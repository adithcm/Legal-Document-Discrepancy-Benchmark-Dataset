In addition, Developer covenants that, except as otherwise approved in writing by the Franchisor, Developer shall not, for a continuous, uninterrupted period commencing upon the expiration, termination or assignment of this Agreement, regardless of the cause for termination, and continuing for two (2) years thereafter, either directly or indirectly, for itself, or through or on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, partnership, corporation or other entity, own, operate, control or have any financial interest in any Competitive Business which is located or has outlets or restaurant units within the Territory. The foregoing shall not apply to operation of an El Pollo Loco® restaurant by Developer pursuant to a Franchise Agreement with Franchisor or the ownership by Developer of less than five percent (5%) of the issued or outstanding stock of any company whose shares are listed for trading on any public exchange or on the over-the-counter market, provided that Developer does not control or become involved in the operations of any such company. For purposes of this Section 20.1, a Competitive Business shall mean a self-service restaurant or fast-food business which sells chicken and/or Mexican food products, which products individually or collectively represent more than twenty percent (20%) of the revenues from such self-service restaurant or fast-food business operated at any one location during any calendar quarter.

In the event that any provision of Section 20.1 above shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, this Agreement shall not be void, but such provision shall be limited to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable. 20.3. Developer understands and acknowledges that Franchisor shall have the right to reduce the scope of any obligation imposed on Developer by Section 20.1, without Developer’s consent, and that such modified provision shall be effective upon Developer’s receipt of written notice thereof. 20.4. Developer acknowledges that violation of the covenants not to compete contained in this Agreement would result in immediate and irreparable injury to Franchisor for which no adequate remedy at law will be available. Accordingly, Developer hereby consents to the entry of a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting any conduct by Developer in violation of the terms of those covenants not to compete set forth in this Agreement. Developer expressly agrees that it may conclusively be presumed that any violation of the terms of said covenants not to compete was accomplished by and through Developer’s unlawful utilization of Franchisor’s Confidential Information, know-how, methods and procedures

Each Party hereto agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other process that might be served in any action or proceeding may be made on such Party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address of the Party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 10.5.

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, exclusive of conflict of laws principles. 19.2 Dispute Resolution; Jurisdiction. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any matters regarding its existence, scope, validity, breach or termination, or any non-contractual obligations arising out of or related to it) that is not able to be resolved through negotiations will be submitted to arbitration in San Francisco, California, administered by the International Chamber of Commerce under its Rules of Arbitration. There will be one arbitrator. The language of the arbitration will be English. The award will be in writing, state the reasons for the award and be final and binding. Judgment on the award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. Except as may be required by law, the parties will preserve the confidentiality of all aspects of the arbitration. The arbitration will be the sole and exclusive forum for final resolution of any such dispute or claim, provided, however, that, because each party will have access to and become acquainted with Confidential Information of the other party, the unauthorized use or disclosure of which may cause irreparable harm and significant injury which may be difficult to ascertain and which may not be compensable by damages alone, the parties agree that the damaged party will have the right to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that it may have for such unauthorized use or disclosure. Each party irrevocably waives all rights to a jury trial in any judicial proceeding permitted hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the validity, construction, and enforceability of this Agreement and the resolution of disputes arising out of and relating to this Agreement, will be governed solely by this Section 19.

However, we cannot and do not ensure that any particular franchisee will benefit directly or pro rata from the placement of advertising. 2. For each of our company-owned and affiliate-owned Restaurants (except Special Sites identified in Paragraph I.C.) offering products and services similar to the Franchised Restaurant we will make contributions to the Fund or to regional Funds equivalent to the contributions required of Franchised Restaurants within the System or, if applicable, region in which the company-owned or affiliate-owned store is located. 3. We will administer and control the Fund and we will have the absolute and unilateral right to determine how, when and where the monies in the Fund will be spent. This includes the right to use Fund monies for (1) the creation, development and production of advertising and promotional materials, (2) any marketing or related research and development, and (3) advertising and marketing expenses, including without limitation, the absolute right to purchase and pay for product and food research and development, advertising materials, production costs, brochures, ad slicks, radio, film and television commercials, videotapes, newspaper, magazine and other print advertising, direct mail pieces, photographer costs, photographs, pictures, designs, services provided by advertising agencies, public relations firms or other marketing, research or consulting firms or agencies, market research and marketing surveys, menu design and graphics, customer incentive programs, sponsorships, marketing meetings and sales incentives, development of Home Pages on the Internet, Internet access provider costs, Internet/World Wide Web programming and advertising, subscriptions to industry newsletters or magazines, marketing or industry studies, books and research materials, administrative costs and salaries for marketing support personnel. All sums paid by you to the Fund will be maintained in a separate account from our other funds and shall not be used to defray any of our general operating expenses, except for such reasonable administrative costs and overhead, if any, as we may incur in activities reasonably related to the administration or direction of the Fund and advertising programs including, without limitation, costs incurred in collecting and accounting for assessments for the Fund. 4. It is our intent that all contributions to the Fund will be expended for advertising and promotional purposes during our fiscal year within which contributions are made. Any monies not expended in the fiscal year in which they were contributed will be applied and used for Fund expenses in the following year. 5. Although we intend the Fund to be of perpetual duration, we have the right to terminate the Fund. We will not terminate the Fund, however, until all monies in the Fund have been expended for advertising and promotional purposes. 6. An unaudited accounting of Fund contributions and expenditures will be prepared annually and will be made available to you upon request. At our option, any such annual accounting may include an audit of the contributions and expenditures of the Fund prepared by an independent certified public accountant selected by us and prepared at the expense of the Fund. 7. Once you make contributions to the Fund, all such monies will be used as required by this Paragraph IX and will not be returned to you.

            Error message: Could not find section in text: Calm shall prepare and maintain complete and accurate books and records covering all transactions relating to this Agreement. XSPA's representatives may, from time to time during regular business hours on reasonable advance notice, during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of six (6) months thereafter, inspect and audit such books and records and examine and copy all other documents and material in the possession or under the control of Calm with respect to the subject matter and the terms of this Agreement. After completion of any inspection or audit pursuant to this Section 8.02, XSPA shall notify Calm of the results of such inspection and audit (the "Calm Audit Results"). Upon receipt of such information, Calm shall have thirty (30) days (the "Calm Review Period") to review the Calm Audit Results. On or prior to the last day of the Calm Review Period, Calm may object to the Calm Audit Results by delivering to XSPA a written statement setting forth its objections in reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for its disagreement therewith (the "Calm Statement of Objections"). If Calm fails to deliver the Calm Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Calm Review Period, the Calm Audit Results shall be deemed to have been accepted by Calm. If Calm delivers the Calm Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Calm Review Period, Calm and XSPA shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Calm Statement of Objections (the "Calm Resolution Period"), and, if the same are so resolved within the Calm Resolution Period, the Calm Audit Results with such changes as may have been previously agreed in writing by Calm and XSPA, shall be final and binding. If Calm and XSPA fail to reach an agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Calm Statement of Objections before expiration of the Calm Resolution Period, then any amounts remaining in dispute ("Calm Disputed Amounts" and any amounts not so disputed, the "Calm Undisputed Amounts") shall be submitted for resolution to the office of an impartial nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants mutually agreeable to Calm and XSPA (each acting reasonably and in good faith) (the "Independent Accountant") who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall resolve the Calm Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Calm Audit Results. The parties hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. The Independent Accountant shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the parties and their decision for each Calm Disputed Amount must be within the range of values assigned to each such item in the Calm Audit Results and the Calm Statement of Objections, respectively.

Valeant shall use only Product Materials approved by Dova in the performance of Valeant Activities under this Agreement; provided, however, that Valeant shall not be required to use any Product Materials that have not been approved by Valeant or which have not incorporated comments provided by Valeant and nothing herein shall require Valeant to use all Product Materials created or prepared by Dova and Valeant reserves the right not to use certain Product Materials. The content of Product Materials shall not be modified or changed by Valeant or Field Force Personnel at any time without the prior written approval of Dova in each instance. Dova shall be responsible for the costs and expenses of creation and development of the Product Materials and Valeant shall be responsible for the costs and expense of reproduction, printing and delivery of the Product Materials to and for Valeant. The Parties will coordinate the production and delivery of Product Materials to allow sufficient internal and field force review time to accommodate scheduled training meetings and distribution to Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing. In the event that Dova incurs costs and expenses for which Valeant is responsible under this Section 4.4.1, Dova may deduct such amounts from the payments due under Section 6.3 and shall include a description thereof in the applicable report under Section 6.3. Promptly after the Effective Date, the Parties will collaborate to finalize the Product Materials in accordance with this Section 4.4.1(a), as soon as reasonably practical.

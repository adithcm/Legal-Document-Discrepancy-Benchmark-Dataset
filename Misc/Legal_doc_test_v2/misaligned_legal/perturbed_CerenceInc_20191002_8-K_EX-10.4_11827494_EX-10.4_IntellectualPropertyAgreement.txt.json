This is replaced with 'time-limited' and 'revocable', fundamentally altering the nature of the license and potentially disrupting the SpinCo's ability to rely on these patent rights. Furthermore, the original license is 'non-exclusive' whereas the modified license is 'exclusive'. A change from non-exclusive to exclusive requires additional consideration under contract law; changing these terms in this way creates contradictions.",

By opening up jurisdiction to any court, and making it non-exclusive, the contract encourages forum shopping and increases the likelihood of venue challenges under § 1404, undermining the predictability intended by the original forum selection clause.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'confidential information' with 'any information they can remember' the scope of protected information becomes ambiguously limited to what the member recalls, significantly weakening confidentiality obligations.

                "law_explanation": "The UTSA protects trade secrets from misappropriation. Limiting confidentiality to 'information they can remember' weakens the definition of trade secret and makes it more difficult to prove misappropriation, conflicting with the intent and protections of the UTSA. What is considered a trade secret is not dependent on one's ability to remember, but the proprietary nature of the information.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'in writing' to 'by a handshake' makes the agreement unenforceable due to the statute of frauds, which typically requires non-compete agreements to be in writing. Furthermore, increasing the radius from 3 to 5 miles makes the non-compete agreement unreasonably broad, depending on the state and jurisdiction. Oral agreements are not valid, and increasing radius makes agreement unenforceable.",

                "law_explanation": "California law, and similar laws in other states, generally prohibit non-compete agreements except in very limited circumstances. Requiring a handshake to approve competition makes the agreement unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds, as agreements restraining trade typically need to be in writing. Also, increasing the radius to 5 miles could be deemed unreasonable in certain states, making it an invalid restraint on trade.",

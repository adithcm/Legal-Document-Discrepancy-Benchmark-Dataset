                "changed_text": "For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a fee accrued daily and payable monthly at an annual rate to be determined at the Sponsor's discretion, but not exceeding 0.50% of the Trust's average daily gross assets.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'net assets' to 'gross assets' allows the sponsor to potentially extract more fees, while stating 'to be determined at the Sponsor's discretion' could allow for hidden fee increases and misreporting, potentially violating regulations around fund accounting.",

                "law_explanation": "Section 36(b) imposes a fiduciary duty on investment advisors regarding compensation. Changing the basis of the fee calculation from 'net' to 'gross' assets and making it discretionary could result in excessive fees, breaching that duty if it is not in the best interest of the fund and its shareholders. The change in asset calculation also affects the definition of 'net assets' required under the act.",

                "changed_text": "The Sponsor shall only be liable for proven acts of criminal intent directly causing financial harm to the Trust, as determined by a court of law. All other claims are waived.",
                "explanation": "This dramatically raises the bar for liability, contradicting the standard of care expected of a fund sponsor. By limiting liability to only 'criminal intent', it avoids responsibility for negligence or breaches of fiduciary duty.",

                "law_explanation": "Section 17(h) prohibits limiting liability for breaches of fiduciary duty. The modified clause effectively attempts to exempt the sponsor from liability for negligence or other non-criminal breaches, directly violating this provision by setting a higher criminal standard.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated only by the Sponsor, with 30 days' written notice, or by mutual agreement of both parties. The Trust may only terminate the agreement if the Sponsor files for bankruptcy.",
                "explanation": "By restricting the Trust's ability to terminate the agreement except under limited circumstances, it creates an imbalance of power that could violate fiduciary duties. This could prevent the trust from acting in the best interests of its shareholders.",

                "law_explanation": "Section 15(a)(3) requires that investment advisory contracts provide for automatic termination in the event of assignment. While this isn't directly an assignment issue, the substantial restriction on the Trust's ability to terminate effectively limits the Trust's freedom to choose its advisor, undermining the protections intended by Section 15 and general fiduciary duties. It essentially takes away the Trust's board's power of renewal or termination.",

                "explanation": "By granting Integrity the blanket authority to act for or represent the Fund in 'all matters,' this clause contradicts the established definition of an 'independent contractor,' which typically limits the contractor's authority and control over the principal.",

                "law_explanation": "The IRS uses a common-law test to determine worker classification. This test evaluates the degree of control and independence.

Except as may otherwise be determined by Integrity and the Fund from time to time, such commissions or concessions shall be uniform to all dealers.",

Such commissions or concessions shall be determined by Integrity alone, and need not be uniform to all dealers.",

Permitting non-uniform commissions directly violates this provision, creating potential liability for FINRA violations.",

However, this clause does not extend to unrecognized entities like Sealand, making the contract unenforceable as it attempts to rely on a legal system that US courts will not recognize.",

ARBITRATION In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Venue shall be Kansas. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction.",

SIGNIFICANCE OF HEADINGS Section headings contained herein are solely for the purpose of aiding in speedy location of subject matter and are not in any sense to be given weight in the construction of this Agreement. Accordingly, in case of any question with respect to the construction of this Agreement, it is to be construed as though such section headings had been omitted. 33. ARBITRATION In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators.

                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause into the section discussing headings and their insignificance undermines the clarity and enforceability of the arbitration agreement. By placing it there, one could argue that the arbitration clause itself should not be given significant weight in the construction of the agreement.",

PROMOTIONAL APPEARANCES A.During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall use best efforts to be available for such press interviews, radio or TV appearances arranged for CONSULTANT by ADAMS GOLF which are compatible with CONSULTANT'S own practice, play and personal time requirements. CONSULTANT will be required to be available after a tournament for selected interviews, either the Sunday afternoon or Monday morning following the tournament. In all such interviews and appearances, CONSULTANT will use his best efforts to make reference to the ADAMS GOLF PRODUCT and wear [*****] and display ADAMS GOLF'S brand name. B.During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall make himself available on not more than [*****] days for television and radio commercials, photo shoots, modeling and promotional appearances compatible with CONSULTANT'S own practice, play and personal time requirements. Said activities shall be directly related to the promotion of ADAMS GOLF PRODUCT. ADAMS GOLF shall reimburse CONSULTANT for reasonable travel expenses for CONSULTANT when making special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph but ADAMS GOLF shall not pay CONSULTANT session fees, residual payments or the like for television appearances. Travel expenses shall include jet fuel or first-class round-trip airfare and lodging, meals and local transportation. 25. APPLICABLE LAW This Agreement shall be governed and construed according to the laws of the State of Kansas.",
                "explanation": "Moving the applicable law clause to the middle of the section regarding promotional appearances buries it within operational details, making it less prominent and potentially overlooked. Parties might not readily find the governing law provision, weakening its enforceability.",

                "explanation": "Moving the indemnity clause under the 'Assignment and Change of Control' section could lead to confusion. An indemnity clause is typically associated with risk allocation and liability, while assignment clauses deal with the transfer of contractual rights and obligations.

Placing the indemnity clause under assignment makes it appear as a secondary consideration related to assignment rather than a fundamental risk allocation mechanism, potentially contradicting its intended scope and enforceability.",

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence: \"The Distributor at all times shall comply with all requirements of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act and similar federal and state laws and regulations,\" the contract now fails to explicitly require the distributor to adhere to consumer protection laws regarding warranties. This omission creates a legal contradiction, as distributors are generally expected to comply with such regulations regardless of whether the contract explicitly states so.",

This Agreement and the rights of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania including all matters of construction, validity, performance, and enforcement and without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws. Venue for any action brought under this Agreement shall be in the appropriate court in Mercer County, Pennsylvania.",
                "changed_text": "5. REQUIREMENT. The Parties agree that Marv and/or Mitchell S. Felder shall have no obligation and/or involvement in any capital raising activities for THI or Premier at any time and for any reason. Further, the 150,000,000 (one hundred and fifty million) stock warrants previously ceded to Mitchell S. Felder by Halberd/THI shall not be eliminated, cancelled, or altered in any way, and for any reason, unless specifically directed at the request of Mitchell S. Felder. \n8. VENUE. This Agreement and the rights of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by the laws of a jurisdiction to be determined by Premier Biomedical, Inc., without regard to conflict of laws principles. Venue for any action brought under this Agreement shall be in a court selected at the sole discretion of THI.",
                "explanation": "Moving the venue clause from its dedicated section to be interspersed with other clauses and changing the jurisdiction and venue determination contradicts standard legal practices. It obscures the governing law and venue, making dispute resolution less predictable and potentially more costly for one party. The introduction of subjective determination of venue and jurisdiction impacts the enforceability and clarity.",

By allowing one party to unilaterally determine the venue, the modified text creates an imbalance that is generally disfavored and can render the clause unenforceable, as it could force the other party to litigate in an inconvenient or unfair location.",

Each Party agrees to hold in confidence confidential information acquired in the course of this relationship with the other Parties and their associates. Each Party agrees to refrain from, either during period of this Agreement or at any other time thereafter, disclosing, using or disseminating such confidential information, for its or another's benefit, in any way acquired in the course of any association arising out of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, confidential information shall include contacts and introductions to third parties and information relating thereto. Confidential information, knowledge or data of a Party and/or its affiliates shall not include any information which is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by such Party or its representatives. Confidential information should further include: all information (in whatever form and whether or not marked or otherwise identified as confidential), including financial statements, business plans or records, concepts, marketing studies, projections, sales or pricing information, customer or supplier information, agreements with third parties, Intellectual Property (as defined below) or other data provided by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party to the Recipient and (ii) all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other material prepared by the Recipient or its Representatives which contain or reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, information furnished by the Disclosing Party pursuant to this Agreement.\n2. LICENSING.  Licensing shall be optional, and no specific terms from the 2010 Agreement/2020 Agreement will apply unless explicitly agreed upon in writing by all parties involved.",
                "explanation": "The modification of the licensing terms undermines the initial licensing agreements by stating they are now optional, contradicting the basis of the agreement.

                "law_explanation": "This modification contradicts basic contract law principles concerning consideration and mutual agreement. Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 71 defines consideration as a bargained-for exchange. By rendering the licensing terms 'optional' and nullifying the previous agreements, the contract fails to provide clear consideration, making the licensing agreement unenforceable because it lacks a defined commitment from all parties. The original contract intended that certain licensing terms would be followed, this edit removes that promise, thus removing the aspect of consideration."

In addition to the 5% amount calculated pursuant to the preceding paragraph, there shall be an identical 5% amount to be paid from THI, per Premier's consideration, to certain shareholders of Premier, as identified by Premier, as of a record date to be determined in the future, on an annual basis, commencing on the one-year anniversary of this Agreement until a total amount of $40,000,000 has been paid to Premier.

                "explanation": "By placing the royalty terms at the end and completely altering the requirements, the enforceability is weakened. All key metrics are decided by one party, which is a conflict of interest and does not represent the intention of all parties.

By allowing THI to unilaterally determine the royalty amounts, it undermines the mutual benefit and fairness that the contract law aims to protect. It is now up to their discretion, which will likely not benefit the other parties."

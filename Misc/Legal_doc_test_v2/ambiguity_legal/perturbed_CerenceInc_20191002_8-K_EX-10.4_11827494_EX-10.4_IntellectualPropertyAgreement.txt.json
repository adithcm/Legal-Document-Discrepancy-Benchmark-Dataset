                "changed_text": "In order to carry out the intent of the Parties with respect to the recordation of the transfers of any registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP, as applicable, to the extent the ownership thereof has transferred from a member of the Nuance Group to a member of the SpinCo Group, or vice versa, pursuant to the Separation Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, the Parties may execute intellectual property assignments in a form similar to that attached as Exhibit A1 (the \"Patent Assignment Agreement\"), Exhibit A2 (the \"Trademark Assignment Agreement\"), Exhibit A3 (the \"Domain Name Assignment Agreement\") and Exhibit A4 (the \"Invention Disclosure Assignment Agreement\") as well as additional case specific assignments as they consider suitable under applicable Laws (collectively, the \"Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements\") for possible recordation with the appropriate Governmental Authority.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes 'shall execute' to 'may execute,' making the execution of intellectual property assignments optional rather than mandatory. Replacing 'substantially similar' with 'similar' introduces vagueness. Removing the word 'deemed' from 'deemed appropriate or necessary' and replacing it with 'they consider suitable' gives the parties more discretion. Finally, replacing 'for recordation' with 'for possible recordation' makes the recordation process discretionary. All these modifications weaken the legal obligation to properly record intellectual property transfers.",

                "law_explanation": "Delaware law (8 Del. C. § 327) mandates that stockholders maintain accurate records of stock ownership, which implicitly requires the corporation to accurately record and maintain records of intellectual property, especially as it pertains to assets critical to the corporation's value and operations. By making the execution and recordation of IP assignments optional, the modified text undermines the ability to maintain accurate records, potentially violating Delaware law regarding corporate record-keeping and transparency in corporate governance. Making the recordation process discretionary introduces ambiguity about the company's commitment to keeping proper records of asset transfers, which contradicts the spirit and intent of Delaware law."

                "changed_text": "Prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, each Party should consider cooperating with the other Party, without any further consideration and ideally at no expense to the other Party, to perhaps obtain, or attempt to cause to be obtained, the release of some outstanding Security Interest attached to any Nuance IP or SpinCo IP that might be subject to assignment from one Party or its Group to the other Party or its Group hereunder, as applicable, and to consider taking actions as the other Party suggests in order to try to obtain such release.",
                "explanation": "The modifications weaken the obligation to cooperate in releasing security interests. Changing 'shall cooperate' to 'should consider cooperating' makes the cooperation voluntary. Replacing 'at no expense' with 'ideally at no expense' suggests expenses could be incurred. Replacing 'obtain' with 'perhaps obtain, or attempt to cause to be obtained' and 'all actions as the other Party may reasonably be requested to take' with 'consider taking actions as the other Party suggests in order to try to obtain such release' further weakens the obligation and introduces ambiguity about the extent of the effort required to release security interests.",

                "law_explanation": "UCC § 9-513 places a duty on secured parties to release security interests upon satisfaction of the underlying debt or obligation. The ambiguous language in the modified text, which makes cooperation and the effort to obtain releases of security interests discretionary ('should consider,' 'perhaps obtain,' 'attempt to cause,' 'try to obtain'), contradicts the mandatory nature of UCC § 9-513. This could lead to a failure to properly release security interests, creating potential legal issues and hindering the clear transfer of intellectual property rights, and the ownership thereof after the distribution.",

                "explanation": "The modifications introduce ambiguity and weaken the prohibitions. Adding 'try not to' softens the commitment. Using qualifiers like 'unnecessarily,' 'in any significant way,' and 'overtly assist' makes the prohibitions subjective. Adding 'demonstrably impairs or significantly adversely affects' raises the threshold for what constitutes a violation. The phrase 'unless there's a good reason' introduces a vague exception. Replacing 'apply for any registration' with 'proactively apply for any similar registration' narrows the scope of the prohibition.",

                "law_explanation": "Lanham Act § 43(a) prohibits unfair competition, including actions that create a likelihood of confusion, deceive, or misrepresent the association of goods or services with another party. The original text prevented SpinCo from challenging or undermining Nuance's IP rights. The modified text, by adding qualifiers like 'unnecessarily,' 'significant way,' 'overtly,' and 'demonstrably impairs,' introduces subjective criteria, making it more difficult to prove a violation of the agreement if SpinCo's actions cause confusion or dilute the value of Nuance's brand. The 'unless there's a good reason' clause further weakens the protection against actions that might be considered unfair competition under the Lanham Act."

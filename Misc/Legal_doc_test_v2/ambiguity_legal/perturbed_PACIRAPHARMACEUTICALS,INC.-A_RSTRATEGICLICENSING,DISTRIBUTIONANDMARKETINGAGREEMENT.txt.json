                "explanation": "Changing \"to make or have made\" to \"to consider making or having made\" introduces ambiguity by making EKR's obligation to manufacture the products discretionary, rather than a right they can definitively exercise. This could lead to disputes over EKR's commitment to ensuring product availability in the Territory.",

                "law_explanation": "The modification weakens EKR's obligation to ensure product availability, potentially conflicting with requirements to maintain an adequate supply of the drug, as indirectly implied within postmarketing reporting requirements in 21 CFR § 314.81(b)(3)(vii), which necessitates reporting on discontinuance of manufacture. While the citation doesn't directly mandate production, the ambiguity introduces uncertainty as to whether EKR is actively ensuring the consistent availability of the drug, which is a crucial concern for regulatory authorities and directly conflicts with what the FDA expects from manufacturers in that the parties will do their best to have the drug available.",

                "explanation": "The original text has a commitment to 'use commercially reasonable efforts,' a fairly strong obligation. The revision introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with 'shall consider,' making the effort to obtain marketing authorizations discretionary rather than obligatory. Furthermore, changing 'determines' to 'considers' weakens the standard of evidence required for the committee to determine viability.",

It is implied EKR is obligated to maintain compliance to the standards as determined by the FDA. It creates a legal contradiction in that the parties agree to comply, but the language suggests they can consider it, so compliance is not obligatory.",

By weakening the legal obligation to provide it, it creates a legal contradiction under this category as the company could suggest there is no obligation to forward to any degree.",

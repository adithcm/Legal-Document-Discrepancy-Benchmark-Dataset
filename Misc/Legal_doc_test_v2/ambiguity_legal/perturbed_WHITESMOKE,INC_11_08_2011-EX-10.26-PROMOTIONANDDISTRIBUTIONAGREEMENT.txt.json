                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply' and 'shall ensure' to 'shall encourage' introduces ambiguity and weakens the binding nature of the obligation.

By only 'endeavoring to comply' and 'encouraging' third parties, the distributor fails to ensure these practices are avoided. This contradicts the spirit and potentially the letter of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall provide' with 'should attempt to provide,' 'a clear statement' with 'a statement,' 'the opportunity' with 'an opportunity,' and 'a button' with 'a mechanism' introduces ambiguity and weakens the requirements for obtaining informed consent before installing the software.

By weakening the requirement to present a clear statement, opportunity to review, and a mechanism for agreement of the EULA, it makes it less likely that users are actually presented with and agree to the terms, including privacy policies, thus potentially violating CalOPPA's implied requirement for affirmative consent for data collection.",

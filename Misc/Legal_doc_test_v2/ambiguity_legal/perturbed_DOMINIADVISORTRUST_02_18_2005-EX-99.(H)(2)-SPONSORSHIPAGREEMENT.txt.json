                "original_text": "Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform such oversight, administrative and management services as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the Trust, which shall include without limitation: (a) maintaining office facilities (which may be in the office of Domini or an affiliate) and furnishing clerical services necessary for maintaining the organization of the Trust and for performing the oversight, administrative and management functions herein set forth; (b) arranging, if desired by the Trust, for directors, officers or employees of the Sponsor to serve as Trustees, officers or agents of the Trust if duly elected or appointed to such positions and subject to their individual consent and to any limitations imposed by law; (c) supervising the overall administration of the Trust, including the updating of corporate organizational documents, and the negotiation of contracts and fees with and the monitoring and coordinating of performance and billings of the Trust's transfer agent, shareholder servicing agents (if any), custodian, administrator, subadministrator (if any) and other independent contractors or agents; (d) overseeing (with advice of the Trust's counsel) the preparation of and, if applicable, filing all documents required for compliance by the Trust with applicable laws and regulations (including state \"blue sky\" laws and regulations), including registration statements on Form N-1A, prospectuses and statements of additional information, or similar forms, as applicable, semi-annual and annual reports to shareholders and proxy statements, and reviewing tax returns",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the general guidance of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor will endeavor to perform oversight, administrative, and management services as periodically discussed with the Trust, potentially including: (a) maintaining office facilities and furnishing clerical services to support the Trust's general organization; (b) considering arrangements for directors, officers, or employees of the Sponsor to serve as Trustees, officers, or agents of the Trust, subject to their availability and legal constraints; (c) assisting in the administration of the Trust, including occasional updates to corporate organizational documents, and participating in contract negotiations and performance monitoring; (d) offering input on the preparation of documents required for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including registration statements and reports to shareholders, and generally reviewing tax returns",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall perform' to 'will endeavor to perform,' the obligation of the Sponsor becomes less definite and more discretionary. Replacing 'reasonably requested' with 'periodically discussed' further weakens the obligation. The term 'potentially including' before listing the services introduces ambiguity. Changing 'overseeing' to 'offering input' makes the Sponsor's role advisory rather than mandatory.",

The modified text introduces vagueness and discretion ('will endeavor', 'potentially including', 'offering input'), potentially failing to define the Sponsor's responsibilities with sufficient clarity as required by the Act, making it difficult to enforce the contract and ensure the Sponsor fulfills its required duties, ultimately harming shareholder interests.",

The definition of 'proven and direct harm' is unclear. Also, capping the liability could violate fiduciary duty.",

Limiting the Sponsor's liability to the fees paid under the agreement is an attempt to limit liability related to gross negligence or reckless disregard, which the Act prevents.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Massachusetts law governs the contract. The modified text replaces 'shall be construed and enforced and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' with 'will be generally guided by the principles of law, potentially including those of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as they seem most relevant'. This introduces significant ambiguity. The phrase 'generally guided' is vague and doesn't establish a clear governing law. Furthermore, 'potentially including those of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' weakens the connection to Massachusetts law. The phrase 'as they seem most relevant' grants subjective discretion in determining which laws apply, further increasing uncertainty and making the contract's interpretation unpredictable.",

The new wording opens the door for disputes over which laws apply, potentially hindering regulatory oversight and investor protection by creating uncertainty about legal obligations and remedies.",

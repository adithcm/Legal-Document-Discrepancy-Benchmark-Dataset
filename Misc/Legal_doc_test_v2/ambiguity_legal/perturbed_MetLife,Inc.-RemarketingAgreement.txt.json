                "changed_text": "(b) The Remarketing Agents will endeavor (i) to exert efforts to remarket the Remarketed Securities tendered or deemed tendered to the Remarketing Agents in the Remarketing, (ii) to consider establishing the Reset Rates with possible reference to the Remarketing Procedures and to attempt to notify the Company, the Trustee and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent of the Reset Rates and (iii) to contemplate carrying out other duties as assigned to the Remarketing Agents in the Remarketing Procedures, potentially consistent with the provisions of the Remarketing Procedures.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a clear obligation for the Remarketing Agents to use \"commercially reasonable efforts\" and \"to notify promptly\". The modified text uses ambiguous terms such as \"endeavor,\" \"exert efforts,\" \"consider establishing,\" \"attempt to notify,\" and \"potentially consistent with\" which significantly weaken the obligation and make it difficult to enforce, thus creating ambiguity.",

                "law_explanation": "The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in New York requires parties to a contract to act honestly and reasonably in their dealings. The modified text replaces clear obligations with vague and discretionary actions, indicating a lack of commitment to fulfilling the contract's purpose, potentially violating this implied covenant under New York law. The changes allow for a weaker, less committed effort than what would be expected under a good faith interpretation of the contract. These vague obligations could be interpreted as not acting honestly or reasonably in the remarketing process.",

                "changed_text": "(f) By approximately 4:30 P.M., New York City time, on or around the Remarketing Settlement Date, assuming there has been a seemingly Successful Remarketing, the Remarketing Agents may attempt to advise, possibly by telephone, the Company, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and the Trustee that the Remarketing was arguably a Successful Remarketing and of certain Reset Rates suggested in the Remarketing and an estimated aggregate principal amount of Remarketed Securities offered in the Remarketing.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a clear deadline and mandatory action to advise specific parties. The modified text introduces uncertainty with \"approximately,\" \"on or around,\" \"assuming,\" \"seemingly Successful Remarketing,\" \"may attempt,\" \"possibly by telephone,\" \"arguably,\" \"certain Reset Rates,\" and \"estimated aggregate principal amount,\" making the obligation unclear and unenforceable.",

The modified language makes it questionable whether proper and timely notification of the outcome of the remarketing actually occurs. The vagueness as to timing and certainty of the success obfuscates what constitutes proper notification, creating ambiguity that excuses the agents from accountability, effectively contradicting the implied duty to provide clear and timely notice under New York's UCC.",

                "changed_text": "(g) During a potentially undefined period sometime around the Applicable Time until perhaps the Remarketing Settlement Date for the Remarketed Securities, to generally avoid actions to offer, sell, contract to offer or sell or somehow dispose of debt securities of the Company with possibly similar pricing characteristics to the Securities maybe exceeding an undefined aggregate principal amount of roughly $3 billion, except, perhaps, debt securities loosely associated with the Global Medium Term Note Program of Metropolitan Life Global Funding I, Global Medium Term Note Program of MetLife Institutional Funding II, or some commercial paper program of, or sponsored by, the Company or unspecified subsidiaries, potentially without the somehow required consent of the Remarketing Agents, whose consent might not necessarily be unreasonably withheld;",
                "explanation": "This perturbation injects numerous ambiguities, undermining the restriction on MetLife's ability to issue similar debt. Words like \"potentially undefined,\" \"sometime around,\" \"perhaps,\" \"generally avoid,\" \"possibly similar,\" \"maybe exceeding,\" \"undefined,\" \"roughly,\" \"loosely associated,\" \"some,\" \"unspecified,\" \"potentially without,\" and \"might not necessarily\" all weaken the obligation.

The original clause provides a clear limit on the issuance of similar debt, which could affect the value of the remarketed securities. The modified text, by being excessively vague, makes it impossible for investors to assess the risk of additional debt issuance and, as such, is misleading. If investors rely on this ambiguous language and suffer losses due to unexpected debt issuance by MetLife, they could argue that the ambiguous wording of this clause misrepresented the actual restrictions in place, violating the Securities Act. The primary URL points to the larger body of law. 77k can be found inside the house.gov URL.",

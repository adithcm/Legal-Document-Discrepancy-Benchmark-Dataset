                "changed_text": "This Remarketing Agreement may be amended or modified by a simple majority vote of the Company's Board of Directors. The Board's decision is final and requires no further written consent from other parties, regardless of modifications to the Securities requiring registration under the Act.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement requires written consent from all parties for amendments. The modified text allows amendments by a simple majority vote of the Company's Board of Directors, disregarding the original consent requirement and potentially circumventing securities registration requirements, creating a conflict.",

This section of the NY BCL stipulates that amendments to agreements affecting shareholder rights or obligations generally require proper authorization and cannot be unilaterally imposed, especially when those amendments impact the securities' registration status.",

Although the contract does not explicitly state that the Distributor is a 'sales representative,' extending the payment period increases the risk of non-compliance.",

                "law_explanation": "The Illinois Antitrust Act prohibits contracts that unreasonably restrain trade.

Reducing the insurance cancellation notice period to 10 days might be viewed as a breach of this covenant if it prejudices the Distributor's ability to protect its interests, particularly given the Distributor is named as an additional insured under the policy.",

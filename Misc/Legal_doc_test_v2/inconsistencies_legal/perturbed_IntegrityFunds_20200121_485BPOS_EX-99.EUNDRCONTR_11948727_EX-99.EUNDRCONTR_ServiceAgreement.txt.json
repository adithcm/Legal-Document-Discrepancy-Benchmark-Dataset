While this applies directly to advisory contracts, similar standards of reasonableness apply to fund distribution agreements, and reducing the Fund's termination notice to 15 days and Integrity's to 30 days may be deemed an unreasonably short period, potentially hindering the fund's ability to find a replacement distributor.",

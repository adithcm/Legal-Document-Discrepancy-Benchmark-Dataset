If this timeframe is deemed unreasonable given the complexity of the divestment and acquisition, it could be argued that the modified clause violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing required by UCC ยง 1-304, particularly concerning contract performance. The implied covenant requires that neither party do anything that will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.",

While Delaware law doesn't specify a mandatory cure period, reducing the initial resolution period to five days and the executive intervention period to five days may be deemed unreasonably short, especially for complex intellectual property matters. This could be seen as a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, potentially rendering the clause unenforceable. The Delaware Supreme court case cited showcases Delaware court rulings on contractual interpretation and the obligation to deal in good faith.",

By invalidating delivery services and email as acceptable means of notification and extending the mailing period to 20 business days, this modification significantly hinders timely communication. This could be challenged as failing to provide adequate notice, violating principles of good faith and fair dealing, and potentially making the contract unenforceable if critical information is delayed, causing damages.

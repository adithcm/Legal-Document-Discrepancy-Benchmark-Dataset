                "explanation": "This change removes the Subcontractor's guarantee to keep properties free of claims or liens. The phrase 'endeavor to' weakens the original obligation. It creates a legal risk by failing to ensure payment to lower-tier subcontractors and suppliers, potentially leading to liens against the property owner, EDGE, in Texas.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas Property Code Chapter 53 provides mechanics, contractors, and material providers lien rights on private construction projects. By removing the guarantee to keep properties free of liens, the revised text contradicts the intent of the statute which is to protect subcontractors and suppliers. The addition of the phrase 'endeavor to' weakens the obligation on the general contractor to ensure that these subcontractors and suppliers get paid, thereby increasing the risk of liens being filed.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas Labor Code Section 406.002 requires employers to provide worker's compensation insurance or opt out by filing a notice with the state. This modified text contradicts the law by implying worker's compensation is optional and creates ambiguity regarding the employer's responsibilities, potentially exposing EDGE to liability if the Subcontractor does not have proper coverage.",

Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the breach thereof shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Texas and the venue shall be in Collin County, Texas for resolution.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit prohibition of arbitration, changing 'shall not be obligated' to 'may resolve', which implies arbitration is a potential option, and the mandatory clause 'It is mandatory' is replaced with 'shall be'. This may violate the Texas Arbitration Act if it forces a consumer into arbitration without clear, conspicuous consent, as the original text makes it clear that mandatory arbitration is not the chosen method of resolution.",

Under the Texas Arbitration Act, particularly in consumer contracts, there are specific requirements for arbitration clauses to be enforceable. Making arbitration a possibility, even without clear consumer consent, could render the agreement unenforceable and subject to legal challenges.",

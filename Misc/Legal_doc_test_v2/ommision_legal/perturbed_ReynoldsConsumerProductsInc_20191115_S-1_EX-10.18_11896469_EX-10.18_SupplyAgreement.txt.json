Occurrence based coverage providing benefits in the minimal amount required by Applicable Law for workplace and work related injuries and illnesses to the employees of a Party, including, without limitation, Workers Compensation Acts of applicable U.S. States, the U.S. Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers Compensation Act and the U.S. Jones Act. Requires alternate employer endorsement and waiver of subrogation endorsement.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'in the minimal amount required by Applicable Law' could lead to the insurance coverage being less than what is legally mandated, potentially violating state workers' compensation laws. Removing 'waiver of subrogation endorsement' removes a clause that protects the indemnitee. The agreement is governed by the laws of Illinois.",

                "law_explanation": "Illinois law mandates specific minimum benefits for workers' compensation. By removing the reference to 'the minimal amount required by Applicable Law', the contract creates ambiguity and a potential loophole where the coverage provided could fall below the legally required minimum, violating 820 ILCS 305. Removing the waiver of subrogation endorsement is a violation, because if a company fails to secure it, they are in violation of the Workers' Compensation Act.",

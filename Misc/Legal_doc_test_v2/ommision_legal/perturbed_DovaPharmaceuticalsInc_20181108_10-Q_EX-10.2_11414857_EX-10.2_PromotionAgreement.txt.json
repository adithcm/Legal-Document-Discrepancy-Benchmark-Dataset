                "explanation": "The original text mandates full compliance with all applicable laws. Modifying it to require only 'reasonable efforts' introduces a legal loophole that weakens consumer protections, potentially allowing non-compliance.

By only requiring \"reasonable efforts\" to comply with applicable laws, the modification could allow the introduction of adulterated or misbranded drugs into interstate commerce, thereby violating the FDCA.

The modified text makes both actions optional, creating a loophole that could lead to the neglect of important medical inquiries. This introduces legal risk by potentially violating regulations concerning the provision of accurate and complete medical information, which is vital for consumer safety.",

By making proof of insurance discretionary, this clause weakens the ability of the other party to enforce the insurance provision, which is a standard risk mitigation measure. This contradiction creates a breach of contract scenario if adequate insurance isn't maintained and verified, leading to potential liability for damages incurred as a result of inadequate coverage.",

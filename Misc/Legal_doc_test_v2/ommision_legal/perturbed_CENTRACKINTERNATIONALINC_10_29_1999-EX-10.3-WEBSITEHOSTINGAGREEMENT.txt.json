                "explanation": "The original text contains a clause limiting liability for consequential damages. By removing the first sentence, 'i-on will not be liable under any circumstances for any lost profits or other consequential damages, even if i-on has been advised as to the possibility of such damages,' the contract becomes ambiguous regarding consequential damages, which may be subject to certain limitations or waivers under Florida law, but not a complete bar. This creates a legal risk and increases the uncertainty for the customer in case of a dispute.",

                "law_explanation": "Florida Statutes § 672.719(3) states that limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is commercial is not. By removing the blanket waiver of liability for consequential damages, the contract opens up the possibility for such damages, and places it in compliance with this statute's allowance for such recovery in specific cases, but it is still an omission because it does not specify the exact conditions or allowable recovery.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss', the contract no longer explicitly requires i-on to take reasonable steps to protect against data loss, making the customer's agreement to hold i-on harmless unconditional.

While not explicitly codified as a single statute, the principle is well-established in Florida case law. Omitting the requirement for 'reasonable steps' suggests a potential breach of this implied duty, as it could be argued that i-on is not acting in good faith to protect the customer's data.",

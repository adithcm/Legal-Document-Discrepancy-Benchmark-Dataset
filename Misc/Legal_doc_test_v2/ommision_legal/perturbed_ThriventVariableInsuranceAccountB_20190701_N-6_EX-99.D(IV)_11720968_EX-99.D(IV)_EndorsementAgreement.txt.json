                "original_text": "If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. If you do not make the extra payment, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest.",
                "explanation": "By removing the option for the member to pay via 'equivalent reduction in benefits or payment in cash' and removing the set interest rate, the contract removes options for the member while obscuring the true impact on the insured party. This creates potential conflicts with state insurance regulations regarding fair practices and full disclosure.",

                "law_explanation": "This modification contradicts Wis. Stat. § 628.34(1), which requires insurance policies to be fair and equitable to the policyholder. By removing the option for the insured to manage deficiency payments and not specifying the interest rate, the modified contract is potentially unfair and misleading.",

                "explanation": "By changing the statement to 'may be credited,' the contract creates ambiguity and removes the reasonable expectation that the consumer understands whether or not they will receive dividends.

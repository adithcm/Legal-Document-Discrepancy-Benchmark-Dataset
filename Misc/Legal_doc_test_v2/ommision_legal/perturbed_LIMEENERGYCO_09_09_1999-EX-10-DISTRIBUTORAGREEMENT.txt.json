                "original_text": "Company warrants that the Products will be designed, manufactured, constructed, assembled and packaged in a workmanlike manner and that such Products shall be fully functional and fit for their intended purposes. Company further warrants that the Products sold hereunder shall be free from defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period of twenty-four (24) months after delivery to Distributor's end-user. The Company shall not be liable for defective Products, except as provided in this Agreement. The Distributor at all times shall comply with all requirements of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act and similar federal and state laws and regulations.",

Company further warrants that the Products sold hereunder shall be free from defects in design, materials and workmanship. The Company shall not be liable for defective Products, except as provided in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the 24-month warranty period and the omission of the statement requiring compliance with the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act weakens consumer protection. This creates a legal risk, because the products do have to comply, and customers can have implied rights beyond the written warranty, and the contract should not try to imply otherwise.",

                "law_explanation": "By omitting the requirement to comply with the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and removing the explicit warranty period, the modified text contradicts the Act's provisions for clear and conspicuous disclosure of warranty terms for consumer products exceeding a certain price threshold. Consumers are not clearly informed of their warranty rights and the obligations of the warrantor.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment terms to be determined by the company at its sole discretion omits the previously agreed-upon thirty (30) day payment window. This could potentially violate Illinois' Sales Representative Act (820 ILCS 120/2) if the distributor is considered a sales representative, as it affects the timing of commission payments.",

                ],
                "law_explanation": "The modification gives the Company unilateral control over the payment schedule, potentially delaying payments to the Distributor and thus violating 820 ILCS 120/2, which requires timely payment of commissions to sales representatives upon termination of the agreement or at specified intervals during the agreement if such intervals are agreed upon in the contract.",

                "explanation": "Removing the assertion that products do not cause environmental harm or infringe on third-party rights and the UL certification requirement creates a potential legal issue related to product safety and compliance.

The Act regulates air emissions and other environmental impacts; the original clause provides a baseline assurance which, when removed, shifts the burden of environmental compliance assurance entirely onto the Distributor, potentially leading to violations if the Products are, in fact, environmentally harmful.",

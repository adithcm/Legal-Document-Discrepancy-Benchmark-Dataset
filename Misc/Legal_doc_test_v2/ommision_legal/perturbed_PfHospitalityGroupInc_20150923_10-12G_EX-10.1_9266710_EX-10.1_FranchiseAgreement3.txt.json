In many states, including Florida where Pizza Fusion was based, statutes grant prevailing parties the right to recover attorney's fees in certain contract disputes. Removing this provision could be seen as an attempt to circumvent that right.",

Many states, like Florida, have laws that require non-compete agreements to be reasonable in time, area, and line of business.

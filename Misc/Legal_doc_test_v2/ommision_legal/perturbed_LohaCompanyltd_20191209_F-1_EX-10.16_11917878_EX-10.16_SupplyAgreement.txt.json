CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers. The Certificate so issued shall be accepted as the base of a claim. The Sellers, in accordance with the Buyers' claim, shall be responsible for the immediate elimination of the defect(s), complete or partial replacement of the commodity or shall devaluate the commodity according to the state of defect(s). Where necessary, the Buyers shall be at liberty to eliminate the defect(s) themselves at the Sellers' expenses. If the Sellers fail to answer the Buyers within one weeks after receipt of the aforesaid claim, the claim shall be reckoned as having been accepted by the Sellers.",

CLAIMS: Should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract, the Buyers may, at the Seller's discretion, be eligible for consideration. The Sellers will consider the Buyer's claim, and may consider elimination of the defect(s), complete or partial replacement of the commodity or devaluation of the commodity. If the Sellers fail to answer the Buyers, no assumption of acceptance shall be made.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 7-day claim window, the requirement for an Inspection Certificate, and the automatic acceptance of claims if unanswered, this modification significantly weakens the buyer's ability to make valid claims. It contradicts the implied warranty of merchantability required under Chinese Contract Law, which provides a reasonable timeframe and mechanism for addressing non-conforming goods.",

By removing the specifics of the claim process and timeframe, the modified text contradicts the buyer's implicit right to inspect and claim damages for non-conforming goods, essentially weakening the legal protection offered under the Contract Law.",

                "explanation": "This clause initially mandates the seller to provide insurance. Modifying it to 'Insurance coverage is optional' removes a significant protection for the buyer, especially considering the international nature of the transaction and potential risks involved. This contradicts Article 142 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China which requires parties to perform their obligations in good faith, including providing necessary protections for goods in transit, and Article 311, which specifies responsibilities regarding the safety of the goods during transport.",

Article 311 specifies that 'Where the seller delivers the object to be the subject matter of the contract, such object shall comply with the quality standards, the package required and the reasonable time limit for inspection, etc., as prescribed in the contract.' By making insurance optional, especially regarding 'All Risks' during international transit (CIP terms), it violates the spirit of good faith performance by potentially exposing the buyer to significant losses during transport. The buyer is now vulnerable during transit and there is a contradiction of the requirement that quality standards are met in article 311.",

The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. The rate of penalty is charged at 0.5% for every seven days, odd days less than seven days should be counted as seven days. In case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the contract and the Sellers, in spite of the cancellation, shall still pay the aforesaid penalty to the Buyers without delay, the seller should refund the money received and pay the 30% of the total goods price of the penalty",

This omission contradicts the legal expectation and right to receive compensation (as agreed in the initial contract) for losses incurred due to late delivery, effectively removing a vital protection for the buyer.",

PPI shall be responsible, to the extent required by Applicable Laws, to report all charges, complaints or claims reportable to the FDA relating to the Product, to the extent such charges, complaints or claims are made prior to the Agreement Date. EKR shall be responsible, to the extent required by Applicable Laws, to report all charges, complaints or claims reportable to the FDA relating to the Product, to the extent such charges, complaints or claims are made after the Agreement Date.",

PPI will endeavor to report charges, complaints, or claims reportable to the FDA relating to the Product for events prior to the Agreement Date, as it deems appropriate. EKR will also endeavor to report such matters to the FDA after the Agreement Date, as it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with 'use reasonable efforts' and 'will endeavor', making the reporting of adverse events discretionary rather than mandatory. The phrase 'as it deems appropriate' further weakens the obligation.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be responsible' to 'shall endeavor to be responsible' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. Removing the clause 'except to the extent that she or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate' eliminates a safeguard that protects against misrepresentation.",

The modified text weakens the responsibility for timely filing by using 'endeavor,' which does not guarantee compliance. Furthermore, removing the exception clause regarding knowledge of inaccurate information allows for a potential lack of due diligence, conflicting with the spirit of the law.",

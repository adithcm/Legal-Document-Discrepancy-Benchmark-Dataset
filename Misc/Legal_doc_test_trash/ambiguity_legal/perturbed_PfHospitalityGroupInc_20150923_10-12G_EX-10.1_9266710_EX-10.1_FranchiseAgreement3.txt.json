                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not' to 'should endeavor not to' weakens the obligation to protect confidential information, potentially allowing for unauthorized disclosure.",

                "law_explanation": "The UTSA protects trade secrets, and this modification undermines that protection by creating ambiguity around the obligation to safeguard such information. The change from 'shall not' to 'should endeavor not to' turns a strict requirement into a mere suggestion, making it harder to enforce the protection of trade secrets.",

                "explanation": "This weakens the non-compete clause. Using 'may consider not engaging' instead of 'shall not' makes the restriction optional. The added 'good faith' clause introduces further ambiguity in enforceability.",

                "law_explanation": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally prohibits non-compete agreements. While there are exceptions, the modification's permissive language ('may consider') and subjective 'good faith' requirement make the non-compete clause even less enforceable under California law, as it fails to meet the narrow exceptions allowed.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'substantially comply,' 'important requirements,' 'might,' 'some,' 'potentially some,' 'major violations,' 'material requirements', and 'as determined by the Franchisor' introduce subjectivity, and weaken the enforceability of the clause, and shifts the burden to the franchisor to specify the interpretation.",

                ],
                "law_explanation": "The Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 359 governs specific performance, which requires clear and definite contract terms. The introduction of subjective terms like 'substantially comply' and 'important requirements,' and shifting determination to the Franchisor makes it difficult to establish a clear breach and undermines the ability to obtain specific performance or an injunction. The standard of 'irreparable injury' requires a showing of damages that cannot be adequately compensated by money, which is undermined by 'might be requested to pay some' costs.",

                "explanation": "The modifications replace definite requirements with vague and discretionary language. For instance, 'shall perform' becomes 'shall endeavor to perform,' 'reasonably requested' becomes 'vaguely requested,' and the mandatory elements are made permissive with qualifiers like 'possibly arranging', 'might involve', and 'generally negotiating.' This undermines the Sponsor's defined duties.",

By weakening the Sponsor's obligation to provide oversight, administrative, and management services 'as may be reasonably requested' and instead using discretionary and vague language, the modification hinders the Board of Trustees' ability to properly evaluate the Sponsor's performance and fulfill its duties under Section 15(c).",

Ambiguity regarding expense allocation makes it difficult to assess if an affiliated person of the Trust is improperly being compensated. Inaccurately defining which entities must pay certain expenses makes it harder to identify the responsible parties and, therefore, whether someone is in violation of their agreement. By making expense allocations vague, it is more difficult to ensure that these fees and expenses are allocated correctly, creating the risk of self-dealing or other conflicts of interest, thus violating the spirit of Section 17(e)(1).",

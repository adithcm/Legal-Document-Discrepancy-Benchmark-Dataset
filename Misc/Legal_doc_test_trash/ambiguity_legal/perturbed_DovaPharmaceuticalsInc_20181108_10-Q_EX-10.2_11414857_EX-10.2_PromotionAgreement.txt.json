In addition, Dova shall, and shall require all of its sales representatives to, comply in all respects with Applicable Laws in connection with its promotion of the Product in the Territory.",

In addition, Dova shall encourage its sales representatives to comply with Applicable Laws in connection with its promotion of the Product in the Territory.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the mandatory 'shall comply in all respects' with the weaker 'endeavor to ensure' and 'encourage', introducing ambiguity and reducing the obligation to a best-effort basis. This directly contradicts the absolute requirement for compliance with laws and regulations.",

                "law_explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity regarding compliance with the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. By weakening the language to 'endeavor to ensure' and 'encourage,' the contract suggests that complete compliance is not strictly required, conflicting with the statute's strict prohibition of offering or paying remuneration to induce referrals, which is a criminal offense and civil violation, not a matter of 'endeavoring' or 'encouraging'.",

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, as soon as practicable following the Effective Date (but in no event later than [***]), Dova and Valeant (under the guidance of their respective pharmacovigilance departments, or equivalent thereof) shall identify and finalize the responsibilities the Parties shall employ to protect patients and promote their well- being in a separate safety data exchange agreement (\"Pharmacovigilance Agreement\"). These responsibilities shall include mutually acceptable guidelines and procedures for the receipt, investigation, recordation, communication and exchange (as between the Parties) of safety information such as Adverse Events, lack of efficacy, misuse/abuse, and any other information concerning the safety of the Product. Such guidelines and procedures will be in accordance with, and enable the Parties and their Affiliates to fulfill, regulatory reporting obligations to Governmental Authorities.",

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Dova and Valeant (under the guidance of their respective pharmacovigilance departments, or equivalent thereof) may attempt to identify and finalize the responsibilities the Parties shall employ to protect patients and promote their well- being in a separate safety data exchange agreement (“Pharmacovigilance Agreement”). These responsibilities should include mutually acceptable guidelines and procedures for the receipt, investigation, recordation, communication and exchange (as between the Parties) of safety information such as Adverse Events, lack of efficacy, misuse/abuse, and any other information concerning the safety of the Product. Such guidelines and procedures may be in accordance with regulatory reporting obligations to Governmental Authorities.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the obligation to establish a pharmacovigilance agreement with mandatory guidelines and procedures to a discretionary 'may attempt' and 'should include', implying that setting up proper pharmacovigilance isn't strictly enforced.",

                "law_explanation": "The change contradicts 21 CFR § 314.80, which mandates postmarketing reporting of adverse drug experiences. By changing 'shall identify and finalize' to 'may attempt to identify and finalize' and weakening the requirements for safety data exchange, the modification suggests that setting up proper adverse event reporting is not mandatory. This conflicts with the FDA's requirement for manufacturers to establish and maintain robust systems for collecting, reviewing, and reporting adverse events, which are critical for patient safety and regulatory oversight.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that all field force personnel are and will be licensed in accordance with all applicable laws. The modified text changes the mandatory language to a subjective belief held by Valeant, and they are following licensing laws as they ‘feel’ appropriate, thus weakening the legal obligation to ensure proper licensing.",

                ],
                "law_explanation": "The modification potentially contradicts state pharmacy laws. By stating that Valeant 'believes' their personnel are licensed 'as they feel appropriate,' it undermines the mandatory requirements of state laws regarding pharmaceutical sales and detailing, which often necessitate specific licenses for individuals promoting prescription drugs to healthcare professionals. For example, CA Business and Professions Code § 4059 prohibits dispensing drugs without a license. Licensing is not a matter of 'feeling appropriate'; it's a strict legal requirement. This subjective phrasing could lead to violations if personnel are not properly licensed under relevant state laws.",

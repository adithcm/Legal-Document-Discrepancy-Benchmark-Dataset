                "original_text": "If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "If the solvency of the Society appears to be potentially impaired, you might be encouraged to consider a possible extra payment. The Board of Directors may suggest an amount for any extra payment. It will be loosely based on each member's perceived share of the potential deficiency. You could perhaps make the extra payment by an undefined reduction in benefits or a theoretical payment in cash. If you opt not to consider making the extra payment sometime after we eventually notify you vaguely of a possible share of an undefined deficiency, an unsubstantiated amount may be potentially charged as a hypothetical indebtedness against the contract at a fluctuating interest rate.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces definitive terms with vague and uncertain language. Phrases like 'appears to be potentially impaired,' 'might be encouraged to consider,' 'may suggest,' 'loosely based,' 'perceived share,' 'potential deficiency,' 'undefined reduction,' 'theoretical payment,' 'opt not to consider,' 'sometime after,' 'eventually notify you vaguely,' 'unsubstantiated amount,' 'hypothetical indebtedness,' and 'fluctuating interest rate' create ambiguity and make the obligations unenforceable. This undermines the original intent to ensure the Society's solvency and protect members' interests, as it allows for discretionary actions and lacks clear, legally binding requirements.",

                "law_explanation": "This modification contradicts Wisconsin Statute 611.12(1) which requires that the terms of an insurance contract be 'specified in the policy'. The modified text introduces so much vagueness and uncertainty regarding the amount, timing, and method of payment of any potential extra assessment in the event of impairment of solvency of the Society that it fails to meet the requirements that the terms be clearly specified in the policy.",

These rights and privileges might be somewhat related to, but also separate from, the ownership of this contract, perhaps.",
                "explanation": "The revised wording uses vague language like 'generally outlined somewhere within,' 'possibly in the Bylaws,' 'might be somewhat related,' and 'perhaps.' This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the member's rights and privileges, making it difficult to determine the actual obligations and benefits associated with membership. It undermines the clarity and enforceability of the membership terms.",

                "law_explanation": "This violates Wisconsin Statute 181.0206 which mandates that all members of a nonstock corporation (such as Thrivent, a fraternal benefit society) have the same rights and obligations with respect to voting, dissolution, redemption, and distributions, unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws. This statute implies a requirement for clear and definite terms within the articles or bylaws, while the modified language creates uncertainty and thereby conflicts with this statute.",

                "changed_text": "From time to time, we may consider evaluating our potential divisible surplus. This contract's hypothetical portion, maybe, could possibly be somewhat credited as a discretionary dividend. Because we currently have no intention of expecting this contract to contribute meaningfully to any divisible surplus, it is realistically rather unlikely that any dividends will actually be credited, probably.",
                "explanation": "The changed text uses non-committal and uncertain language. Phrases such as 'From time to time, we may consider evaluating,' 'potential divisible surplus,' 'hypothetical portion, maybe, could possibly be somewhat credited,' 'discretionary dividend,' 'no intention of expecting,' 'meaningfully,' 'realistically rather unlikely,' and 'probably' create significant ambiguity about the dividend policy.

                "law_explanation": "This modification directly contradicts Wisconsin Statute 611.31(1)(a), which states that any policyholder participating in divisible surplus is entitled to participate in the earnings of the insurer. Making dividend allocation 'discretionary' and 'unlikely', and generally using weasel words to imply dividends will not be credited undermines the policyholder's right to participate in the company's earnings, as prescribed by the statute, which requires the terms of that participation to be definite.",

                "original_text": "The relevant assignee Party shall have the sole responsibility, at its sole cost and expense, to file the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements and any other forms or documents with the appropriate Governmental Authorities as required to record the transfer of any registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP that is allocated under the Separation Agreement, as applicable, and the relevant assignor Party hereby consents to such recordation.",
                "changed_text": "The relevant assignee Party shall endeavor to file the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements and any other forms or documents with Governmental Authorities, as it deems reasonably appropriate to record the transfer of registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP that is allocated under the Separation Agreement, as applicable, and the relevant assignor Party hereby consents to such recordation.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall have the sole responsibility' with 'shall endeavor,' which weakens the obligation to file. Also, replacing 'as required' with 'as it deems reasonably appropriate' introduces discretion, potentially leading to non-compliance. By using the word \"endeavor\" instead of \"shall\", it is not clearly stating an obligation to fulfill the recordation of the IP rights assignment, which is a legal contradiction. The wording introduces ambiguity, conflicting with the requirements for intellectual property assignments.",

                "law_explanation": "The Lanham Act states the assignment must be recorded in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The modified text uses 'endeavor' and 'deems reasonably appropriate', which creates discretion on whether to record the assignment. If it isn't recorded, this violates the Lanham Act.",

                "changed_text": "SpinCo agrees that it will generally not (i) oppose, challenge, petition to cancel, contest or threaten in any way, or assist another party in opposing, challenging, petitioning to cancel, contesting or threatening in any way, any application or registration by Nuance or its Affiliates or their respective licensees for any Nuance IP, (ii) engage in any act, or make commercially reasonable efforts to avoid purposefully omitting to perform any act, that impairs or adversely affects the rights of Nuance or any member of the Nuance Group in and to any Nuance IP or (iii) apply for any registration (including federal, state and national registrations) with respect to the Nuance IP unless compelled by law.",
                "explanation": "By adding \"generally not\" and \"commercially reasonable efforts\" the language weakens SpinCo's commitment not to challenge Nuance's IP and not to impair Nuance's IP rights. Also, by adding \"unless compelled by law\" it allows SpinCo to apply for registration of Nuance IP if a law exists that requires them to do so. These additions introduce ambiguity that opens the door for SpinCo to challenge or undermine Nuance's IP rights. This contradicts common law legal precedent.",

This covenant requires parties to act honestly and not undermine the purpose of the contract. The changes allow SpinCo to take actions that could harm Nuance's IP rights, contradicting this principle.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"reasonable best efforts\" to \"reasonable efforts\" weakens the obligation. The clause \"provided that such actions do not result in undue hardship\" gives each party an out if they deem the effort required to be too burdensome.

The \"undue hardship\" clause creates an incentive to shirk responsibility. The phrase \"undue hardship\" can be interpreted in many different ways, which violates the DGCL's duty of care.",

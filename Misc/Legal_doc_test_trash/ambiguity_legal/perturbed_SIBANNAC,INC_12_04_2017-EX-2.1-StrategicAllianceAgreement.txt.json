                "explanation": "Changing 'best efforts' to 'reasonable endeavors' and adding 'as it sees fit' weakens Bravatek's obligation to actively promote the products. This introduces ambiguity and allows Bravatek to potentially not fulfill the promotional duties adequately.",

By using 'reasonable endeavors' and adding 'as it sees fit', the modified text introduces a subjective standard that could allow Bravatek to avoid genuine promotional efforts, potentially violating the implied duty of good faith.",

                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any prospective clients arguably introduced by Bravatek, and vaguely registered with COMPANY by some means, and somewhat delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a possible lead-finder fee, at the sole discretion of COMPANY, which may be in the range of approximately 10% to perhaps 20% of perceived project revenue, with the fee subject to change, possibly payable after an uncertain amount of time following client payment, if ever.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces significant ambiguity regarding key aspects of the lead-finder fee agreement. Terms like 'arguably introduced,' 'vaguely registered,' 'possible fee,' 'sole discretion,' 'approximately,' 'perhaps,' 'subject to change,' and 'uncertain amount of time' make the entire compensation clause unenforceable and open to the COMPANY's interpretation. It goes from a guaranteed finder fee to something that is highly unlikely.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas Business and Commerce Code § 2.204 addresses the formation of contracts for the sale of goods. While it allows for flexibility, it requires an agreement to be 'sufficient to show agreement,' and there must be a 'reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy'. By making the lead-finder fee entirely discretionary and uncertain, the modified text fails to provide a 'reasonably certain basis' for determining damages, rendering the agreement unenforceable and violating this provision.",

                "explanation": "The changes weaken the confidentiality clause by changing 'agree to maintain in strict confidence' to 'should endeavor to maintain confidence' and 'not to disclose' to 'try not to disclose'. This introduces a discretionary element where a strict obligation existed before. Also, it goes from 'not to use for any purposes' to 'generally avoid using for purposes', which weakens that condition.",

                "law_explanation": "The Texas Trade Secrets Act (TTSA) defines 'misappropriation' as the disclosure or use of a trade secret without express or implied consent. By weakening the obligation to maintain confidentiality, the modified text creates ambiguity around what constitutes permitted use or disclosure, potentially undermining the protection afforded by the TTSA. A 'reasonable effort' to maintain confidentiality is insufficient to protect trade secrets as required by law. Section 134A.002 allows for injunctive relief to prevent misappropriation, which would be more difficult to obtain if the confidentiality obligation is weakened and discretionary.",

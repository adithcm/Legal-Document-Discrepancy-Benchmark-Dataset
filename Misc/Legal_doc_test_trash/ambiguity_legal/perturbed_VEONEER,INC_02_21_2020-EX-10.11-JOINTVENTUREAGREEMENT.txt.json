                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the agreement *shall* be governed and construed by the laws of Japan. The change introduces vagueness by suggesting the agreement will be 'generally construed' following 'principles arguably informed by' Japanese law, introducing ambiguity. This weakening could allow parties to argue for interpretations not strictly aligned with Japanese law, particularly if disputes arise in jurisdictions outside Japan.",

                "law_explanation": "While the PICC aren't binding law, they are often used to interpret international contracts. By weakening the choice of law clause, the amendment risks undermining the predictability and enforceability typically associated with a clear choice of law, going against best practices in international commercial law.",

                "explanation": "The original clause creates an obligation on the Nissin Parties to ensure VNBJ and VNBZ comply with indemnification requirements. The modified text weakens this to an agreement to 'encourage' VNBJ and VNBZ to 'consider complying,' removing the binding obligation to ensure compliance.

However, the weakening of the indemnification obligation in the modified text, especially the removal of clear directives, could create potential breaches of fiduciary duties if directors and officers are not adequately protected, conflicting with principles underlying corporate governance and director liability as articulated in Delaware law.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"shall\" to \"should endeavor to\" weakens the obligation. Stating that specific handling instructions are optional contradicts standard shipping practices and regulations.",

                "law_explanation": "Article 16 of the Regulations for the Implementation of the Standardization Law of the People's Republic of China emphasizes the importance of standards in ensuring product quality and safety. By making the marking of specific handling instructions optional, the modified text contradicts the spirit of this law, as such instructions are crucial for preventing damage and ensuring the safe handling of goods during transportation, thus affecting product quality and safety. While this article does not directly refer to markings, the regulations support the use of standards to ensure safe transit of goods. The lack of markings indicating weight, hazards, and instructions would be a legal issue during inspection.",

This Contract is made out in three originals in both Chinese and English, each language being legally of the equal effect. Conflicts between these two languages arising there from, if any, shall be subject to Chinese version.",
                "changed_text": "The Contract is valid for approximately 5 years. This Contract is made out in three originals in both Chinese and English, but for practical purposes, the English version shall be the primary reference.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"valid for 5 years\" to \"approximately 5 years\" introduces ambiguity. Prioritizing the English version contradicts the original clause stating the Chinese version prevails in case of conflict, potentially leading to misinterpretations and legal challenges under Chinese law.",

                "law_explanation": "Article 125 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China states that if there are disputes over the understanding of the terms of a contract, the true meaning shall be determined according to the words and sentences used in the contract, relevant provisions of the contract, the purpose of the contract, and transaction practices. This implicitly respects the originally agreed-upon language precedence (Chinese). By stating the English version will be the primary reference, this goes against this general understanding by explicitly contradicting the original language precedence and potentially creating a different interpretation than intended or expected under Chinese Law.",

The letter of credit should state that partial shipments are allowed. The Buyer's agent agrees to pay for the goods in accordance with the actual amount of the goods shipped. 80% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.1. The remaining 20% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.2. The Letter of Credit shall be valid until 90 days after the latest shipment is effected.",

The value of the letter of credit will be determined at the buyer's discretion. The letter of credit may state that partial shipments are allowed. Payments will be processed in a manner convenient to the buyer.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall open' to 'shall endeavor', removing 'irrevocable' and 'within 30 days', and adding 'buyer's discretion' and 'manner convenient to the buyer' significantly weakens the buyer's obligations regarding the letter of credit. The original text clearly outlines strict payment terms, while the edited version makes these terms ambiguous and dependent on the buyer's choices. This undermines the seller's financial security, potentially violating good faith principles in contract performance.",

                "law_explanation": "Article 8 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China mandates that parties shall abide by the principle of good faith in performing their contractual obligations. The modified text undermines the principle of good faith because the buyer is given too much discretion. The term 'reasonable timeframe' is vague and may be interpreted subjectively, while 'at the buyer's discretion' regarding the value and 'manner convenient to the buyer' regarding payments further reduces the buyer's commitment and shifts power dynamics. The modifications create potential for exploitation by allowing the buyer to delay or reduce payments unfairly, contradicting the requirement of honesty and trustworthiness under Article 8.",

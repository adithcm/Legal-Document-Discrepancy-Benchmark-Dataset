                "explanation": "The modification changes the original text by adding 'as reasonably convenient' which makes the obligation to sign documents for intellectual property rights ambiguous and dependent on the consultant's discretion.",

                "law_explanation": "The modification introduces an ambiguous standard of 'reasonably convenient,' which contradicts the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Texas Business and Commerce Code § 1.203. This section requires parties to a contract to act honestly and reasonably. By making the action contingent on the consultant's convenience, the provision allows the consultant to potentially obstruct the company's efforts to secure intellectual property rights, violating the implied covenant of good faith.",

                "explanation": "The modification changes 'written waivers that may be provided by the Company upon request, which shall not be unreasonably withheld' to 'waivers that the Company may or may not provide' and 'will not directly or indirectly participate' to 'will try to avoid directly or indirectly participating'. This weakens the non-compete clause, making it non-binding. The company can deny waivers and the consultant only has to 'try' not to participate.",

                "law_explanation": "The modified text creates an unenforceable non-compete agreement under Texas Business and Commerce Code § 15.50, which requires specific limitations on time, geographical area, and scope of activity. By making the waiver discretionary and the non-compete obligation conditional ('try to avoid'), the agreement lacks the required specificity and certainty to be enforceable, thus contradicting Texas law on non-compete agreements. In Texas, non-compete agreements must be reasonable. This agreement as modified is likely deemed unreasonable.",

                "law_explanation": "The modified text introduces vagueness which can violate Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 35.001, concerning choice of law in contracts. This code implies a need for clarity and certainty in the agreement on which jurisdiction's laws will govern the contract. By referring to 'vaguely interpreted principles of law,' the modification contradicts the intent of this Texas statute, creating uncertainty about which specific laws will apply and hindering the predictability required for contractual enforcement. Texas law requires clarity on which state's laws apply.",

A copy of the (i) certificate(s) of insurance and (ii) endorsements, acceptable to EDGE, shall be submitted to EDGE prior to commencement of any Work and renewals or replacements of such certificates shall be so delivered at least 30 days prior to the expiration or termination of each such policy. A copy of the insurance policies shall promptly be made available to EDGE upon EDGE' request. Subcontractor expressly acknowledges while EDGE retains the right to review the insurance provided by Subcontractor and' Lower-tier Subcontractors, EDGE is not obligated to perform such review. In addition, EDGE exercise of such right is for EDGE' benefit alone and shall confer no rights to Subcontractor or to any third party. EDGE's acceptance of or failure to object to the submitted documents does not constitute approval of coverage that is not in compliance with this Agreement or as acceptance or affirmation of the adequacy or applicability of such insurance.",

Subcontractor may provide a certificate(s) of insurance and endorsements. A copy of the insurance policies will be available upon request, depending on availability.

                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity regarding the type and amount of insurance required, replacing 'as required herein' with 'as it deems necessary.' Also, the modification makes the submission of the insurance certificate optional by using 'may' instead of 'shall,' and the term 'depending on availability' creates ambiguity around insurance availability.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas Insurance Code ยง 81.051 mandates that individuals and entities maintain financial responsibility, often through insurance, to cover potential liabilities. The modification gives the subcontractor too much discretion in determining necessary insurance, which might not be adequate to cover potential liabilities arising from the work, thus contradicting the spirit and intent of the law that ensures sufficient financial backing for potential damages or claims. Specifically, by making the subcontractor's assessment of 'necessary' insurance subjective, it fails to guarantee that the minimum coverage levels required by law or standard industry practices are met.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies continuous operation except for scheduled maintenance during specific hours. The modified text weakens this commitment, allowing for interruptions as 'deemed necessary' and only 'endeavoring' to schedule maintenance during off-peak hours.

The modified text changes 'will provide' to 'may provide' and replaces 'reasonable efforts to maintain' with 'will attempt to maintain,' weakening the obligation and making the provision of connectivity discretionary.

The modified text weakens this by using 'is expected,' 'is encouraged,' and 'may result,' making the payment obligation and the consequences of non-payment ambiguous.

The modified language weakens the definiteness of the payment obligation, potentially making it more difficult for i-on to enforce the payment terms. Florida case law, as exemplified by cases like Commerce Partnership 8098 Ltd. Partnership v.

Integrity shall order Shares from the Fund only to the extent that it shall have received purchase orders therefore.",

Integrity may order Shares from the Fund based on anticipated demand.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'best efforts' to 'good faith efforts' and 'public offering price' to 'price it considers appropriate' introduces ambiguity. Allowing Integrity to order shares based on 'anticipated demand' instead of only 'purchase orders' contradicts SEC regulations.",

Allowing Integrity to sell at a price it 'considers appropriate' and order shares based on 'anticipated demand' circumvents this pricing rule, potentially leading to dilution or unfair pricing for investors.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'will generally aim to conduct... in a manner that it believes is consistent with' creates a weaker obligation.

As used in this Agreement, the terms \"registration statement,\" \"prospectus,\" and \"statement of additional information\" shall mean any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information filed by the Fund with the SEC and any amendments and supplements thereto which at any time shall have been filed with the SEC. The Fund represents and warrants to Integrity that any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information, when such registration statement becomes effective, will include all statements required to be contained therein in conformity with the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC; that all statements of fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information will be true and correct when such registration statement becomes effective; and that neither any registration statement nor any prospectus or statement of additional information when such registration statement becomes effective will include an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to a purchaser of Shares.",

The Fund believes and represents that any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information, when such registration statement becomes effective, will generally include statements. The fund makes a good faith effort to ensure accuracy, but does not guarantee all statements of fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information will be entirely true and correct when such registration statement becomes effective; and that the fund plans on neither any registration statement nor any prospectus or statement of additional information including an untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to a purchaser of Shares.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'represents' to 'believes' and 'carefully prepared in conformity' to 'prepared with reasonable effort to conform' weakens the representation and warranty. Adding 'generally include' creates uncertainty. Stating that it 'does not guarantee' truth and correctness, while stating that they 'plan on' not including untrue statements further dilutes the accountability of the Fund for its filings with the SEC.",

The standard of liability under Section 11 is strict, and cannot be contracted away by vague or qualified representations.",

The Party is formed, registered, licensed and operating its business in compliance with the laws of the United States of America, its states and territories, and any districts, municipalities and other political subdivisions of the foregoing (\"Applicable Laws\").",

                "explanation": "This change replaces the explicit legal obligation to operate in compliance with applicable laws with a vague intention to operate in substantial alignment with the 'spirit' of the laws.

                "explanation": "The change from 'will defend and indemnify' to 'will endeavor to defend and indemnify' weakens the obligation, and the addition of 'reasonably linked to' introduces ambiguity regarding the causal connection required for indemnification.

                "law_explanation": "This weakens the indemnity obligation. CERCLA imposes strict, joint, and several liability on certain parties for environmental contamination, regardless of fault.

Commercial General Liability Insurance.

Commercial General Liability Insurance. Occurrence-based coverage with a combined single limit that the Party deems sufficient per occurrence and in the aggregate for premises and operations; products and completed operations; contractual liability coverage for indemnities of a Party contained within this Agreement; broad form property damage (including completed operations); explosion, collapse and underground hazards; and personal injury. Additional insured endorsement and waiver of subrogation endorsement may be obtained.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will maintain' with 'will attempt to maintain' weakens the requirement. Replacing '$10,000,000' with 'that the Party deems sufficient' introduces ambiguity and removes a clear, objective standard. Replacing 'Requires' with 'may be obtained' makes the additional insured and waiver of subrogation endorsements optional. This weakens coverage.",

                "changed_text": "Within a reasonable timeframe, as determined by THI, after the end of each quarterly period, THI may furnish to Marv a statement, which need not be certified, showing what THI deems relevant regarding Licensed Products: i. Licensed Products which were sold, leased or put into use; ii. services performed that used Licensed Product; iii. the approximate amount of royalty payable; and iv. if no Licensed Product has been sold, leased or put into use or if no services have been performed, THI may or may not show that fact.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'thirty (30) days' with 'a reasonable timeframe, as determined by THI,' removing the certification requirement, and making the content of the statement discretionary. This weakens the reporting obligation.",

The modified text allows THI to unilaterally determine what is 'reasonable' and 'relevant,' and removes the requirement for certification, potentially allowing for manipulation of royalty reporting, which violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Specifically, the law states that 'Every contract or duty within this title imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement.'",

Marv shall have no duty to pay an IP Cost, whether affirmed or not affirmed, for which Marv does not receive prepayment. If THI does not pay Marv by the Due Date, the Application or Patent shall revert to Marv as if THI had denied payment under section 2(c)3.",

                "explanation": "The original text sets a clear obligation for THI to prepay IP costs and outlines the consequences of non-payment. The modified text introduces ambiguity by making prepayment optional for THI ('may') and conditioning Marv's duty on 'internal budgetary constraints.' It also replaces the automatic reversion of rights with a vague 'case-by-case basis' determination.",

The modified text weakens the contractual obligation on both sides, making it difficult to enforce the terms of the agreement regarding IP cost payments, and the consequence of not paying. This directly contradicts the principles that define what is expected of both parties in the original contract. A jury could find the modified language to be so ambiguous as to eliminate a firm commitment on either side.",

The modified language, allowing subjective determination of what is 'reasonable and necessary' and permitting disclosure for perceived 'business opportunities,' significantly weakens the protection of confidential information, potentially allowing for actions that would be considered misappropriation under PUTSA, because it undermines the reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy required for trade secret protection. Specifically the PUTSA section 5302 covers Injunctive relief for misappropriation, which the modified text is explicitly inviting through permissive loopholes.",

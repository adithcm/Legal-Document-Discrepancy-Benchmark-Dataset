                "explanation": "The modified text weakens the exclusivity requirement by replacing 'shall exclusively play/use' with 'shall endeavor to exclusively play/use' and explicitly grants the consultant discretion to use non-Adams Golf clubs, contradicting the intended exclusivity.",

                "law_explanation": "The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing requires parties to a contract to act honestly and reasonably in the performance and enforcement of the contract. By weakening the exclusivity clause and granting the consultant broad discretion to use competing products, the modified text could be interpreted as acting in bad faith, especially if the consultant actively promotes competing products while under contract. This contradicts the expected standard of good faith in contractual performance under Kansas law, given that the contract explicitly outlines mandatory products to be used.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of' to 'shall attempt to achieve a satisfactory record of play' and removing the specific minimum number of events and repayment schedule, the legal obligation to participate in a certain number of events and the financial repercussions for not doing so becomes highly ambiguous and unenforceable.",

                "law_explanation": "Under Kansas law, specific performance is a remedy available for breach of contract, compelling the breaching party to fulfill the contractual obligations. However, specific performance is generally not granted if the obligations are vague or involve personal services that are difficult for a court to supervise. The modified text introduces ambiguity regarding the number of events and removes the concrete repayment schedule, making it significantly more difficult for ADAMS GOLF to obtain specific performance or even monetary damages for the CONSULTANT's failure to participate, as the terms are no longer sufficiently definite to enforce.",

ADAMS GOLF intends to protect, indemnify and hold CONSULTANT harmless from and against expenses, damages, claims, etc.",
                "explanation": "The alteration changes a mandatory 'shall submit' to a discretionary 'may submit,' significantly reducing the consultant's control over their image and endorsement. The removal of the 'approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed' clause gives ADAMS GOLF more leeway. Indemnification is weakened from a firm agreement ('agrees to protect, indemnify and hold harmless') to a statement of intent ('intends to protect, indemnify and hold harmless').",

                "law_explanation": "While KSA 84-3-407 specifically addresses alteration of negotiable instruments, the principle of material alteration impacting contractual obligations is a common law concept. By changing 'shall submit' to 'may submit' and weakening the indemnification clause, Adams Golf effectively alters a key aspect of the contract related to the Consultant's control over their image and Adams Golf's liability. If these alterations are deemed material and made without the consultant's consent, it could provide grounds for the consultant to argue the contract is unenforceable, or at least that the altered terms are not binding. The 'good faith' requirement implicit in contract law could also be argued to be violated if Adams Golf exploits this ambiguity to the detriment of the consultant.",

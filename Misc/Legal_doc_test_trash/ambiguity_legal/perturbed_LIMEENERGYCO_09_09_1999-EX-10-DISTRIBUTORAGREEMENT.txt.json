                "original_text": "Company shall at all times make reasonable efforts to maintain quality control and to deliver Products to Distributor which, when received by Distributor, or, as the case may be, the end-user, are properly and adequately packaged and contained, fully assembled (except for miscellaneous components which may be shipped separately to prevent damage in transit), fully functional and otherwise in conformance with the warranties set forth herein. Company warrants that the Products will be designed, manufactured, constructed, assembled and packaged in a workmanlike manner and that such Products shall be fully functional and fit for their intended purposes. Company further warrants that the Products sold hereunder shall be free from defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period of twenty-four (24) months after delivery to Distributor's end-user.",
                "changed_text": "Company should endeavor to maintain quality control and attempt to deliver Products to Distributor which, when received by Distributor, or, as the case may be, the end-user, are adequately packaged and contained, mostly assembled, generally functional, and substantially in conformance with the warranties set forth herein. Company warrants that the Products will be generally designed, manufactured, constructed, assembled and packaged, and that such Products shall be generally functional and fit for their intended purposes. Company warrants that the Products sold hereunder should be reasonably free from defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period of twenty-four (24) months after delivery to Distributor's end-user.",
                "explanation": "By using terms such as 'endeavor,' 'attempt,' 'mostly assembled,' 'generally functional,' and 'substantially in conformance,' the obligation is weakened, making it difficult to enforce a standard of quality. This conflicts with implied warranties of merchantability, which require goods to be fit for their ordinary purpose.",

                "law_explanation": "The Illinois UCC 5/2-314 implies a warranty that goods are merchantable, meaning they must be reasonably fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used. By weakening the quality control and functionality requirements with vague language, the modified text contradicts the implied warranty of merchantability, making it easier for the Company to provide goods that do not meet the basic standards of being fit for purpose.",

                "changed_text": "The Distributor should not disclose this agreement unless there is a good reason.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and vagueness. 'Good reason' is not defined and can be interpreted in many ways. This may violate the Illinois Trade Secrets Act.",

                ],
                "law_explanation": "The Illinois Trade Secrets Act defines what constitutes a trade secret and sets rules for protecting it. By allowing disclosure for a 'good reason,' without defining it, the distributor could potentially disclose information the company deems confidential, and therefore, a trade secret. If the disclosure is not protected under the exceptions allowed under the Illinois Trade Secrets Act, it would violate the Act.",

Company will make reasonable efforts to procure a policy, which is non-cancelable, except upon thirty (30) days, advance notice to the Distributor.",
                "changed_text": "Company may carry some product liability insurance through any insurance company and may name the Distributor as an additional insured. Company will try to procure a policy, which is not easily canceled.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'will carry a reasonable amount' to 'may carry some' makes the insurance coverage discretionary rather than obligatory. The vague language 'any insurance company' and 'not easily canceled' weakens the obligation to provide adequate and reliable insurance coverage.",

                "law_explanation": "While not directly mandating insurance, the Illinois Product Liability Act addresses the legal responsibilities of manufacturers and sellers for defective products. The altered text undermines the distributor's protection by potentially leaving them exposed to significant liability. The original clause offered a level of assurance via reasonably sound insurance policy, which will be affected if the insurance policy is not reliable due to the new text.",

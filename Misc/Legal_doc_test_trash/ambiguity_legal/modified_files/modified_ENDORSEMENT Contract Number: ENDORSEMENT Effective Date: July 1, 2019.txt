Ballard Road Appleton, WI 54919-0001 (800) 847-4836 The following amendments apply in lieu of any contract provisions to the contrary. The following provisions are included as part of this contract: MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. <*$p$*>If the solvency of the Society appears to be potentially impaired, you might be encouraged to consider a possible extra payment. The Board of Directors may suggest an amount for any extra payment. It will be loosely based on each member's perceived share of the potential deficiency. You could perhaps make the extra payment by an undefined reduction in benefits or a theoretical payment in cash. If you opt not to consider making the extra payment sometime after we eventually notify you vaguely of a possible share of an undefined deficiency, an unsubstantiated amount may be potentially charged as a hypothetical indebtedness against the contract at a fluctuating interest rate.<*$p$*> MEMBERSHIP. The person(s) named as the Insured(s) or the Annuitant(s) is a benefit member of the Society. <*$p$*>Rights and privileges of membership are generally outlined somewhere within the Articles of Incorporation and possibly in the Bylaws of the Society. These rights and privileges might be somewhat related to, but also separate from, the ownership of this contract, perhaps.<*$p$*> DIVIDENDS. <*$p$*>From time to time, we may consider evaluating our potential divisible surplus. This contract's hypothetical portion, maybe, could possibly be somewhat credited as a discretionary dividend. Because we currently have no intention of expecting this contract to contribute meaningfully to any divisible surplus, it is realistically rather unlikely that any dividends will actually be credited, probably.<*$p$*> DIVIDEND OPTIONS. If dividends are credited after premiums can no longer be paid under this contract, dividends will be paid in cash. Otherwise, dividends will be applied under the Payment of Premium option unless the Cash option has been chosen in writing. Cash. Dividends are paid in cash. Payment of Premium. Dividends are applied as payment of a Net Premium.

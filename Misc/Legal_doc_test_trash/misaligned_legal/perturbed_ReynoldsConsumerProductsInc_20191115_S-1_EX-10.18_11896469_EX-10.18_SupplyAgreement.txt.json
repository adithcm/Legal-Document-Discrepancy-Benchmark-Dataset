                "original_text": "The phrase \"Confidential Information\" means information meeting all of the following criteria: 1) The information is a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information owned by a Party or its direct and indirect subsidiaries under Applicable Law (this Party is referred to at times in this Section as the \"Disclosing Party\"); and 2) The other Party (referred to at times in this Section as the \"Receiving Party\") requests such information from the Disclosing Party for the Authorized Purpose during the Term (i.e., neither Party wants unsolicited Confidential Information from the other Party); and 3) The Disclosing Party discloses such requested information to the Receiving Party during the Term either labelled as \"Confidential\" or words of similar intent, or describes the disclosed information in reasonable detail in a written notice to the Receiving Party delivered, either at the time of disclosure or within five (5) days of disclosure. If a Disclosing Party neglects to label or deliver timely written notice to the Receiving Party identifying the disclosed information as confidential in nature, the disclosed information will only be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement if the Disclosing Party is able to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the Receiving Party knew that the disclosed information was a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information of the Disclosing Party at the time of disclosure.",
                "changed_text": "The phrase \"Confidential Information\" means information meeting all of the following criteria: 1) The information is a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information owned by a Party or its direct and indirect subsidiaries under Applicable Law (this Party is referred to at times in this Section as the \"Disclosing Party\"); and 2) The other Party (referred to at times in this Section as the \"Receiving Party\") requests such information from the Disclosing Party for the Authorized Purpose during the Term (i.e., neither Party wants unsolicited Confidential Information from the other Party); and 3) The Disclosing Party discloses such requested information to the Receiving Party during the Term either labelled as \"Confidential\" or words of similar intent, or describes the disclosed information in reasonable detail in a written notice to the Receiving Party delivered, either at the time of disclosure or within five (5) days of disclosure.

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for the Disclosing Party to prove the Receiving Party's knowledge of the confidential nature of the information, we are changing what defines confidential information under the agreement. This may contradict the Illinois Trade Secrets Act, which requires demonstrating knowledge or use. If the Receiving Party unknowingly receives unlabeled confidential information, they might not be bound by confidentiality, which is a legal risk.",

                "law_explanation": "The modification contradicts the ITSA, which requires proof that the defendant knew or had reason to know the information was a trade secret. By stating that information will be treated as confidential regardless of the Receiving Party's knowledge, the contract could potentially protect information that doesn't meet the statutory definition of a trade secret, thereby altering the legally established requirements for trade secret protection.",

In addition, if Seller has to file litigation to collect the amount owed and Seller prevails in the litigation, Buyer will reimburse Seller for actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller in collecting the delinquent amount and accrued late payment fees on the delinquent amount.",

In addition, if Seller has to file litigation to collect the amount owed and Seller prevails in the litigation, Buyer will reimburse Seller for all expenses incurred by Seller in collecting the delinquent amount and accrued late payment fees on the delinquent amount.",
                "explanation": "The modification increases the late payment fee and changes \"actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses\" to \"all expenses\". This conflicts with Illinois law regarding permissible interest rates and the types of expenses recoverable in debt collection. Making the expenses not \"reasonable\" or \"substantiated\" is a problem.",

Additionally, the change to \"all expenses\" contradicts the FDCPA's prohibition of unreasonable charges or expenses and misrepresentation of the amount of debt. This clause now includes any unsubstantiated expenses.",

Independent contractors should not be subject to extensive control over how they perform their work. Granting the Buyer the right to direct certain day-to-day activities relating to product specifications suggests an employer-employee relationship, leading to potential misclassification under IRS rules.",

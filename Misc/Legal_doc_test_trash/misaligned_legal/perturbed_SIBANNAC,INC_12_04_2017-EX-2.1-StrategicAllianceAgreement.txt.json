                "original_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be unilaterally decided by COMPANY at its sole discretion, with no guaranteed minimum or maximum percentage of project revenue, and payable at COMPANY's discretion, which may be up to 180 days after client payment.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces the mutually agreed range for the lead-finder fee with a completely discretionary amount decided unilaterally by COMPANY, and drastically alters the payment terms. This conflicts with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in Texas contract law.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract. By granting COMPANY the unilateral right to determine the lead-finder fee and payment terms, without any minimum guarantee or reasonable timeframe, the modified text contradicts the implied duty to act in good faith.",

                "law_explanation": "TUTSA protects trade secrets, which are broadly defined as information that derives independent economic value from not being generally known. Requiring explicit written marking as 'Confidential' as the *only* condition for protection is inconsistent with the broader definition and protections afforded under TUTSA, making it harder to claim trade secret protection.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas courts generally uphold choice-of-law provisions in contracts. Allowing each party to unilaterally decide which laws apply undermines the certainty and predictability that the choice-of-law clause is intended to provide. The right to determine which laws will govern the relationship is taken away from the courts and given to the parties creating uncertainty. While there isn't a specific statute being contradicted, it goes against established Texas legal precedent regarding contractual interpretation and choice of law.",

A Web site may exist on a single computer system with other Web sites.",
                "changed_text": "The term \"Web site\" shall mean a collection of static HTML pages viewable on a single browser. A Web site shall not include dynamic content, server-side scripts, or any interactive elements.",
                "explanation": "This modification severely restricts the definition of a \"Web site,\" contradicting the common and legal understanding of what a website entails, especially concerning interactive content and dynamic elements.",

                "law_explanation": "The modified definition excludes interactive elements which are inherent in the statutory definition of a website. Florida Statute 487.031(5)(b) discusses web pages and websites in relation to pesticide information. This implies that Florida law views a website as being able to provide dynamic information and services, not just static pages, related to things such as pesticide use. The modified definition removes dynamic functionality, thus conflicting with the implicit definition within the statute.",

                "changed_text": "i-on will attempt to maintain the operation of the Hosted Site during business hours, Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays, subject to unforeseen outages and maintenance.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding uptime commitments, significantly reducing the guaranteed availability of the hosted site.

                "law_explanation": "Florida Statute § 672.314 addresses the implied warranty of merchantability in the sale of goods and services. While this contract is for services, the change from 'continuous operation' to operation only during 'business hours' may be seen as a breach of implied warranty if the customer reasonably expects 24/7 availability, particularly given the nature of web hosting. By significantly reducing the guaranteed uptime, the modified text introduces a potential conflict with the implied warranty of reasonable service, leading to legal uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "This modification shifts the responsibility for legal compliance from the customer to i-on. This is a contradiction because website owners are typically held responsible for the content they publish, especially in cases of copyright infringement, defamation, or violation of accessibility laws.",

                "law_explanation": "17 U.S.C. § 512 outlines the safe harbor provisions for online service providers (OSPs) regarding copyright infringement. While it protects OSPs under certain conditions, it fundamentally places the responsibility for infringing content on the user (the customer in this case). By stating that i-on assumes responsibility for the legality of the content, it contradicts the principle that the content provider (customer) is primarily liable for copyright violations. The safe harbor provisions apply to i-on's protection from the client doing illegal things, not the other way around.",

                "original_text": "If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on the Board of Director's discretion. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 30 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 10% per year.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the determination of extra payment from fair share to the board's discretion makes the term ambiguous and subjective. Changing the payment timeframe to 30 days and the interest rate to 10% creates conflicting terms regarding solvency and indebtedness obligations.",

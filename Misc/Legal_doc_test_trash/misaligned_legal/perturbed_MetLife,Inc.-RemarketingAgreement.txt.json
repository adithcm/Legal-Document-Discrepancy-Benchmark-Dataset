                "explanation": "By defining “Business Day” in a way that ignores legal holidays recognized in New York, the contract introduces a contradiction. This could affect deadlines and obligations if a bank holiday is not treated as such.",

                "law_explanation": "New York General Construction Law § 24 specifies which days are considered public holidays and thus typically observed as non-business days. The modified contract language contradicts this by stating a 'Business Day' is irrespective of whether banking institutions are closed due to law or executive order. This contradiction could lead to disputes regarding deadlines and obligations that fall on legally recognized holidays.",

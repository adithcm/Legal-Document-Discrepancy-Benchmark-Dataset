                "original_text": "Nothing in this Agreement shall cause Subcontractor in any way to be construed as a partner or joint venture with, or an employee of, EDGE in connection with or arising from Subcontractor's rendering of Work to EDGE pursuant to this Agreement. EDGE retains Subcontractor only for the purposes and to the extent as set forth in this Agreement, and Subcontractor's relation to EDGE during the term of this Agreement shall be that of an independent contractor and nothing herein shall create or imply any other or different relationship.",
                "changed_text": "Nothing in this Agreement shall cause Subcontractor in any way to be construed as a partner or joint venture with, or an employee of, EDGE in connection with or arising from Subcontractor's rendering of Work to EDGE pursuant to this Agreement. EDGE retains Subcontractor only for the purposes and to the extent as set forth in this Agreement, and Subcontractor's relation to EDGE during the term of this Agreement shall be that of an independent contractor. For the purposes of liability, however, Subcontractor shall be considered an employee of EDGE.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction. The paragraph initially establishes the subcontractor as an independent contractor, but then adds a clause stating that for liability purposes, the subcontractor will be considered an employee. This contradictory statement creates legal uncertainty about the subcontractor's true status.",

                "law_explanation": "The modified text contradicts IRS guidelines, which emphasize behavioral control, financial control, and the relationship of the parties to determine worker classification. The contradiction between 'independent contractor' and 'employee for liability' introduces ambiguity, potentially leading to misclassification under tax law and liability disputes. An official IRS document on independent contractor status is included as the second link.",

It is mandatory that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the breach thereof shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Texas and the venue shall be exclusively in Collin County, Texas for resolution.",

                "explanation": "The original text specified that arbitration was not an option. The modified text introduces arbitration as an optional method of resolution, while simultaneously stating that all disputes are MANDATORY subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Texas and Collin County.

                "law_explanation": "The FAA favors the enforcement of valid arbitration agreements. By making arbitration optional while also mandating jurisdiction in Texas courts, the modification creates uncertainty about whether an arbitration agreement, if entered, would be enforceable, especially if one party prefers litigation in Texas. The simultaneous statements that arbitration can be elected, but litigation is mandatory causes confusion.",

Giving EDGE arbitrary discretion over the insurance type and amount could lead to the subcontractor being underinsured or not having legally required coverage, potentially violating implied obligations and general contractor regulations.

                "explanation": "The original text states that the member will gain access to confidential information, justifying the non-disclosure agreement. The modified text states that the member will NOT gain access to confidential information, removing the justification for the non-disclosure agreement and potentially making it unenforceable.

                "changed_text": "(d) As used in this Agreement, the term \"Post-Term Period\" shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of two (2) years from the date of: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement only if terminated for cause; (c) termination of Member's employment with Franchisee; and/or (d) a final order of a duly authorized arbitrator, panel of arbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been taken) with respect to any of the foregoing or with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement; either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or entity).",
                "explanation": "By adding 'only if terminated for cause', the post-term non-compete is now only triggered if the agreement is terminated for cause. This contradicts standard non-compete enforcement principles, as non-competes often apply regardless of the reason for termination, subject to reasonableness considerations. This modification introduces ambiguity and could render the non-compete unenforceable if the Franchise Agreement expires or is terminated without cause.",

                "law_explanation": "While this varies by state, this modification could be seen as an unreasonable restriction on an employee's ability to earn a living if the termination wasn't for cause. Many states scrutinize non-competes and require them to be narrowly tailored and justified. Limiting the trigger to 'termination for cause' introduces a condition that may not be considered reasonable, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific facts.  For example, in California, non-compete agreements are generally void, and this clause wouldn't meet an exception.",

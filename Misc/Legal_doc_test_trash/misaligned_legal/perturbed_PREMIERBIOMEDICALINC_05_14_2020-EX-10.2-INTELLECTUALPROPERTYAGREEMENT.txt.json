Information meeting the definition of a \"trade secret\" as set forth in the Uniform Trade Secret Act is explicitly excluded.",
                "explanation": "The modified text explicitly excludes information meeting the definition of a \"trade secret\" from the scope of 'confidential information'. This directly contradicts the original text and could lead to disputes, as trade secrets are a legally protected form of confidential information.",

By excluding information meeting this definition from 'confidential information', the modified text contradicts the established legal definition and protection afforded to trade secrets.",

                "law_explanation": "Pa.R.C.P. 1006 outlines specific rules for determining proper venue in civil actions, often based on where the cause of action arose, where a transaction or occurrence took place, or where a party resides or conducts business. Granting the plaintiff the unilateral right to choose any venue contradicts these rules and could allow for forum shopping, potentially violating the defendant's right to a fair trial in a proper jurisdiction.",

If the amount of such charge exceeds the maximum permitted by law, such charge shall be reduced to such maximum.",

This charge shall apply regardless of any usury laws.",
                "explanation": "This change sets a late payment charge significantly higher than potentially permissible under Pennsylvania usury laws and explicitly states it applies regardless of such laws. This creates a direct contradiction.",

                "law_explanation": "41 P.S. ยง 201 sets limits on the interest rates that can be charged for loans and other financial transactions in Pennsylvania. By setting a rate that could exceed these limits and stating that usury laws don't apply, the modified text directly contradicts Pennsylvania law, rendering that portion of the contract potentially unenforceable. The specific rate that is legal will depend on the specific type of transaction and is beyond the scope of this answer, however a 25% surcharge is likely usurious."

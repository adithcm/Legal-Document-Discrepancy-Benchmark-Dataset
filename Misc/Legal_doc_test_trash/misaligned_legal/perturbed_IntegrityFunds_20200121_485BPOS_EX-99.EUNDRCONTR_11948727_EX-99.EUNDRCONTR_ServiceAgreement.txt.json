Integrity will act only on its own behalf as principal should it choose to enter into selling agreements with selected dealers or others.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.6 Integrity shall be deemed to be an employee and, except as specifically provided or authorized herein, shall have no authority to act for or represent the Fund. Integrity will act only on its own behalf as principal should it choose to enter into selling agreements with selected dealers or others.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractor' to 'employee' creates a conflict. The contract later treats Integrity as an independent entity, managing its own expenses and activities. Designating them as an 'employee' can blur the lines of liability and control, conflicting with the intended operational framework.",

Factors such as control over work, financial investment, and the relationship of the parties are considered. This modification contradicts these established criteria by classifying Integrity as an 'employee' while simultaneously granting them independent control over their operations, potentially leading to misclassification under tax law.",

While parties are generally free to choose the law governing their contract, a court may not enforce the chosen law if it violates a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue. Here, using Chinese law to govern the contract between two US entities could violate fundamental US securities and investment regulations, making the choice-of-law clause unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Sweden.",
                "explanation": "The contract originally states that the laws of Japan govern it. Changing this to Sweden introduces a conflict because Veoneer AB is a Swedish corporation, while Nissin Kogyo Co., Ltd. is a Japanese corporation. Choosing Sweden over Japan could be contested, creating uncertainty about which jurisdiction's laws apply. There is a chance the choice of law has been negotiated but the fact that Nissin is a Japanese company that is also a key party here makes it a less clear cut decision.",

                "law_explanation": "While party autonomy allows contract parties to choose the governing law, this choice is usually made considering the connection to the parties and the transaction. Changing the governing law to Sweden, when a key party (Nissin) is Japanese and the original agreement specified Japanese law, could be challenged as an unreasonable or bad-faith choice, particularly if the dispute resolution process is also altered.",

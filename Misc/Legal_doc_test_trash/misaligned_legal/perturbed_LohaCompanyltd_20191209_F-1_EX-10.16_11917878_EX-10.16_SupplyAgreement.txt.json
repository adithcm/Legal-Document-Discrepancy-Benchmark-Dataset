                "original_text": "The Sellers shall not be held responsible for the delay in shipment or non-delivery, of the goods due to Force Majeure, which might occur during the process of manufacturing or in the course of loading or transit. The Sellers shall advise the Buyers immediately of the occurrence mentioned above and within fourteen days thereafter, the Sellers shall send by airmail to the Buyers a certificate of the accident issued by the competent government authorities, Chamber of Commerce or registered notary public of the place where the accident occurs as evidence thereof.",
                "changed_text": "The Sellers shall not be held responsible for the delay in shipment or non-delivery, of the goods due to Force Majeure, which might occur during the process of manufacturing or in the course of loading or transit. The Sellers are only required to notify the buyers of the occurrence mentioned above within a reasonable time frame, if practical. The form of notification is at the sellerâ€™s discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires specific actions (immediate advice and airmail certificate within 14 days) for Force Majeure. The modified text makes the notification requirement vague and discretionary, conflicting with standard interpretations of Force Majeure clauses.",

                "law_explanation": "Article 79 of the CISG outlines the requirements for a party to be excused from performance due to an impediment beyond their control (Force Majeure). While it does not explicitly dictate the form or timing of notification, generally accepted principles of good faith and commercial reasonableness, implied within the CISG, suggest that notification should be prompt and adequate. The modified text contradicts this implied requirement by allowing for potentially delayed and discretionary notification, which could prejudice the buyer's ability to mitigate damages.",

In case no settlement can be reached, either party *may* unilaterally choose to litigate in a court of their choosing, regardless of jurisdiction.",

                "law_explanation": "Article 4 of the China Arbitration Law states that if parties have reached an arbitration agreement, they should apply for arbitration and cannot sue in a people's court. The modified clause directly contradicts this by allowing either party to unilaterally choose litigation despite the agreement to arbitrate, potentially rendering the arbitration agreement unenforceable in China.",

The letter of credit should state that partial shipments are allowed. The Buyer's agent agrees to pay for the goods in accordance with the actual amount of the goods shipped. 80% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.1. The remaining 20% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.2. The Letter of Credit shall be valid until 90 days after the latest shipment is effected.",

The seller will accept whatever letter of credit terms the buyer provides, or will not be paid.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates the terms of the Letter of Credit (irrevocable, 100% value, etc.). The modified text gives the buyer complete discretion over the letter of credit terms, which renders the payment terms extremely vague and contradicts basic principles of contract certainty.",

                "law_explanation": "While UCC Article 5 doesn't prescribe the exact terms of a letter of credit, it does require that the terms be clear and definite. The modified text introduces so much uncertainty regarding the letter of credit's amount and terms that it becomes unenforceable, as it doesn't provide a clear basis for determining the obligations of the parties involved. It contradicts the implied requirement of certainty and good faith in commercial transactions governed by the UCC. Additionally, this creates conditions that can be seen as an unfair trade practice.",

                    "explanation": "By removing the 'ordinary wear and tear excepted' clause and the mandate to provide an itemized list within 30 days, the contract becomes more favorable to the landlord and removes consumer protections.",

It also only allows deductions for damage beyond normal wear and tear. This modification contradicts this law by removing the requirement to provide an itemized list and by not explicitly accounting for normal wear and tear.",

By stating the landlord will 'attempt' to maintain, and by removing the explicit requirement to comply with health and safety codes, the contract weakens the tenant's right to a habitable living environment and contradicts this implied warranty.",

                    "explanation": "Removing the requirement for written notice and an opportunity to cure a breach violates tenant protection laws by allowing immediate eviction, which may not be legal in California.",

By eliminating the requirement to provide a written notice to cure, the modified clause contradicts this legal requirement and allows for potentially illegal evictions.",

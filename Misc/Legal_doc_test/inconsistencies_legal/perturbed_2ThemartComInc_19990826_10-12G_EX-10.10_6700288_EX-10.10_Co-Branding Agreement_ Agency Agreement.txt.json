Once every twelve (12) months, 2TheMart through a CPA may inspect and audit such records to verify reports. Any such inspection will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with i-Escrow's business activities and with no less than fifteen (15) days notice. i-Escrow shall within two (2) weeks make any overdue payments disclosed by the audit.",

                "explanation": "This change reduces the record-keeping period, shortens the audit notice period, and extends the payment deadline after the audit, potentially violating California's requirements for maintaining accurate financial records and timely payments.",

Reducing the record-keeping period to six months may not be sufficient to ensure compliance with this requirement, especially if audits or legal inquiries occur after that period. The reduction in notice for audits and the extended payment period also impede the ability to promptly verify and rectify any payment discrepancies.",

Reducing the notice period to 10 days may violate this covenant, as it might not provide sufficient time for a party to evaluate the agreement's performance, seek legal counsel, and negotiate terms for renewal. This could amount to a lack of good faith in the performance of the agreement.",

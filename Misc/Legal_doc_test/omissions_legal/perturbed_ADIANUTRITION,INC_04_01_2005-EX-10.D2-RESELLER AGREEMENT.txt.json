                "original_text": "Detto shall comply with all laws and regulations applicable to Detto's marketing and distribution of Qwik-Fix Pro hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Detto shall, at its own expense, make, obtain, and maintain in force at all times during the term of this Agreement, all filings, registrations, licenses, permits and authorizations in North America required for Detto to perform its obligations under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This clause originally mandates compliance with *all* applicable laws and regulations. The modified version significantly weakens this requirement by only mandating compliance with *some* laws. This introduces a legal risk because it's not specifying which laws Detto needs to comply with.",

                "law_explanation": "California Business and Professions Code § 17200 prohibits unfair competition, including unlawful business practices. By weakening the compliance clause, the contract allows for potential violations of this statute, which is a broad consumer protection law.",

You may be required, at AIRSOPURE's sole discretion, to upgrade or remodel Your AIRSOPURE Center to conform to AIRSOPURE's then-current specifications and standards as specified in AIRSOPURE's Operating Manual of otherwise in writing, provided such upgrade or remodel is reasonable in terms of cost and implementation schedule.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'provided such upgrade or remodel is reasonable in terms of cost and implementation schedule,' the franchisee is now vulnerable to unreasonable demands for upgrades. This introduces potential violations of fair franchising practices.",

                "law_explanation": "The modified text removes the constraint that upgrades or remodels must be reasonable in cost and implementation schedule. This contradicts Texas Business & Commerce Code ยง12.003, which implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing. By potentially requiring unreasonable upgrades, the franchisor could be violating this duty.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for 'Comprehensive general liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000.00' weakens the franchisee's insurance obligations. This could be problematic, especially in Texas, where businesses are expected to carry adequate insurance coverage to cover potential liabilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas law requires businesses to carry adequate insurance to protect against liabilities.",

                "law_url": "N/A - General principle; specific requirements vary by industry and activity.",
                "law_explanation": "The omission contradicts the general principle of carrying sufficient liability insurance to cover business risks. While there's no single statute mandating a specific amount for every business, the absence of a defined minimum in the contract creates a situation where the franchisee may be underinsured, potentially violating implicit legal expectations and increasing the risk of legal action against both the franchisee and, potentially, the franchisor. Although not explicitly breaking a specific law, it ignores a key principle of risk management and compliance that is implicit in business regulations.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from Texas to a hypothetical 'Country X' that has weaker consumer protection laws, or does not recognize franchise law, removes protections afforded to the franchisee under Texas law. This is a form of omission because it effectively omits the benefits of Texas law.",

This effectively omits these protections, disadvantaging the franchisee if Country X lacks similar laws.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"shall\" with \"shall endeavor\" introduces ambiguity regarding the Company's obligation to fulfill Distributor's orders. This creates a weaker, less enforceable commitment.",

                "law_explanation": "The UCC requires good faith in output and requirement contracts. Changing \"shall sell\" to \"shall endeavor to sell\" weakens the obligation and introduces uncertainty that might conflict with the UCC's implied duty of good faith in fulfilling reasonable orders, especially if the distributor relies on the supply for its exclusive territory.",

                "original_text": "Company will carry a reasonable amount of product liability insurance through a reasonably acceptable products liability insurance company and will name the Distributor as an additional insured under that policy. Company will make reasonable efforts to procure a policy, which is non-cancelable, except upon thirty (30) days, advance notice to the Distributor.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"will carry\" to \"may carry\", \"reasonably acceptable products liability insurance company\" to \"as it deems necessary\" and \"will make reasonable efforts\" to 'attempt' significantly weakens the obligation to carry product liability insurance and provide proper notice. It creates multiple ambiguities and loopholes as to the type and provision of the insurance.",

By weakening the insurance requirement, the company may not have sufficient coverage to meet its obligations under the Act, leaving the distributor vulnerable and potentially contradicting the Act's intent to ensure compensation for damages caused by defective products.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"shall use\" to \"may use\" makes the use of samples discretionary rather than obligatory. The statement \"Whether the Samples purchased by Distributor hereunder count toward the minimum expectations will be determined at a later date.\" introduces uncertainty, about whether samples contribute towards minimum purchase requirements. This introduces ambiguity about the responsibilities of the distributer.",

                "law_explanation": "While not a direct contradiction, diminishing the Distributor's obligation to promote sales with Samples can be seen as undermining the spirit of the Illinois Sales Representative Act, which seeks to protect sales representatives' (in this case, distributors) rights to compensation based on their efforts to sell products. Ambiguity about minimum expectations can lead to disputes over whether the distributor is meeting its obligations.",

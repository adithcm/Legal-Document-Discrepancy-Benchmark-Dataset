                "original_text": "\"Trade Secrets\" means all information, in any form or medium, to the extent that the owner thereof has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret and the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, the public.",
                "changed_text": "\"Trade Secrets\" means any business information that is kept within the company, regardless of whether measures are taken to protect its secrecy or if it derives economic value from being secret. The Trade Secret may be generally known.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Trade Secrets' aligns with the standard legal definition requiring reasonable measures for secrecy and deriving economic value from being secret. The modified definition removes these critical requirements, stating that a 'Trade Secret' may be generally known and doesn't need protective measures. This contradicts the established legal understanding of trade secrets.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA)",

                "law_explanation": "The DTSA defines 'trade secret' partly as 'information the owner thereof has taken reasonable measures to keep secret' and that 'derives independent economic value...from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, another person who can obtain economic value from the disclosure or use of the information'. The modified definition directly contradicts this by stating the Trade Secret may be generally known and that protective measures are not needed, which fails to meet the legal requirements for trade secret protection under the DTSA.",

                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as of the Distribution Date, Nuance hereby grants to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing, terminable at will, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license under the Nuance Patents, without regard to the coverage of the Nuance Patents, to make some products or services of the SpinCo Business.",
                "explanation": "This modification drastically alters the nature of the license granted. It changes the license from 'fully paid-up, perpetual and irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable' to 'royalty-bearing, terminable at will, non-transferable, non-sublicensable' and removes the condition that the patents must cover the products or services. This creates uncertainty and directly contradicts the original intent of providing a strong, ongoing license, undermining the value and enforceability of the agreement.",

                "law_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/consideration",
                "law_explanation": "By changing the license to 'royalty-bearing' and 'terminable at will,' the agreement introduces a lack of mutuality. Consideration is a fundamental aspect of contract law, requiring that both parties receive something of value. A license terminable at will with royalty requirements may be deemed as lacking consideration, if the licensor can terminate at any time and still demand payment for the period up to termination. The phrase 'without regard to the coverage of the Nuance Patents, to make some products or services of the SpinCo Business' also adds to the uncertainty. This shifts the risk heavily to SpinCo, making the promise of a license illusory and potentially rendering the agreement unenforceable due to lack of mutuality of obligation and certainty of terms.",

                "explanation": "The original definition provides a comprehensive description of 'Software', including its forms, documentation, and explicitly excluding 'Data'. The modified definition is vague and contradictory. It uses 'some' instead of 'any and all', removes the requirement for documentation, and states that 'Software may include data', directly contradicting the original exclusion.

                "law_explanation": "Under U.S. Copyright Law (17 U.S. Code ยง 102), copyright protection extends to 'original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression'. The original definition implicitly acknowledges this by defining 'Software' in a way that implies a tangible, documented form. The modified definition removes the requirement for documentation and introduces uncertainty about its form, which could imply that undocumented or intangible software is covered. This creates a conflict, as copyright law requires a fixed form for protection. Moreover, the added phrase `Software may include data` contradicts the existing legal understanding that treats software and data as distinct types of work, where software contains instructions and data contains information to be processed by the instructions.",

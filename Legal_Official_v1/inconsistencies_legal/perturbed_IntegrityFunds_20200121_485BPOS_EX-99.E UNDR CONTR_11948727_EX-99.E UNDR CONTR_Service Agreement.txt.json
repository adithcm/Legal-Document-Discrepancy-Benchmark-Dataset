While technically Integrity still has 30-day notice, reducing the fund's termination notice to 15 days creates an imbalance that might be considered unreasonable and detrimental to the fund's shareholders, potentially conflicting with the spirit of the law requiring fair termination terms. The modification introduces a non-compliance by making the fund's termination terms significantly shorter than the legal standard implies for protecting investor interests.",

Although this contract does not explicitly fall under the UCC, the principle of good faith is widely applied in contract law. Reducing the notification period to two days for indemnification claims could be seen as acting in bad faith, as it unreasonably restricts the Fund's ability to investigate the claim and prepare a defense. This unreasonably short timeframe impedes the Fund's ability to exercise its rights under the indemnification agreement, potentially voiding the clause under the principle of good faith.",

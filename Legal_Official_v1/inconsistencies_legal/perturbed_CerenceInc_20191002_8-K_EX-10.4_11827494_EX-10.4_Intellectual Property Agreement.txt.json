Additionally, FRCP 5(b)(2)(C) states that service by mail is complete upon mailing; the perturbation delays this to 30 days.",

This choice of venue shall apply regardless of any statutory right to transfer venue based on convenience or the location of witnesses.",

By stating that the choice of venue applies regardless of any statutory right to transfer venue, the modified text directly attempts to contract around this federal law, which is generally not permissible.",

Neither party will be held liable for unintentional violations.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'use reasonable efforts to comply' weakens the obligation, potentially conflicting with strict liability aspects of export control laws like the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and Export Administration Regulations (EAR).

                "law_explanation": "The AECA and its implementing regulations (ITAR) impose strict liability for certain export control violations. The original text mandates compliance. The modified text allows for 'reasonable efforts' and absolves parties of liability for 'unintentional violations', which directly contradicts the AECA's strict liability framework, where intent is not always a factor in determining a violation. Thus, one cannot contract out of this liability using only the language of reasonable effort.",

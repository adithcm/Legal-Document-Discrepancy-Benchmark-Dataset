Filings will be considered timely if submitted within 30 days of the regulatory deadline.",
                "explanation": "Adding a clause stating that filings are timely if submitted within 30 days of the deadline directly contradicts SEC regulations that require filings to be made by specific deadlines.",

Stating that filings are timely if submitted within 30 days of the deadline directly violates these requirements, which mandate adherence to the SEC's prescribed deadlines.",

                "law_explanation": "Rule 13d-2 specifies the requirements for filing amendments to Schedule 13D or 13G.

                "explanation": "Changing the date to a future date five years later than the signature date invalidates the agreement because the agreement is for filing activities around March 27, 2020. It is nonsensical to agree to do something 5 years later, so filing now would be against this agreement. This is because an agreement should be valid and have a present time to take effect. If the filing occurred around March 27, 2020, and the agreement is dated to occur in 2025, then this would contradict the purpose of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as this agreement covers the reporting of securities.",

                "law_explanation": "Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the disclosure of information by certain beneficial owners of securities. The altered date creates an agreement that is temporally inconsistent and therefore ineffective for the reporting requirements around March 2020, undermining the immediate disclosure mandate of the Act.",

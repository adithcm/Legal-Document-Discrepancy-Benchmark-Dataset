                "original_text": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 10 days' written notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 10 days may conflict with the Investment Company Act of 1940, which implies a reasonable notice period for terminating agreements to protect the interests of the Trust and its shareholders. Ten days might be deemed unreasonably short.",

While this agreement isn't strictly an investment advisory contract, the oversight, administrative, and management services provided by the Sponsor are closely related. A 10-day notice period may be deemed insufficient to protect the interests of the Trust and its shareholders, potentially conflicting with the spirit and intent of the Act, especially regarding proper oversight and administration.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment frequency from monthly to quarterly could create issues under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. This section implies that fees should be paid with reasonable frequency, and paying only quarterly might be seen as obscuring the actual costs and thus impacting the Trustees' ability to evaluate the fairness of the compensation adequately and in a timely manner.",

                "law_explanation": "Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that the compensation paid to an investment adviser (Domini, in this case) must be reasonable. While the act doesn't explicitly mandate a specific payment frequency, paying fees quarterly rather than monthly could be viewed as an attempt to obscure the actual cost. This makes it more difficult for the trustees to adequately monitor the fees and ensure they are reasonable and consistent with the fiduciary duty owed to the fund shareholders.",

                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall only be responsible for the overall appearance of regulatory compliance. The Sponsor shall not be responsible for actual regulatory compliance.",
                "explanation": "Stating the sponsor is only responsible for the appearance of regulatory compliance directly contradicts the spirit and requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which requires that investment companies and their sponsors have comprehensive and effective compliance programs. This modification removes actual regulatory compliance which is against the law.",

                "law_explanation": "Rule 38a-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 requires registered investment companies (like the Trust) and their investment advisers to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the federal securities laws. The changed text, stating the Sponsor is only responsible for the 'overall appearance of regulatory compliance,' directly undermines this requirement by suggesting that actual compliance is not the Sponsor's responsibility. This creates a conflict because it effectively nullifies the obligation to have effective compliance programs as mandated by the rule.",

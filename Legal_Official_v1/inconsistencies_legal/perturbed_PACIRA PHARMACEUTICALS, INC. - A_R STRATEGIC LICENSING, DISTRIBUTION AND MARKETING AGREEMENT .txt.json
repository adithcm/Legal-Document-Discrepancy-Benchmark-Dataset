                "explanation": "Increasing the timeframe for FDA notification to 30 days from the original 5 days introduces a delay that could potentially conflict with regulatory expectations for prompt notification.",

                "law_explanation": "While 21 CFR § 314.72 doesn't specify an exact timeframe for notifying the FDA of NDA transfer, waiting 30 days might be considered a delay that could cause regulatory concern about the promptness of the notification. The FDA wants information in a timely manner, and a delay could cause them to believe there is a serious problem with the NDA.",

                "explanation": "Changing the royalty payment deadline from 45 to 90 days increases the time before payment, which can create issues with compliance depending on the specifics of generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP) and potential tax implications related to revenue recognition.",

                "law_explanation": "26 U.S. Code § 451 deals with the general rule for taxable year of inclusion and if the contract shifts the payment schedule so significantly that it defers income recognition beyond what is permissible under IRS regulations and GAAP, there would be a conflict with federal tax law.",

                "law_explanation": "California Insurance Code § 678 requires insurers to provide a minimum number of days' notice for cancellation or nonrenewal of a policy, which is typically more than 5 days. By mandating only 5 days' notice in the contract, Pacira is asking to be alerted in a way that could conflict with mandated California insurance law.",

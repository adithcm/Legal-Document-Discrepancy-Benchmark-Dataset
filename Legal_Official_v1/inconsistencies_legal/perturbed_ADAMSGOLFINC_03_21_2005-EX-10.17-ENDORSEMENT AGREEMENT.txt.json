                "original_text": "ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within ninety (90) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.",
                "changed_text": "ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within thirty (30) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination window to 30 days could be problematic if internal investigations or legal reviews reasonably require more time, potentially conflicting with 'reasonable time' standards in employment law for investigations, especially in cases of misconduct or ethical violations. This is because some investigations take time and reducing this to 30 days could cause the employer to miss their window to terminate.",
                "contradicted_law": "Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964",

                ],
                "law_explanation": "Title VII requires that a charge of discrimination be filed with the EEOC within 180 days of the alleged violation or within 300 days if the state or local agency has authority to grant or seek relief. While this relates to filing a charge, a 30-day window for an employer to act after becoming aware of conduct may be deemed unreasonably short, especially if the conduct is related to potential discrimination, and could potentially be seen as retaliatory if the investigation is not properly conducted due to time constraints. Although not directly conflicting, it can create a fact pattern that leads to litigation.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the approval response time to one business day for advertising materials may not allow sufficient time for proper review, especially if legal or brand compliance checks are needed. This can create risks, potentially violating advertising regulations.",

                "law_explanation": "The FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce. If Adams Golf were to use advertising material that is deceptive or misleading because the consultant didn't have enough time to review the material due to the one-day constraint, it could be argued that Adams Golf violated the FTC Act.",

                "changed_text": "Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall forfeit all compensation earned prior to the date of termination, and shall have no further claim against ADAMS GOLF.",
                "explanation": "Forcing forfeiture of earned compensation upon termination, regardless of the reason, violates wage and hour laws that mandate payment for work already performed. This is because in most jurisdictions an employer is required to pay an employee for services rendered.",
                "contradicted_law": "Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)",

                "law_explanation": "The FLSA requires employers to pay employees the minimum wage for all hours worked. Forfeiting already earned compensation violates this principle as it effectively denies payment for work that has already been completed. While this agreement is for an endorsement, the idea that someone could forfeit compensation for work they have already done is illegal.",

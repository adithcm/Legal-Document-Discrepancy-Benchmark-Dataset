What constitutes a 'reasonable time' to provide such assurance depends on the circumstances, but two days is likely too short to be considered reasonable in many commercial contexts.",

                "law_explanation": "The Illinois Interest Act limits the rate of interest that can be charged on written contracts. While the specific limit varies depending on the context, a 10% monthly interest rate (120% annually) is likely to exceed permissible limits and be considered usurious, especially if Buyer is not a large business entity. The late fee must be comparable to the market value, thus this contractual obligation would violate usury laws in Illinois.",

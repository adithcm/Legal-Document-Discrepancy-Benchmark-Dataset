                "explanation": "Reducing the payment period to 10 days could be considered an unreasonable timeframe, especially given the context of financial hardship that leads to solvency issues. This could contradict regulations requiring fair and reasonable practices by financial institutions.",

This conflicts with UCC § 9-406(d) which generally invalidates contractual terms that restrict the assignment of accounts or payment intangibles, preventing parties from unduly restricting the transfer of contractual rights.",

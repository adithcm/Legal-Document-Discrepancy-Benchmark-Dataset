                "law_explanation": "The Illinois Prompt Payment Act generally requires state agencies to pay contractors within 30 days of receiving a proper bill. While this contract is between private parties, extending payment terms to 60 days could be seen as an attempt to circumvent the spirit of prompt payment, especially if the distributor is working on projects ultimately involving state funds or entities.",

If the product has an implied warranty of merchantability beyond 6 months, a shorter express warranty might be deemed unconscionable or deceptive, potentially voiding the express warranty altogether and leaving the company liable for the implied warranty period.",

The reasonableness of such a restriction depends on the specific circumstances and the nature of the IP involved.",

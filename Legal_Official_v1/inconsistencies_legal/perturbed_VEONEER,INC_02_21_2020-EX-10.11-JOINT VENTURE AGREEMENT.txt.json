Changing the governing law to Delaware can create a conflict with the principles of party autonomy and the reasonable expectations of the parties under Japanese Law.",

The modified text attempts to release parties from liability for breaches that occurred *before* the termination, directly contradicting the principle that a party is liable for damages resulting from their failure to perform contractual obligations, potentially rendering this clause unenforceable under Japanese law.",

                "explanation": "Making the amendment immediately effective regardless of the SPA's termination and the closings contradicts the original intent, which was for the amendment to be contingent on those specific events. This could create legal uncertainty and conflict with laws governing contract formation and conditions precedent, especially if the SPA's termination implies a lack of consideration for the amendment.",

                "law_explanation": "Article 127 of the Japanese Civil Code outlines the effect of conditions precedent on the validity of juridical acts (contracts). By removing the condition precedent (VNBJ and VNBZ closings), and making the amendment effective regardless of the SPAsâ€™ termination, the modified text creates a potentially invalid agreement where the underlying basis for the agreement (the closings) no longer exists. This contradicts the principle that a contract is void if a condition precedent is not met, potentially making the amendment unenforceable.",

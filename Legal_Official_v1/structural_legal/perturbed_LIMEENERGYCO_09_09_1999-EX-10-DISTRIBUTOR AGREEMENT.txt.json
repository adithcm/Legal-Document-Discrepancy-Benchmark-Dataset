Company further warrants that the Products sold hereunder shall be free from defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period of twenty-four (24) months after delivery to Distributor's end-user. The Company shall not be liable for defective Products, except as provided in this Agreement. The Distributor at all times shall comply with all requirements of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act and similar federal and state laws and regulations.",

The Company shall not be liable for defective Products, except as provided in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The clause requiring the Distributor to comply with the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act has been removed from the warranty section. This could lead to the distributor not being aware of their obligations under the Act and thus non-compliance. The altered text suggests Company makes no requirements of the distributor, potentially limiting the distributors liability.",

                "law_explanation": "15 U.S. Code ยง 2302 stipulates the rules regarding disclosure of warranty terms, and by removing the explicit statement that the Distributor must comply with it and relevant regulations within the warranty section, the contract makes it less clear that the distributor has obligations under this Act. This lack of clarity makes the disclosure not conspicuous, which could be viewed as a violation of the Act. There are requirements of clear disclosure and duties.",

Neither party is granted any express or implied right of authority by the other party to assume or to create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of or in the name of the other party, or to bind the other party in any manner or thing whatsoever. 6.9 Governing Law. This Agreement is to be construed according to the laws of the State of Illinois.",
                "explanation": "The governing law clause has been moved to section 1.7. This is where relationship of parties is defined, making it ambiguous. This weakens its prominence.

This could make it more difficult to enforce the contract according to Illinois law. The law provides the ability for cases to be heard in specific places. This should be easily accessible for parties reading the contract.",

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY i-on will not be liable under any circumstances for any lost profits or other consequential damages, even if i-on has been advised as to the possibility of such damages. i-on's liability for damages to the Customer for any cause whatsoever, regardless of the form of action, and whether in contract or in tort, including negligence, shall be limited to one (1) month's fees and the remaining portion of any prepaid fees.",
                "explanation": "Moving the limitation of liability clause to the 'Third-Party Software' section makes it less prominent and harder for the customer to find, potentially weakening its enforceability. Consumers might not reasonably expect such a critical clause to be located under a section concerning third-party software, which obscures the clause.",

                "law_explanation": "Florida Statutes § 672.719 allows for contractual modification or limitation of remedy, but such limitations may be unenforceable if unconscionable. Hiding the limitation of liability clause in an unexpected section of the contract could contribute to a finding of unconscionability, because it reduces the likelihood that the customer is aware of the limitation of liability before signing the agreement.",

The provisions of this Agreement relating to indemnification shall survive termination of the Customer's Hosted Site.",

INDEMNIFICATION The Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless i-on, against any lawsuits, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) to which i-on may become subject related to or arising out of Customer's use of i-on's services, and will reimburse i-on for all legal and other expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in connection with investigating, defending, or settling any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action, or proceeding whether or not in connection with pending or threatened litigation in which i-on is a party. The provisions of this Agreement relating to indemnification shall survive termination of the Customer's Hosted Site.",
                "explanation": "Moving the indemnification clause to the 'Miscellaneous' section, which contains boilerplate provisions, minimizes its prominence. Indemnification clauses are significant because they shift potential liability, and their placement should be conspicuous. Hiding such a crucial clause amidst standard boilerplate language reduces its visibility.",

                "law_explanation": "Florida Statute § 725.06 concerns agreements to indemnify contractors; while it doesn't explicitly mandate a particular placement, the statute implies that such agreements should be clear and unambiguous. Placing it in Miscellaneous obscures its importance and makes it less conspicuous which can be challenged as not being clear and unambiguous.",

The Customer acknowledges that data loss is a possibility, even with mirrored computer storage and archival backup of such storage as provided by i-on per this Agreement, and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any such data loss for the Hosted Site, provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss. The Customer shall use i-on's resources in a manner that is clearly consistent with the purposes of the products and services offered. The Customer shall comply with applicable laws, standards, policies, and procedures.",
                "changed_text": "RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CUSTOMER The Customer is responsible for paying i-on the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450. The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site. CONDITIONS OF SERVICE The Customer acknowledges that the Internet is an unreliable, unsecured, and error-prone network and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any interruptions in service to the Hosted Site or inability for users to reach or effectively use the Hosted Site that arises outside the scope of i-on's responsibilities as explicitly described in this Agreement.

                "explanation": "By moving the 'Conditions of Service' to the section about 'Responsibilities of the Customer,' the text creates the illusion that they are not distinct aspects of the contract. A reasonable reader could assume that conditions of service are only the responsibility of the customer, not i-on. This obfuscation makes it harder to determine which responsibilities fall upon each party.",

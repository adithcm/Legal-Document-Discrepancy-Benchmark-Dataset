In this capacity, Bravatek will use its best efforts to provide the following services to COMPANY. 9) Governing Law This Agreement is entered into in the State of Texas and shall be interpreted according to the laws of the State of Texas.",
                "explanation": "Moving the governing law clause to the section describing duties obscures its importance and makes it less likely to be noticed and understood. It now appears to be part of Bravatek's duties rather than a fundamental aspect of the contract.",

                "explanation": "Moving the compensation clause under the modifications clause makes it harder to locate and could be argued as obscuring the intended payment terms. The fee structure being placed under 'modifications' could allow a party to argue that the compensation can be modified at any time.",

In Texas, the absence of a specified price in a contract of sale usually indicates that the price is a reasonable price at the time of delivery. However, if the contract states that the price can be altered as per modification clauses, that could be challenged.",

Information at or after such time that is disclosed to either party by a third party entitled to disclose such information c. Information which is required by law to be disclosed to federal, state or local authorities. 10) Indemnification COMPANY shall indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of COMPANY or breach of COMPANY of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

                "explanation": "Moving the indemnification clause after the confidentiality clause disrupts the logical flow of the contract. Indemnification clauses are crucial for risk allocation.

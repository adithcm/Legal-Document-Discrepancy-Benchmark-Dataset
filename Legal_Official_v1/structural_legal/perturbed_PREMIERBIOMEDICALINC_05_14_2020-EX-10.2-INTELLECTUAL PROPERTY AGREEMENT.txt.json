A contract that lacks a clearly defined venue could be challenged, forcing disputes into these courts even if the parties intended a different forum. The lack of specificity directly increases the likelihood that a claim could be subject to the jurisdiction of magisterial district judges, which might not be appropriate or desired by the contracting parties and is something that might be waived with a clear venue.",

For purposes of this Agreement, confidential information shall include contacts and introductions to third parties and information relating thereto. Confidential information, knowledge or data of a Party and/or its affiliates shall not include any information which is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by such Party or its representatives.

While no statute directly addresses this, established common law principles hold that contractual terms, especially those involving financial obligations, must be presented in a way that a reasonable person would notice and understand them. By moving the expense reimbursement clause to a section discussing the extent of service, it loses prominence and might not be readily noticed by a party reviewing the contract. This lack of conspicuousness could render the clause less enforceable, as a court might find that it was not fairly presented to the obligated party.",

By burying the arbitration clause after the confidentiality clause, and shifting the numerical order, it is less likely to be considered to have been explicitly brought to the attention of the other party, especially if this contract will be applied to international sales contracts under the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. This makes it difficult to enforce.",

By shifting the law of application higher into the general provisions, it makes it less likely for parties to understand which law takes precedence. This is especially true if it is meant to fall under the jurisdiction of the CISG. The court will have to resolve which law applies.",

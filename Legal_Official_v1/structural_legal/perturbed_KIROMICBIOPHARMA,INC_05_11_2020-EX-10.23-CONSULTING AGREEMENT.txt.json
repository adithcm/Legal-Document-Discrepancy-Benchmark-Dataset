Please note that because of employer regulations adopted in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, within three (3) business days of starting your new position you will need to present documentation demonstrating that you have authorization to work in the United States.

                "explanation": "By placing the arbitration agreement within the section discussing background checks and authorization to work, it becomes less conspicuous and may not be readily noticed by the consultant.

While it doesn't explicitly mandate a specific section, moving it to an unrelated section like 'Background Check and Authorization to Work' could be argued as obscuring the clause, potentially weakening its enforceability under general contract law principles of conspicuousness and reasonable notice. Moving it causes it to become hidden or obfuscated and could lead to the arbitration agreement not being upheld.",

                "explanation": "By placing the compensation section after the 'Counterparts' clause and before the 'Entire Agreement' section, it is separated from the 'Services' section, where it logically belongs.

                "explanation": "By placing the 'No Debarment' clause after the 'General' section, the specific warranties related to debarment are separated from other related representations and warranties.

                "law_explanation": "While 21 U.S.C. ยง 335a itself doesn't prescribe where a 'no debarment' clause should be placed in a contract, regulations and guidance surrounding FDA-regulated activities often emphasize the importance of due diligence and ensuring compliance with debarment provisions. Hiding the 'No Debarment' clause in the General section implies a lack of emphasis and could potentially be interpreted as insufficient due diligence, even if the clause exists, which might create enforcement challenges should a debarment issue arise. Placing this after general language makes the purpose of this clause less direct to all parties in the event of legal action, due to its placement.",

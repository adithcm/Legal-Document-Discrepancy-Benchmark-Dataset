ARBITRATION In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Venue shall be Kansas. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction.",

SIGNIFICANCE OF HEADINGS Section headings contained herein are solely for the purpose of aiding in speedy location of subject matter and are not in any sense to be given weight in the construction of this Agreement. Accordingly, in case of any question with respect to the construction of this Agreement, it is to be construed as though such section headings had been omitted. 33. ARBITRATION In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators.

                "explanation": "By placing the arbitration clause within the section regarding headings, it diminishes its prominence and makes it less likely that a party will recognize its importance. This could be seen as burying the clause in an irrelevant section.",

                "law_explanation": "The Federal Arbitration Act favors arbitration agreements but requires clear and unmistakable assent. Placing the arbitration clause under 'Significance of Headings' obscures its importance, potentially undermining clear assent and enforceability, as it is not readily apparent to the parties signing the agreement. The placement creates ambiguity.",

CONFIDENTIALITY Both parties understand that the contents of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, all amounts paid or to be paid and any additional consideration, are extremely confidential, and that disclosure of same to any third party could be detrimental to the interests of one or both parties. Therefore, both parties agree not to disclose the terms of this Agreement, without the permission of the other party, to any third party other than to CONSULTANT'S business, legal and financial advisors, and with respect to all such advisors, CONSULTANT shall take all reasonable steps to ensure such confidentiality to ADAMS GOLF. Furthermore, CONSULTANT recognizes that during the course of performing his duties hereunder he may become aware of proprietary, confidential information concerning ADAMS GOLF, its PRODUCT, methods, processes, billing practices, financial condition, etc., or information ADAMS GOLF designates as confidential (collectively \"Confidential Information\"). CONSULTANT agrees that he will maintain in confidence and not disclose to any third party at any time any such Confidential Information and shall not use any such information to the detriment of ADAMS GOLF or for any purpose not contemplated by the Agreement. 25. APPLICABLE LAW This Agreement shall be governed and construed according to the laws of the State of Kansas.",
                "explanation": "Moving the 'Applicable Law' clause to be within the confidentiality section reduces its immediate visibility and prominence. While still present, it's less likely to be noticed, which is a core concept with structural flaws. A party may assume the contract is under a different jurisdiction's laws.",

CONSULTANT will be required to be available after a tournament for selected interviews, either the Sunday afternoon or Monday morning following the tournament. In all such interviews and appearances, CONSULTANT will use his best efforts to make reference to the ADAMS GOLF PRODUCT and wear [*****] and display ADAMS GOLF'S brand name. 12. BEHAVIOR During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT will conduct himself at all times with due regard to public morals and conventions.

                "explanation": "By embedding the morals clause within the section concerning promotional appearances, the clause is more likely to be overlooked and its implications misunderstood. It's a less intuitive placement than a dedicated section on 'Termination' or 'General Conduct'.",

Embedding this clause in a seemingly unrelated section creates uncertainty regarding its intended application. This obscures the clause's significance, potentially making it harder to enforce.",

No delay or failure by the Franchisor or Franchisee to exercise any right under this Agreement, and no partial or single exercise of that right, shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right provided herein, and no waiver of any violation of any terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any succeeding violation of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. 3.

While there are exceptions, the courts require strict interpretation and clear, conspicuous language regarding the remedies for breach, including injunctive relief. By burying the injunctive relief clause within less relevant clauses, the contract diminishes the clarity and enforceability of the non-compete aspect, potentially conflicting with how California courts interpret such agreements.",

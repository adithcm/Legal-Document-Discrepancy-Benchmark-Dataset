The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.

This Agreement shall be construed and enforced and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without reference to principles of conflicts of law. The captions in this Agreement are included for convenience only and in no way define or delimit any of the provisions hereof or otherwise affect their construction or effect. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but such counterparts shall, together, constitute only one instrument. The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.

                "explanation": "Moving the liability limitation clause to the 'Miscellaneous' section buries it, making it less prominent and potentially harder for a party to readily find and understand their rights and responsibilities regarding liability. This may affect the enforceability of the clause as it is not clearly presented in a section dedicated to liability or related topics.",

                "explanation": "The clause on 'Duration, Termination, and Amendments' has been moved to become part of the section detailing the 'Duties of the Sponsor'. This makes it less prominent and difficult to find quickly when looking for information on how the agreement can be terminated or amended. It also interrupts the reasonable flow of information describing Sponsor duties. This change impacts clarity, potentially leading to disputes over termination rights or amendment procedures.",

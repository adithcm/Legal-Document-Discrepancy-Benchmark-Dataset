THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS TRANSACTION, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS.

                "explanation": "By adding 'THESE PROVISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO EXCEPTIONS AS DEFINED IN EXHIBIT Z,' the waiver of jury trial is weakened. This creates ambiguity about whether the right to a jury trial is truly waived and contradicts its all-encompassing intention.",

                "law_explanation": "The modification introduces an ambiguity that undermines the clarity and enforceability of the jury trial waiver. By stating that the provisions are 'subject to exceptions as defined in EXHIBIT Z,' it creates uncertainty about the scope of the waiver and could potentially allow a party to argue that their claim falls within one of the exceptions, thereby preserving their right to a jury trial, contrary to the original intention of the waiver. According to the 7th Amendment, jury trials have to be 'preserved', this modification undermines this amendment.",

Requiring notification solely via carrier pigeon, a method known for its unreliability and impracticality in modern business, is unreasonable and frustrates the purpose of the notification clause. The covenant of good faith requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in the performance and enforcement of their contracts, and this change undermines that principle.",

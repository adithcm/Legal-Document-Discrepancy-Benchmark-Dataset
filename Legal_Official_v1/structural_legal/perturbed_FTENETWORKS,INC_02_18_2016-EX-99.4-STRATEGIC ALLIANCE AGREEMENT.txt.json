It is mandatory that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the breach thereof shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Texas and the venue shall be exclusively in Collin County, Texas for resolution.",
                "changed_text": "Subcontractor shall obtain at its own cost and expense and maintain the insurance in full force and effect during the term of the Agreement as required herein. A copy of the (i) certificate(s) of insurance and (ii) endorsements, acceptable to EDGE, shall be submitted to EDGE prior to commencement of any Work and renewals or replacements of such certificates shall be so delivered at least 30 days prior to the expiration or termination of each such policy. A copy of the insurance policies shall promptly be made available to EDGE upon EDGE' request. Subcontractor expressly acknowledges while EDGE retains the right to review the insurance provided by Subcontractor and' Lower-tier Subcontractors, EDGE is not obligated to perform such review. In addition, EDGE exercise of such right is for EDGE' benefit alone and shall confer no rights to Subcontractor or to any third party. EDGE's acceptance of or failure to object to the submitted documents does not constitute approval of coverage that is not in compliance with this Agreement or as acceptance or affirmation of the adequacy or applicability of such insurance.\n\nSubcontractor and EDGE shall not be obligated to resolve by arbitration any claim or dispute related to the Agreement. It is mandatory that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the breach thereof shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Texas and the venue shall be exclusively in Collin County, Texas for resolution.",
                "explanation": "The clause mandating jurisdiction and venue in Collin County, Texas, is a crucial legal provision that should be easily located. Moving this provision to the 'Insurance' section makes it less prominent and harder to find, reducing its enforceability.",

                "law_explanation": "This section implies that venue provisions should be clear and conspicuous, which is undermined by embedding them within a paragraph detailing insurance requirements.

                "explanation": "By interleaving the 'Notice of Material Defects' clause (originally in section 20) within the 'Suspension of Work' clause (section 12), the clarity and focus of each clause is diminished.

                "law_explanation": "The duty of good faith and fair dealing requires parties to a contract to act honestly and reasonably.

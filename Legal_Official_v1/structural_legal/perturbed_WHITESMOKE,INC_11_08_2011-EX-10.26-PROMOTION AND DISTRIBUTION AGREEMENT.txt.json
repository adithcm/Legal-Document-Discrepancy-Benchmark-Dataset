                "explanation": "Removing the explicit statement that the distributor must comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws weakens the clause.

Civ. Code § 1798.135, which emphasizes transparency and informed consent from consumers regarding data collection and usage. The absence of a clear and upfront invitation to review and agree to the EULA undermines the consumer's ability to make an informed decision about installing software, contradicting the CCPA's core principles of transparency and consumer control over their personal information.",

Consultant shall not, during or subsequent to the term of this Agreement, use any Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever other than the performance of the Services on behalf of Company, or disclose Confidential Information to any third party.",

Consultant may, during or subsequent to the term of this Agreement, use any Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever, even other than the performance of the Services on behalf of Company, and disclose Confidential Information to any third party.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall not' to 'may', the confidentiality clause is fundamentally undermined. The original agreement protects Kiromic, Inc's confidential information by restricting the consultant from using or disclosing it. The change allows the consultant to use and disclose confidential information without restriction, undermining trade secret protections.",

                "law_explanation": "The TUTSA protects trade secrets. By allowing the consultant to use and disclose confidential information, the modified agreement actively contradicts the protections afforded by TUTSA, which provides remedies for misappropriation of trade secrets. This modification renders the confidentiality clause unenforceable and undermines Kiromic, Inc's ability to protect its trade secrets under Texas law.",

                "explanation": "The change replaces 'Consultant' with 'Company', making the Company responsible for reporting the Consultant's income. This creates a contradiction as the Consultant, as an independent contractor, is legally responsible for reporting their own income, not the company they are contracting with.",

However, this is about *reporting* payments, and it doesn't supplant the independent contractor's primary obligation to report their *own* income. By stating the Company is obligated to report the Consultant's income (implying the consultant is absolved of this responsibility), it creates a false impression regarding the Consultant's tax obligations and undermines the contractor's responsibility for self-employment taxes.",

                "explanation": "This clause specifies that Texas law governs the agreement. However, the contract states in the opening paragraph that Kiromic, Inc. is a Delaware corporation. Switching the governing law to Delaware when the operations are in Texas could create confusion about which state's laws apply regarding employment, contracts, and other business-related matters, especially considering the consultant is working in Texas.",

                "law_explanation": "Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 187 outlines the principles for determining which state's law applies when a contract contains a choice-of-law provision. While parties generally have the freedom to choose the governing law, courts may refuse to apply the chosen law if the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties' choice. By stating Delaware law governs when the consultant is operating in Texas and the company's primary activities are in Texas, it contradicts the common understanding and legal principles of choice of law, potentially leading to disputes about which state's laws should apply. (Note that Delaware law *could* apply since the company is incorporated there, but changing it introduces a conflict.)",

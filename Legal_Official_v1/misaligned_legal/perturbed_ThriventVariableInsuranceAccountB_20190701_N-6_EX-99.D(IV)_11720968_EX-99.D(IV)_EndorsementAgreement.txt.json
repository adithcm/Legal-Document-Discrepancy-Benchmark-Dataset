It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash.",

It will be based on what the Board determines is a reasonable contribution. You must make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'may be required' to 'are required' and 'fair share' to 'reasonable contribution' and eliminating 'or by a payment in cash' changes the nature of the assessment and payment of deficiency, creating ambiguity and potentially conflicting with regulations regarding fair and equitable treatment of members. Changing from 'you may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash' to 'you must make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits' contradicts the original clause and potentially the law.",

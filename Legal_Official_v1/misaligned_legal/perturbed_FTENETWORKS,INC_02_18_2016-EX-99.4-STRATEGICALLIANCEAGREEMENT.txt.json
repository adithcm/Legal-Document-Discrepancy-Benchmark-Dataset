The IRS considers the level of control an employer has over a worker as a key factor. By stating that EDGE *may* provide direction, the agreement implies a level of control that is inconsistent with independent contractor status, potentially leading to misclassification under federal tax law.",

Defining 'default' to include disregarding suggestions, advice, or recommendations from public authorities is overly broad and vague.

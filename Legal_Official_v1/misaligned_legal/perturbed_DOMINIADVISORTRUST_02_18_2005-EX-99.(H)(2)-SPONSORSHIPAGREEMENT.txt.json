                "explanation": "The original text specifies a higher threshold of liability (willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence). Changing this to 'simple negligence' lowers the liability standard for the Sponsor, which could conflict with standards required by the Investment Company Act of 1940 regarding fiduciary duties.",

                "law_explanation": "Section 36(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 imposes a fiduciary duty on investment company advisors and sponsors. While it doesn't explicitly define a 'simple negligence' standard, lowering the bar for liability may be viewed as an attempt to circumvent the intended protections for investors and the expected standard of care for those managing investment companies. By lowering the standard, the contract attempts to protect the Sponsor from failures to meet their fiduciary duty.",

                "explanation": "This removes the explicit clause making Domini responsible for the actions of its subcontractors. The original clause aligns with the typical agency law principles, but the modified version directly contradicts it. Investment advisors can't delegate away their fiduciary duties without oversight or responsibility.",

By disclaiming responsibility for subcontractors, Domini attempts to avoid accountability for actions that could harm the Trust, which directly contradicts the implied fiduciary duty under the Act. The advisor cannot simply abdicate responsibility for actions carried out on their behalf.",

The original choice of Massachusetts law is reasonable given the location of the parties (Massachusetts business trust and Massachusetts LLC).

While parties can generally choose their governing law, such a choice cannot override mandatory provisions of US federal law, especially those designed to protect US investors and regulate US-based investment companies. Selecting Chinese law to govern an agreement subject to US federal securities regulations is likely unenforceable to the extent it conflicts with US law and policy. The Investment Company Act of 1940 is federal law; therefore, the agreement cannot choose PRC law.",

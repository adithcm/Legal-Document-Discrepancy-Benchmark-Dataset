The term excludes any other laws, rules, regulations, codes, or guidelines, regardless of their effect in any jurisdiction within the Territory, unless specifically enumerated and agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of 'Applicable Laws' introduces ambiguity by suggesting that not all relevant laws will automatically apply unless explicitly agreed upon.

There is no required form, but the receiving party must acknowledge receipt of the confidential notice.

                "explanation": "The modified definition dramatically broadens the exceptions to confidential information, undermining the enforceability of the confidentiality clause. The original text's reliance on 'written documentation' to prove exceptions is removed, replaced by subjective belief and any means of public disclosure.

Each Party shall maintain, at its own cost, comprehensive product liability insurance, general commercial liability insurance and business interruption insurance at a level which is reasonable and customary taking into account the nature of the Product but which shall have combined limits of not less than $[**] per occurrence.

During the Term, neither Party shall do or omit to do any act, matter or thing which could prejudice or render voidable any such insurance.

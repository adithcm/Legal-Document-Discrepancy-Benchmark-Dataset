                "explanation": "Changing \"independent contractor\" to \"contractor\" and removing the restriction on authority contradicts the standard definition of an independent contractor, who typically operates autonomously and does not have the authority to represent the client. This creates ambiguity as to whether Integrity is an agent of the fund, blurring the lines of responsibility and liability.",

                "law_explanation": "Section 17(e)(1) restricts affiliated persons from acting as an agent. By changing \"independent contractor\" to \"contractor\" and granting Integrity the authority to act for the Fund, this change potentially violates the provisions against self-dealing and conflicts of interest that the Investment Company Act of 1940 seeks to prevent.",

Integrity may allow commissions or concessions to dealers in such amounts as Integrity shall determine from time to time, regardless of what is set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement.",
                "explanation": "By adding that Integrity can act 'on behalf of the fund' and removing the registration statement limitations, this creates ambiguity concerning Integrity's authority and the established commission structure. It introduces the potential for undisclosed or non-uniform commissions, which violates securities regulations requiring transparent fee disclosures.",

                "law_explanation": "Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 requires a registration statement to be in effect. By stating that Integrity can set commissions 'regardless of what is set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement,' this change contradicts the legal requirement for transparency and disclosure of fees associated with the securities offering as stated in the registration statement.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall continue indefinitely, with no need for annual renewal or approval by the Fund's Board of Trustees.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for annual approval by the Board of Trustees contradicts the Investment Company Act of 1940's requirements for ongoing oversight and independent review of agreements that could involve conflicts of interest. Eliminating the automatic termination and renewal process bypasses crucial investor protection mechanisms.",

This change directly violates Section 15(c) because it eliminates the need for annual approval and effectively makes the agreement perpetual, which is not allowed without ongoing oversight and approval.",

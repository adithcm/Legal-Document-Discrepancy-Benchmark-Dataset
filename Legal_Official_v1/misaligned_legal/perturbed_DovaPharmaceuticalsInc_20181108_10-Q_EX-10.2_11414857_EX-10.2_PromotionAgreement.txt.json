                "original_text": "1.27 \"Field\" shall mean the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure and any and all additional indications for which the Product is approved in the Territory.",
                "changed_text": "1.27 \"Field\" shall mean the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. Additional uses for the Product must be pre-approved by the board of directors.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the definition of \"Field\" to restrict additional indications unless pre-approved by the board introduces ambiguity and contradicts the original intent. By saying \"any and all additional indications for which the Product is approved in the Territory,\" this created a specific and encompassing scope for the agreement. By placing a caveat, it creates a conflict of interest.",

                "law_explanation": "By stating that \"additional uses for the Product must be pre-approved by the board of directors\", it implies that other uses are possible or allowed. This could directly contravene FDA regulations regarding approved uses, as it implies that unapproved uses are considered legitimate within the agreement. This contradicts the federal laws around drug marketing and sales, namely 21 U.S. Code § 331, which prohibits the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any drug that is adulterated or misbranded. The new wording implies the drug can be introduced for an unapproved use, or \"off-label\" use, which contradicts the law.",

                "explanation": "Changing the definition of \"Act\" from referring to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to a set of company guidelines introduces a contradiction and misaligns terminology. This creates uncertainty in enforcement and legal compliance.",

                ],
                "law_explanation": "By redefining \"Act\" to mean a set of guidelines used by the company when marketing drugs, the original intention is changed to be vague and undefined. This contradicts the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as this Act outlines specific requirements and regulations. It does not grant companies the ability to self-regulate outside of those rules, or even define the rules internally. Therefore, misinterpreting this definition causes the modification to contradict the law.",

                "explanation": "Modifying \"comply in all respects\" to \"attempt to comply in most respects\" creates a loophole and weakens compliance requirements. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement, as it implies that full compliance is not mandatory.",

                "law_explanation": "By modifying the text to state that Valeant will \"attempt to comply in most respects with Applicable Laws\", Valeant will not be in compliance with certain key tenets of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S. Code § 3729. The FCA imposes liability on persons and companies who defraud governmental programs. By allowing them to merely \"attempt\" compliance, this allows the implication that they do not need to comply with anti-kickback statutes or other laws and programs. This violates the FCA.",

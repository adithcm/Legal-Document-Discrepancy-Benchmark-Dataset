                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Business Day\" relies on legal or executive orders, which aligns with standard legal practice. By changing it to rely on \"internal policy\" in Delaware, it creates ambiguity. If banks are open due to a legal requirement but closed due to internal policy, it is unclear if that counts as a business day. This definition conflicts with established legal interpretations and creates contractual uncertainty.",

The modified definition of 'Business Day' now includes closure days based on internal bank policies, which could be different than legal holidays. This change makes the contract deviate from the default state law regarding business days and creates the potential for disputes about timelines.",

The modified text gives the Company the sole right to determine what is 'unjust', which can override any established legal principles of fairness or equity.

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing the commitment to 'continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week' with the vague term 'generally maintain'. The specific mention of 'reasonable hardware and software maintenance' is replaced with 'occasional maintenance', making it unclear when and how often maintenance can occur. This weakens the service level agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'should endeavor to comply' significantly weakens the obligation.

                "law_explanation": "Chapter 817 of the Florida Statutes outlines various fraudulent practices that are illegal in the state. While this section covers many things, a core idea is that businesses have a legal obligation to conduct themselves in a non-fraudulent manner. By weakening the compliance clause, the contract suggests that compliance is optional. This could be problematic if the customer engages in fraudulent activities on the hosted site. If the customer only 'endeavors' to comply with laws, the ambiguity undermines the original intention to prevent illegal activities, indirectly contradicting the statutes prohibiting fraudulent practices.",

                "original_text": "Subcontractor shall obtain at its own cost and expense and maintain the insurance in full force and effect during the term of the Agreement as required herein. A copy of the (i) certificate(s) of insurance and (ii) endorsements, acceptable to EDGE, shall be submitted to EDGE prior to commencement of any Work and renewals or replacements of such certificates shall be so delivered at least 30 days prior to the expiration or termination of each such policy. A copy of the insurance policies shall promptly be made available to EDGE upon EDGE' request.",
                "changed_text": "Subcontractor shall endeavor to obtain and maintain insurance during the term of the Agreement. A copy of the (i) certificate(s) of insurance and (ii) endorsements, ideally acceptable to EDGE, should be submitted to EDGE prior to commencement of any Work and renewals or replacements of such certificates should be so delivered close to 30 days prior to the expiration or termination of each such policy. A copy of the insurance policies may be made available to EDGE upon request.",
                "explanation": "The changes weaken the obligation to obtain and maintain insurance by using 'endeavor' instead of 'shall.' The phrase 'ideally acceptable' introduces subjectivity, and replacing 'shall' with 'should' makes timely submission of insurance documents non-mandatory. 'May be made available' weakens the requirement to provide insurance policies.",

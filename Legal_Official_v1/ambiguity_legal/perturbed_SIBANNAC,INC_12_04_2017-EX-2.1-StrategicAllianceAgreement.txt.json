                "explanation": "The addition of \"when practical\", \"potentially in writing\", and \"prior to or shortly after\" introduces ambiguity regarding the agreement on sales price. This weakens the obligation to have a clear agreement in writing before the project starts.",

                "law_explanation": "The modified text contradicts the Texas Statute of Frauds which, although typically applying to goods over $500, implies that agreements for the sale of custom-designed products, which are likely to exceed that amount, should be clearly documented in writing. By making the written agreement 'potentially' and the timing of the agreement vague, the modified clause undermines the intent of Texas law to ensure clarity and enforceability in commercial transactions.",

                "law_explanation": "The Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (TUTSA) provides legal remedies for the misappropriation of trade secrets.

                "explanation": "Replacing \"shall indemnify\" with \"may indemnify\" and adding \"arguably arising from the actions of COMPANY or alleged breach of COMPANY of its purported obligations under this Agreement, subject to COMPANY's discretion\" significantly weakens the indemnification clause.

The modified indemnification clause, by making indemnification discretionary and ambiguous, could be interpreted as acting in bad faith if COMPANY arbitrarily refuses to indemnify Bravatek in situations where COMPANY's actions clearly caused harm. This introduces a conflict with the underlying principles of Texas contract law.",

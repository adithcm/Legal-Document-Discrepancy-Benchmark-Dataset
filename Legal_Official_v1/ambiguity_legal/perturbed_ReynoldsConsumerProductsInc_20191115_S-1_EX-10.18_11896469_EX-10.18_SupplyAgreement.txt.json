The original text establishes a clear obligation for the Seller to defend and indemnify, while the modified text makes it discretionary, dependent on the Seller's willingness. Adding \"potential threat\" adds another layer of vagueness to what exactly seller is willing to indemnify against. This introduces vagueness on the liability of seller.",

By changing the standard of care to a subjective \"deems appropriate,\" the modified text weakens the protection of trade secrets. This is because the Receiving Party could argue that even inadequate security measures were deemed appropriate, making it harder to prove misappropriation and thus contradicting the Act's aim to protect trade secrets through reasonable measures.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other, except to the extent that she or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall endeavor to be responsible for the filing of such amendments, and for the perceived completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, but shall not be strictly responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other, except to the extent that she or it has actual knowledge that such information is materially inaccurate.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states responsibility for timely filing and accuracy. The modified text weakens this by using 'endeavor to be responsible' and 'perceived completeness,' making the obligation less definitive and allowing for subjective interpretation. Replacing 'knows or has reason to believe' with 'has actual knowledge' raises the bar for recognizing inaccuracy, potentially shielding parties from liability they would have under the original language. 'Strictly responsible' is also an ambiguity.",

                "law_explanation": "The modification contradicts the spirit and intent of Rule 13d-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires accurate and timely disclosure of beneficial ownership. By introducing ambiguity around the responsibility for accuracy and timeliness, the modified text potentially undermines the regulatory requirement for transparency and full disclosure to investors.",

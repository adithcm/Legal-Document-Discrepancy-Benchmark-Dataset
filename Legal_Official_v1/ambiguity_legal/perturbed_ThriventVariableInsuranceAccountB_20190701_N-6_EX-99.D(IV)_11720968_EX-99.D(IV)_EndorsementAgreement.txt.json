                "original_text": "If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be encouraged to consider an extra payment. The Board of Directors will attempt to determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be vaguely based on each member's supposed share of the deficiency. You might consider making the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or perhaps a payment in cash. If you choose not to make the extra payment within approximately 60 days from when we vaguely notify you of a possible share of the deficiency, the amount may be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at a potentially fluctuating rate per year.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'may be required' with 'may be encouraged to consider', 'will determine' with 'will attempt to determine', and 'will be based on' with 'will be vaguely based on', making the obligation and calculation discretionary and unclear. Using 'supposed share' and 'might consider' introduces uncertainty. Replacing '60 days' with 'approximately 60 days' and adding 'when we vaguely notify' and using 'a potentially fluctuating rate' further undermines the certainty of the repayment terms. This creates ambiguity and allows for arbitrary actions, violating the principle of clear contractual obligations.",

The ambiguities introduced regarding the calculation and timing of extra payments, and the interest rate, create uncertainty that undermines the clarity required by Wisconsin law for enforceable contracts.",

                "changed_text": "Annually, we might attempt to determine our divisible surplus. This contract's theoretical share, if any exists and if we feel like it, could be considered for a dividend. As we do not particularly anticipate this contract contributing to any discernible divisible surplus, it is vaguely expected that potentially no dividends will be credited.",
                "explanation": "The modifications weaken the obligation and introduce ambiguity. Changing 'we will determine' to 'we might attempt to determine', 'will be credited as a dividend' to 'could be considered for a dividend', and adding subjective elements like 'if any exists and if we feel like it', and 'any discernible' allows for discretion. Replacing 'it is not expected' to 'it is vaguely expected' and 'no dividends will be credited' to 'potentially no dividends will be credited' makes the dividend calculation and payout highly uncertain and discretionary, contradicting the principle of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "law_explanation": "The ambiguous phrasing around dividend calculations and payouts contradicts the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Wisconsin Statutes § 631.20. This statute requires insurers to act honestly and fairly in their dealings with policyholders. By introducing uncertainty and discretion into the dividend process, the modified text creates the potential for the insurer to unfairly withhold dividends that should rightfully be credited to the policy, undermining the policyholder's reasonable expectations and the insurer's duty to act in good faith.",

Society membership rights and privileges are generally not transferable or assignable, unless special exceptions are made.",

Replacing 'You may' with 'You might, under certain circumstances, be able to' and adding qualifiers like 'perhaps' and 'but that is not guaranteed' create doubt about the policyholder's right to transfer ownership. Similarly, adding 'generally not transferable or assignable, unless special exceptions are made' introduces uncertainty about the assignment of membership rights, potentially contradicting the policyholder's understanding of their rights.",

The introduction of uncertain qualifications and exceptions regarding transferability obscures the policyholder's rights and creates ambiguity that is not permitted under Wisconsin law.",

                "changed_text": "In order to carry out the intent of the Parties with respect to the recordation of the transfers of any registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP, as applicable, to the extent the ownership thereof has transferred from a member of the Nuance Group to a member of the SpinCo Group, or vice versa, pursuant to the Separation Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, the Parties should consider executing intellectual property assignments in a form similar to that attached as Exhibit A1 (the \"Patent Assignment Agreement\"), Exhibit A2 (the \"Trademark Assignment Agreement\"), Exhibit A3 (the \"Domain Name Assignment Agreement\") and Exhibit A4 (the \"Invention Disclosure Assignment Agreement\") as well as any additional case specific assignments as they may find agreeable (collectively, the \"Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements\") for recordation with the appropriate Governmental Authority.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall execute' to 'should consider executing' weakens the obligation. Replacing 'substantially similar' with 'similar to' introduces ambiguity. Removing 'deemed appropriate or necessary under applicable Laws' and replacing it with 'as they may find agreeable' makes the execution of assignments entirely discretionary, contradicting the need to comply with laws regarding IP transfer.",

                "law_explanation": "Delaware law mandates that corporations have the power to execute and deliver assignments. By making the execution of assignments discretionary, the modified text could be interpreted as allowing the parties to choose not to execute necessary assignments, which undermines the corporation's legal power to properly transfer intellectual property assets as required to effectuate the spin-off, potentially hindering the entire agreement. The original text ensures a valid transfer while the new one suggests that the parties may optionally decide to not fulfill their duties.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party will attempt to not (i) oppose, challenge, petition to cancel, contest or threaten in a significant way, or assist another party in opposing, challenging, petitioning to cancel, contesting or threatening in a significant way, any application or registration by SpinCo or its Affiliates or their respective licensees for any SpinCo IP, (ii) engage in any act, or try not to purposefully omit to perform any act, that impairs or potentially adversely affects the rights of SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group in and to any SpinCo IP or (iii) apply for primary registrations (including federal, state and national registrations) with respect to the SpinCo IP.",
                "explanation": "Introducing 'attempt to not' and 'try not to purposefully omit' weakens the commitment and creates ambiguity. Adding 'significant way' introduces a subjective standard for what constitutes opposition or threats. Changing 'impairs or adversely affects' to 'impairs or potentially adversely affects' introduces uncertainty. Limiting 'any registration' to 'primary registrations' creates a loophole, suggesting that other forms of registrations are permissible, therefore weakening protections under the Lanham Act.",

                "law_explanation": "Section 1114 of the Lanham Act prohibits actions that are likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception regarding trademarks. The original clause aims to prevent any action that could impair SpinCo's trademarks. By weakening the language to only prohibit actions that 'significantly' oppose or threaten SpinCo's IP, and introducing caveats like 'attempt to not,' the modified text creates ambiguity and potentially allows for actions that, while not overtly infringing, could still cause confusion or dilute SpinCo's trademark, conflicting with the Lanham Act's intent to protect trademark holders from any form of infringement that leads to consumer deception or confusion.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall use reasonable best efforts' with 'will consider using reasonable efforts' weakens the obligation to a mere consideration. Replacing 'take' with 'try to take' and 'cause to be taken' with 'potentially cause to be taken' introduces uncertainty. Replacing 'all actions' with 'some actions' and 'all things' with 'a few things' reduces the scope of the obligation. Using 'seemingly necessary' instead of 'reasonably necessary' and 'possibly proper' instead of 'proper' makes the criteria subjective. Limiting 'applicable Laws and agreements' to 'select Laws and agreements' introduces a loophole. 'Potentially consummate' and 'perhaps make effective' weaken the commitment to completing the transactions.",

                "law_explanation": "Delaware law requires specific actions to effectuate mergers or consolidations. By using qualifiers like 'potentially,' 'perhaps,' 'seemingly,' 'select,' and weakening the 'shall use reasonable best efforts' to 'will consider using reasonable efforts,' the modified text introduces ambiguity and suggests a lower level of commitment than required by law for the successful completion of the spin-off process and to effectively protect intellectual property rights assigned in connection with it. The parties might now argue that they only needed to consider taking some, rather than all, necessary actions, undermining the enforceability of the agreement and the corporation's obligations.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation. 'Encourage' is also less forceful than 'ensure.' This introduces ambiguity regarding the level of compliance required and whether non-compliance is a breach of contract.",

By weakening the obligation to comply with the Guidelines for Applications (Exhibit C, which addresses data collection and user consent), the modified text creates a potential conflict with the CCPA's requirements for clear and affirmative consent regarding data collection and use. 'Endeavor' and 'encourage' don't guarantee compliance with these strict requirements, potentially resulting in unlawful data handling practices.",

'Should endeavor' is weaker than 'shall,' 'consider' is weaker than 'agree,' 'chance to possibly review' is weaker than 'the opportunity to review,' and 'tentative agreement' is weaker than 'agreement.'

                "law_explanation": "GDPR Article 4(11) defines consent as 'any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes'. The modified text undermines the requirement for 'unambiguous' and 'informed' consent. 'Should endeavor,' 'consider,' 'chance to possibly review,' and 'tentative agreement' introduce vagueness and reduce the likelihood of freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent before installing the software, potentially violating GDPR's consent requirements if the software processes personal data of EU residents. The change from 'does not affirmatively agree' to 'does not seem to agree' introduces a subjective element, further weakening the assurance of explicit consent.",

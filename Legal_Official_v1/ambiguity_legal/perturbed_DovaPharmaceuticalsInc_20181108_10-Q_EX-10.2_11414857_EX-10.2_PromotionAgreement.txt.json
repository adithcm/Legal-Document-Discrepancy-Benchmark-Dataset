                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Valeant shall instruct and cause the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing to use only the Product Labeling and, subject to the terms of Section 4.4, Product Materials approved by Dova for the conduct of the Valeant Activities for the Product and consistent with Applicable Laws. Valeant shall instruct the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing to, and will monitor the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing to ensure that such Field Force Personnel, limit their claims of efficacy and safety for the Product to those claims which are consistent with and do not exceed the Product Labeling and any Promotional Materials.",
                "changed_text": "Valeant will encourage the Field Force Personnel engaged in Detailing to utilize Product Labeling and, subject to Section 4.4, Product Materials approved by Dova for Valeant Activities, striving for consistency with Applicable Laws. Valeant may suggest that the Field Force Personnel engaged in Detailing consider limiting their claims of efficacy and safety for the Product to align with the Product Labeling and Promotional Materials.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens Valeant's obligation to ensure its Field Force Personnel comply with applicable laws regarding product promotion. Replacing 'shall instruct and cause' with 'will encourage' and 'shall instruct...to, and will monitor...to ensure that such Field Force Personnel limit' with 'may suggest that the Field Force Personnel consider limiting' introduces ambiguity and discretion, potentially conflicting with strict regulatory requirements for pharmaceutical promotion.",

                ],
                "law_explanation": "By changing mandatory language ('shall') to permissive language ('will encourage,' 'may suggest'), the modified text implies that Valeant does not have a firm obligation to ensure its sales representatives accurately represent the product's efficacy and safety, which could lead to misrepresentations prohibited under 21 U.S.C. § 352. The original text ensures adherence to approved labeling and promotional materials, whereas the modified text allows for deviation, potentially resulting in the product being 'misbranded' if its labeling or advertising is false or misleading.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply in all respects with Applicable Laws' with 'should, to the extent feasible, encourage its Field Force Personnel to generally be aware of Applicable Laws' significantly weakens the legal obligation. It replaces a strict compliance requirement with a suggestion for general awareness, introducing ambiguity as to what constitutes 'feasible' and 'generally aware.'",

                ],
                "law_explanation": "This modification creates an ambiguous legal obligation that undermines the Anti-Kickback Statute. The original text mandates strict compliance with all applicable laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits offering or paying anything of value to induce referrals. The altered text's permissive language ('should encourage...generally be aware') implies that Valeant's personnel are not required to actively avoid kickbacks, potentially leading to violations without clear accountability. By weakening the requirement to comply, the contract implicitly permits a lower standard of conduct, increasing the risk of violations.",

                "changed_text": "Valeant will aim to maintain records of each Detail and its obligations hereunder.",
                "explanation": "This modification loosens the requirement for record-keeping. The original 'shall keep accurate and complete records, consistent with pharmaceutical industry standards' is replaced with 'will aim to maintain records,' removing the obligation for accuracy, completeness, and consistency with industry standards. This makes the obligation vague and difficult to enforce.",

                ],
                "law_explanation": "The change from 'shall keep accurate and complete records' to 'will aim to maintain records' weakens the requirement for detailed documentation of Detailing activities, making it non-compliant with 21 CFR Part 211. This regulation mandates accurate record-keeping for pharmaceutical activities. The new text does not guarantee that the records will be precise or maintained to a specific standard. This contradicts the regulation because such detailing are promotional activities that need to be documented, as part of GMP.",

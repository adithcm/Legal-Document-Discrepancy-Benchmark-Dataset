The Fund represents and warrants to Integrity that any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information, when such registration statement becomes effective, will include all statements required to be contained therein in conformity with the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC; that all statements of fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information will be true and correct when such registration statement becomes effective; and that neither any registration statement nor any prospectus or statement of additional information when such registration statement becomes effective will include an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to a purchaser of Shares.",

The Fund represents and warrants to Integrity that any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information, when such registration statement becomes effective, will include statements believed to be required therein, considering the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC; that statements of fact contained therein will be substantially true and accurate when such registration statement becomes effective; and that any registration statement nor any prospectus or statement of additional information when such registration statement becomes effective will include a knowingly untrue statement of material fact or intentionally omit a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to a purchaser of Shares.",

Replacing 'all statements required' with 'statements believed to be required' introduces subjectivity. Changing 'true and correct' to 'substantially true and accurate' and adding 'knowingly' and 'intentionally' before 'untrue statement' and 'omit a material fact' diminishes the guarantee of accuracy and completeness, contradicting the strict liability standard under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933.",

Introducing qualifiers like 'believes,' 'with consideration to,' 'substantially true and accurate,' and requiring 'knowingly' untrue statements directly contradicts this strict liability standard. Section 11 does not require proof of intent or knowledge for liability to attach; the mere presence of a material misstatement or omission is sufficient. By weakening the representation of accuracy and completeness, the modified text allows for potential violations of Section 11.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless' with 'will consider indemnifying' makes the indemnification discretionary rather than mandatory. Adding the condition that indemnification 'will only apply to claims directly resulting from information provided solely by the Fund' narrows the scope significantly and introduces ambiguity regarding what constitutes 'directly resulting' and how contribution is determined, weakening investor protection. This can conflict with the requirements for full and fair disclosure and potential liability under securities laws, specifically Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 and SEC Rule 485.",

                "law_explanation": "Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 aims to protect investors by holding issuers and underwriters liable for material misstatements or omissions in registration statements. The original text provides a clear indemnification agreement from the Fund to Integrity, consistent with the allocation of responsibility for accurate disclosures. However, the modified text's discretionary indemnification ('will consider') and narrowed scope undermine this protection. The 'directly resulting' clause introduces a subjective element, making it more difficult for Integrity to seek indemnification, especially if its actions are deemed to have 'contributed' to the misstatement. This ambiguity can discourage Integrity from thoroughly scrutinizing the Fund's disclosures, potentially increasing the risk of inaccurate statements and weakening investor safeguards, which are central to the purpose of Section 11.",

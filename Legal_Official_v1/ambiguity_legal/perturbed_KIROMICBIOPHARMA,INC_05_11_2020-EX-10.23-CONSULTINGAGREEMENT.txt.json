                "original_text": "Consultant shall not, during or subsequent to the term of this Agreement, use any Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever other than the performance of the Services on behalf of Company, or disclose Confidential Information to any third party. Consultant agrees that Confidential Information shall remain the sole property of Company. Consultant further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant should endeavor, during and after the term of this Agreement, not to utilize Confidential Information beyond performing Services for the Company, nor willingly reveal it to external parties. Consultant acknowledges that Confidential Information is considered Company property. Consultant will take precautions to reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not' to 'should endeavor not to,' 'agrees' to 'acknowledges,' and 'take all reasonable precautions' to 'take precautions to reduce the risk' weakens the binding nature of the confidentiality agreement. This makes the obligation unclear and less enforceable.",

                "law_explanation": "The modified text weakens the consultant's obligation to protect confidential information. The Texas Trade Secrets Act allows for injunctive relief to prevent the misappropriation of trade secrets, which requires a clear and binding agreement. Replacing 'shall not' with 'should endeavor not to' and similar changes could make it more difficult for the Company to obtain an injunction, as it introduces ambiguity about the consultant's obligations, undermining the legal protection intended by the Act.",

It is expected that the Company shall own inventions conceived by Consultant alone or jointly with others in performing the Services or using Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'hereby irrevocably assigns' with 'assigns...subject to reasonable exceptions' and 'shall own' introduces ambiguity and undermines the certainty of ownership transfer. The phrase 'reasonable exceptions' is vague and could lead to disputes over what constitutes a valid exception.",

By including 'subject to reasonable exceptions,' the assignment becomes less definitive. This ambiguity could be exploited to argue that certain inventions were not effectively transferred to the Company, potentially hindering the company's ability to protect its intellectual property and defend against claims of fraudulent transfer related to those assets.",

Section 335a and does not appear on the United States Food and Drug debarment list. Consultant represents and warrants that Consultant has not committed any crime or conduct that could result in such debarment or Consultant's exclusion from any governmental healthcare program. Consultant represents and warrants that, to Consultant's knowledge, no investigations, claims or proceedings with respect to any such crimes or conduct are pending or threatened against Consultant.",

Consultant states that they have not knowingly committed any crime or conduct that would definitely result in such debarment or exclusion. Consultant believes that no relevant investigations are currently pending.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'represents and warrants' to 'states,' adding qualifiers like 'to the best of their understanding,' 'knowingly,' and 'definitely,' and replacing 'are pending or threatened' with 'are currently pending' significantly weakens the assurance provided by the consultant. This introduces subjectivity and limits the consultant's liability.",

The modified text introduces ambiguity and weakens the consultant's responsibility, potentially conflicting with the spirit and intent of 21 U.S.C. § 335a, which aims to prevent individuals and companies debarred by the FDA from participating in certain activities. The changes limit the company's legal recourse if the consultant is later found to be debarred, as the consultant's statements are qualified and subjective rather than absolute.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall promote' to 'shall endeavor to promote' weakens the obligation to a 'best efforts' standard, which is ambiguous and allows for less promotion. Changing 'shall furnish' to 'may furnish' makes providing promotional materials discretionary.",

                "law_explanation": "The original text implies a strong commitment to promoting the product. The modified text weakens this, potentially leading to insufficient promotion, which could be viewed as a deceptive practice if the product's success relies heavily on the company's marketing efforts as presented during the contract negotiation. This contradicts 815 ILCS 505/2 because the ambiguity allows the company to not actively promote the product and the act forbids that they use deception in the distribution of the product.",

                "explanation": "Adding 'generally' and 'what it considers' makes the 'workmanlike manner' standard subjective. Changing 'fully functional and fit' to 'generally be functional and suitable' weakens the warranty. Changing 'free from defects' to 'free from significant defects' introduces ambiguity about what constitutes a 'significant' defect.",

The modified text weakens the warranty to a subjective assessment of 'workmanlike manner' and 'significant defects,' potentially allowing the company to provide products that are not truly fit for their intended purpose, thus contradicting 810 ILCS 5/2-314.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'should endeavor to comply' makes compliance non-mandatory.

The modified text only requires an 'endeavor' to comply with the 'general intent,' which allows the distributor to potentially disregard specific requirements of the Act. This contradicts 15 U.S. Code ยง 2302, which mandates clear and conspicuous disclosure of warranty terms.",

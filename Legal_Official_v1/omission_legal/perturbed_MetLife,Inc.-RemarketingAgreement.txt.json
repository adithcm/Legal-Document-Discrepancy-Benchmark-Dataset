                "changed_text": "To make available to securityholders of the Company an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries at its discretion;",
                "explanation": "This removes the requirement to provide an earnings statement within a specific timeframe (18 months) and makes it discretionary, weakening investor rights. It also removes any reference to Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158), further reducing the company's obligation to adhere to specific accounting standards and compliance measures.",

By removing the specific requirement to make an earnings statement available within 18 months, the modified text reduces the company's obligation to comply with Section 11(a) which necessitates truthful and transparent financial reporting. This weakens investor protections afforded by the Securities Act.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'any state or Federal court in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York' to 'any court of the Company's choosing,' and removing 'to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any suit, action or proceeding,' the amendment gives the company complete control over the venue of any legal proceedings, potentially forcing the Remarketing Agents into unfavorable or distant jurisdictions.

While parties can consent to jurisdiction and venue, the modified text arguably attempts to manipulate this, potentially undermining the Remarketing Agents' ability to pursue claims in a fair and convenient forum as contemplated by the Act. The changes give undue power to MetLife by allowing it to choose a court that may not have proper jurisdiction or be convenient for the Remarketing Agents.",

                "explanation": "The original text ensures that both the Company and Remarketing Agents waive their right to a jury trial. The modified text only explicitly states that the Company waives this right, implicitly leaving the Remarketing Agents' right to a jury trial intact. This could be problematic as it creates an imbalance in legal recourse, favoring the Remarketing Agents should a dispute arise. While the right to a jury trial can be waived, this right extends to both parties and cannot be unilaterally granted to one, especially without explicit mutual agreement. The change selectively benefits the Remarketing Agents and undermines the principle of mutual waiver.",

                "law_explanation": "The Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial in civil cases. While this right can be waived, it must be a knowing and voluntary waiver by all parties involved. The modified text omits the Remarketing Agents' waiver, which could be interpreted as a denial of their right to waive or exercise their right to a jury trial, depending on their interpretation of the contract, leading to potential legal challenges. The original text clearly establishes mutual waiver, while the modified text creates ambiguity and potential conflict with the Seventh Amendment.",

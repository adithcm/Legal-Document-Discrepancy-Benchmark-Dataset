                "changed_text": "Valeant shall instruct the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing to conduct the Valeant Activities for the Product.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for Valeant to monitor and audit its Field Force Personnel to ensure adherence to Applicable Laws removes a critical compliance measure. This creates a **legal contradiction** with federal regulations mandating comprehensive monitoring of sales activities to prevent fraud and abuse, especially in pharmaceutical promotion.",

                "law_explanation": "The original text required Valeant to monitor and audit its personnel to ensure compliance with all applicable laws. The modified text omits any form of monitoring. This directly contradicts 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, which prohibits the solicitation, receipt, or offer of any remuneration in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service, or item paid for under a Federal health care program. A failure to monitor and audit for compliance with this law represents a potential violation.",

The Parties shall meet promptly thereafter to attempt to resolve such disputes.",
                "changed_text": "Promptly upon receipt of the quarterly or monthly reports described in this Section 6.3, Valeant may, at its convenience, review such reports.",
                "explanation": "Removing Valeant's obligation to review the reports and promptly notify Dova of any disputes undermines the transparency and accuracy of financial reporting. It further fails to ensure compliance with financial regulations, which could potentially mask fraud and misrepresentation.",

                "law_explanation": "The original text obligated Valeant to review reports from Dova and to promptly notify Dova of any disputes with those reports. The modified text removes that obligation. 15 U.S.C. § 78m requires accurate financial reporting. By removing this obligation, this contract does not encourage accurate financials, and may enable inaccurate financial reporting.",

                "explanation": "Removing the *requirement* to provide written proof of insurance weakens Dova's ability to ensure Valeant maintains adequate coverage, especially comprehensive general liability insurance. This creates a legal contradiction as state laws often mandate minimum liability coverage for businesses, and without proof, compliance cannot be verified.",

                "law_explanation": "The original text required each party to provide reasonable written proof of the existence of such insurance to the other party upon request. The modified text makes this discretionary. This violates 21 CFR Part 211, which requires pharmaceutical companies to implement quality control and assurance measures to ensure the safety and efficacy of their products. The contract allows parties to avoid complying with quality control processes such as insurance. ",

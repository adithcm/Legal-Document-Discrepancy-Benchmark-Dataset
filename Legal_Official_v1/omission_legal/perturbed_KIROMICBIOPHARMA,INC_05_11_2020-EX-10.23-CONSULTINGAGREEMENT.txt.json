The number of arbitrator(s) shall be one. The seat of arbitration shall be Houston, Texas. Texas law shall also apply to the extent necessary to fill any gaps created by the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the parties.

                "explanation": "By removing 'binding arbitration controlled by the rules of the American Arbitration Association' and 'Texas law shall also apply to the extent necessary to fill any gaps created by the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator(s) shall have sole kompetenz-kompetenz regarding this Arbitration Agreement' from the arbitration clause, the agreement becomes vague and potentially unenforceable. Texas law favors explicit arbitration agreements that adhere to specific procedural rules. Deleting these clauses introduces ambiguity and could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent consumer protection measures ensuring fair arbitration processes.",

                "law_explanation": "The modified text contradicts the Texas Arbitration Act because it doesn't explicitly state that the arbitration is 'binding' or specify the governing rules (e.g., AAA rules), potentially rendering the agreement unenforceable under Texas law. Texas law favors arbitration, but requires clarity and adherence to established procedures to ensure fairness. Without specifying the rules of the American Arbitration Association, the agreement fails to ensure the availability of procedural default rules that would be applicable to the arbitration proceeding. This is problematic as it is less clear the arbitration process is enforceable.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'that Consultant will not bring onto the premises of Company any unpublished document or proprietary information belonging to such employer, person or entity unless consented to in writing by the same', the agreement omits a critical protection against trade secret misappropriation under Texas law. This omission increases the risk of the company inadvertently using or possessing trade secrets of others, potentially leading to liability.",

                "law_explanation": "The modified text weakens the protections against trade secret misappropriation, potentially violating the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (TUTSA). TUTSA prohibits the acquisition, use, or disclosure of trade secrets without consent. By removing the explicit prohibition against bringing unpublished documents onto the premises, the agreement fails to adequately safeguard against the risk of misappropriation, especially if the consultant has access to confidential information from previous employers. The company is therefore vulnerable to liability under TUTSA.",

                "explanation": "Removing the explicit reference to Texas law creates ambiguity regarding the governing law. This omission can be problematic because it removes the parties' express agreement that Texas law should govern the contract, allowing for disputes about which jurisdiction's laws should apply. Texas has specific consumer protection laws; removing this clause could allow a different state's laws (potentially with weaker consumer protections) to apply. This introduces uncertainty and increases legal risk.",

                "law_explanation": "The modified text contradicts the intention to apply the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) as the agreement no longer explicitly selects Texas law. The DTPA provides consumers with specific rights and remedies against deceptive business practices. By omitting the reference to Texas law, the contract introduces ambiguity and could lead a court to apply the laws of a jurisdiction with weaker consumer protections, thereby circumventing the DTPA and harming the consultant.",

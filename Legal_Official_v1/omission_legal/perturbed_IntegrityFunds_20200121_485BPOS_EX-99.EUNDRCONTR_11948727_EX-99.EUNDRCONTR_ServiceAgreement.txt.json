Section 1.3 All activities by Integrity as underwriter of the Shares shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation, all rules and regulations made or adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") or by any securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Fund's Registration Statement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit requirement for compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations issued by the SEC, the contract creates a legal loophole. The new text focuses on forecasts instead of purchase orders, and removes a general commitment to legal and regulatory compliance, relying solely on compliance with the fund's registration statement, which may not be sufficient to cover all required legal obligations.",

By omitting the requirement to comply with all SEC rules and regulations, the modified text weakens the obligation of Integrity to avoid such practices, potentially contradicting this provision. This creates a legal risk, as Integrity might engage in practices that, while technically compliant with the Fund's Registration Statement, violate broader SEC regulations designed to protect investors from manipulation and deception.",

The Fund agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Integrity, its several officers and governors, and any person who controls Integrity within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the cost of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) which Integrity, its officers and governors, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or necessary to make the statements in any of them not misleading; provided, however, that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers or governors, and any such controlling person shall not be deemed to cover any claims, demands, liabilities, or expenses arising out of or based upon any statements or representations made by Integrity or its representatives or agents other than such statements and representations as are contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information and in such financial and other statements as are furnished to Integrity pursuant to paragraph 2.2 hereof; and further provided that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity and the Fund's representations and warranties hereinbefore set forth in paragraph 3 shall not be deemed to cover any liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which Integrity would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of Integrity's reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement. The Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers and governors, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon the Fund's being notified of any action brought against Integrity, its officers or governors, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or by telegram addressed to the Fund at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to the Fund by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify the Fund of any such action shall not relieve the Fund from any liability that the Fund may have to the person against whom such action is brought by reason of any such untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of the Fund's indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1.",

                "explanation": "By removing the provisos that limit the Fund's indemnification obligations, the contract now appears to require the Fund to indemnify Integrity even for actions arising from Integrity's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, and even if the Fund isn't promptly notified of legal action. This directly contradicts legal standards that prevent indemnification for one's own intentional misconduct.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that Kansas law governs the interpretation of the contract. Removing this specific reference and replacing it with 'principles of contract law' introduces ambiguity. While contract law principles are generally applicable, the absence of a specific state law reference may lead to disputes over which state's laws apply, particularly regarding consumer protection aspects. Given that the Fund's principal office is in North Dakota, and Integrity's office is also mentioned as being in Minot, North Dakota in Section 4.1 & 4.2, this could also be seen as an attempt to avoid the stricter consumer protection laws of another relevant jurisdiction.",

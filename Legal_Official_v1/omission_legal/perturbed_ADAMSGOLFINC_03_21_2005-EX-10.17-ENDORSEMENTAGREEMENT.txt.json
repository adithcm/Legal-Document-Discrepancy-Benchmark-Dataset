                "explanation": "By stating that principles of equity will be used rather than the laws of Kansas, the agreement is forgoing consumer protections that are legally mandated by Kansas law. Several Kansas statutes protect consumers against deceptive trade practices, warranty rights, and other contractual issues. By removing the application of Kansas law, these protections are effectively omitted, creating a potentially unfair situation for the consultant. While equity looks to fairness, it doesn't guarantee the consumer rights established in Kansas law.",

The KCPA protects consumers from deceptive and unconscionable acts and practices. By stating the agreement is governed by 'principles of equity' rather than Kansas law, the consultant loses the statutory protections afforded by the KCPA.",

If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel.

Furthermore, by removing 'and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction', this eliminates court oversight to protect the consultant.",

The Kansas Uniform Arbitration Act (KUAA) provides a framework for fair and impartial arbitration proceedings, including provisions for arbitrator selection, procedural rules, and judicial review. By omitting these details, the modified clause contradicts the KUAA, potentially leading to biased or unfair arbitration outcomes. The removal of the court judgement clause also violates KSA 5-418.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit mention of 'hold harmless', 'claims', 'causes of action', 'suits', 'damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses)' and narrowing the scope to 'any liability,' the consultant's obligation is drastically reduced. Kansas law provides specific protection against overly broad indemnification clauses, particularly those that would require a party to indemnify another party for their own negligence. The original clause, while broad, could arguably be interpreted within reasonable bounds; the modified clause removes the specificity necessary for a court to determine the intended scope and may violate Kansas law against indemnifying for one's own negligence if interpreted too broadly. It also removes requirements for ADAMS GOLF to show proof of damages.",

                "law_explanation": "The modified clause broadens the indemnification obligation of the consultant while removing clarity and limitations. Kansas law disfavors contracts that indemnify a party for its own negligence unless such intent is expressed in clear and unequivocal terms. By simply stating 'any liability,' without explicitly addressing negligence or fault, the clause becomes ambiguous and potentially unenforceable under Kansas law, especially if ADAMS GOLF's liability arises from its own actions. The EBCO, Inc. v. BG Constr. Co. case clarifies Kansas' position on indemnification agreements and the requirement for clear and unambiguous language.",

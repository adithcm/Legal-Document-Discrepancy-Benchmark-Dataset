Each Party agrees to refrain from, either during period of this Agreement or at any other time thereafter, disclosing, using or disseminating such confidential information, for its or another's benefit, in any way acquired in the course of any association arising out of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees to hold in confidence confidential information acquired in the course of this relationship with the other Parties and their associates. Each Party agrees to refrain from disclosing confidential information during the period of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'using or disseminating such confidential information, for its or another's benefit, in any way acquired in the course of any association arising out of this Agreement' and limiting the confidentiality restriction to 'during the period of this Agreement' significantly weakens the confidentiality clause. This omission creates a legal risk because it implies that after the agreement terminates, parties are free to use the confidential information, which could violate trade secret laws.",

                "law_explanation": "The modified text fails to adequately protect trade secrets as defined under Pennsylvania law because it implies that confidentiality obligations cease upon termination of the agreement, which conflicts with the PUTSA's protection against misappropriation even after a relationship ends.",

                "law_explanation": "Pennsylvania law dictates rules for personal jurisdiction and venue.

                "explanation": "Changing 'in full' to 'at THI's sole discretion' allows THI to decide how much, if any, of Marv's legal expenses will be reimbursed. This omission introduces a legal risk because it could be interpreted as an unenforceable agreement if the discretion is not exercised in good faith, potentially violating Pennsylvania's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts.",

                "law_explanation": "By granting THI 'sole discretion' over reimbursement without any standard for reasonableness or good faith, the modified text creates a risk that THI could arbitrarily deny reimbursement, violating Pennsylvania's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to a contract to act honestly and reasonably in its performance and enforcement. While the Restatement isn't Pennsylvania law, Pennsylvania courts refer to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 205 in interpreting the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

Company further warrants that the Products sold hereunder shall be free from defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period of twenty-four (24) months after delivery to Distributor's end-user.

                "explanation": "Removing the sentence 'The Distributor at all times shall comply with all requirements of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act and similar federal and state laws and regulations.' creates a potential violation of consumer protection laws. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act mandates certain disclosures and requirements regarding warranties for consumer products, and the distributor's explicit agreement to comply with it is important for upholding consumer rights.",

This act requires clear and conspicuous disclosure of warranty terms, and by removing the compliance clause, the agreement becomes less protective of consumer rights and potentially violates the Act's provisions regarding warranty information.",

Company will make reasonable efforts to procure a policy, which is non-cancelable, except upon thirty (30) days, advance notice to the Distributor.' removes a protective measure for the distributor and potentially violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Illinois law. Without being named as an additional insured, the distributor has less protection against product liability claims related to the company's products, and removing the non-cancelable clause leaves the distributor vulnerable to sudden policy changes.",

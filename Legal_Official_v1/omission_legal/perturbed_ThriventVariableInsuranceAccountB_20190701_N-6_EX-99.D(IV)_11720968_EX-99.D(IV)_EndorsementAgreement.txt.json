It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

If you do not make the extra payment, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 15% per year.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the option to pay the deficiency in cash and increasing the interest rate on the indebtedness contradicts consumer protection laws regarding fair debt collection and usury laws.",

                "law_explanation": "Wisconsin Statutes Section 422.201 and 422.202 places restrictions on deficiency judgments in consumer credit transactions, aiming to protect consumers from unfair debt collection practices. By removing the 'payment in cash' option and increasing the interest rate to 15% in the case of solvency impairment, this change effectively limits the consumer's ability to settle debts fairly and imposes a potentially usurious interest rate, undermining the protections afforded by Wisconsin law.",

                "explanation": "Removing the statement 'Since we do not expect this contract to contribute to divisible surplus, it is not expected that any dividends will be credited' creates an ambiguous promise of dividends, which could be viewed as misleading if the company never intends to pay them.

                "law_explanation": "Wisconsin Statute 100.18 prohibits deceptive advertising practices. By removing the disclaimer about the expectation of dividends, the modified text implies that dividends are possible without providing a clear expectation or likelihood.

By omitting the reference to these documents and instead stating rights and privileges may be 'set forth elsewhere,' the contract fails to clearly inform members about the location of these crucial documents, undermining their right to access information about their membership rights and privileges within the society.",

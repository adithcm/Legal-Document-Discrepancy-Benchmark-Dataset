                "changed_text": "Each party warrants to the other that it will use reasonable care and skill in complying with its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This clause has been altered to remove the distributor's warranty to undertake commercially reasonable endeavors in good faith to comply with Google's business partner due diligence process. This creates a legal contradiction by omitting a critical aspect of compliance with anti-corruption laws. The original text ensures the Distributor follows due diligence, which is crucial for adhering to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. By removing this, the contract fails to explicitly mandate compliance efforts, increasing legal risk.",

                "law_explanation": "The modification omits the requirement for the distributor to undertake commercially reasonable due diligence. This directly contradicts the spirit and intention of the FCPA, which mandates that companies take proactive steps to prevent corruption, including due diligence on business partners. Removing this duty of care undermines the FCPA’s anti-corruption measures, increasing the risk of FCPA violations.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'Furthermore, Distributor will not make any facilitation payments, which are payments to induce officials to perform routine functions they are otherwise obligated to perform,' the contract now fails to explicitly prohibit facilitation payments. While the FCPA does not explicitly ban facilitation payments, it has very strict guidelines on them, and the removal of the explicit prohibition creates a gray area and increases legal risk. This conflicts with best practices for FCPA compliance.",

                "law_explanation": "Removing the explicit prohibition on facilitation payments weakens the anti-corruption stance of the contract. Although the FCPA has nuanced views on facilitation payments, best practices dictate a clear prohibition to avoid even the appearance of bribery. By omitting this, the contract creates potential legal ambiguity and increases the risk of non-compliance with the FCPA.",

This undermines the protections intended by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically provisions addressing the protection of confidential information during investigations or legal proceedings. Failure to provide notice can lead to violations of due process and damage the disclosing party.",

                "law_explanation": "21 CFR § 314.80 requires manufacturers (which, post-agreement, would include EKR) to report adverse drug experiences to the FDA. By removing EKR's responsibility to report such incidents within the US, the contract contradicts this federal regulation, potentially leading to non-compliance and legal repercussions.",

Such insurance shall be with a reputable insurance company and where reasonably possible (taking into account the availability of such insurance) shall be maintained for not less than [**] ([**]) years following the expiry or termination of this Agreement. During the Term, neither Party shall do or omit to do any act, matter or thing which could prejudice or render voidable any such insurance.

                "explanation": "The removal of 'comprehensive', the specific insurance types (general commercial liability and business interruption), the minimum coverage amount, the duration of insurance post-termination, and the requirements for providing evidence and notice significantly weakens the insurance requirements. This could create a **legal contradiction** if the type or amount of insurance required falls short of the state's regulations.",

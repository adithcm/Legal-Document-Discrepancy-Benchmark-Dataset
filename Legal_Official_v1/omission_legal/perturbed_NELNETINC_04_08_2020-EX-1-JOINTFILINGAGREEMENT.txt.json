                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned agree to jointly prepare and file with regulatory authorities a Schedule 13G or 13D for ownership of securities of the issuer. Filing will be pursuant to provisions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'applicable' and the specific reference to Rule 13d-1(k), the amended text becomes less precise and potentially obscures the mandatory nature of the filing requirements under securities law. The omission weakens the explicit affirmation of compliance with Rule 13d-1(k).",

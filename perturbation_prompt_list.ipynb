    "prompt_ambiguity_legal = \"\"\"You are a senior compliance officer reviewing a legal contract. Your task is to modify a section of the contract by introducing an ambiguous legal obligation while ensuring that the ambiguity contradicts a state or national law.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Before modifying the text:\n",
    "    - **Read the file** to determine what city, state, or country the contract applies to.\n",
    "    - If the jurisdiction is unclear, default to **United States law.\n",
    "    - Make sure to include 2-3 distinct perturbation objects in the \"perturbation\" array, each containing all required fields as specified in the JSON schema**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Ambiguities occur when a legal statement is vague, leading to multiple interpretations. A **legal contradiction** under this category happens when an obligation is introduced ambiguously, making it difficult to enforce under state or national law. This can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements, leaving legal obligations open to dispute.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a clear legal obligation in the contract.\n",
    "    2. Modify the wording to make it **vague or open to multiple interpretations**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure that this ambiguity creates **non-compliance with a specific law** in the identified jurisdiction.\n",
    "    4. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Examples of Ambiguous Legal Obligations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The company shall provide necessary accommodations for disabled employees.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The company shall provide accommodations for disabled employees as deemed appropriate.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The term \"as deemed appropriate\" introduces ambiguity, conflicting with **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)**, which mandates **clear, non-discretionary accommodations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"All contractors must comply with local zoning laws.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"All contractors must make reasonable efforts to comply with zoning laws.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Reasonable efforts\" is vague—some zoning laws require strict adherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The landlord shall ensure habitable living conditions in compliance with state law.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The landlord shall make efforts to maintain habitable conditions.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Make efforts\" does not guarantee habitability, which violates **tenant protection laws**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The company shall maintain data security measures that meet industry standards.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The company shall maintain data security measures that it deems sufficient.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Deems sufficient\" is subjective and contradicts **GDPR and CCPA** requirements for **specific security standards**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Employees shall be provided meal breaks as required by law.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Employees shall be encouraged to take meal breaks.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Some states require **mandatory** meal breaks (e.g., California).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The Contractor shall comply with all federal and state regulations governing workplace safety, ensuring all necessary precautions are taken to protect employees from occupational hazards. The Contractor must conduct quarterly safety inspections and submit reports to regulatory authorities. Any violations of safety standards shall result in corrective actions and potential penalties. The company’s leadership is responsible for ensuring full compliance at all levels.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The Contractor should make reasonable efforts to comply with applicable federal and state regulations governing workplace safety. The Contractor may conduct periodic safety inspections and submit reports when deemed necessary. Violations of safety standards will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, and corrective actions may be recommended where appropriate.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall comply' with 'should make reasonable efforts,' making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. The removal of 'quarterly safety inspections' eliminates a clear legal requirement, and replacing 'shall result in corrective actions' with 'may be recommended' creates uncertainty. This contradicts **OSHA regulations**, which mandate strict compliance and routine reporting on workplace safety violations.\n",

    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Ambiguities also occur when key terms are **inconsistently defined within the document itself**, creating internal contradictions. This type of **in-text contradiction** confuses contract enforcement by allowing multiple interpretations of the same term in different sections, leading to potential legal disputes over meaning.\n",

    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Section 2:** \"The term ‘Client’ refers to any party who purchases our services.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 8:** \"Clients are defined as parties who hold an active contract for at least six months.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The first definition includes all buyers, while the second restricts \"Clients\" to long-term customers, leading to disputes over **contractual obligations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Section 1:** \"Employees are eligible for health benefits upon hiring.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 6:** \"Employees are eligible for health benefits after 90 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The contradiction makes it unclear when benefits apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Section 4:** \"The vendor is responsible for product warranties.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 9:** \"Warranty claims shall be processed by the manufacturer.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** It’s unclear **who holds warranty responsibility**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Section 3:** \"Data shall be stored for five years.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 12:** \"Data must be deleted within two years.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** A **conflicting data retention period** could violate regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Section 2:** \"A shareholder is anyone holding 5% or more equity.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 7:** \"A shareholder is anyone with voting rights.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** A shareholder under one section may **not qualify in another**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The Supplier shall deliver all goods in accordance with the specifications outlined in Schedule A. Any failure to meet these specifications will be considered a material breach of contract. In such cases, the Buyer reserves the right to request a full refund or demand replacement goods within 30 days. The Supplier guarantees that all goods will conform to the quality and performance standards described in the agreement.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The Supplier shall make every effort to deliver goods in accordance with the specifications outlined in Schedule A. If specifications are not fully met, the Buyer and Supplier will engage in discussions to determine an appropriate resolution, which may include partial refunds or adjusted delivery timelines.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall deliver' with 'shall make every effort,' making performance non-binding. The original contract clearly stated that failure to meet specifications was a material breach with predefined consequences, whereas the modified version introduces an uncertain resolution process. This creates an **internal contradiction** if another part of the contract enforces strict adherence to Schedule A’s specifications.\n",

    "### **Examples of Conflicting Contract and Statutory Terms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "- **Original:** \"The employee shall be considered an independent contractor.\"\n",
    "- **Modified:** \"The worker shall be considered an independent contractor.\"\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Some states define **“worker” differently from “independent contractor”** under employment laws, leading to misclassification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "- **Original:** \"Bank deposits are federally insured up to $250,000.\"\n",
    "- **Modified:** \"Bank deposits may be insured at the institution’s discretion.\"\n",
    "- **Explanation:** This contradicts **FDIC insurance laws**, which guarantee deposit protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "- **Original:** \"A tenant has the right to a habitable living environment.\"\n",
    "- **Modified:** \"A tenant has the right to request habitability improvements.\"\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Federal **tenant protection laws** mandate a **clear landlord obligation**, which this change removes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 4:**\n",
    "- **Original:** \"Employees are entitled to paid overtime after 40 hours per week.\"\n",
    "- **Modified:** \"Overtime pay shall be determined based on business needs.\"\n",
    "- **Explanation:** The **Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)** mandates **fixed overtime rules**—this modification makes it discretionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 5:**\n",
    "- **Original:** \"All sales agreements must disclose total finance charges.\"\n",
    "- **Modified:** \"Finance charge disclosure is encouraged but not required.\"\n",
    "- **Explanation:** The **Truth in Lending Act (TILA)** requires **clear disclosure** of finance charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 6:**\n",
    "- **Original:** \"The lessee shall be responsible for all maintenance and repair costs associated with the leased property, except those classified as structural repairs, which shall be the responsibility of the lessor. Structural repairs include foundation, roof, and exterior load-bearing walls.\"\n",
    "- **Modified:** \"The lessee shall be responsible for all upkeep and general property repairs, except for major repairs, which shall be handled by the lessor.\"\n",
    "- **Explanation:** The term **'structural repairs'** was replaced with **'major repairs'**, creating legal uncertainty. Structural repairs have a clear **legal definition**, whereas 'major repairs' is vague and open to interpretation. This contradicts the intent of the contract and could lead to disputes over **repair responsibilities** under real estate law.\n",

    "prompt_inconsistencies_inText = \"\"\"You are a financial contract auditor ensuring consistency in payment terms. Your task is to introduce a conflict between different payment deadline clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition:**\n",
    "Inconsistencies also lead to **in-text contradictions** when **different sections of a contract provide conflicting deadlines, obligations, or penalties**. This creates ambiguity regarding which terms should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "1. Identify a **key term** in the contract.\n",
    "2. Modify its definition in different sections so that they **conflict**.\n",
    "3. Ensure the contradiction creates **uncertainty in enforcement**.\n",
    "4. Make sure to include 2-3 distinct perturbation objects in the \"perturbation\" array, each containing all required fields as specified in the JSON schema**.\n",
    "5. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Examples of Conflicting Payment Terms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "- **Section 4:** \"Invoices must be paid within 45 days.\"\n",
    "- **Section 12:** \"Late fees apply if invoices are unpaid after 30 days.\"\n",
    "- **Explanation:** One section allows **45 days**, but the other **charges late fees after 30 days**, creating ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "- **Section 6:** \"Security deposits are fully refundable.\"\n",
    "- **Section 9:** \"Security deposits are non-refundable.\"\n",
    "- **Explanation:** It is unclear whether **deposits must be returned**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "- **Section 3:** \"Early termination fees apply if the contract is ended before 12 months.\"\n",
    "- **Section 10:** \"Clients may terminate at any time without penalty.\"\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Conflicting clauses **cause uncertainty about termination fees**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 4:**\n",
    "- **Section 5:** \"Payment plans must be completed within 6 months.\"\n",
    "- **Section 11:** \"Customers may extend payment plans up to 12 months.\"\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Different sections **contradict the maximum payment period**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 5:**\n",
    "- **Section 8:** \"Interest on late payments accrues at 5% per month.\"\n",
    "- **Section 14:** \"No interest will be charged on late payments.\"\n",
    "- **Explanation:** **Conflicting interest policies** could lead to legal disputes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 6:**\n",
    "- **Original:** \"For the purposes of this Agreement, the term 'Affiliate' shall refer to any entity that is controlled by, controls, or is under common control with either party. The term 'control' shall mean ownership of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the voting equity in such entity. Affiliates shall be entitled to the same rights and obligations as the contracting party.\"\n",
    "- **Modified:** \"For the purposes of this Agreement, the term 'Affiliate' shall refer to any entity that is affiliated with, works in conjunction with, or has a strategic partnership with either party. Affiliates may be granted certain rights and obligations as determined by the contracting party on a case-by-case basis.\"\n",
    "- **Explanation:** The modified text **creates an in-text contradiction** by **changing the definition of \"Affiliate\"** to include strategic partnerships and loosely affiliated entities, rather than just entities **under majority control**. This contradicts other contract sections that **rely on the original definition** (51% ownership) to determine rights and obligations. Additionally, **allowing case-by-case determination** undermines the original intent of treating affiliates the same as contracting parties, introducing **legal uncertainty** and **potential disputes over obligations**.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Ambiguities\n",
    "- **1A. Legal Contradiction – Ambiguous Legal Obligation**  \n",
    "  - **Definition:** Introducing unclear contractual obligations that make enforcement difficult under state or national law.  \n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The company shall take reasonable efforts to comply with environmental regulations.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The company shall take necessary efforts to comply with environmental regulations.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Necessary efforts\" is ambiguous—state laws often define specific compliance measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1B. In-Text Contradiction – Conflicting Definitions of a Term**  \n",
    "  - **Definition:** Using different definitions of the same term in different sections, creating confusion.  \n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    - **Section 2:** \"The term ‘Client’ refers to any party who purchases our services.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 8:** \"Clients are defined as parties who hold an active contract for at least six months.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** These conflicting definitions create ambiguity in contract enforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Omissions\n",
    "- **2A. Legal Contradiction – Omission of Consumer Rights**  \n",
    "  - **Definition:** Removing a legally required clause, violating state or national law.  \n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Customers have the right to return the product within 30 days, as required by state law.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Customers have the right to return the product at the company’s discretion.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** This contradicts consumer protection laws, which require a minimum return policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2B. In-Text Contradiction – Missing Clause Creates Inconsistency**  \n",
    "  - **Definition:** Removing a key clause while other sections still reference it, creating an internal contradiction.  \n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    - **Section 5:** \"If the contract is terminated, the client shall receive a prorated refund.\"\n",
    "    - **Omitted Clause:** Section 10, which explains how prorated refunds are calculated, is removed.\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The contract still references refunds, but without Section 10, enforcement becomes ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Misaligned Terminology\n",
    "- **3A. Legal Contradiction – Conflicting Contract and Statutory Terms**  \n",
    "  - **Definition:** Using terminology that misaligns with statutory definitions, violating regulatory requirements.  \n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The employee shall be considered an independent contractor.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The worker shall be considered an independent contractor.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Some states define \"worker\" differently, affecting employee classification laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **3B. In-Text Contradiction – Different Terminology for the Same Concept**  \n",
    "  - **Definition:** Using different terms interchangeably without defining them, creating internal contradictions.  \n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    - **Section 1:** \"The Vendor shall supply goods within 30 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 7:** \"The Supplier shall ensure delivery within 60 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Vendor\" and \"Supplier\" are undefined, leading to ambiguity in delivery terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Structural Flaws\n",
    "- **4A. Legal Contradiction – Misplaced Legal Disclosures**  \n",
    "  - **Definition:** Moving a legally required disclosure to an irrelevant section, reducing its enforceability.  \n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"In case of disputes, arbitration shall be required.\" (Located under \"Dispute Resolution\")\n",
    "    - **Modified:** Moved to \"Optional Clauses.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Arbitration clauses must be clearly stated in the dispute resolution section.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **4B. In-Text Contradiction – Clause Placement Creates Internal Conflict**  \n",
    "  - **Definition:** Placing a clause in multiple locations with conflicting implications.  \n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    - **Section 3:** \"The contract auto-renews unless the customer cancels 30 days before the renewal date.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 9:** \"Renewal is subject to mutual agreement by both parties.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** One section implies automatic renewal, while another requires explicit agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Inconsistencies\n",
    "- **5A. Legal Contradiction – Conflict with Regulatory Timelines**  \n",
    "  - **Definition:** Setting a timeline that contradicts state or federal law.  \n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Employees must submit harassment claims within 15 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Employees must submit harassment claims within 5 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Some states mandate at least 30 days for such claims, making this policy illegal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **5B. In-Text Contradiction – Conflicting Payment Terms**  \n",
    "  - **Definition:** Setting different deadlines or conditions in different sections of the contract.  \n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    - **Section 4:** \"Invoices must be paid within 45 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 12:** \"Late fees apply if invoices are unpaid after 30 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The first section allows 45 days, while the second enforces late fees after 30 days, causing confusion.\n",

      "Okay, imagine regular computers are like light switches: they can be either ON (representing 1) or OFF (representing 0).\n",

      "Here's the breakdown:\n",

      "* **Classical Bits (Regular Computers):**  Think of a light switch. It's either ON (1) or OFF (0). That's a bit, the basic unit of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Quantum Bits (Qubits - Quantum Computers):** Think of a dimmer switch. It can be ON (1), OFF (0), or any brightness in between. This is a qubit. Because it can be in multiple states *simultaneously*, it's much more powerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this powerful?**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Superposition:**  A qubit can represent 0, 1, or a combination of both *at the same time*.  This means a quantum computer can explore many possibilities simultaneously.  Imagine trying to find the best route through a maze. A regular computer would try each path one by one. A quantum computer could explore *all* the paths at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Entanglement:** Imagine you have two of these special dimmer switches (qubits). If they're entangled, when you adjust one, the other instantly changes in a predictable way, even if they're far apart. This allows qubits to work together to solve problems in a way that's impossible for regular computers.  Think of it like a super-fast communication channel between the qubits.\n",
      "\n",
      "**So, what can Quantum Computers do?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of superposition and entanglement, quantum computers are theoretically much faster than classical computers for certain types of problems, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Drug Discovery:**  Simulating molecules and chemical reactions.\n",
      "* **Materials Science:**  Designing new materials with specific properties.\n",
      "* **Cryptography:**  Breaking current encryption methods (and developing new, stronger ones).\n",
      "* **Optimization:**  Finding the best solutions to complex problems, like optimizing logistics or financial models.\n",
      "* **Artificial Intelligence:**  Improving machine learning algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Catch:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Early Stage:** Quantum computing is still in its early stages of development.  They are extremely complex to build and maintain.\n",
      "* **Error-Prone:** Qubits are very sensitive to their environment and prone to errors (decoherence).\n",
      "* **Not a Replacement for Regular Computers:** Quantum computers aren't going to replace your laptop. They're good at specific types of problems that are currently too hard for regular computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers use qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition) and are linked together in a special way (entanglement). This allows them to explore many possibilities at once and solve certain complex problems much faster than regular computers. However, they are still in early stages of development and are not a replacement for the computers we use every day. Think of them as specialized tools for solving very specific, very difficult problems.\n",

       "'\\n    You are a legal verification expert. Your task is to determine how strongly a legal contradiction was created when a contract was modified. This contradiction must be evaluated based on legal standards, using the information provided.\\n\\n    You are given:\\n    - The **type** of perturbation introduced\\n    - The **original contract text**\\n    - The **changed (perturbed) version** of that text\\n    - A short **perturbation explanation**, describing how the legal obligation was altered\\n    - A **law explanation**, generated by an LLM, describing why it believes this change contradicts a specific law\\n    - **Two scraped law snippets**, pulled from official legal sources (e.g., .gov/.org sites)\\n    - The definitions for each type of Perturbation. \\n\\n    ---\\n\\n    ### Perturbation Type:\\n    {perturbation.get(\"type\", \"\")}\\n\\n    ### Original Text:\\n    {perturbation.get(\"original_text\", \"\")}\\n\\n    ### Changed Text:\\n    {perturbation.get(\"changed_text\", \"\")}\\n\\n    ### Perturbation Explanation:\\n    {perturbation.get(\"explanation\", \"\")}\\n\\n    ### Law Explanation (Generated by LLM):\\n    {perturbation.get(\"law_explanation\", \"\")}\\n\\n    ### Scraped Law Snippet 1:\\n    {perturbation.get(\"scraped_snippet_1\", \"\")}\\n\\n    ### Scraped Law Snippet 2:\\n    {perturbation.get(\"scraped_snippet_2\", \"\")}\\n    \\n    ### Perturbation Definitions:\\n    1. Ambiguity Legal Contradiction: Ambiguities occur when a legal statement is vague, leading to multiple interpretations. A **legal contradiction** under this category happens when an obligation is introduced ambiguously, making it difficult to enforce under state or national law. This can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements, leaving legal obligations open to dispute.\\n    2. Omission Legal Contradiction: Omissions occur when a contract **removes essential information**, creating legal loopholes. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract omits **a legally mandated consumer protection**, making it non-compliant.\\n    3. Misaligned Terminalogy Legal Contradiction: Misaligned terminology occurs when a contract **uses terms that do not match their statutory meaning**, leading to non-compliance. A **legal contradiction** in this category arises when contractual language deviates from legally recognized definitions, making the contract unenforceable.\\n    4. Structural Flaws Legal Contradiction: Structural flaws occur when the **organization of a contract affects its clarity or enforceability**. A **legal contradiction** in this category arises when a required legal disclosure is **placed in an irrelevant or misleading section**, making it difficult for parties to locate or interpret.\\n    5. Inconsistencies Legal Contradiction: Inconsistencies arise when **time-sensitive obligations** in a contract do not align with legal requirements. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract sets **a deadline or requirement that violates federal or state law**, making the contractual terms unenforceable or illegal.\\n    \\n    ---\\n\\n    ### Your Task (Strict Instructions):\\n\\n    1. Analyze all the provided inputs thoroughly, along with the definitions to understand what perturbation type was used.\\n    2. Focus your contradiction assessment on the following 5 core elements:\\n       - Scraped Law Snippet 1\\n       - Scraped Law Snippet 2\\n       - Perturbation Explanation\\n       - Law Explanation\\n       - The comparison between the Original and Changed Text\\n\\n    3. Use **both scraped law snippets**, even if one is missing, short, or incomplete. If both are valid, use both to strengthen your understanding of the law\u2019s scope and language.\\n\\n    4.

This contradicts the FTC Act, which, according to Scraped Law Snippet 1, aims to 'prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce'. The modified language makes it more difficult to enforce compliance with guidelines designed to prevent such practices, as the Distributor can argue that it 'endeavored' or 'encouraged' compliance without actually ensuring it. Scraped Law Snippet 2 references 15 USC 45 regarding 'Unfair methods of competition unlawful; prevention by Commission', reinforcing the legal obligation to prevent unfair practices, an obligation that is undermined by the weakening of the compliance mandate in the modified text.\"\n",

The original contract mandates \\\"all commercially reasonable actions required,\\\" whereas the changed text only requires the Receiving Party to \\\"endeavor to take actions it believes are commercially reasonable.\\\" This introduces a subjective standard, allowing the Receiving Party to take minimal action and still technically comply with the contract, undermining the 'reasonable efforts' standard.

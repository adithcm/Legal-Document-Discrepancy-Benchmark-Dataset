        "explanation": "The original text requires 30 days' written notice for termination. Reducing this to 7 days may conflict with state laws requiring longer notice periods for contract terminations, depending on the specific jurisdiction and nature of the agreement. Many states require 30 days or more for terminating contracts involving ongoing business relationships.",

On or before the Lease Commencement Date for any Schedule, the Company shall present to Lessor documentation (\"Purchase Documentation\"), in form and substance satisfactory to Lessor in its sole discretion, which (i) describes all units of Equipment ordered, received and accepted by the Company as agent for Lessor in connection with such Schedule, and (ii) if Company has paid any Supplier for any of the Equipment, includes evidence of the Purchase Price paid to Supplier for each such unit of Equipment and of passage of title thereto to Lessor. Upon the latter of (A) Lessor's receipt of the Purchase Documentation or (B) the satisfaction of all conditions precedent on or after the applicable Lease Commencement Date, Lessor shall pay the Supplier or reimburse the Company, as the case may be, for the aggregate Purchase Price for all Equipment purchased hereunder in connection with such schedule.",
        "changed_text": "Section 2.03 Payment of Purchase Price. The Company shall present documentation at its convenience. The Lessor will pay the Supplier or reimburse the Company for the aggregate Purchase Price within 120 days of the Lease Commencement Date.",
        "explanation": "The original text states that payment will occur upon receipt of documentation or satisfaction of conditions precedent, tied to the Lease Commencement Date. Delaying payment to within 120 days of the Lease Commencement Date contradicts typical prompt payment laws. Also, original text stipulates documentation to be satisfactory to Lessor. Removing the requirement of Lessor's approval and giving the Company discretion to present documentation 'at its convenience' introduces ambiguity and potential delays, further conflicting with business norms and potentially state laws regarding timely payment.",

        "original_text": "8. Term of Joint Venture. The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than thirty (30) days prior to scheduled termination.",
        "changed_text": "8. Term of Joint Venture. The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than ten (10) days prior to scheduled termination.",
        "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for extending the joint venture from 30 days to 10 days before termination could be problematic. While there isn't a specific statutory requirement mandating 30 days for all contract extensions in Pennsylvania, such a short period may be deemed commercially unreasonable in some contexts, especially considering the complexities often involved in joint ventures. This could open the contract up to challenges based on fairness and good faith.",

        "law_explanation": "Pennsylvania law implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing in every contract. While not directly violating a specific statute, the shortened 10-day notice period might be construed as a failure to act in good faith, especially if one party is disadvantaged by the limited time to assess and agree to the extension. Courts in Pennsylvania consider the reasonable expectations of parties when determining if good faith has been breached.",

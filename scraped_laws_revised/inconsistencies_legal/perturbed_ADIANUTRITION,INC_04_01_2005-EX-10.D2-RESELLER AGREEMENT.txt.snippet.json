Detto shall pay PivX a late charge on outstanding amounts due equal to one and one-half percent (1.50%) per month or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less. All payments shall be made in United States Dollars, free of any withholding tax and of any currency control or other restrictions to PivX.",

        "law_explanation": "California's usury law sets limits on the interest rates that can be charged on loans and debts. The modified text specifies a late charge of 2% per month. The permissible rate depends on various factors, including whether the lender is a licensed financial institution. The change may be considered usurious depending on these factors and the current market interest rates. Note that the law states \"the rate of interest upon a judgment rendered in any court of this state shall be set by statute\".",

This Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach of this Agreement by the other party that is not cured within thirty (30) days of the other party's receipt of written notice of such breach. If a material breach is cured within a thirty (30) day cure period this Agreement shall remain in effect as if no material breach had occurred. This Agreement shall terminate automatically without notice and without further action by the other party in the event that the other party becomes insolvent, which means it becomes unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business as they come due, or makes an assignment of this Agreement for the benefit of creditors.",

        "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination for convenience and the cure period for material breach to 10 days could be deemed unconscionable, violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under California law, especially if Detto has made significant investments based on the agreement.",

        "law_explanation": "Under California law, every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This means neither party can do anything to injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement. Reducing the notice and cure periods to 10 days may be seen as a violation of this covenant if it deprives Detto of a reasonable opportunity to remedy a breach or impairs Detto's ability to benefit from the contract, especially considering potential investments made by Detto in reliance on the agreement. While the contract does not explicitly mention good faith, this provision is implied under California law. Under the commercial code, 'Good faith' means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.",

What constitutes a reasonable time depends on the nature, purpose, and circumstances of the action. For complex software, 2 days may be considered an unreasonably short time to adequately inspect the delivered software for damages or missing portions, especially if thorough testing is needed.

        "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to 24 months may be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable under California Business and Professions Code Section 16600, particularly if the consultant's role does not involve access to critical trade secrets or confidential information.

        "explanation": "Removing the written notice requirement before termination could conflict with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in California contracts.

        "law_explanation": "Under California law, every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires that neither party do anything that injures the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement. While a contract may allow for termination at will, exercising that right without any notice whatsoever could be seen as a violation of this covenant if it demonstrably harms the other party, as it deprives them of the ability to arrange their affairs accordingly.",

Depending on the exact setting, good faith may require an honest belief or purpose, faithful performance of duties , observance of fair dealing standards, or an absence of fraudulent intent . A fiduciary relationship creates a duty of good faith between the agent and the principal . The breach of this duty of good faith can lead to liability . Failure to act in good faith is known as bad faith and is generally considered to be a level of culpability greater than negligence .

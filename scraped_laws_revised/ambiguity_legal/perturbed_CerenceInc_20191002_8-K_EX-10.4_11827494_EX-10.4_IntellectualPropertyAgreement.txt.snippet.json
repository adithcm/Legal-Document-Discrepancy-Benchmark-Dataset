        "original_text": "The relevant assignee Party shall have the sole responsibility, at its sole cost and expense, to file the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements and any other forms or documents with the appropriate Governmental Authorities as required to record the transfer of any registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP that is allocated under the Separation Agreement, as applicable, and the relevant assignor Party hereby consents to such recordation.",
        "changed_text": "The relevant assignee Party shall endeavor to file the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements and any other forms or documents with Governmental Authorities, as deemed reasonably necessary, to facilitate the recordation of the transfer of any registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP allocated under the Separation Agreement, as applicable, and the relevant assignor Party consents to such recordation if practical.",
        "explanation": "The change from 'shall have the sole responsibility' to 'shall endeavor to file' introduces ambiguity, weakening the obligation to file the necessary documents. The phrase 'as deemed reasonably necessary' introduces subjectivity, and 'if practical' provides an escape clause, making enforcement difficult. This may result in failure to properly record IP transfers.",

        "explanation": "The change from 'shall use reasonable best efforts' to 'will consider using reasonable efforts, where practical' significantly weakens the obligation. Furthermore, replacing 'reasonably necessary, proper or advisable' with 'deemed generally helpful' introduces subjectivity and lacks a clear standard. The use of 'potentially consummate' further weakens the commitment to completing the transactions.

        "law_explanation": "DGCL Section 141(a) requires that the business and affairs of a corporation be managed 'by or under the direction of a board of directors'. This management requires a certain level of due diligence, which could be interpreted as more than just 'considering' actions 'deemed generally helpful'.

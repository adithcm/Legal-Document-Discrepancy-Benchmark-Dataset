        "explanation": "The addition of 'endeavor to comply' and 'what it reasonably believes' introduces ambiguity and makes compliance discretionary. It allows the subcontractor to argue that they complied based on their own subjective interpretation of the law.",

        "law_explanation": "OSHA regulations require strict compliance with safety standards. By using the phrase 'endeavor to comply,' the modified text suggests that only a good-faith effort is necessary, rather than full adherence to the law, which is a violation. 29 CFR 1926.20(b)(1) states that 'It shall be the responsibility of the employer to initiate and maintain such programs as may be necessary to comply with this part.' which expects a high degree of commitment from the employer/subcontractor to comply with OSHA standards.",

        "explanation": "The phrases \"commercially reasonable efforts\" and \"what it deems necessary\" make the obligation to obtain necessary permits and licenses vague. It could be argued that if obtaining a permit proves difficult or expensive, the subcontractor has met their obligation by simply trying, even if they ultimately fail to secure the permit.",

        "law_explanation": "This section requires specific licensing for various professions to ensure competence and public safety. By allowing the subcontractor to determine what is 'necessary', it contradicts the state's legal requirement for mandatory licensing to perform certain types of work. The specific licensing requirements vary by occupation but failure to hold a license where required is a violation of the Texas Occupations Code.",

        "explanation": "The terms 'attempt to pay' and 'endeavor to keep...reasonably free' weaken the obligation to pay for services/materials and keep the worksites free of liens. They suggest that the subcontractor is not absolutely responsible for preventing liens, introducing uncertainty.",

It protects subcontractors and suppliers by allowing them to file mechanic's liens against the property if they are not paid.

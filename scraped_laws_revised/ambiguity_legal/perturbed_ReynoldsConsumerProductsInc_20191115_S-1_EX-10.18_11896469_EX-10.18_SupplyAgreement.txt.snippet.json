The Party is formed, registered, licensed and operating its business in compliance with the laws of the United States of America, its states and territories, and any districts, municipalities and other political subdivisions of the foregoing (\"Applicable Laws\").",

The Party is formed, registered, licensed and operating its business in general compliance with the laws of the United States of America, its states and territories, and any districts, municipalities and other political subdivisions of the foregoing (\"Applicable Laws\").",
        "explanation": "The original text mandates strict compliance with all laws. By changing \"in compliance\" to \"in general compliance,\" we introduce ambiguity. 'General compliance' doesn't define the level of adherence required and opens the door to interpretation, potentially allowing the party to fall short of full compliance without technically breaching the warranty.",

        "law_explanation": "Section 404 of SOX requires companies to establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting. This necessitates strict adherence to laws and regulations to ensure accurate financial reporting. 'General compliance' is not enough, creating a loophole to not fully meet SOX requirements.",

Has been manufactured, packaged, labelled, sold and delivered by Seller, and may be sold by Buyer in interstate commerce, in compliance with Applicable Laws, including without limitation with food safety regulations issued by the United States Food and Drug Administration that are applicable to the product. Seller will not be in breach of this warranty because an Applicable Law prohibits, restricts or imposes a charge on a product in a district, municipality or other political subdivision of the United States of America or its states or territories.",
        "changed_text": "c.

Seller will not be in breach of this warranty because an Applicable Law prohibits, restricts or imposes a charge on a product in a district, municipality or other political subdivision of the United States of America or its states or territories.",
        "explanation": "Changing 'in compliance' to 'in substantial compliance' introduces ambiguity. It's unclear what level of compliance constitutes 'substantial compliance,' making the legal obligation less stringent. Also changing 'that are applicable' to 'that are generally applicable' creates vagueness as to which rules are relevant.",

        "law_explanation": "The FD&C Act requires strict compliance with food safety regulations. The modification to 'substantial compliance' and 'generally applicable' weakens the requirement, creating a potential violation of the FD&C Act, which does not allow for subjective interpretations of its standards.",

Commercial General Liability Insurance. Occurrence based coverage with a combined single limit of at least $10,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate for premises and operations; products and completed operations; contractual liability coverage for indemnities of a Party contained within this Agreement; broad form property damage (including completed operations); explosion, collapse and underground hazards; and personal injury.

        "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, each Party will maintain insurance coverage, including Commercial General Liability Insurance, with a combined single limit of approximately $10,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate for premises and operations; products and completed operations; contractual liability coverage for indemnities of a Party contained within this Agreement; broad form property damage (including completed operations); explosion, collapse and underground hazards; and personal injury. Requires additional insured endorsement and a reasonable effort towards a waiver of subrogation endorsement.",
        "explanation": "Changing 'at least $10,000,000' to 'approximately $10,000,000' and 'waiver of subrogation endorsement' to 'a reasonable effort towards a waiver of subrogation endorsement' introduces vagueness. It's unclear what 'approximately' means and what constitutes a 'reasonable effort,' making the insurance requirement less enforceable.",

        "law_explanation": "State insurance codes often mandate specific minimum coverage requirements and conditions. The 'approximately' wording and 'reasonable effort' clause provide loopholes that allow parties to deviate from legally mandated levels and conditions, potentially violating state insurance regulations. For example, the Illinois Insurance Code outlines specific requirements for liability coverage that 'approximately' may undermine.",

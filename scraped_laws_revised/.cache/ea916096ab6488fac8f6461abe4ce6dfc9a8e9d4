Form W-4P is now used only to make withholding elections for periodic pension or annuity payments. Previously, Form W-4P was also used to make withholding elections for nonperiodic payments and eligible rollover distributions. Withholding elections for nonperiodic payments and eligible rollover distributions are now made on Form W-4R, Withholding Certificate for Nonperiodic Payments and Eligible Rollover Distributions.

This information is now included in Pub. 15-T with the Percentage Method and Wage Bracket Method withholding tables. However, the IRS is no longer providing the Formula Tables for Percentage Method Withholding (for Automated Payroll Systems); Wage Bracket Percentage Method Tables (for Automated Payroll Systems); or the Combined Federal Income Tax, Employee Social Security Tax, and Employee Medicare Tax Withholding Tables.</p>

However, the exclusion is still available in the case of a member of the U.S. Armed Forces on active duty who moves because of a permanent change of station due to a military order. The exclusion applies only to reimbursement of moving expenses that the member could deduct if they had paid or incurred them without reimbursement. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Moving Expenses</em></span> in Pub. 3, Armed Forces’ Tax Guide, for the definition of what constitutes a permanent change of station and to learn which moving expenses are deductible.</p>

<p class="item"><a name="en_US_2025_publink100012629"></a><b>No federal income tax withholding on disability payments for injuries incurred as a direct result of a terrorist attack directed against the United States. </b>Disability payments (including Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments) for injuries incurred as a direct result of a terrorist attack directed against the United States (or its allies) aren't included in income. Because federal income tax withholding is only required when a payment is includible in income, no federal income tax should be withheld from these payments. See Pub. 907, Tax Highlights for Persons With Disabilities; and Pub. 3920, Tax Relief for Victims of Terrorist Attacks.</p>

Generally, an EFT is made using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). If you don't want to use EFTPS, you can arrange for your tax professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other trusted third party to make electronic deposits on your behalf. Also, you may arrange for your financial institution to initiate a same-day wire payment on your behalf. EFTPS is a free service provided by the Department of the Treasury. Services provided by your tax professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other third party may have a fee.For more information on making federal tax deposits, see <span class="emphasis"><em>How To Deposit</em></span> in Pub. 15.

<a class="indexterm" name="idm140619177924160"></a>

<p>People such as doctors, veterinarians, and auctioneers who work in an independent trade, business, or profession in which they offer their services to the public are generally not employees. However, whether such people are employees or independent contractors depends on the facts in each case. The general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if you, the person for whom the services are performed, have the right to control or direct only the result of the work and not the means and methods of accomplishing the result.</p>

<a class="indexterm" name="idm140619180810016"></a>

<p>Under common-law rules, anyone who performs services for you is generally your employee if you have the right to control what will be done and how it will be done. This is so even when you give the employee freedom of action. What matters is that you have the right to control the details of how the services are performed. For a discussion of facts that indicate whether an individual providing services is an independent contractor or employee, see <a class="xmlbc-link" href="#en_US_2025_publink1000169489" id="en_US_2025_publink1000169468" title="2. Employee or Independent Contractor?">section 2</a>.</p>

<p class="p-block">If you have an employer-employee relationship, it makes no difference how it is labeled. The substance of the relationship, not the label, governs the worker's status. It doesn't matter whether the individual is employed full time or part time.</p>

<p class="p-block">For employment tax purposes, no distinction is made between classes of employees. Superintendents, managers, and other supervisory personnel are all employees. An officer of a corporation is generally an employee; however, an officer who performs no services or only minor services, and neither receives nor is entitled to receive any pay, isn't considered an employee. A director of a corporation isn't an employee with respect to services performed as a director.<a class="indexterm" name="idm140619178368352"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="idm140619179020416"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="idm140619177937152"></a></p>

<p class="p-block">You generally have to withhold and pay income, social security, and Medicare taxes on wages that you pay to common-law employees. However, the wages of certain employees may be exempt from one or more of these taxes. See <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="xmlbc-link" href="#en_US_2025_publink1000169523" id="en_US_2025_publink1000169469" title="3.

<p>To determine whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor under the common-law rules, the relationship of the worker and the business must be examined. In any employee-independent contractor determination, all information that provides evidence of the degree of control and the degree of independence must be considered.</p>

<p class="p-block">Facts that provide evidence of the degree of control and independence fall into three categories: behavioral control, financial control, and the type of relationship of the parties. These facts are discussed next.</p>

<a class="indexterm" name="idm140619180831344"></a>

<p>Special rules apply to the treatment of ministers for social security and Medicare tax purposes. An exemption from social security and Medicare taxes is available for ministers and certain other religious workers and members of certain recognized religious sects. For more information on getting an exemption, see Pub. 517.</p>

<p class="inlinehd"><strong>Ministers.</strong></p>
<span class="inlinep"><a class="indexterm" name="idm140619179399152"></a></span>

<p><span class="inlinep">Ministers are individuals who are duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed by a religious body constituting a church or church denomination.

Employee or Independent Contractor?">section 2</a> should be applied to determine whether a minister is your employee or is self-employed. Whether the minister is an employee or self-employed, the earnings of a minister aren't subject to federal income, social security, and Medicare tax withholding. However, even if the minister is a common-law employee, the earnings as reported on the minister's Form 1040 or 1040-SR are subject to self-employment tax and federal income tax. You don't withhold these taxes from wages earned by a minister, but if the minister is your employee, you may agree with the minister to voluntarily withhold tax to cover the minister's liability for self-employment tax and federal income tax. For more information, see Pub. 517.</span></p>

<p><span class="inlinep">If your minister is an employee, report all taxable compensation as wages in box 1 of Form W-2. Include in this amount expense allowances or reimbursements paid under a nonaccountable plan, discussed in section 5 of Pub. 15. Don't include a parsonage allowance (excludable housing allowance) in this amount. You may report a designated parsonage or rental allowance (housing allowance) and a utilities allowance, or the rental value of housing provided in a separate statement or in box 14 of Form W-2. Don't show on Form W-2, Form 941, or Form 944 any amount as social security or Medicare wages, or any withholding for social security or Medicare tax. If you withheld federal income tax from the minister under a voluntary agreement, this amount should be shown in box 2 of Form W-2 as federal income tax withheld. For more information on ministers, see Pub. 517. </span></p>

<p class="inlinehd"><strong>Exemptions for ministers and others.</strong></p>

<p><span class="inlinep">Certain ordained ministers, Christian Science practitioners, and members of religious orders who haven't taken a vow of poverty may apply to exempt their earnings from self-employment tax on religious grounds. The application must be based on conscientious opposition because of personal considerations to public insurance that makes payments in the event of death, disability, old age, or retirement, or that makes payments toward the cost of, or provides services for, medical care, including social security and Medicare benefits. The exemption applies only to qualified services performed for the religious organization. See Revenue Procedure 91-20, 1991-1 C.B. 524, for guidelines to determine whether an organization is a religious order or whether an individual is a member of a religious order.</span></p>

<p class="p-block"><span class="inlinep">To apply for the exemption, the employee should file Form 4361. See Pub. 517 for more information about claiming an exemption from self-employment tax using Form 4361. </span></p>

<p><span class="inlinep">If you belong to a recognized religious sect or to a division of such sect that is opposed to insurance, you may qualify for an exemption from the self-employment tax. To qualify, you must be conscientiously opposed to accepting the benefits of any public or private insurance that makes payments because of death, disability, old age, or retirement, or makes payments toward the cost of, or provides services for, medical care (including social security and Medicare benefits). If you buy a retirement annuity from an insurance company, you won't be eligible for this exemption. Religious opposition based on the teachings of the sect is the only legal basis for the exemption. In addition, your religious sect (or division) must have existed since December 31, 1950.</span></p>

<p>If an employee is given a temporary work assignment away from their regular place of work, certain travel expenses reimbursed or paid directly by the employer in accordance with an accountable plan (see section 5 of Pub. 15) may be excludable from the employee’s wages. Generally, a temporary work assignment in a single location is one that is realistically expected to last (and does in fact last) for 1 year or less. If the employee’s new work assignment is indefinite, any living expenses reimbursed or paid by the employer (other than qualified moving expenses paid to a member of the U.S. Armed Forces on active duty who moves because of a permanent change of station due to a military order) must be included in the employee’s wages as compensation.

<p>Don't withhold federal income, social security, or Medicare tax on the fair market value of an employee achievement award if it is excludable from your employee's gross income. To be excludable from your employee's gross income, the award must be tangible personal property given to an employee for length of service or safety achievement, awarded as part of a meaningful presentation, and awarded under circumstances that don't indicate that the payment is disguised compensation. Excludable employee achievement awards also aren't subject to FUTA tax.</p>

<p class="p-block">The exclusion doesn’t apply to awards of cash, cash equivalents, gift cards, gift coupons, or gift certificates (other than arrangements granting only the right to select and receive tangible personal property from a limited assortment of items preselected or preapproved by you). The exclusion also doesn’t apply to vacations, meals, lodging, tickets to theater or sporting events, stocks, bonds, other securities, and other similar items.</p>

<p class="inlinehd"><strong>Limits.</strong></p>

<p><span class="inlinep">The most that you can exclude for the cost of all employee achievement awards to the same employee for the year is $400. A higher limit of $1,600 applies to qualified plan awards. Qualified plan awards are employee achievement awards under a written plan that doesn't discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. An award can't be treated as a qualified plan award if the average cost per recipient of all awards under all of your qualified plans is more than $400.</span></p>

<p class="p-block"><span class="inlinep">If during the year an employee receives awards not made under a qualified plan and also receives awards under a qualified plan, the exclusion for the total cost of all awards to that employee can't be more than $1,600. The $400 and $1,600 limits can't be added together to exclude more than $1,600 for the cost of awards to any one employee during the year.</span></p>

<p>Only amounts that you pay as a qualified scholarship to a candidate for a degree may be excluded from the recipient's gross income. A qualified scholarship is any amount granted as a scholarship or fellowship that is used for:</p>

<p></p>

<p class="p-block">The exclusion from income doesn't apply to the portion of any amount received that represents payment for teaching, research, or other services required as a condition of receiving the scholarship or tuition reduction. These amounts are reportable on Form W-2. However, the exclusion will still apply for any amount, despite any service condition attached to the amount, received under the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program; the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship and Financial Assistance Program; and a comprehensive student work-learning-service program operated by a work college, as defined in section 448(e) of the Higher Education Act of 1965.</p>

<p class="p-block">Any amounts that you pay for room and board aren't excludable from the recipient's gross income. A qualified scholarship isn't subject to social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes, or federal income tax withholding. For more information, see Pub. 970, Tax Benefits for Education.</p>

<a class="indexterm" name="idm140619183171760"></a>

<p>If you provide outplacement services to your employees to help them find new employment (such as career counseling, resume assistance, or skills assessment), the value of these benefits may be income to them and subject to all withholding taxes. However, the value of these services won't be subject to any employment taxes if:</p>

<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
	<li class="listitem">
	<p>You derive a substantial business benefit from providing the services (such as improved employee morale or business image) separate from the benefit that you would receive from the mere payment of additional compensation, and</p>

	<p>The employee would be able to deduct the cost of the services as employee business expenses if they had paid for them.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p></p>

<p class="p-block">However, if you receive no additional benefit from providing the services, or if the services aren't provided on the basis of employee need, then the value of the services is treated as wages and is subject to federal income tax withholding and social security and Medicare taxes. Similarly, if an employee receives the outplacement services in exchange for reduced severance pay (or other taxable compensation), then the amount the severance pay is reduced is treated as wages for employment tax purposes.</p>

<a class="indexterm" name="idm140619179553376"></a>

<p>If you pay, under a plan, supplemental unemployment compensation benefits to a former employee, all or part of the payments may be taxable and subject to federal income tax withholding, depending on how the plan is funded. Amounts that represent a return to the employee of amounts previously subject to tax aren't taxable and aren't subject to withholding. You should withhold federal income tax on the taxable part of the payments made, under a plan, to an employee who is involuntarily separated because of a reduction in force, discontinuance of a plant or operation, or other similar condition. It doesn't matter whether the separation is temporary or permanent.</p>

<p class="p-block">There are special rules that apply in determining whether supplemental unemployment compensation benefits are excluded from wages for social security, Medicare, and FUTA tax purposes. To be excluded from wages for such purposes, the benefits must meet the following requirements.</p>

<a class="indexterm" name="idm140619179686656"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idm140619178330896"></a>

<p>A golden parachute payment, in general, is a payment made under a contract entered into by a corporation and key personnel. Under the agreement, the corporation agrees to pay certain amounts to its key personnel in the event of a change in ownership or control of the corporation. Payments to employees under golden parachute contracts are subject to social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes, and federal income tax withholding. See Regulations section 1.280G-1 for more information.</p>

<p class="p-block">No deduction is allowed to the corporation for any excess parachute payment. To determine the amount of the excess parachute payment, you must first determine if there is a parachute payment for purposes of section 280G. A parachute payment for purposes of section 280G is any payment that meets all of the following.</p>

<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
	<li class="listitem">
	<p>The payment is in the nature of compensation.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="listitem">
	<p>The payment is to, or for the benefit of, a disqualified individual. A disqualified individual is anyone who at any time during the 12-month period prior to, and ending on, the date of the change in ownership or control of the corporation (the disqualified individual determination period) was an employee or independent contractor and was, in regard to that corporation, a shareholder, an officer, or a highly compensated individual.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="listitem">
	<p>The payment is contingent on a change in ownership of the corporation, the effective control of the corporation, or the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the corporation.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="listitem">
	<p>The payment has an aggregate present value of at least three times the individual's base amount. The base amount is the average annual compensation for service includible in the individual's gross income over the most recent 5 tax years.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p></p>

<p class="p-block">An excess parachute payment amount is the excess of any parachute payment over the base amount. For more information, see Regulations section 1.280G-1. The recipient of an excess parachute payment is subject to a 20% nondeductible excise tax. If the recipient is an employee, the 20% excise tax is to be withheld by the corporation.</p>

<div class="example">
<p class="title"><strong>Example.</strong></p>

<p>An officer of a corporation receives a golden parachute payment of $400,000. This is more than three times greater than their average compensation of $100,000 over the previous 5-year period. The excess parachute payment is $300,000 ($400,000 minus $100,000). The corporation can't deduct the $300,000 and must withhold the excise tax of $60,000 (20% of $300,000).</p>

<p>In general, if an employer lends an employee more than $10,000 at an interest rate less than the current applicable federal rate (AFR), the difference between the interest paid and the interest that would be paid under the AFR is considered additional compensation to the employee. This rule applies to a loan of $10,000 or less if one of its principal purposes is the avoidance of federal tax.</p>

<p>This additional compensation to the employee is subject to social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes, but not to federal income tax withholding. Include it in compensation on Form W-2 (or Form 1099-NEC for an independent contractor). The AFR is established monthly and published by the IRS each month in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. You can get these rates by going to <a class="ulink" href="https://www.irs.gov" target="_top" rel="noopener">IRS.gov</a> and entering “AFR” in the search box.

<a class="indexterm" name="idm140619181024496"></a>

<p>If you establish a leave-sharing plan for your employees that allows them to transfer leave to other employees for medical emergencies, the amounts paid to the recipients of the leave are considered wages. These amounts are includible in the gross income of the recipients and are subject to social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes, and federal income tax withholding. Don't include these amounts in the wages of the transferors. These rules apply only to leave-sharing plans that permit employees to transfer leave to other employees for medical emergencies.</p>

<p class="p-block">In addition, you may establish a leave-sharing plan that allows your employees to deposit leave in an employer-sponsored leave bank for use by other employees who have been adversely affected by a major disaster. Under such programs, the IRS won’t assert that a leave donor who deposits leave in the employer-sponsored leave bank under a major disaster leave-sharing program has income, wages, compensation, or rail wages for the deposited leave if the plan treats the employer’s payments to the leave recipient as wages or compensation for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA), the Railroad Unemployment Repayment Tax (RURT), and federal income tax withholding, unless excluded by another provision of law.

<p>Section 409A provides that all amounts deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plan for all tax years are currently includible in gross income (to the extent the amounts deferred are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not previously included in gross income) and subject to additional taxes, unless certain requirements are met pertaining to, among other things, elections to defer compensation and distributions under an NQDC plan. Section 409A also includes rules that apply to certain trusts or similar arrangements associated with NQDC plans if the trusts or arrangements are located outside the United States or are restricted to the provision of benefits in connection with a decline in the financial health of the plan sponsor, or contributions are made to the trust during certain periods such as when a qualified plan of the service recipient is underfunded. Employers must withhold federal income tax (but not the additional section 409A taxes) on any amount includible in gross income under section 409A. Income included under section 409A from an NQDC plan must be reported on Form W-2 or Form 1099-MISC, whichever applies. Amounts deferred during the year under an NQDC plan subject to section 409A may also be reported on the Form W-2 or Form 1099-MISC, but this isn’t required. For more information, see the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3 and the Instructions for Forms 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC. These reporting rules don't affect the application or reporting of social security, Medicare, or FUTA tax.</p>

<p class="p-block">The provisions don't prevent the inclusion of amounts in income or wages under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or common-law principles, such as when amounts are actually or constructively received or irrevocably contributed to a separate fund. For more information about NQDC plans, see Regulations sections 1.409A-1 through 1.409A-6. Notice 2008-113 provides guidance on the correction of certain operation failures of an NQDC plan.

<p>A sick pay plan is a plan or system established by an employer under which sick pay is available to employees generally or to a class or classes of employees. This doesn't include a situation in which benefits are provided on a discretionary or occasional basis with merely an intention to aid particular employees in time of need.</p>

<p class="p-block">You have a sick pay plan or system if the plan is in writing or is otherwise made known to employees, such as by a bulletin board notice or your long and established practice. Some indications that you have a sick pay plan or system include references to the plan or system in the contract of employment, employer contributions to a plan, or segregated accounts for the payment of benefits.</p>

<p><span class="inlinep">An employer's agent is a third party that bears no insurance risk and is reimbursed on a cost-plus-fee basis for payment of sick pay and similar amounts. A third party may be your agent even if the third party is responsible for determining which employees are eligible to receive payments. For example, if a third party provides administrative services only, the third party is your agent. If the third party is paid an insurance premium and isn't reimbursed on a cost-plus-fee basis, the third party isn't your agent. Whether an insurance company or other third party is your agent depends on the terms of their agreement with you.</span></p>

<p class="p-block"><span class="inlinep">A third party that makes payments of sick pay as your agent isn't considered the employer and generally has no responsibility for employment taxes. This responsibility remains with you. However, under an exception to this rule, the parties may enter into an agreement that makes the third-party agent responsible for employment taxes. In this situation, the third-party agent should use its own name and employer identification number (EIN) (rather than your name and EIN) for the responsibilities that it has assumed.</span></p>

<p><span class="inlinep">Sick pay paid by you or your agent is subject to mandatory federal income tax withholding. An employer or agent paying sick pay generally determines the federal income tax to be withheld based on the employee's Form W-4. The employee can't choose how much federal income tax will be withheld by giving you or your agent a Form W-4S, Request for Federal Income Tax Withholding From Sick Pay. Sick pay paid by an agent is treated as supplemental wages. If the agent doesn't pay regular wages to the employee, the agent may choose to withhold federal income tax at a flat 22% rate, rather than at the wage withholding rate.

<p><span class="inlinep">Sick pay paid by a third party that isn't your agent isn't subject to mandatory federal income tax withholding. However, an employee may elect to have federal income tax withheld by submitting Form W-4S to the third party.</span></p>

<p class="p-block"><span class="inlinep">If Form W-4S has been submitted, the third party should withhold federal income tax on all payments of sick pay made 8 or more days after receiving the form. The third party may, at its option, withhold federal income tax before 8 days have passed.</span></p>

<p class="p-block"><span class="inlinep">The employee may request on Form W-4S to have a specific whole dollar amount withheld. However, if the requested withholding would reduce any net payment below $10, the third party shouldn't withhold any federal income tax from that payment. The minimum amount of withholding that the employee can specify is $4 per day, $20 per week, or $88 per month based on the payroll period.</span></p>

<p class="p-block"><span class="inlinep">Withhold from all payments at the same rate whether full or partial payments. For example, if $25 is withheld from a regular full payment of $100, then $20 (25%) should be withheld from a partial payment of $80.</span></p>

<p>The depositing and reporting rules for a third party that isn't your agent depend on whether liability has been transferred as discussed under <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="xmlbc-link" href="#en_US_2025_publink1000169568" id="en_US_2025_publink1000268888" title="Third party not employer's agent.">Third party not employer's agent</a></em></span>, earlier in this section.</p>

<p><span class="inlinep">If the third party doesn't satisfy the requirements for transferring liability for FUTA tax and the <span class="bold"><strong>employer</strong></span> part of the social security and Medicare taxes, the third party reports the sick pay on its own Form 940 and Form 941 (or Form 944).

<p class="p-block"><span class="inlinep">Form 941, line 8, must contain a special adjusting entry for social security and Medicare taxes.

<h4 class="title role-hd2"><a name="en_US_2025_publink1000169599"></a>Example of Figuring and Reporting Sick Pay</h4>

<p><span class="bold"><strong>Note.</strong></span> The following example is for wages paid in 2024.</p>

<p class="p-block">Dave, an employee of Edgewood Corporation, was seriously injured in a car accident on January 1, 2024. Dave's last day of work was December 31, 2023. The accident wasn't job related.</p>

<p class="p-block">Key, an insurance company that wasn't an agent of the employer, paid Dave $2,000 sick pay each month for 10 months, beginning in January 2024. Dave submitted a Form W-4S to Key, requesting $210 be withheld from each payment for federal income tax. Dave received no payments from Edgewood from January 2024 through October 2024. Dave returned to work on November 1, 2024.</p>

<p class="p-block">For the policy year in which the car accident occurred, Dave paid a part of the premiums for coverage, and Edgewood paid the remaining part. The plan was, therefore, a “contributory plan.” During the 3 policy years before the calendar year of the accident, Edgewood paid 70% of the total of the net premiums for its employees' insurance coverage, and its employees paid 30%.</p>

<div class="section xmlbc_role" id="en_US_2025_publink1000169600">
<p class="inlinehd"><em><strong>Social security and Medicare taxes.</strong></em></p>

<p><span class="inlinep">For social security and Medicare tax purposes, taxable sick pay was $8,400 ($2,000 per month × 70% (0.70) = $1,400 taxable portion per payment; $1,400 × 6 months = $8,400 total taxable sick pay). Only the six $2,000 checks received by Dave from January through June are included in the calculation. The check received by Dave in July (the seventh check) was received more than 6 months after the month in which Dave last worked.</span></p>

<p class="p-block"><span class="inlinep">Of each $2,000 payment Dave received, 30% ($600) isn't subject to social security and Medicare taxes because the plan is contributory and Dave's after-tax contribution is considered to be 30% of the premiums during the 3 policy years before the calendar year of the accident.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="section xmlbc_role" id="en_US_2025_publink1000169601">
<p class="inlinehd"><em><strong>FUTA tax.</strong></em></p>

<p><span class="inlinep">Of the $8,400 taxable sick pay (figured the same as for social security and Medicare taxes), only $7,000 is subject to the FUTA tax because the FUTA tax contribution base is $7,000.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="section xmlbc_role" id="en_US_2025_publink1000169602">
<p class="inlinehd"><em><strong>Federal income tax withholding.</strong></em></p>

<p><span class="inlinep">Of each $2,000 payment, $1,400 ($2,000 × 70% (0.70)) is subject to voluntary federal income tax withholding. In accordance with Dave's Form W-4S, $210 was withheld from each payment.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="section xmlbc_role" id="en_US_2025_publink1000169603">
<p class="inlinehd"><em><strong>Liability transferred.</strong></em></p>

<p><span class="inlinep">For the first 6 months following the last month in which Dave worked, Key was liable for social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes on any payments that constituted taxable wages. However, Key could have shifted the liability for the <span class="bold"><strong>employer</strong></span> part of the social security and Medicare taxes (and for the FUTA tax) during the first 6 months by withholding Dave's part of the social security and Medicare taxes, timely depositing the taxes, and notifying Edgewood of the payments.</span></p>

<p class="p-block"><span class="inlinep">If Key shifted liability for the <span class="bold"><strong>employer</strong></span> part of the social security and Medicare taxes to Edgewood and provided Edgewood with a sick pay statement, Key wouldn't prepare a Form W-2 for Dave. However, Key would file Form 8922. Key and Edgewood must each prepare Forms 941. Edgewood must also report the sick pay and withholding for Dave on Forms W-2, W-3, and 940.</span></p>

<p class="p-block"><span class="inlinep">As an alternative, the parties could have followed the optional rule described under <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="xmlbc-link" href="#en_US_2025_publink1000169597" id="en_US_2025_publink1000169604" title="Optional rule for Form W-2.">Optional rule for Form W-2</a></em></span>, earlier in this section. Under this rule, Key would prepare Form W-2 even though liability for the <span class="bold"><strong>employer</strong></span> part of the social security and Medicare taxes had been shifted to Edgewood. Also, Key wouldn't prepare a sick pay statement, and Edgewood, not Key, would file Form 8922 reflecting the sick pay shown on Edgewood's Forms 941.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="section xmlbc_role" id="en_US_2025_publink1000169605">
<p class="inlinehd"><em><strong>Liability not transferred.</strong></em></p>

<p><span class="inlinep">If Key didn't shift liability for the <span class="bold"><strong>employer</strong></span> part of the social security and Medicare taxes to Edgewood, Key would prepare Forms W-2 and W-3 as well as Forms 941 and 940. In this situation, Edgewood wouldn't report the sick pay.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="section xmlbc_role" id="en_US_2025_publink1000169606">
<p class="inlinehd"><em><strong>Payments received after 6 months.</strong></em></p>

<p><span class="inlinep">The payments received by Dave in July through October aren't subject to social security, Medicare, or FUTA tax because they were received more than 6 months after the last month in which Dave worked (December 2023). However, Key must continue to withhold federal income tax from each payment because Dave furnished Key with a Form W-4S. Also, Key must prepare Forms W-2 and W-3, unless it has furnished Edgewood with a sick pay statement. If the sick pay statement was furnished, then Edgewood must prepare Forms W-2 and W-3.</span></p>

<p>If two or more related corporations employ the same individual at the same time and pay this individual through a common paymaster that is one of the corporations, the corporations are considered to be a single employer. They have to pay, in total, no more in social security tax than a single employer would pay.</p>

<p class="p-block">If you pay your employee's social security and Medicare taxes without deducting them from the employee's pay, you must include the amount of the payments in the employee's wages for federal income tax withholding and social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes. This increase in the employee's wages for your payment of the employee's social security and Medicare taxes is also subject to employee social security and Medicare taxes. This again increases the amount of the additional taxes you must pay.</p>

<p class="p-block">To figure the employee's increased wages in this situation, divide the stated pay (the amount that you pay without taking into account your payment of employee social security and Medicare taxes) by a factor for that year. This factor is determined by subtracting from 1.0 the combined employee social security and Medicare tax rate for the year that the wages are paid. For 2025, the factor is 0.9235 (1.0 − 0.0765). If the stated pay is more than $162,628.35 (2025 wage base $176,100 × 0.9235), follow the procedure described under <span class="emphasis"><em>Stated pay of more than $162,628.35 in 2025</em></span> below.</p>

<a class="indexterm" name="idm140619180092944"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idm140619214978016"></a>

<p>Generally, federal income tax withholding applies to the taxable part of payments made from pension plans, profit-sharing plans, stock bonus plans, annuity plans, certain deferred compensation plans, IRAs, and commercial annuities. Don't withhold income taxes from amounts totally exempt from tax. If part of a distribution is taxable and part is nontaxable, withhold income taxes only on the part subject to tax when known. The method and rate of withholding depends on (a) the kind of payment; (b) whether the payments are to be delivered outside the United States and its territories; and (c) whether the payee is a nonresident alien individual, a nonresident alien beneficiary, or a foreign estate. Qualified distributions from Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k) plans are nontaxable and, therefore, not subject to withholding. See <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="xmlbc-link" href="#en_US_2025_publink1000107667" id="en_US_2025_publink1000169623" title="Payments Outside the United States and Payments to Foreign Persons">Payments Outside the United States and Payments to Foreign Persons</a></em></span>, later in this section, for special withholding rules that apply to payments outside the United States and payments to foreign persons.</p>

<p>Periodic payments are those made in installments at regular intervals over a period of more than 1 year. They may be paid annually, quarterly, monthly, etc. Withholding from periodic payments of a pension or annuity is generally figured in the same manner as withholding from wages. Form W-4P is used to request withholding on periodic payments. See Pub. 15-T for more information on how to withhold on periodic payments.</p>

<p class="p-block">Don't use Form W-4P or Form W-4R for payments to nonresident aliens, nonresident alien beneficiaries, or foreign estates. In the absence of a treaty exemption, nonresident aliens, nonresident alien beneficiaries, and foreign estates are generally subject to a 30% withholding tax under section 1441 on the taxable portion of a periodic or nonperiodic pension or annuity payment that is from U.S. sources. However, many tax treaties provide that private pensions and annuities are exempt from withholding and tax. Also, payments from certain pension plans are exempt from withholding even if no tax treaty applies. See Pub. 515 and Pub. 519. A foreign person should submit Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals), to you before receiving any payments. The Form W-8BEN must contain the foreign person's taxpayer identification number (TIN) to support a withholding exemption. A TIN for this purpose means a U.S. TIN (SSN or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN)). However, for a claim based on a tax treaty, a foreign TIN may be substituted for a U.S. TIN.</p>

<p>There are several specific requirements for electronic systems set up as a substitute to paper Forms W-4R that are in addition to those described earlier under <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="xmlbc-link" href="#en_US_2025_publink1000281192" id="en_US_2025_publink1000112901" title="Electronic submission of Forms W-4R, W-4S, and W-4V.">Electronic submission of Forms W-4R, W-4S, and W-4V</a></em></span>. Electronic systems must exactly replicate the text from the face of the paper Form W-4R between lines 1 and 2, with the exception that electronic systems that are being used exclusively for nonperiodic payments may omit the second bullet, and systems that are being used exclusively for eligible rollover distributions may omit the first bullet. Electronic systems must also exactly replicate the text on line 2 and the 2025 Marginal Rate Tables (inclusive of all related text above and within the tables) as they appear after the paper Form W-4R. An electronic substitute to Form W-4R can provide a link to a web page with the 2025 Marginal Rate Tables, inclusive of all related text on the first page of the W-4R starting with the text “2025 Marginal Rate Tables,” as well as the applicable Specific Instructions, starting with “Suggestion for determining withholding,” rather than providing the tables (and related first page text) themselves, but the link must be immediately below line 2 on the electronic substitute form and be preceded by the following text: “The link below will take you to the 2025 Marginal Rate Tables. You may use these tables to help you select the appropriate withholding rate for this payment or distribution. Instructions on how to best use them are included.”</p>

<p class="p-block">No pop-ups or hoverboxes are permitted, and if the electronic system has toggles for those steps that limit the amount of text that is viewable, the toggles must be off as the default. If the electronic system places steps on different pages, users must be required to go to each page before they may electronically sign the form. The electronic system must also include a hyperlink to Form W-4R on IRS.gov or include the General and Specific instructions in their entirety in the electronic system interface itself (that is, inclusion of only some of this information requires a link to the form). Specific references on Form W-4R to “page 2” of Form W-4R should be linked to where the information is located.</p>

        "original_text": "15.10 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. Without reference to choice or conflict of law principles, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA. The Parties unconditionally submit to exclusive jurisdiction of and accept as the exclusive venue for any legal proceeding involving this Agreement the state and federal courts located in the County of Los Angeles, California. Before any Party (the \"Complaining Party\") may bring any legal proceeding against the other (the \"Non Complaining Party\"), the Complaining Party shall first make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve all disputes privately by notifying and providing to the Non Complaining Party of the Complaining Party's complaints, reasons and supporting evidence for the complaints, and the reasonable steps Complaining Party would like the Non Complaining Party to take in order to address the complaints. If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles County, California, by an arbitrator of JAMS, in accordance with its arbitration rules and procedures then in effect. Judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing Party in any dispute involving this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the other Party its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees (including any fees for expert witnesses, paralegals, or other legal service providers). This Section 15.10 shall not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.",
        "changed_text": "15.3 Expenses. Each Party shall be responsible for its own costs and expenses in connection with all matters relating to the negotiation and performance of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties. 15.4 Assignment. Neither Newegg nor Allied shall have the right or power to assign or transfer any part of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior consent in writing of the other Party. 15.5 Injunctive Relief. Each Party agrees that money damages for a breach of its obligations under the provisions of this Agreement protecting Confidential Information and those governing Intellectual Property Rights may be an inadequate remedy for the loss suffered by the other Party and the other Party shall have the right to obtain injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in order to prevent the breach, or further breach as the case may be, of any such obligation, without limiting the other Party's right to pursue any and all remedies provided in such event by law or equity. Without reference to choice or conflict of law principles, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA.

        "explanation": "Moving the governing law and jurisdiction clause, including the arbitration agreement, into the middle of clauses discussing unrelated topics like expenses and assignment, makes it less likely to be noticed or understood by a party reviewing the contract. Typically, governing law and dispute resolution are located at the end of the contract in a dedicated section. Placing it in the middle disrupts the standard format and reduces its prominence.",

        "law_explanation": "The FAA favors arbitration agreements, but they must be presented clearly and unambiguously. Moving the arbitration clause to an unexpected location within the 'Expenses' and 'Assignment' sections could be interpreted as an attempt to bury the clause, making it harder to enforce under the FAA because it could be argued that one party did not knowingly agree to arbitration. California law also has similar requirements for conspicuous placement of arbitration clauses.",

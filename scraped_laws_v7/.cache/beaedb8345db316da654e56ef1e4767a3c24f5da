Such proceeds shall be deposited in the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission Operations Fund. If an employer survives or was formed by a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or reincorporation, the actual wages paid in this State of all employers party to the merger, consolidation, reorganization, or reincorporation shall, for purposes of determining the amount of the fee imposed by this Section, be regarded as those of the surviving or new employer.</font></code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code><font size="2" face="Courier New">(b) Beginning on July 30, 2004 (the effective date of Public Act 93-840) and on July 1 of each year thereafter through 2023, the Chairman shall charge and collect an annual Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission Operations Fund Fee from every employer subject to subsection (a) of this Section equal to 0.0075% of its annual actual wages paid in this State as reported in each employer's annual self-insurance renewal filed for the previous year as required by Section 4 of this Act and Section 4 of the Workers' Occupational Diseases Act.

All sums collected by the Commission under the provisions of this Section shall be paid promptly after the receipt of the same, accompanied by a detailed statement thereof, into the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission Operations Fund. The fee due pursuant to Public Act 93-840 shall be collected instead of the fee due on July 1, 2004 under Public Act 93-32.

A credit memorandum may be applied for the 2-year period from the date of issuance against the payment of any amount due during that period under the fee imposed by this Section or, subject to reasonable rule of the Commission including requirement of notification, may be assigned to any other employer subject to regulation under this Act.

as a firefighter, EMT, or paramedic for less than 5 years at the time he or she files an Application for Adjustment of Claim concerning this condition or impairment with the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission. The rebuttable presumption established under this subsection, however, does not apply to an emergency medical technician (EMT), emergency medical technician-intermediate (EMT-I), advanced emergency medical technician (A-EMT), or paramedic employed by a private employer if the employee spends the preponderance of his or her work time for that employer engaged in medical transfers between medical care facilities or non-emergency medical transfers to or from medical care facilities. The changes made to this subsection by Public Act 98-291 shall be narrowly construed. The Finding and Decision of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission under only the rebuttable presumption provision of this subsection shall not be admissible or be deemed res judicata in any disability claim under the Illinois Pension Code arising out of the same medical condition; however, this sentence makes no change to the law set forth in Krohe v. City of Bloomington, 204 Ill.2d 392.

These charges and fees are provider billed amounts and shall not include discounted charges.  The 80th percentile is the point on an ordered data set from low to high such that 80% of the cases are below or equal to that point and at most 20% are above or equal to that point.  The Commission shall adjust these historical charges and fees as of August 1, 2004 by the Consumer Price Index-U for the period August 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005.  The Commission shall establish fee schedules for procedures, treatments, or services for hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, emergency room and trauma, ambulatory surgical treatment centers, and professional services.   These charges and fees shall be designated by geozip or any smaller geographic unit. The data shall in no way identify or tend to identify any patient, employer, or health care provider. As used in this Section, "geozip" means a three-digit zip code based on data similarities, geographical similarities, and frequencies. A geozip does not cross state boundaries. As used in this Section, "three-digit zip code" means a geographic area in which all zip codes have the same first 3 digits. If a geozip does not have the necessary number of charges and fees to calculate a valid percentile for a specific procedure, treatment, or service, the Commission may combine data from the geozip with up to 4 other geozips that are demographically and economically similar and exhibit similarities in data and frequencies until the Commission reaches 9 charges or fees for that specific procedure, treatment, or service.  In cases where the compiled data contains less than 9 charges or fees for a procedure, treatment, or service,  reimbursement shall occur at 76% of charges and fees as determined by the Commission in a manner consistent with the provisions of this paragraph. Providers of out-of-state procedures, treatments, services, products, or supplies shall be reimbursed at the lesser of that state's fee schedule amount or the fee schedule amount for the region in which the employee resides. If no fee schedule exists in that state, the provider shall be reimbursed at the lesser of the actual charge or the fee schedule amount for the region in which the employee resides.  Not later than September 30 in 2006 and each year thereafter, the Commission shall automatically increase or decrease the maximum allowable payment for a procedure, treatment, or service established and in effect on January 1 of that year by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index-U for the 12 month period ending August 31 of that year. The increase or decrease shall become effective on January 1 of the following year. As used in this Section, "Consumer Price Index-U" means the index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor, that measures the average change in prices of all goods and services purchased by all urban consumers, U.S. city average, all items, 1982-84=100.</font></code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code><font size="2" face="Courier New">(a-1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) and unless otherwise indicated, the following provisions shall apply to the medical fee schedule starting on September 1, 2011:</font></code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code><font size="2" face="Courier New">(1) The Commission shall establish and maintain fee </font></code></div></td></tr><tr><td><table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td width="1"><code><font size="2" face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></code></td><td><div align="justify"><code><font size="2" face="Courier New">schedules for procedures, treatments, products, services, or supplies for hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, emergency room, ambulatory surgical treatment centers, accredited ambulatory surgical treatment facilities, prescriptions filled and dispensed outside of a licensed pharmacy, dental services, and professional services.

Said rate of interest shall be set forth in the Arbitrator's Decision. Interest shall be drawn from the date of the arbitrator's award on all accrued compensation due the employee through the day prior to the date of payments.

The employee shall not be required to refund the challenged payment. The decision of the Commission may be reviewed in the same manner as in arbitrated cases. No challenge may be initiated under this paragraph more than 3 years after the payment is made.

Such agreement shall be in writing in such form as provided by the Commission. Applications for adjustment of claim submitted for decision by an arbitrator under this subsection (p) shall proceed according to rule as established by the Commission. The Commission shall promulgate rules including, but not limited to, rules to ensure that the parties are adequately informed of their rights under this subsection (p) and of the voluntary nature of proceedings under this subsection (p). The findings of fact made by an arbitrator acting within his or her powers under this subsection (p) in the absence of fraud shall be conclusive. However, the arbitrator may on his own motion, or the motion of either party, correct any clerical errors or errors in computation within 15 days after the date of receipt of such award of the arbitrator and shall have the power to recall the original award on arbitration, and issue in lieu thereof such corrected award. The decision of the arbitrator under this subsection (p) shall be considered the decision of the Commission and proceedings for review of questions of law arising from the decision may be commenced by either party pursuant to subsection (f) of Section 19. The Advisory Board established under Section 13.1 shall compile a list of certified Commission arbitrators, each of whom shall be approved by at least 7 members of the Advisory Board. The chairman shall select 5 persons from such list to serve as arbitrators under this subsection (p). By agreement, the parties shall select one arbitrator from among the 5 persons selected by the chairman except that if the parties do not agree on an arbitrator from among the 5 persons, the parties may, by agreement, select an arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association, whose fee shall be paid by the State in accordance with rules promulgated by the Commission. Arbitration under this subsection (p) shall be voluntary.</font></code><br><code><font size="2" face="Courier New">(Source: P.A. 102-775, eff. 5-13-22; 103-590, eff. 6-5-24.)</font></code></div></td></tr></table></body></html><br><a style="visibility: hidden" href='/legislation/ilcs/documents/082003050K19.htm'></a><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"><html><head><title>820 ILCS 305/19.1</title></head><body><table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="500"><tr><td><div align="justify"><code><font size="2" face="Courier New">

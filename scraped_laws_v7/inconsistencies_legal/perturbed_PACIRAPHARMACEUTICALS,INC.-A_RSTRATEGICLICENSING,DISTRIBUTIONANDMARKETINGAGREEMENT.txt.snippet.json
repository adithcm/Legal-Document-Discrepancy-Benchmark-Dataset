Delaying the provision of sales data to 45 days could be argued as hindering the ability of the distributor to prepare timely financial reports, especially if the data is critical for revenue recognition or inventory management. Therefore, there is indirect contradiction from this law due to the importance of accurate and timely reports in financial settings.",

These links are provided for the user's convenience and may not reflect all recent amendments. If you have questions concerning the meaning or application of a particular law, please consult with an attorney who specializes in securities law. Securities Act of 1933 Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Trust Indenture Act of 1939 Investment Company Act of 1940 Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 Rules and Regulations Securities Act of 1933 Often referred to as the \"truth in securities\" law, the Securities Act of 1933 has two basic objectives: require that investors receive financial and other significant information concerning securities being offered for public sale; and prohibit deceit, misrepresentations, and other fraud in the sale of securities. See the full text of the Securities Act of 1933 . Purpose of Registration A primary means of accomplishing these goals is the disclosure of important financial information through the registration of securities. This information enables investors, not the government, to make informed judgments about whether to purchase a company's securities. While the SEC requires that the information provided be accurate, it does not guarantee it. Investors who purchase securities and suffer losses have important recovery rights if they can prove that there was incomplete or inaccurate disclosure of important information. The Registration Process In general, securities sold in the U.S. must be registered. The registration forms companies file provide essential facts while minimizing the burden and expense of complying with the law. In general, registration forms call for: a description of the company's properties and business; a description of the security to be offered for sale; information about the management of the company; and financial statements certified by independent accountants. Registration statements and prospectuses become public shortly after filing with the SEC. If filed by U.S. domestic companies, the statements are available on the EDGAR database accessible at www.sec.gov. Registration statements are subject to examination for compliance with disclosure requirements. Not all offerings of securities must be registered with the Commission. Some exemptions from the registration requirement include: private offerings to a limited number of persons or institutions; offerings of limited size; intrastate offerings; and securities of municipal, state, and federal governments. By exempting many small offerings from the registration process, the SEC seeks to foster capital formation by lowering the cost of offering securities to the public. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 With this Act, Congress created the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Act empowers the SEC with broad authority over all aspects of the securities industry. This includes the power to register, regulate, and oversee brokerage firms, transfer agents, and clearing agencies as well as the nation's securities self regulatory organizations (SROs). The various securities exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Stock Market, and the Chicago Board of Options are SROs. The ",

Scraped Law Snippet 1, referring to Rule 13d-2, discusses amendment filings within shorter timeframes (five business days, two business days) under certain circumstances, indicating that 'promptly' may require faster action than 60 days. While Snippet 1 does not explicitly define 'promptly,' the existence of these shorter deadlines implies that a fixed 60-day period could be non-compliant if a material change warrants a more immediate amendment filing. Therefore, the modification introduces a potential contradiction, justifying a score of 0.7."

        "justification": "The changed text backdates the agreement to 2010, while the original was 2020. The Perturbation Explanation and Law Explanation state that this could be considered a false statement regarding the effective date of the agreement. Scraped Law Snippet 1, 17 CFR \u00a7 240.10b-5, explicitly prohibits making \"any untrue statement of a material fact\" in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. Backdating the agreement creates an untrue statement about when the agreement was made, which could be material to investors as it misrepresents the historical context of the agreement, hence constituting a violation. Therefore, there is a strong contradiction, as the change directly conflicts with Rule 10b-5. The score is 0.8, reflecting a strong contradiction because backdating directly violates the prohibition of untrue statements in securities-related contexts."

        "justification": "The changed text reduces the termination window from 90 to 30 days, which the perturbation explanation suggests may be unreasonably short, potentially conflicting with fairness and reasonable notice. The law explanation expands on this by stating that a 30-day window may violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, depending on the complexity of the issue. Scraped Law Snippet 1 supports this, stating that 'Every contract or duty within the Uniform Commercial Code imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement.' While the snippet doesn't specify timeframes, it establishes the principle of good faith, which the reduced timeframe could potentially violate. Therefore, the contradiction score is 0.6, reflecting a moderate likelihood of contradiction, as the reduced timeframe could be seen as a breach of good faith, but the actual determination depends on the specific circumstances and applicable jurisdiction."

        "justification": "The changed text reduces the payment window from one month to two weeks. The Perturbation Explanation suggests this might violate state wage laws if repayment is considered a deduction and the shortened period doesn't allow sufficient processing time. The Law Explanation mentions the Kansas Wage Payment Act and highlights potential issues with a reduced payment timeframe. Since the scraped snippets are missing, a definitive contradiction cannot be established. However, the explanations provided indicate a possible contradiction due to the shortened timeframe impacting the ability to accurately compute and process the repayment, potentially violating wage payment regulations. Therefore, a score of 0.4 is assigned, indicating a possible, but not definitively proven, legal contradiction."

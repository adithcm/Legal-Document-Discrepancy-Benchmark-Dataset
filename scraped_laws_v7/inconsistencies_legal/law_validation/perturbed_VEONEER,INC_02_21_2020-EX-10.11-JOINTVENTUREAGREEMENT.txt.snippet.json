While parties generally have the freedom to choose the governing law, this choice is not absolute and cannot override mandatory provisions of Japanese law, especially if the contract has substantial connections to Japan, as explained in the Law Explanation. Scraped Law Snippet 1, referencing the 'Act on General Rules for Conflict of Laws (Japan),' mentions various regulations and articles related to payment services and fund transfers within Japan. The changed text ignores the potential applicability of these mandatory Japanese regulations by selecting Delaware law. The absence of Scraped Law Snippet 2 doesn't negate the contradiction, as Snippet 1, combined with the Law Explanation, highlights the risk of disregarding mandatory Japanese legal provisions. This creates a moderate contradiction because the enforceability of specific clauses under Delaware law may be challenged if they conflict with Japanese regulations that should otherwise apply."

The Law Explanation specifies that 17 U.S. Code \u00a7 507 provides a three-year statute of limitations for copyright infringement. Scraped Law Snippet 2 defines a statute of limitations as 'any law that bars claims after a certain period of time passes after an injury' and notes that 'the period of time varies depending on the jurisdiction and the type of claim.' The Perturbation Explanation indicates this change introduces a limited period for intellectual property warranty claims which could conflict with the standard statutes of limitations. Because the modified text sets a one-month limit, whereas the provided law suggests statutes of limitations are generally much longer than one month, a strong contradiction exists. While the specific statute isn't explicitly cited, the principle of a longer allowable period is supported by the law snippets. Therefore, the contradiction score is 0.8."

A condition precedent is contrasted with a condition subsequent . In a contract , a condition precedent is an event that must occur before the parties are obligated to perform . For example, an insurance contract may require the insurer to pay to rebuild the customer\u2019s home if it is destroyed by fire during the policy period. The fire is a condition precedent. The fire must occur before the insurer is obligated to pay. Courts prefer to interpret a clause in a contract as a promise rather than a condition precedent to avoid forfeiture . The Second Restatement of Contracts has dropped the term \u201ccondition precedent\u201d and simply refers to it as \u201ccondition.\u201d In property law , a condition precedent is an event at which the vesting of a property interest occurs. If the condition does not occur before a specified time, the condition fails, and the property interest does not vest. For example, if parents write a grant which states they grant the property Blackacre \u201cto our son, if he graduates from college by his 21st birthday\u201d, graduating from college before the son\u2019s 21st birthday is the condition precedent. If the son graduates from college before his 21st birthday, title to Blackacre transfers to him. If the son\u2019s 21st birthday comes and he has not yet graduated from college, the interest never vests, and the parents never lose ownership of Blackacre. Condition precedents are most frequently seen in combination with contingent remainders . Accordingly, conditions precedent are usually subject to the rule against perpetuities which states that they are invalid unless they must vest, if at all, within 21 years after a relevant life in being.

        "justification": "The changed text contradicts the original agreement by removing the condition precedent of the VNBJ and VNBZ closings for the amendment to become effective. The scraped snippet from Wex Law defines a condition precedent as 'an event that must occur before a right, claim, duty, or interests arises' and provides an example of an insurance contract where a fire must occur before the insurer is obligated to pay. In the original text, the VNBJ and VNBZ closings were conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the amendment, similar to the fire example. The changed text makes the amendment effective immediately, regardless of whether these closings occur. This contradicts the principle of condition precedent, as the amendment now becomes effective without the fulfillment of the original conditions. The law explanation also supports this by referencing Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 225, which deals with the effects of the failure of a condition, and stating that the changed text disregards established contract law principles regarding conditions precedent. This leads to uncertainty and potential disputes, justifying a contradiction score of 0.7."

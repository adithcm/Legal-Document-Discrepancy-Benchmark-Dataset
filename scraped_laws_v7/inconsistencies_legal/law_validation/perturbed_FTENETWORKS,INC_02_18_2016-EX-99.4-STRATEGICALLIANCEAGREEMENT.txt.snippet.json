The Law Explanation says Texas law provides a longer statutory timeframe for enforcement of a mechanic's lien, and although the scraped snippets do not directly state a specific timeframe besides for foreclosure, they describe the process for discharging a lien which implicitly takes more than three days. Scraped Law Snippet 1, Sec. 53.157, lists several ways a lien can be discharged, implying that there are processes that take longer than three days. The contradiction is moderately strong because while the snippets don't provide an exact alternative timeframe, they show that the changed text's three-day limit is likely inconsistent with legally permissible actions."

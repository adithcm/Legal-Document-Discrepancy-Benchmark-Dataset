(b) If the court finds just cause for requiring the bond and that the bond is reasonably necessary and proper to secure prompt payment of the wages of the employees of the employer and the employer's compliance with this chapter, the court may enjoin the employer from doing business until the requirement is met. The injunction may also apply to any other person concerned with or in any way participating in the failure to pay wages resulting in the conviction or in a final order of the commission. The court may make any other order appropriate and necessary to compel compliance with the requirement. (c) In an action under this section, the employer has the burden of proving that the bond is unnecessary or that the amount demanded by the commission is excessive.

        "justification": "The changed contract text, extending the payment timeframe to 60 days after the final statement, directly contradicts Texas Labor Code. The Law Explanation states that Texas Labor Code \u00a7 61.051 mandates payment of all wages due by the sixth day after termination. Scraped Law Snippet 1 includes Sec. 61.051, which pertains to wage claims and supports the notion that there are prescribed timeframes for wage payments under Texas law. The change from 30 to 60 days for final payment directly violates the prompt payment requirement outlined in the Law Explanation, creating a strong legal contradiction. While the provided snippet does not explicitly state the 'sixth day' deadline, it does refer to wage claim filings for wages not paid as prescribed in the chapter, and the Law Explanation specifies the timeframe directly contradicting the contract change."

This contradicts the requirement for timely verification under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, as explained in the Law Explanation. Scraped Law Snippet 1, 8 USC 1324a, addresses 'Unlawful employment of aliens,' and while it doesn't explicitly state the 'three days' timeframe, the Law Explanation correctly infers that the Act necessitates a specific timeframe for verification, making the removal of the deadline a violation.

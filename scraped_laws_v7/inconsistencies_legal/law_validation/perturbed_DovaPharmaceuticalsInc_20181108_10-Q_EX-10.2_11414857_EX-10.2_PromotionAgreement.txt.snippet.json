        "original_text": "Meetings of the JSC may be called by either Party on no less than thirty (30) days' notice during the Term. Each Party shall make all proposals for agenda items and shall provide all appropriate information with respect to such proposed items at least ten (10) days in advance to the applicable meeting; provided that under exigent circumstances requiring input by the JSC, a Party may provide its agenda items to the other Party within a shorter period of time in advance of the meeting, or may propose that there not be a specific agenda for that particular meeting, so long as the other Party consents to such later addition of such agenda items or the absence of a specific agenda for such meeting, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The chairperson shall prepare and circulate for review and approval of the Parties minutes of each meeting within thirty (30) days after the meeting.",
        "changed_text": "Meetings of the JSC may be called by either Party on no less than fifteen (15) days' notice during the Term. Each Party shall make all proposals for agenda items and shall provide all appropriate information with respect to such proposed items at least five (5) days in advance to the applicable meeting; provided that under exigent circumstances requiring input by the JSC, a Party may provide its agenda items to the other Party within a shorter period of time in advance of the meeting, or may propose that there not be a specific agenda for that particular meeting, so long as the other Party consents to such later addition of such agenda items or the absence of a specific agenda for such meeting, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The chairperson shall prepare and circulate for review and approval of the Parties minutes of each meeting within sixty (60) days after the meeting.",
        "explanation": "This change reduces the notice period for meetings and agenda items, and increases the time to circulate meeting minutes, which could impede timely dispute resolution and decision-making. Increasing the time to circulate the meeting minutes to 60 days may cause delays in acting on those meetings' decisions.",

        "law_explanation": "The modified text reduces the notice period for JSC meetings to 15 days. While this agreement is not a collective bargaining agreement, the spirit of good-faith bargaining, as described in the NLRA, involves providing adequate notice for discussions. In collective bargaining agreements, compressed timelines for notification can be seen as a failure to bargain in good faith, especially when substantial changes are at stake. This modified text does not inherently create any illegal activity, but may provide circumstances in which either party may not have enough time to adequately prepare for meetings, ultimately not following the good faith effort needed to properly make decisions. By reducing the time to circulate meeting minutes, further delays may occur in addressing issues brought up in the meeting.",

        "justification": "The LLM explanation suggests the reduced notice period and extended circulation of minutes might hinder good-faith efforts in decision-making, drawing a parallel to collective bargaining agreements and the NLRA. However, without relevant scraped snippets, there's no specific legal violation identified. The missing snippets prevent a strong assertion of contradiction, as there's no demonstrable conflict with existing law. The change may lead to practical difficulties, but lacks clear legal contravention based on the provided information."

Trade secrets are protected for as long as they are kept confidential and provide economic value.

        "justification": "The changed text reduces the confidentiality period to one year. The Law Explanation states that the UTSA protects trade secrets as long as they remain confidential and provide a competitive advantage. A one-year confidentiality period may not be sufficient, thus potentially undermining the protections afforded by state law. Scraped Law Snippet 1 mentions the Uniform Law Commission which provides states with legislation to bring clarity and stability to state statutory law. The change in the contract could be seen as contradicting the UTSA's goal of protecting trade secrets for as long as they remain confidential, which the one-year limit may not satisfy. This creates a legal contradiction, but not a very strong one as the contradiction depends on the nature of the trade secret. Scraped Law Snippet 2 contains 'None', and therefore provides no further information about this contradiction."

        "law_explanation": "Many states have Prompt Payment Acts that mandate timely payment for goods and services. While these laws often apply specifically to insurance claims or government contracts, extending the payment timeframe for audit adjustments to 180 days could be considered an unreasonably long delay, violating the principles and intent behind such laws, especially if it causes financial hardship or operational difficulties for the party awaiting payment. States vary greatly on the specifics of prompt payment, making the specific timeframe an area of legal concern.",

        "justification": "The modified text extends the payment timeframe for audit adjustments to 180 days. The Perturbation Explanation suggests this timeframe could violate prompt payment laws in many states. The Law Explanation further elaborates that while prompt payment laws primarily target insurance claims or government contracts, extending payment timeframe to 180 days might be seen as unreasonably long, contravening the intent behind such laws. However, the absence of specific statutory language in the scraped snippets indicating a maximum timeframe for audit adjustments makes it difficult to assert a direct legal contradiction. The absence of specific legal support for a maximum timeframe reduces the strength of the contradiction."

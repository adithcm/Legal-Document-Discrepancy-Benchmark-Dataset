        "justification": "The original contract allows for a flexible distribution timeline following Google's request, indicated by \"[*]\". The changed text sets a fixed 10-day deadline. The Law Explanation suggests this fixed deadline might not satisfy California Labor Code Section 2922's implicit requirement of 'reasonable notice,' depending on the situation. Scraped Law Snippet 1, California Labor Code Section 2922, states that employment with no specified term can be terminated with 'notice to the other.' While the snippet addresses termination, the Law Explanation extends the principle of 'reasonable notice' to changes in work conditions, which the fixed distribution timeline could affect. The change introduces a potential conflict, although the strength of the contradiction depends on specific circumstances, making it a moderate contradiction."

An employer who lays off a group of employees by reason of the termination of seasonal employment in the curing, canning, or drying of any variety of perishable fruit, fish, or vegetables, shall be deemed to have made immediate payment when the wages of said employees are paid within a reasonable time as necessary for computation and payment thereof; provided, however, that the reasonable time shall not exceed 72 hours, and further provided that payment shall be made by mail to any employee who so requests and designates a mailing address therefor.

        "justification": "The changed text sets a rigid 5-day repayment deadline for overpayments, potentially conflicting with fair dispute resolution implied by labor laws. The Perturbation Explanation and Law Explanation both suggest this timeframe could be coercive and insufficient if the overpayment is disputed. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 (California Labor Code Section 201) primarily concerns wage payments upon employee discharge, it highlights the importance of timely and fair wage handling. Although not directly applicable to overpayment disputes between companies, it establishes a principle of fairness in payment matters, suggesting a rapid, inflexible repayment demand could be problematic if challenged. The original text had a [*] timeframe, creating ambiguity, while the changed text imposes a fixed deadline. This shift introduces a potential for conflict and is thus assigned a contradiction score of 0.6."

The periods prescribed for the commencement of actions other than for the recovery of real property, are as follows: 335.1. Within two years: An action for assault, battery, or injury to, or for the death of, an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another. 336. Within five years: (a) An action for mesne profits of real property. (b) An action for violation of a restriction, as defined in Section 784 of the Civil Code. The period prescribed in this subdivision runs from the time the person seeking to enforce the restriction discovered or, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered the violation. A failure to commence an action for violation of a restriction within the period prescribed in this subdivision does not waive the right to commence an action for any other violation of the restriction and does not, in itself, create an implication that the restriction is abandoned, obsolete, or otherwise unenforceable. This subdivision shall not bar commencement of an action for violation of a restriction before January 1, 2001, and until January 1, 2001, any other applicable statutory or common law limitation shall continue to apply to that action. 336a. Within six years. 1. An action upon any bonds, notes or debentures issued by any corporation or pursuant to permit of the Commissioner of Corporations, or upon any coupons issued with such bonds, notes or debentures, if such bonds, notes or debentures shall have been issued to or held by the public. 2. An action upon any mortgage, trust deed or other agreement pursuant to which such bonds, notes or debentures were issued. Nothing in this section shall apply to bonds or other evidences of indebtedness of a public district or corporation. 337. Within four years: 1. An action upon any contract, obligation or liability founded upon an instrument in writing, except as provided in Section 336a of this code; provided, that the time within which any action for a money judgment for the balance due upon an obligation for the payment of which a deed of trust or mortgage with power of sale upon real property or any interest therein was given as security, following the exercise of the power of sale in such deed of trust or mortgage, may be brought shall not extend beyond three months after the time of sale under such deed of trust or mortgage. 2. An action to recover (1) upon a book account whether consisting of one or more entries; (2) upon an account stated based upon an account in writing, but the acknowledgment of the account stated need not be in writing; (3) a balance due upon a mutual, open and current account, the items of which are in writing; provided, however, that where an account stated is based upon an account of one item, the time shall begin to run from the date of said item, and where an account stated is based upon an account of more than one item, the time shall begin to run from the date of the last item. 3. An action based upon the rescission of a contract in writing. The time begins to run from the date upon which the facts that entitle the aggrieved party to rescind occurred. Where the ground for rescission is fraud or mistake, the time does not begin to run until the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake. Where the ground for rescission is misrepresentation under Section 359 of the Insurance Code, the time does not begin to run until the representation becomes false. 337a.

        "justification": "The modified contract extends the audit period to 7 years, while California Code of Civil Procedure Section 337, as shown in both Scraped Law Snippet 1 and Scraped Law Snippet 2, sets a four-year statute of limitations for actions based on written contracts. The Law Explanation accurately states that this extension allows Google to audit records beyond the period for which legal action could be taken to enforce the contract. While the contract doesn't explicitly violate the statute of limitations, it creates a scenario where audits could occur for unenforceable claims, potentially constituting an undue burden. Therefore, a contradiction score of 0.7 is appropriate."

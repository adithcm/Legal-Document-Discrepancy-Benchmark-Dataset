        "original_text": "This Remarketing Agreement may not be amended or modified except by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, each of the parties hereto; provided, however, that in the event that the Securities to be remarketed, or any portion thereof, are modified in such a way so that they no longer require registration under the Act, the Company, the Remarketing Agents and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent hereby agree to promptly enter into an amendment to this Remarketing Agreement containing such representations, warranties and covenants as would normally be required to more accurately reflect an offering of unregistered securities.",
        "changed_text": "This Remarketing Agreement may be amended or modified by a simple majority vote of the Company's Board of Directors. The Board's decision is final and requires no further written consent from other parties, regardless of modifications to the Securities requiring registration under the Act.",
        "explanation": "The original agreement requires written consent from all parties for amendments. The modified text allows amendments by a simple majority vote of the Company's Board of Directors, disregarding the original consent requirement and potentially circumventing securities registration requirements, creating a conflict.",

This section of the NY BCL stipulates that amendments to agreements affecting shareholder rights or obligations generally require proper authorization and cannot be unilaterally imposed, especially when those amendments impact the securities' registration status.",

        "justification": "The changed text alters the amendment process, allowing the Company's Board of Directors to modify the agreement with a simple majority vote, potentially bypassing the original requirement for written consent from all parties. The Law Explanation suggests this contradicts NY BCL \u00a7 367, especially if these amendments impact securities' registration status or shareholder rights. However, Scraped Law Snippet 1 provides 'None', and Snippet 2 leads to a 'Not Found' error, so there is no direct, verifiable legal text to confirm the contradiction of NY BCL \u00a7 367. The lack of specific legal text reduces the contradiction score, despite the changed text's potential violation of established agreement modification practices. Because the changed text weakens the original agreement and potentially circumvents important consent requirements related to securities registration, the score is above neutral."

Serving and Filing Pleadings and Other Papers (a) Service: When Required. (1) In General. Unless these rules provide otherwise, each of the following papers must be served on every party: (A) an order stating that service is required; (B) a pleading filed after the original complaint, unless the court orders otherwise under Rule 5(c) because there are numerous defendants; (C) a discovery paper required to be served on a party, unless the court orders otherwise; (D) a written motion, except one that may be heard ex parte; and (E) a written notice, appearance, demand, or offer of judgment, or any similar paper. (2) If a Party Fails to Appear. No service is required on a party who is in default for failing to appear. But a pleading that asserts a new claim for relief against such a party must be served on that party under Rule 4 . (3) Seizing Property. If an action is begun by seizing property and no person is or need be named as a defendant, any service required before the filing of an appearance, answer, or claim must be made on the person who had custody or possession of the property when it was seized. (b) Service: How Made. (1) Serving an Attorney. If a party is represented by an attorney, service under this rule must be made on the attorney unless the court orders service on the party. (2) Service in General. A paper is served under this rule by: (A) handing it to the person; (B) leaving it: (i) at the person's office with a clerk or other person in charge or, if no one is in charge, in a conspicuous place in the office; or (ii) if the person has no office or the office is closed, at the person's dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there; (C) mailing it to the person's last known address\u2014in which event service is complete upon mailing; (D) leaving it with the court clerk if the person has no known address; (E) sending it to a registered user by filing it with the court's electronic-filing system or sending it by other electronic means that the person consented to in writing\u2014in either of which events service is complete upon filing or sending, but is not effective if the filer or sender learns that it did not reach the person to be served; or (F) delivering it by any other means that the person consented to in writing\u2014in which event service is complete when the person making service delivers it to the agency designated to make delivery.

        "justification": "The changed text, which mandates communication via carrier pigeon, directly contradicts the principle of reasonable service as implied by FRCP 5(b)(2). The original text specified reliable methods like mail and telecommunication. The Law Explanation accurately identifies the conflict with the requirement for service to be 'reasonably likely to result in its receipt.' While the snippet doesn't explicitly forbid carrier pigeons, Rule 5(b)(2) outlines acceptable methods like handing it to the person, leaving it at their office, mailing it, or electronic means. Carrier pigeons lack the reliability and verifiability of these methods, making the change a strong contradiction. The absence of a second snippet does not detract from this clear conflict."

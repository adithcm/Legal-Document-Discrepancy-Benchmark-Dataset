        "law_explanation": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally invalidates non-compete agreements. While narrow exceptions exist (e.g., sale of a business), a blanket 5-year non-compete is likely overbroad and unenforceable in California, especially considering the lack of explicit justification. The original two year non-compete may also be unenforceable but a five year term is significantly more suspect.",

Arthur Andersen LLP (2008) 44 Cal.4th 937, to void the application of any noncompete agreement in an employment context, or any noncompete clause in an employment contract, no matter how narrowly tailored, that does not satisfy an exception in this chapter.

        "justification": "The changed text increases the non-compete period from two to five years, which strongly contradicts California Business and Professions Code Section 16600, as evidenced by Scraped Law Snippet 1. The snippet states that \"every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.\" The five-year non-compete period is likely an unreasonable restraint of trade, making it likely unenforceable under California law. The snippet also references Edwards v. Arthur Andersen LLP (2008) 44 Cal.4th 937, reinforcing that the law should be broadly read to void non-compete agreements in employment contexts that do not satisfy an exception. While the original two-year period might also be challenged, a five-year restriction significantly strengthens the contradiction, justifying a high score."

        "justification": "The changed text removes the phrase 'or thereafter' from the confidentiality agreement, potentially conflicting with the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA) as explained in the Law Explanation and Perturbation Explanation. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 confirms the existence of CUTSA (CIV 3426), it doesn't detail the specific post-term protections afforded by the Act. However, the Law Explanation states that CUTSA intends to prevent misappropriation of trade secrets even after a relationship ends. By limiting the restriction to only 'during the term,' the contract weakens the post-term protections that could be afforded by CUTSA, making the change a strong contradiction. Because Snippet 1 is high level, the contradiction is only moderate."

        "justification": "The changed text directly contradicts the implication of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1033.5. The original text allows for 'reasonable' attorney's fees, aligning with the legal standard. The changed text removes 'reasonable' and adds 'regardless of reasonableness,' which attempts to bypass the court's assessment of fees, going against the legal principle that fees should be reasonable. Snippet 1, referencing CCP 1033.5, states that certain items are allowable as costs, implying that these costs, including attorney's fees, are subject to review and must be deemed allowable.

The Law Explanation suggests that a 10-day termination clause could prevent the required annual approval by the board of directors. Scraped Law Snippet 1 mentions 15 USC 80a-15, which pertains to contracts of advisers and underwriters. Scraped Law Snippet 2 also lists 15 USC 80a-15 within the Investment Company Act of 1940, further confirming its relevance. Although the snippets do not specify the minimum required notice period, the Law Explanation claims that a shorter notice period undermines the annual approval requirement, thus a contradiction score of 0.7 is warranted."

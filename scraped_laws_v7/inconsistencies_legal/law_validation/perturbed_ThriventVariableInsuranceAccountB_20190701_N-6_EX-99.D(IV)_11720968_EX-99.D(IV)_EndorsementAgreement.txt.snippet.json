        "original_text": "If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
        "changed_text": "If you do not make the extra payment within 10 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
        "explanation": "Reducing the payment period for deficiency payments to 10 days may not provide sufficient time for individuals to respond, especially considering potential delays in mail or other communication methods. This contradicts the general principle of providing reasonable notice and opportunity to cure deficiencies.",

        "law_explanation": "Although this statute speaks directly to transfers of property, similar concepts of sufficient time to cure defaults apply to insurance contracts to ensure fairness and prevent unjust enrichment. Providing only 10 days to respond to deficiency notice contradicts the spirit of allowing reasonable time to cure the issue.",

        "justification": "The change reduces the payment period from 60 to 10 days. The Perturbation Explanation highlights that this may not provide sufficient time, contradicting the principle of reasonable notice. The Law Explanation suggests a similar concept of 'sufficient time to cure defaults' should apply to insurance contracts. However, without a specific law or snippet defining 'reasonable time' or minimum notice periods for deficiency payments, it is hard to say this violates a specific law. The lack of legal snippets prevents a strong determination of contradiction, but the reduction does seem potentially unfair. Therefore a score of 0.4 is given."

        "original_text": "Each year, we will determine our divisible surplus. This contract's share, if any, will be credited as a dividend. Since we do not expect this contract to contribute to divisible surplus, it is not expected that any dividends will be credited.",
        "changed_text": "We will determine our divisible surplus at our sole discretion, and this contract's share, if any, will be determined at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to never credit any dividends.",
        "explanation": "Changing the wording to allow 'sole discretion' and reserve the right to never credit dividends creates uncertainty and potential conflict with state laws regarding fair practices for insurance contracts, especially if the contract implies dividends might be paid.",

        "contradiction_score": 0.6,
        "justification": "The original contract language indicates that dividends, while not expected, could potentially be credited. The changed text introduces 'sole discretion' in determining both the divisible surplus and the contract's share, while also reserving the right to never credit dividends. This creates a situation where dividends, which might have been anticipated under the original language, are now subject to arbitrary determination and potential denial. The Law Explanation suggests this could lead to unfair discrimination if applied in a discriminatory manner, violating laws against such practices in insurance. While the scraped snippets are empty, indicating a lack of direct statutory text, the Law Explanation and Perturbation Explanation, coupled with the shift in language from a potential dividend to sole discretion and possible denial, increase the likelihood of the contract being used in a discriminatory way. Because there's no way to definitively determine if the action is discriminatory from the snippets provided, the contradiction strength is moderate."

        "law_explanation": "This statute requires insurance policies to be readable and understandable.

        "justification": "The original text states that \"Dividends are applied as payment of a Net Premium,\" while the changed text states \"Dividends will not be applied as payment of Net Premium. All dividends, if any, will be forfeited to the insurer.\" This represents a direct alteration of the dividend application, potentially conflicting with policyholder rights. Although the scraped snippets are empty, the Perturbation Explanation indicates a potential violation of regulations against unfair insurance practices. The Law Explanation supports this by suggesting the change could be considered misleading if not clearly communicated. Therefore, there's a likely contradiction based on the information provided, even without concrete legal code in the snippets."

        "justification": "The original contract allows ten days for providing assurance of performance, while the changed contract reduces this to two days. The Law Explanation indicates that UCC \u00a7 2-609 requires 'adequate assurance of due performance' and suggests that two days may not be considered a reasonable time to respond, potentially violating the spirit of good faith. Scraped Law Snippet 2 references Illinois Fair Invention Development Standards Act, which doesn't directly pertain to UCC or contracts, so it is not relevant. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 is empty, the Law Explanation in conjunction with the Perturbation Explanation suggests a violation of the implied duty of good faith. Although the snippets do not explicitly state a minimum time for assurance, the reduction to two days creates a plausible conflict with the implied duty of good faith, supporting a moderate contradiction score. A higher score is not warranted as there's no explicit legal statement on the specific timeframe constituting 'adequate' assurance."

        "justification": "The changed text reduces the timeframe for delivering insurance evidence. The Law Explanation suggests this shortened timeframe may not provide enough time and thus act in bad faith, which Illinois law implies a covenant against. The Perturbation Explanation supports this, stating the reduction could be commercially unreasonable. Scraped Law Snippet 1, while not directly stating the law, alludes to the importance of legal professionals using AI technologies to improve efficiency, indirectly addressing the need for reasonable timeframes in legal processes, however, it does not provide details for specific time frames. Since there is no explicit law snippet showing a violation of state or federal law, the change is only potentially contradictory based on the implied duty, this creates a moderate contradiction."

Therefore, a score of 0.4 reflects a potential, but not definitive, contradiction due to the lack of direct legal text supporting the claim that the extended timeframe inherently violates trade secret law."

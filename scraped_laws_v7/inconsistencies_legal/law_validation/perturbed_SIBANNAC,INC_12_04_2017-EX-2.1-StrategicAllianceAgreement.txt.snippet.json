The Perturbation Explanation states that changing the payment term from NET 30 to NET 90 could violate prompt payment laws in some states if the company is a small business. The Law Explanation references Texas Business and Commerce Code \u00a7 28.004, stating that payments to small businesses must be made within 30 days of receipt of the invoice. Although it's not explicitly stated that Bravatek is a small business, nor is there a law snippet explicitly confirming the 30-day limit for small businesses, the potential violation of prompt payment laws for small businesses in Texas raises a moderate contradiction if Bravatek qualifies as a small business. Since no law snippets were found to confirm or deny this, the score is not higher."

        "law_explanation": "While not a specific statute, Texas contract law requires reasonable notice for termination or non-renewal of contracts. Changing the notice period to 30 days, when a 90-day notice was initially agreed upon, is much less favorable for the party that does not wish to automatically renew and creates a scenario where a party has less time to make arrangements. A court could find that 30 days' notice is insufficient and therefore unreasonable under the circumstances. The Business and Commerce Code Section 2.309 speaks to absence of specific time provisions. Here the time provision has changed, but this law explains the principle in general.",

        "justification": "The original text specified a 90-day notice period for non-renewal, which was reduced to 30 days in the changed text. The Law Explanation argues that this reduction might be considered unreasonable under Texas contract law, as it provides less time for arrangements. The Perturbation Explanation supports this by suggesting the shorter notice period could disadvantage one party. While the scraped snippets are empty, the core principle of 'reasonable notice' in contract law (as explained by the LLM) is relevant. Because there's no specific statute defining what constitutes 'reasonable notice' for this agreement type, and because the absence of law snippets weakens the claim, the contradiction is not absolute. However, the change introduces a potentially unreasonable condition, so a moderately strong contradiction score is warranted."

While TUTSA doesn't specify a required confidentiality period, reducing it to one year significantly increases the risk of trade secret misappropriation if the confidential information retains commercial value beyond that period. A one-year term might be deemed inadequate protection, leading to potential legal disputes if confidential information is disclosed after that period and causes harm. The determination of adequate time for protection falls into what would be considered reasonable. While this period of time might be valid, it depends on what constitutes a company trade secret. The second URL is to a document related to trade secret protection in Texas, as it is difficult to find an official document specifically stating the need for a certain amount of time to protect trade secrets.

Sec. 134A.002. DEFINITIONS. In this chapter: (1) \"Claimant\" means a party seeking to recover damages under this chapter, including a plaintiff, counterclaimant, cross-claimant, or third-party plaintiff. In an action in which a party seeks recovery of damages under this chapter on behalf of another person, \"claimant\" includes both that other person and the party seeking recovery of damages. (1-a) \"Clear and convincing\" means the measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established. (2) \"Improper means\" includes theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, to limit use, or to prohibit discovery of a trade secret, or espionage through electronic or other means. (3) \"Misappropriation\" means: (A) acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; or (B) disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who: (i) used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret; (ii) at the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that the person's knowledge of the trade secret was: (a) derived from or through a person who used improper means to acquire the trade secret; (b) acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain the secrecy of or limit the use of the trade secret; or (c) derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain the secrecy of or limit the use of the trade secret; or (iii) before a material change of the position of the person, knew or had reason to know that the trade secret was a trade secret and that knowledge of the trade secret had been acquired by accident or mistake.

        "justification": "The changed contract reduces the confidentiality period from five years to one year. The LLM explanation suggests this may increase the risk of trade secret misappropriation under Texas law (Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code \u00a7 134A.002), particularly if the information retains commercial value beyond one year. Scraped Law Snippet 1 defines 'misappropriation' as the acquisition, disclosure, or use of a trade secret by improper means, or without consent, including if someone knew or should have known the information was a trade secret and was acquired through improper means. While the statute doesn't specify a minimum confidentiality period, reducing it to one year could be deemed insufficient protection depending on the trade secret's nature and lifespan. The strength of the contradiction is moderate (0.6) because the statute doesn't mandate a specific period, but shortening the time increases the risk of a successful claim of misappropriation."

        "original_text": "EKR shall at its own cost and expense use commercially reasonable efforts to take those steps reasonably necessary in order to obtain and thereafter maintain Marketing Authorizations (including pricing and reimbursement approvals) for the Product in those countries of the Territory other than the United States which the Committee determines to present commercially viable opportunities for the Product.",
        "changed_text": "EKR shall consider using commercially reasonable efforts to take those steps reasonably necessary in order to obtain and thereafter maintain Marketing Authorizations (including pricing and reimbursement approvals) for the Product in those countries of the Territory other than the United States which the Committee considers potentially viable opportunities for the Product.",
        "explanation": "The original text has a commitment to 'use commercially reasonable efforts,' a fairly strong obligation. The revision introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with 'shall consider,' making the effort to obtain marketing authorizations discretionary rather than obligatory. Furthermore, changing 'determines' to 'considers' weakens the standard of evidence required for the committee to determine viability.",

        "law_explanation": "The altered language makes EKR's commitment to maintaining marketing authorizations uncertain, which might conflict with the FDA requirements regarding supplemental applications or reporting changes per 21 CFR \u00a7 314.70(b). It is implied EKR is obligated to maintain compliance to the standards as determined by the FDA. It creates a legal contradiction in that the parties agree to comply, but the language suggests they can consider it, so compliance is not obligatory.",

        "justification": "The original contract mandates EKR to 'use commercially reasonable efforts' to obtain marketing authorizations. The revised text weakens this obligation by stating EKR 'shall consider using commercially reasonable efforts,' thus introducing discretion where there was originally a duty. The Law Explanation points out that this shift may conflict with FDA requirements regarding compliance (e.g., 21 CFR \u00a7 314.70(b)), implying that the FDA requires a clear commitment to maintaining compliance. While the provided snippets do not directly state the obligation to obtain marketing authorization, the snippets generally pertain to supplements and changes to approved NDAs, and explicitly reference Title 21. By making the effort discretionary, the revised text creates a high contradiction because it undermines the enforceability of any obligation to comply with regulatory standards, potentially leading to non-compliance."

        "justification": "The changed text weakens the mandatory reporting requirements for adverse events. The original text uses \"shall promptly provide\" and \"promptly forward,\" indicating a clear obligation. The modified text uses \"should attempt to provide\" and \"could forward,\" making the reporting discretionary. The Law Explanation highlights conflict with 21 CFR \u00a7 314.80(c)(1), which requires submission of information regarding adverse drug experiences. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 doesn't directly contain 21 CFR \u00a7 314.80(c)(1), it confirms its existence within the Code of Federal Regulations and Title 21. Scraped Law Snippet 2 further validates Title 21's regulatory role concerning drugs and medical devices. The shift from mandatory to discretionary reporting creates a direct conflict with regulatory expectations, thus, the contradiction is rated as HIGH."

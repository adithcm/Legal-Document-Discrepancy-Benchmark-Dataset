Because the statute database is maintained primarily for legislative drafting purposes, statutory changes are sometimes included in the statute database before they take effect.

As used in this Act, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) \"Invention Development Services\" shall include at least one of the following: (1) evaluation of the market potential of an invention; and (2) representation of an invention to potential distributors or to potential manufacturers of the invention. (b) \"Contract for invention development services\" shall include a contract by which an invention developer undertakes to perform invention development services for a customer. (c) \"Customer\" shall include any person, firm, corporation, association, or other entity that is solicited by, inquires about or seeks the services of, or enters into a contract for invention development services with an invention developer. (d) \"Invention\" shall mean any discovery, process, method, apparatus, machine, design, formulation, composition, product, concept, idea or any combination thereof. (e) \"Invention developer\" shall mean any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity and the agents, employees or representatives of such person, firm, corporation, association, or other entity that performs invention development services, except (1) any department or agency of the federal, state or local government, (2) any charitable, scientific, educational, religious, or other organization qualified under Section 501(c)(3) or described in Section 170(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, or (3) any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity that does not charge a fee for invention development services.

        "justification": "The modified text introduces ambiguity and weakens the company's obligations regarding product quality and condition. The original text requires 'reasonable efforts to maintain quality control' and deliver products that are 'properly and adequately packaged and contained, fully assembled, fully functional and otherwise in conformance with the warranties'. The changed text uses terms like 'generally try', 'appear to be reasonably packaged', 'mostly assembled', 'generally functional' and 'arguably in conformance'. This significantly reduces the enforceability of these requirements. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 focuses on invention development services and does not directly address product quality, the Law Explanation argues that the changes undermine the implied warranty of merchantability under the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code (810 ILCS 5/2-314), which requires goods to be fit for ordinary purposes. By allowing products that may not meet basic standards of functionality or packaging, the modified contract text creates a high risk of non-compliance with merchantability standards, therefore creating a high contradiction."

        "original_text": "MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
        "changed_text": "MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you might be asked to consider an extra payment. The Board of Directors will consider the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's perceived fair share of the deficiency. You may contemplate making the extra payment by a possible reduction in benefits or by a theoretical payment in cash. If you neglect to consider the extra payment within a reasonable time from when we notify you of your share of the deficiency, an amount may be arbitrarily charged against the contract with interest possibly compounded.",
        "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity. 'Might be asked to consider' weakens the obligation to pay. 'Consider the amount' suggests the Board may not actually decide on an amount. 'Perceived fair share' introduces subjectivity. 'Possible reduction' and 'theoretical payment' make the payment options uncertain. 'Neglect to consider' and 'reasonable time' are vague, replacing the clear 60-day deadline. 'Arbitrarily charged' and 'possibly compounded' further erode the enforceability of this clause.",

        "law_explanation": "The original clause specifies a clear obligation for members to make extra payments if the Society's solvency is impaired, detailing the amount calculation and the consequences of non-payment within 60 days. This aligns with Wisconsin Statutes Section 611.26(2)(a), which regulates assessments by mutual insurance companies and requires a definite and enforceable assessment process. The modified text introduces uncertainty by using vague terms like 'might be asked to consider,' 'perceived fair share,' and 'reasonable time,' making the obligation unenforceable under Wisconsin law because it fails to provide a clear, objective standard for determining and enforcing the extra payment, thus contradicting the statute's intent for a defined assessment.",

        "justification": "The modified contract significantly weakens the original obligation for members to make extra payments if the Society becomes insolvent, introducing substantial ambiguity and subjectivity. The original text creates a clear obligation, while the modified text uses terms like 'might be asked to consider,' 'perceived fair share,' and 'reasonable time.' The Law Explanation states that the original text aligns with Wisconsin Statutes Section 611.26(2)(a) requiring a definite and enforceable assessment process. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 does not directly mention section 611.26(2)(a), the explanation uses that section as a basis for the contradiction. The ambiguity introduced by the changes would make the obligation unenforceable under Wisconsin law as the assessment process becomes subjective. Because the changes create ambiguity in a way that would undermine enforcement under the law, this is a high contradiction."

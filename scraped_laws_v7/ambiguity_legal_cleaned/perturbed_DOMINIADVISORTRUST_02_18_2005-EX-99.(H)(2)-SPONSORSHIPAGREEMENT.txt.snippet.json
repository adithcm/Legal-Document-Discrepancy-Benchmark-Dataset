        "justification": "The modification significantly weakens the Sponsor's obligations, creating a high risk of non-compliance with Section 15(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The original text uses 'shall perform,' a clear mandate, while the modified text uses 'will endeavor to perform,' which is discretionary. Similarly, 'reasonably requested' becomes 'periodically discussed,' further reducing the Sponsor's commitment. The phrase 'potentially including' introduces ambiguity about the services to be provided. The shift from 'overseeing' to 'offering input' diminishes the Sponsor's responsibility. According to the law explanation, Section 15(a) requires investment advisory contracts to be specific, and these changes introduce vagueness. Scraped Law Snippet 1 refers to 15 USC 80a-15, which covers contracts of advisers and underwriters, supporting the law explanation's claim that the Investment Company Act of 1940 is relevant to this contract. The weakening of mandatory language and introduction of ambiguity directly contradicts the need for specificity in investment advisory contracts, posing a high risk of non-compliance and potentially harming shareholder interests."

        "justification": "The modified text contradicts the Investment Company Act, specifically concerning exculpatory clauses. The original text limited liability to 'willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence,' which aligns with fiduciary responsibilities. The changed text replaces this with 'proven and direct harm' and caps liability at fees paid. The Law Explanation states that Section 17(h) of the Investment Company Act prohibits exculpatory clauses that protect investment company affiliates from liability for conduct falling below certain standards, including breaches of fiduciary duty. Capping the Sponsor's liability to the fees paid under the agreement attempts to limit liability related to gross negligence or reckless disregard, which the Act prevents. The provided law snippets, though primarily focused on prohibited transactions under 15 U.S. Code \u00a7 80a-17, support the overarching principle of holding affiliated persons accountable, and the Law Explanation directly links the liability cap to a violation of this principle related to fiduciary duty. The change weakens the liability standard and introduces a cap, creating a HIGH contradiction as it attempts to circumvent legal accountability for serious misconduct."

The changed text weakens this by stating the agreement 'will be generally guided by the principles of law, potentially including those of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as they seem most relevant.' This introduces significant ambiguity and subjectivity, deviating from the original clear directive. The law explanation states that clear governing law is crucial for compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that the new wording opens the door for disputes. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 doesn't explicitly mandate a specific choice of law clause, the act's need for clear legal obligations and investor protection is undermined by the ambiguous language. The change replaces a definitive choice of law with a vague guideline, increasing the risk of inconsistent interpretation and hindering regulatory oversight."

To get this relief, you must file all required federal information returns on a basis consistent with your treatment of the worker. You (or your predecessor) must not have treated any worker holding a substantially similar position as an employee for any periods beginning after 1977. See Publication 1976, Section 530 Employment Tax Relief Requirements PDF , for more information. Some misclassified workers can attach Form 8919 to their income tax return to report uncollected Social Security and Medicare tax Workers who believe they have been improperly classified as independent contractors by an employer can use Form 8919, Uncollected Social Security and Medicare Tax on Wages , to figure and report the employee’s share of uncollected Social Security and Medicare taxes due on their compensation. Voluntary Classification Settlement Program The Voluntary Classification Settlement Program (VCSP) is an optional program that provides taxpayers with an opportunity to reclassify their workers as employees for future tax periods for employment tax purposes with partial relief from federal employment taxes for eligible taxpayers that agree to prospectively treat their workers (or a class or group of workers) as employees. To participate in this voluntary program, the taxpayer must meet certain eligibility requirements. Apply to participate in the VCSP by filing Form 8952, Application for Voluntary Classification Settlement Program , in order to enter into a closing agreement with the IRS.

        "scraped_snippet_1": "contract | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! × No thank you contract A contract is an agreement between parties , creating mutual obligations that are enforceable by law . The basic elements required for the agreement to be a legally enforceable contract are: mutual assent , expressed by a valid offer and acceptance ; adequate consideration ; capacity ; and legality . In some states , elements of consideration can be satisfied by a valid substitute. Possible remedies for breach of contract include general damages , consequential damages , reliance damages , and specific performance . Background : Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. Contract law is generally governed by state common law , and while general overall contract law is common throughout the country, some specific court interpretations of a particular element of the contract may vary between the states. If a promise is breached, the law provides remedies to the harmed party, often in the form of monetary damages, or in limited circumstances, in the form of specific performance of the promise made. Elements -- Consideration and Mutual Assent Contracts arise when a duty comes into existence, because of a promise made by one of the parties. To be legally binding as a contract, a promise must be exchanged for adequate consideration. There are two different theories or definitions of consideration: Bargain Theory of Consideration and Benefit-Detriment theory of consideration. Benefit-Detriment Under the b enefit-detriment theory, an adequate consideration exists only when a promise made to the benefit of the promisor or to the detriment of the promisee, which reasonably and fairly induces the promisor to make a promise for something else for the promisee. For example, promises that are purely gifts are not considered enforceable because the personal satisfaction the grantor of the promise may receive from the act of generosity is normally not considered sufficient detriment to constitute adequate consideration. Bargain-for-Exchange Under Bargain-for-Exchange theory of consideration, adequate consideration exists when a promisor makes a promise in return for something else. Here, the essential condition is that the promisor was given something specifically to induce the promise being made. In other words, the bargain for exchange theory is different from the detriment-benefit theory in that the focus in bargain for exchange theory seems to be the parties’ motive for making the promises and the parties’ subjective mutual assent, while in detriment benefit theory, the focus seems to be an objective legal detriment or benefit to the parties. Governing Laws Contracts are mainly governed by state statutory and common (judge-made) law and private law (i.e. the private agreement). Private law principally includes the terms of the agreement between the parties who are exchanging promises. This private law may override many of the rules otherwise established by state law. Statutory law, such as the Statute of Fraud , may require some kinds of contracts be put in writing and executed with particular formalities, for the contract to be enforceable. Otherwise, the parties may enter into a binding agreement without signing a formal written document. For example, Virginia Supreme Court has held in Lucy v. Zehmer that even an agreement made on a piece of napkin can be considered a valid contract, if the parties were both sane, and showed mutual assent and consideration. Most of the principles of the common law of contracts are outlined in the Restatement of Law, Second Contracts published by the American Law Institute. The Uniform Commercial Code , whose original articles have been adopted in nearly every state, represents a body of statutory law that governs important categories of contracts. The main articles that deal with the law of contracts are Article 1 (General Provisions) and Article 2 (Sales) . Sections of Article 9 (",

Pennsylvania became the first state to adopt the UCC in 1953, and every other state followed suit over the next twenty years. News ULC Statement on Ownership of Investment Property under Uniform Commercial Code Article 8 ULC Statement on Central Bank Digital Currencies and the Uniform Commercial Code Cooperation with ALI The UCC is a joint project of the Uniform Law Commission and the American Law Institute. Recognizing that drafting a combined commercial code was a massive undertaking, the ULC invited ALI to participate in the codification project, and the ALI board accepted the invitation in 1942. Over the next ten years the two organizations collaborated at drafting meetings funded in large part by a generous grant from the Maurice and Laura Falk Foundation, with additional funding contributed from law firms, banks, and businesses that recognized the need for uniform commercial laws. The UCC Today The UCC is maintained under the guidance of the Permanent Editorial Board for the Uniform Commercial Code (PEB) , comprised of members appointed by the ULC and the ALI. The PEB, established in 1961, monitors developments in commercial law, recommends UCC amendments and revisions when necessary, and publishes official commentary to help courts interpret specific UCC provisions. An endowment established with the original Falk Foundation grant funding and replenished with UCC publishing royalties is available to fund UCC drafting projects. Articles Article 1, General Provisions Uniform Commercial Code Article 1 contains definitions and general provisions applicable as default rules to transactions covered under other articles of the UCC. Article 1 was last revised in 2001, with a few minor amendments since then to harmonize with recent revisions of other UCC articles. View Article 1, General Provisions Article 2, Sales Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 governs the sale of goods. It was part of the original Uniform Commercial Code approved in 1951. Article 2 represented a revision and modernization of the Uniform Sales Act, which was originally approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1906. The Uniform Law Commission and American Law Institute approved a revised Article 2 in 2003 that was not adopted in any state, and was subsequently withdrawn by both organizations in 2011. Thus the 1951 version of Article 2 is the most recent official version. View Article 2, Sales Article 2A, Leases Uniform Commercial Code Article 2A governs leases of personal property. It was first added to the Uniform Commercial Code in 1987 and amended in 1990. A revision was approved by the Uniform Law Commission and the American Law Institute in 2003, but was not adopted in any jurisdiction and subsequently withdrawn by both organizations in 2011. Thus, the 1987 version of Article 2A, as amended in 1990, remains the official text. View Article 2A, Leases Article 3, Negotiable Instruments Uniform Commercial Code Article 3 governs negotiable instruments: drafts (including checks) and notes representing a promise to pay a sum of money, and that have independent value because they are negotiable. An instrument is negotiable if it can be transferred to another person and remain enforceable against the person who originally made the promise to pay. The substance of Article 3 has its roots in the Negotiable Instrument Law first approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1896. That early uniform law was revised and incorporated into the original version of the UCC in 1951, and a further revision was approved in 1990.

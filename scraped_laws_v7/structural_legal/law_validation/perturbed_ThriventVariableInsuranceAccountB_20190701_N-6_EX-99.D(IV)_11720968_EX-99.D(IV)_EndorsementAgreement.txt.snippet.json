A settlor may expressly provide in the creating instrument that the interest in income of a beneficiary other than the settlor is not subject to voluntary or involuntary alienation. The income interest of such a beneficiary cannot be assigned and is exempt from claims against the beneficiary until paid over to the beneficiary pursuant to the terms of the trust. 701.06(2) (2) Principal beneficiaries.

The interest in principal of such a beneficiary cannot be assigned and is exempt from claims against the beneficiary, but a judgment creditor, after any payments of principal have become due or payable to the beneficiary pursuant to the terms of the trust, may apply to the court for an order directing the trustee to satisfy the judgment out of any such payments and the court in its discretion may issue an order for payment of part or all of the judgment. 701.06(3) (3) Disclaimer or renunciation not an assignment.

        "justification": "The modified contract moves dividend information into the 'Assignment' section, which, according to the perturbation explanation, obscures the clarity and accessibility of dividend options. The Law Explanation suggests this might contradict the principle of clear disclosure, akin to Wisconsin Statutes \u00a7 701.06, which addresses disclosure requirements for trust documents. Scraped Law Snippet 2, referencing Wisconsin Statutes \u00a7 701.06, concerns spendthrift provisions and rights of creditors of beneficiaries in trusts, focusing on alienation of income and principal. While the snippet does not directly address disclosure requirements in insurance contracts, the Law Explanation draws an analogy. The modification doesn't directly violate the specific provisions in \u00a7 701.06 regarding spendthrift provisions, but it weakens the clarity expected for financial terms, creating a potential conflict with the broader principle of clear disclosure. A contradiction score of 0.4 reflects that, while there isn't a direct violation, placing the dividend information in an unexpected section reduces clarity and creates a risk of misinterpretation, which is a weaker contradiction."

        "justification": "The changed text moves the \"Entire Contract\" clause into the \"Membership\" section. The LLM's law explanation asserts this placement makes the disclosure about what constitutes the entire contract less prominent, potentially violating Wisconsin Statutes \u00a7 631.05, which mandates insurance policies contain the entire contract between the parties. The explanation argues this placement makes it difficult to ascertain all documents constituting the agreement. While no direct snippet from the statute is available to confirm the exact language, the lack of prominence due to structural change suggests a moderate contradiction. The \"Structural Flaws Legal Contradiction\" definition states a contradiction arises when a required legal disclosure is placed in an irrelevant or misleading section. Thus, even without the exact legal language present, the altered contract's structure weakens the policyholder's immediate access to the entire agreement, giving rise to a non-trivial contradiction score.

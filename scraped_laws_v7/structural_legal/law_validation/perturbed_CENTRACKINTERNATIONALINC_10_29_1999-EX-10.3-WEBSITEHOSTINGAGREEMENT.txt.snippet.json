        "justification": "The original contract had the limitation of liability clause in a prominent location, which was then moved to the 'Miscellaneous' section. The Law Explanation suggests this increases the likelihood a court finds the limitation \"unconscionable\" due to lack of prominence. While Florida Statute 672.719(3), as quoted in Scraped Law Snippet 1, allows for the limitation or exclusion of consequential damages unless unconscionable, the placement of the clause weakens its enforceability, as it is less likely to be noticed by the Customer, increasing the probability that a court would deem the limitation unconscionable. Therefore, the change creates a moderate legal contradiction but doesn't directly violate the statute."

While the law explanation references Florida Statute \u00a7 725.06, the statute explicitly addresses construction contracts and indemnification limitations. The original contract text and the changed text do not appear to be related to construction, alteration, repair, or demolition of a building. Scraped Law Snippet 1 states that \"Any portion of any agreement or contract for or in connection with... any construction... shall be void and unenforceable unless the contract contains a monetary limitation...\" Since the contract doesn't seem to be in connection with construction, and Scraped Law Snippet 2 is empty, there's no direct violation of the law. However, the placement might lead to ambiguity, thus weakening its enforceability. Therefore, a score of 0.4 reflects the potential ambiguity introduced by the structural change, without a direct statutory conflict."

The LLM suggests that if the disclaimer is not sufficiently conspicuous, it could be argued that the implied warranty still applies. While 672.316 itself isn't provided, the reference to it within 672.314 implies that disclaimers must be clear and readily noticeable to be effective. Therefore, the structural flaw of placing the disclaimer in an unexpected location weakens its enforceability, creating a moderate contradiction with the intent to disclaim warranties under Florida law, justifying a score of 0.7."

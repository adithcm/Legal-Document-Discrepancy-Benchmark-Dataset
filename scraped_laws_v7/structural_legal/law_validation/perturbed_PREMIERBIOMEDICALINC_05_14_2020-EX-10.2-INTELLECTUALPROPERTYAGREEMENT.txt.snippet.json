        "justification": "The changed text allows one party (THI) to unilaterally select the venue and Premier Biomedical, Inc. to determine the governing law, which contradicts the general principle of fairness in venue selection, as supported by the Law Explanation. 28 U.S. Code \u00a7 1391 outlines rules for venue, and while the snippet doesn't explicitly forbid such a clause, it suggests that venue should consider convenience and fairness, principles undermined by the changed text giving sole discretion to one party. The original text specified a venue (Mercer County, Pennsylvania) and governing law (Commonwealth of Pennsylvania), providing clarity and agreement between parties, which is lost in the modified text. The changed text creates an imbalance and uncertainty, making the agreement less enforceable and potentially forcing the other party into an unfair location. The specific language in 28 USC 1391 (b) indicates that a civil action may be brought in a judicial district, which implies that there are some standards or rules for selecting venue, not simply one party's discretion."

        "scraped_snippet_1": "consideration | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! \u00d7 No thank you consideration Consideration is a promise , performance, or forbearance bargained by a promisor in exchange for their promise. Consideration is the main element of a contract . Without consideration by both parties, a contract cannot be enforceable. For instance, if a person used the money to purchase an apple, the apple is the merchant\u2019s consideration, and the money is the person\u2019s consideration. Types: Consideration could be a promise, performance, forbearance, or property with legal value, but the economic benefit is not required. A gift or gratuitous promise cannot be a consideration for they have no bargaining. The past performance also cannot be a consideration as there is no exchange. Substitute for consideration: A contract without consideration could be enforceable if it has a substitute. Substitutes are promissory estoppel or detrimental reliance under Restatement (Second) of Contracts , or good faith modification under UCC . Promissory estoppel /detrimental reliance: A contract without consideration is enforceable if the nonperformance of the promisor will cause injustice. Elements of promissory estoppel are (i) the promise has reasonable, foreseeable, and detrimental reliance on the promisor, and (ii) the enforcement of the promise is necessary to avoid injustice. Good faith modification: A modified contract is a kind of new agreement, which changes parties\u2019 obligations and then requires new consideration. But contract modification made in good faith under UCC is enforceable even without consideration.

        "justification": "The changed text introduces a significant alteration to the licensing terms, making them 'optional' and negating the previously agreed-upon terms from the 2010/2020 agreements. This undermines the initial consideration established in the original contract. Scraped Law Snippet 1 defines consideration as 'a promise, performance, or forbearance bargained by a promisor in exchange for their promise' and states that 'without consideration by both parties, a contract cannot be enforceable.' By making the licensing terms optional, the changed text removes the element of a 'promise' and creates uncertainty about the obligations of the parties involved, thereby weakening the consideration and potentially rendering the licensing agreement unenforceable. The 'bargained-for exchange' is diminished, leading to a contradiction of basic contract law principles regarding consideration. The modification introduces ambiguity about the commitment expected from each party, which can make the contract less enforceable. Therefore, a contradiction score of 0.7 is appropriate as the change significantly impacts the enforceability of the contract's licensing provisions due to weakened consideration."

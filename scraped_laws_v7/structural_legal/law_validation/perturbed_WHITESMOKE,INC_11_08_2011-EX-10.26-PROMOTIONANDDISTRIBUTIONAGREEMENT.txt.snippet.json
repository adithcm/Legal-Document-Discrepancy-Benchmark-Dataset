        "justification": "The changed text moves the tax clause to the 'Counterparts' section, potentially obscuring it from relevant parties. The Perturbation Explanation and Law Explanation suggest this could lead to non-compliance due to accounting departments missing the obligations. Scraped Law Snippet 2, 26 USC 6001, states that \"Every person liable for any tax imposed by this title, or for the collection thereof, shall keep such records...\" While the altered contract doesn't explicitly violate this, moving the tax clause could hinder the ability to maintain proper records, as the tax responsibilities are less discoverable. This weakens the obligation to keep records, but doesn't directly contradict it. Therefore, a score of 0.6 reflects this moderate contradiction."

        "justification": "The changed text relocates the \"Entire Agreement\" clause into the definitions section, which could arguably obscure its importance and impact. The Law Explanation suggests this weakens the agreement, potentially leading to confusion regarding the agreement's comprehensive nature. UCC 2-202, as presented in Scraped Law Snippet 1, addresses the final written expression of an agreement. While the placement doesn't directly contradict the snippet's wording (which focuses on barring prior agreements), it could undermine the purpose of UCC 2-202 by creating ambiguity about what constitutes the 'final expression' of the agreement. The clause is still present, but its less prominent placement could allow parties to argue that they were unaware of its significance, potentially contradicting the goal of UCC 2-202. The absence of a second snippet limits the depth of legal assessment, but the placement of the entire agreement in definitions creates a potential structural flaw. Thus, the contradiction score reflects a moderate contradiction."

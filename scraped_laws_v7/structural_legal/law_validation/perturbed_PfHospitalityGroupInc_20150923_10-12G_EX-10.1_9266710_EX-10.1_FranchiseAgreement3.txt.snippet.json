Injunctions and Restraining Orders | Federal Rules of Civil Procedure | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! \u00d7 No thank you Rule 65. Injunctions and Restraining Orders (a) Preliminary Injunction. (1) Notice. The court may issue a preliminary injunction only on notice to the adverse party. (2) Consolidating the Hearing with the Trial on the Merits. Before or after beginning the hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction, the court may advance the trial on the merits and consolidate it with the hearing. Even when consolidation is not ordered, evidence that is received on the motion and that would be admissible at trial becomes part of the trial record and need not be repeated at trial. But the court must preserve any party's right to a jury trial. (b) Temporary Restraining Order. (1) Issuing Without Notice. The court may issue a temporary restraining order without written or oral notice to the adverse party or its attorney only if: (A) specific facts in an affidavit or a verified complaint clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before the adverse party can be heard in opposition; and (B) the movant's attorney certifies in writing any efforts made to give notice and the reasons why it should not be required. (2) Contents; Expiration. Every temporary restraining order issued without notice must state the date and hour it was issued; describe the injury and state why it is irreparable; state why the order was issued without notice; and be promptly filed in the clerk's office and entered in the record. The order expires at the time after entry\u2014not to exceed 14 days\u2014that the court sets, unless before that time the court, for good cause, extends it for a like period or the adverse party consents to a longer extension. The reasons for an extension must be entered in the record. (3) Expediting the Preliminary-Injunction Hearing. If the order is issued without notice, the moti",

        "justification": "The perturbation moves the 'Injunctive Relief' clause into a 'Delay' section, which the Perturbation Explanation suggests obscures its importance. The Law Explanation argues this could hinder a party's ability to understand their rights related to injunctive relief under FRCP 65. Scraped Law Snippet 1 is FRCP 65, which details requirements for injunctions and restraining orders. While the modified contract doesn't directly violate any specific rule *within* FRCP 65, placing the clause in an unexpected section could make it more difficult for a party to quickly ascertain their rights and remedies, potentially affecting their ability to comply with FRCP 65's procedural requirements for obtaining an injunction. Scraped Law Snippet 2 references the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure overall and their purpose, which includes the 'just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.' By potentially obscuring a key remedy, the change could impede a speedy determination. Thus, the contradiction score is 0.6."

        "justification": "The relocation of the 'Confidential Information' definition introduces a structural flaw, potentially weakening its enforceability under trade secret laws. While the provided snippets don't directly confirm the violation (Snippet 1 is missing, and Snippet 2 is a 404 error), the Perturbation and Law explanations highlight that obscuring the definition of confidential information can undermine efforts to maintain secrecy, a critical aspect of trade secret protection. Placing this vital definition under the 'Delay' section makes it less accessible and could be interpreted as a failure to make reasonable efforts to protect the information. This is a contradiction because the structure of the contract impacts the enforceability of the obligation. Thus, the score reflects that although this may weaken enforceability, it is not a direct violation of the law given the missing legal snippets."

The Law Explanation argues this misplaced emphasis undermines the intent to preserve contract validity. However, without provided law snippets explicitly mandating the placement of a severability clause or detailing the consequences of its relocation, the contradiction remains weak. The absence of a specific legal mandate within the provided snippets means there's no direct legal violation. The argument rests on an interpretation of implied intent rather than a concrete legal requirement, so the contradiction score is 0.3."

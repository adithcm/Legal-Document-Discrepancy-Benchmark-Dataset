Information at or after such time that is disclosed to either party by a third party entitled to disclose such information c. Information which is required by law to be disclosed to federal, state or local authorities. 9) Governing Law This Agreement is entered into in the State of Texas and shall be interpreted according to the laws of the State of Nevada.",

TERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF THE TITLE; PARTIES' POWER TO CHOOSE APPLICABLE LAW. (a) Except as provided hereafter in this section, when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to this state and also to another state or nation the parties may agree that the law either of this state or of such other state or nation shall govern their rights and duties. Failing such agreement this title applies to transactions bearing an appropriate relation to this state.

        "justification": "The original contract specified Texas law, but the modified version changed it to Nevada, placing this change within the confidentiality section. The Law Explanation suggests this relocation and change of state creates ambiguity regarding the governing law, potentially contradicting the intention of the parties. Scraped Law Snippet 1, specifically Section 1.301(a) of the Texas Business and Commerce Code, states that parties can agree on a governing law if the transaction has a reasonable relation to that state. While the modification doesn't directly violate this section (as parties *can* choose another state), it introduces ambiguity through its placement, making the agreement less clear, weakening the initial clear choice of Texas law. The contradiction score reflects this ambiguity, as the law permits choosing another state, but the manner of the change reduces clarity and potentially undermines the initial agreement on Texas law."

        "justification": "The structural flaw introduced by moving the compensation clause arguably makes it easier to overlook, as it's placed near the 'Modifications' clause. The LLM's Law Explanation suggests this could weaken the enforceability of the clause, giving the company more power. Snippet 1 contains general information about the formation of contracts for the sale of goods, stating in section 2.204 (a) that \"A contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract.\" While the relocation of the clause may not directly violate the law, its placement could make it harder to demonstrate 'agreement', especially if it is 'overlooked'.

Scraped Law Snippet 1 discusses various statutes of limitations in Texas, including a four-year period for specific performance of a contract (Sec. 16.004). While the Law Explanation connects the difficulty of finding the clause to a potential limitation on legal recourse, it's a somewhat weak link. The snippet doesn't directly say that obscuring a clause affects the statute of limitations; it simply states the period. The relocation of the clause may make it less obvious, but it doesn't inherently violate the statute of limitations. Therefore, a low contradiction score is appropriate."

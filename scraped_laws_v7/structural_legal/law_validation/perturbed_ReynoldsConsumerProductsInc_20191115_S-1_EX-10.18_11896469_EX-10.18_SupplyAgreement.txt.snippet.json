The Law Explanation mentions Illinois Compiled Statutes 815 ILCS 205/4, which regulates interest rates and finance charges. Scraped Law Snippet 1, however, is from 775 ILCS 20, which deals with defense contract employment discrimination, and therefore does not address usury or interest rate limits. Because the provided law snippet is irrelevant to the claim of usury, the contradiction strength is moderate; if a relevant usury law from Illinois were provided, the score would likely be higher. The perturbation creates a potential contradiction because the capped rate might conflict with legally allowed rates, even if a direct statute is not evidenced here."

The conflicting legal rules may come from U.S. federal law, the laws of U.S. states, or the laws of other countries. The process by which a court determines what law to apply is sometimes referred to as \"characterization\" or \"classification.\" This determination must be made in accordance with the law of the forum . A federal court in a case before it based on diversity of citizenship , for example, determines the conflict of law issue as if it were the highest court in the state in which it is sitting. Courts faced with a choice of law issue generally have two choices: A court can apply the law of the forum ( lex fori ) -- which is usually the result when the question of what law to apply is procedural . Or the court can apply the law of the site of the transaction or occurrence that gave rise to the litigation in the first place ( lex loci ) -- this is usually the controlling law selected when the matter is substantive . Federal courts play by different rules than state courts because federal jurisdiction is limited to what has been enumerated in the Constitution . The rules that federal courts must obey regarding which laws to apply are extremely complex.

The Parties will attempt to select a mutually acceptable JAMS mediator within ten (10) days of the notice requesting mediation.

        "justification": "The changed text weakens the original agreement by removing specific details regarding dispute resolution, which could lead to enforceability issues under Illinois law. The removal of the jury trial waiver, as addressed in 735 ILCS 5/2-1105, introduces uncertainty about whether the parties knowingly waived their right to a jury trial. While the statute outlines procedures for demanding a jury trial, the original contract explicitly waived this right, which is now absent in the changed text. This omission creates a potential contradiction as it is unclear if the parties intended to waive this right. Additionally, the removal of the specific jurisdiction (Lake or Cook County, Illinois) from the litigation clause makes the venue provision less precise and potentially harder to enforce, further contributing to the contradiction."

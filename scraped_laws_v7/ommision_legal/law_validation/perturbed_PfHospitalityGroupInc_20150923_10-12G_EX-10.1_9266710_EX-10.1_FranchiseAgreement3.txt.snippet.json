        "justification": "The original contract explicitly requires the member to pay court costs and attorney's fees, while the changed contract removes this obligation. Florida Statute 57.105 allows a court to award attorney's fees to the prevailing party under certain circumstances. While the statute doesn't mandate the payment of attorney's fees in every case, the original contract language strengthens the franchisor's position to recover these fees, and the removal of this clause weakens it. This creates a contradiction, albeit not a direct one, because the changed contract does not explicitly violate the statute but removes a contractual provision that aligns with its potential application. The statute allows for attorney's fees to be awarded; the original contract ensured payment, while the modified contract removes that guarantee. Therefore, a contradiction score of 0.6 is appropriate."

In any action concerning enforcement of a restrictive covenant: (a) A court shall not enforce a restrictive covenant unless it is set forth in a writing signed by the person against whom enforcement is sought.

The term \u201clegitimate business interest\u201d includes, but is not limited to: 1. Trade secrets, as defined in s. 688.002 (4). 2.

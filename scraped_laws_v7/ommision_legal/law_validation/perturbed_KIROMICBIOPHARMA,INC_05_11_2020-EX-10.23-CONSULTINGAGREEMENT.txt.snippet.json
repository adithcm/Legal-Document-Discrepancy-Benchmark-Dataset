In Texas, some regulations require companies to retain control over who performs work under certain agreements, particularly in sensitive industries.

While not directly prohibiting subcontracting, it implies a standard of reasonable delegation with consideration for the other party's interest in having the original promisor perform. Removing the consent requirement weakens the company's control over performance, potentially conflicting with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Texas contract law, especially if the subcontracting leads to deficient performance or exposes the company to unforeseen liabilities. By removing the clause requiring consent, the consultant can bring anyone and assign work. This could result in the company being responsible for third parties that are unvetted.",

Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless: (1) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer; (2) they materially alter it; or (3) notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received. (c) Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract. In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this title. Acts 1967, 60th Leg., p. 2343, ch. 785, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1967. Sec. 2.209. MODIFICATION, RESCISSION AND WAIVER. (a) An agreement modifying a contract within this chapter needs no consideration to be binding. (b) A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants such a requirement on a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the other party. (c) The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this chapter (Section 2.201 ) must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions. (d) Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of Subsection (b) or (c) it can operate as a waiver. (e) A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of the contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver. Acts 1967, 60th Leg., p. 2343, ch. 785, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1967. Sec. 2.210. DELEGATION OF PERFORMANCE; ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS. (a) A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach. (b) Unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise. (c) The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the seller's interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer's chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of Subsection (b) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but (i) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement. (d) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of \"the contract\" is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the ass",

        "justification": "The changed text removes the requirement for the Company's consent before the Consultant subcontracts duties, potentially conflicting with Texas Business & Commerce Code \u00a7 2.210. Snippet 1, section (a) states \"A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract.\" By removing the consent requirement, the company loses control over who performs the duties and their right to object, which could contradict their substantial interest in controlling the performance, as highlighted in the perturbation explanation. While 2.210(a) does allow delegation 'unless otherwise agreed', the original contract included a clause requiring consent to ensure the company had control. The removal of this control mechanism, while not a direct violation, weakens the company's position and could expose them to risks associated with unvetted subcontractors, which creates a contradiction. Scraped Law Snippet 2 is unavailable, which does not affect the evaluation in this case. Since the law doesn't explicitly prohibit the altered language, but allows for control by the contracting party, the contradiction score is not at its highest."

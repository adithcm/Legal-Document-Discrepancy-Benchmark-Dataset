By only requiring 'reasonable efforts,' the modified text opens the door to potentially non-compliant products entering the market, thus conflicting with the absolute prohibition described in the law. The original text aligns with the legal obligation to prevent the introduction of adulterated or misbranded products, whereas the changed text weakens this obligation.

        "justification": "The original contract language mandated the forwarding and addressing of off-label medical information requests, ensuring healthcare professionals receive information concerning drug use. The changed language makes these actions optional. While the scraped snippets (21 CFR 201.56 and 21 CFR 201.57) do not explicitly mandate the handling of off-label requests, they generally pertain to the 'content and format of labeling for human prescription drug and biological products,' implying a need for comprehensive information dissemination to ensure safe and effective drug use. The omission of mandatory action in the changed text weakens the likelihood that healthcare professionals will receive crucial information, potentially conflicting with the broader intention of adequate labeling as outlined by the CFR sections. Therefore, the contradiction is moderate, as it undermines the spirit of providing complete drug information without directly violating the explicit wording of the snippets."

        "scraped_snippet_2": "contract | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! \u00d7 No thank you contract A contract is an agreement between parties , creating mutual obligations that are enforceable by law . The basic elements required for the agreement to be a legally enforceable contract are: mutual assent , expressed by a valid offer and acceptance ; adequate consideration ; capacity ; and legality . In some states , elements of consideration can be satisfied by a valid substitute. Possible remedies for breach of contract include general damages , consequential damages , reliance damages , and specific performance . Background : Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. Contract law is generally governed by state common law , and while general overall contract law is common throughout the country, some specific court interpretations of a particular element of the contract may vary between the states. If a promise is breached, the law provides remedies to the harmed party, often in the form of monetary damages, or in limited circumstances, in the form of specific performance of the promise made. Elements -- Consideration and Mutual Assent Contracts arise when a duty comes into existence, because of a promise made by one of the parties. To be legally binding as a contract, a promise must be exchanged for adequate consideration. There are two different theories or definitions of consideration: Bargain Theory of Consideration and Benefit-Detriment theory of consideration. Benefit-Detriment Under the b enefit-detriment theory, an adequate consideration exists only when a promise made to the benefit of the promisor or to the detriment of the promisee, which reasonably and fairly induces the promisor to make a promise for something else for the promisee. For example, promises that are purely gifts are not considered enforceable because the personal satisfaction the grantor of the promise may receive from the act of generosity is normally not considered sufficient detriment to constitute adequate consideration. Bargain-for-Exchange Under Bargain-for-Exchange theory of consideration, adequate consideration exists when a promisor makes a promise in return for something else. Here, the essential condition is that the promisor was given something specifically to induce the promise being made. In other words, the bargain for exchange theory is different from the detriment-benefit theory in that the focus in bargain for exchange theory seems to be the parties\u2019 motive for making the promises and the parties\u2019 subjective mutual assent, while in detriment benefit theory, the focus seems to be an objective legal detriment or benefit to the parties. Governing Laws Contracts are mainly governed by state statutory and common (judge-made) law and private law (i.e. the private agreement). Private law principally includes the terms of the agreement between the parties who are exchanging promises. This private law may override many of the rules otherwise established by state law. Statutory law, such as the Statute of Fraud , may require some kinds of contracts be put in writing and executed with particular formalities, for the contract to be enforceable. Otherwise, the parties may enter into a binding agreement without signing a formal written document. For example, Virginia Supreme Court has held in Lucy v. Zehmer that even an agreement made on a piece of napkin can be considered a valid contract, if the parties were both sane, and showed mutual assent and consideration. Most of the principles of the common law of contracts are outlined in the Restatement of Law, Second Contracts published by the American Law Institute. The Uniform Commercial Code , whose original articles have been adopted in nearly every state, represents a body of statutory law that governs important categories of contracts. The main articles that deal with the law of contracts are Article 1 (General Provisions) and Article 2 (Sales) . Sections of Article 9 (",

        "justification": "The modified text introduces a contradiction by changing a mandatory obligation to a discretionary one. The original text states \"Each Party shall provide...\" while the changed text states \"Each Party may...\" This weakens the enforceability of the insurance provision. Scraped Law Snippet 2 defines a contract as 'an agreement between parties, creating mutual obligations that are enforceable by law.' By making the provision of proof of insurance discretionary, the 'mutual obligation' to provide proof upon request is undermined, creating a weaker contract with potentially unenforceable terms. This aligns with the Perturbation Explanation, which highlights the increased legal risk due to the ability to avoid demonstrating adequate insurance coverage. The Law Explanation further reinforces this by pointing out the breach of contract scenario that arises if adequate insurance isn't maintained and verified. The change significantly impacts the enforceability of a key contractual element."

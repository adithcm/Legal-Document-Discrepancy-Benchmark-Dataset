It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

        "explanation": "By removing the option for the member to pay via 'equivalent reduction in benefits or payment in cash' and removing the set interest rate, the contract removes options for the member while obscuring the true impact on the insured party.

        "justification": "The changed text removes the policyholder's options for managing deficiency payments and omits the interest rate, which may violate Wis. Stat. \u00a7 628.34(1), which prohibits insurance communications containing misleading information, including information misleading due to incompleteness. Snippet 2, specifically 628.34(1)(a), states that 'No person...may make or cause to be made any communication relating to an insurance contract...that contains false or misleading information, including information that is misleading because of incompleteness.' The omission of payment options and the interest rate could be deemed 'incomplete' and therefore misleading, suggesting the change is unfair to the policyholder. The removal of specified payment methods and leaving the interest rate unspecified increases the potential for unfairness and lack of transparency. Therefore, a contradiction score of 0.7 is appropriate."

        "justification": "The changed contract text, by replacing 'will be credited' with 'may be credited,' introduces ambiguity regarding dividend payouts. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 628.34(1)(a), as shown in Scraped Law Snippet 2, prohibits communications related to insurance contracts that contain 'false or misleading information, including information that is misleading because of incompleteness.' While the original text explicitly stated no dividends were expected, the revised version creates a potential for misleading consumers into believing they might receive dividends when that is not the intention. This incompleteness regarding dividend expectations, thus, arguably violates the statute. The contradiction score is 0.7 because, while the change introduces ambiguity, it doesn't definitively state something false, only incomplete."

        "justification": "The changed text weakens the assurance of fixed membership rights, potentially violating Wis. Stat. \u00a7 628.34(1) which prohibits misleading communications related to insurance contracts. The original text clearly states the rights are 'set forth in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws' and 'separate from the ownership of this contract,' implying a degree of stability and independence. By contrast, the changed text states the rights are 'subject to change,' which could be interpreted as misleading because it introduces uncertainty about the benefits and allows for arbitrary modifications. This contradicts the law's aim to prevent incompleteness, as specified in snippet 2: '...information that is misleading because of incompleteness.' The potential for arbitrary change weakens the contract and creates a misleading impression, as forbidden by the statute."

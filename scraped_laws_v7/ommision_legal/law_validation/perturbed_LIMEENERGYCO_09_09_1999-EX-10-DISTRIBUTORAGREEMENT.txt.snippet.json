Company further warrants that the Products sold hereunder shall be free from defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period of twenty-four (24) months after delivery to Distributor's end-user.

        "explanation": "The removal of the 24-month warranty period and the omission of the statement requiring compliance with the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act weakens consumer protection. This creates a legal risk, because the products do have to comply, and customers can have implied rights beyond the written warranty, and the contract should not try to imply otherwise.",

        "law_explanation": "By omitting the requirement to comply with the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and removing the explicit warranty period, the modified text contradicts the Act's provisions for clear and conspicuous disclosure of warranty terms for consumer products exceeding a certain price threshold. Consumers are not clearly informed of their warranty rights and the obligations of the warrantor.",

        "justification": "The omission of the 24-month warranty and the explicit mention of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act raises a moderate contradiction. While specific legal snippets are unavailable to definitively confirm a direct violation, the perturbation explanation suggests that removing the warranty period and compliance statement weakens consumer protection and might create a misleading impression about consumer rights, especially concerning implied warranties. The Law Explanation supports this by pointing out the failure to clearly inform consumers of their warranty rights, which contrasts with the Act's aim for clear disclosure. The absence of scraped snippets limits a precise assessment, but the explanations together imply a weakening of consumer protection measures, warranting a contradiction score of 0.7."

        "justification": "The changed text introduces a potential contradiction with Illinois law, specifically 820 ILCS 120/2, if the distributor qualifies as a sales representative. The original text established a clear 30-day payment window. The changed text allows the Company to unilaterally determine the payment schedule. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 concerns labor disputes and is not directly applicable, the Law Explanation points to 820 ILCS 120/2 requiring timely commission payments. The absence of a second relevant law snippet weakens the certainty of the contradiction. However, the unilateral control over payment timing introduced by the change creates a risk of violating the timely payment requirement mentioned in the Law Explanation, justifying a moderate contradiction score."

Before such appropriation is approved, the sheriff must present to the county board his outline of how the junior deputy sheriff program will operate. In this presentation, the sheriff should demonstrate that this program will educate the children of the county as to the rights, duties and obligations of a citizen of this State and should show that the program is designed to acquaint these children with the work of law enforcement agencies and officers.

        "scrape_success": 1,

        "justification": "The modified contract removes the original text's representation that the products do not cause harmful emissions or infringe on third-party rights. The Law Explanation suggests this increases the risk of violating the Illinois Environmental Protection Act. However, Scraped Law Snippet 1 focuses on the 'Junior Deputy Sheriff Act' (55 ILCS 115), outlining a program for children and county sheriffs. It does not address environmental regulations or product emissions. Scraped Law Snippet 2 is empty. Because neither law snippet directly relates to product emissions, environmental hazards, or infringement on third-party rights, the contradiction is weak. While the Perturbation Explanation and Law Explanation raise concerns, there's no direct legal basis in the provided snippets to confirm a clear contradiction; the removal of the clause only creates a potential for future issues if products violate environmental laws. Therefore, a low contradiction score of 0.2 is appropriate."

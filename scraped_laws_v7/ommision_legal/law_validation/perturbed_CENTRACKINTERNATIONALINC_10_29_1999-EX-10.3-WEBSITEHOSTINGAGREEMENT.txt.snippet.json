By removing the first sentence, 'i-on will not be liable under any circumstances for any lost profits or other consequential damages, even if i-on has been advised as to the possibility of such damages,' the contract becomes ambiguous regarding consequential damages, which may be subject to certain limitations or waivers under Florida law, but not a complete bar.

        "justification": "The original text contained a waiver for consequential damages, which the changed text omits. Florida Statute 672.719(3), as presented in Scraped Law Snippet 1, allows for the limitation or exclusion of consequential damages unless unconscionable, particularly regarding consumer goods. The omission weakens the protection previously offered to i-on, as the changed text no longer explicitly limits liability for consequential damages, leaving it open to interpretation and potential legal challenges, especially if deemed unconscionable under the statute. However, it doesn't directly violate the law, because the law permits limitations; it doesn't mandate them. Therefore, a score of 0.6 reflects that the change introduces ambiguity and potential legal risk, rather than a direct violation."

(c) \u201cCustomer records\u201d means any material, regardless of the physical form, on which personal information is recorded or preserved by any means, including, but not limited to, written or spoken words, graphically depicted, printed, or electromagnetically transmitted that are provided by an individual in this state to a covered entity for the purpose of purchasing or leasing a product or obtaining a service.

        "justification": "The changed text removes a requirement for i-on to approve software installations, potentially increasing the risk of security breaches. The Law Explanation suggests this could raise concerns about compliance with Florida's data security laws, specifically mentioning Florida Statute \u00a7 501.171. Scraped Law Snippet 1 defines a 'breach of security' as 'unauthorized access of data in electronic form containing personal information' and includes 'covered entities' which are commercial entities that 'acquire, maintain, stores, or uses personal information.' While the change doesn't directly violate the statute by itself, removing the approval process increases the risk of a breach, making the entity potentially liable under \u00a7 501.171 if a breach occurs due to unapproved software. Therefore, the contradiction is not direct, but the modification increases the risk of violating the law, warranting a moderate contradiction score."

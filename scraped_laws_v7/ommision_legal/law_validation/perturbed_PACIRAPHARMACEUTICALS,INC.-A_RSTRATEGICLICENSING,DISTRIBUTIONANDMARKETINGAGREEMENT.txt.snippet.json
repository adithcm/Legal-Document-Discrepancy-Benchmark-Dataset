By removing 'thirty (30) days prior written notice of any cancellation of its coverage or reduction in coverage from the requirements stated herein', this introduces a greater risk of not knowing the other party is not insured.",

Any person, firm or corporation which sells or installs urea-formaldehyde foam insulation shall give written notice to the purchaser of such insulation or the owner of the building wherein such insulation is installed, stating as follows: \u201cThis insulation is urea-formaldehyde based and may emit formaldehyde. After installation of this product, some people have experienced adverse physical effects from formaldehyde emissions, including unpleasant odor, watery eyes, and nose and throat irritations. These conditions may be alleviated by introducing fresh air into the building. Exposure to urea-formaldehyde foam insulation is not recommended for persons who have been previously sensitized to formaldehyde, or who have a history of respiratory problems. Urea-formaldehyde foam insulation is not recommended for use in attics, below grade or wall cavities deeper than six inches.

Scraped Law Snippet 2 discusses urea-formaldehyde foam insulation and notice requirements related to its sale and installation, which is irrelevant to the insurance requirements in the contract. Scraped Law Snippet 1 is 'None'.

The Law Explanation suggests this hinders timely legal action and potentially violates the duty of good faith. Scraped Law Snippet 2, which outlines remedies for trademark infringement, including sections on 'Remedies; infringement' (1114), 'Injunctive relief' (1116), and 'Recovery for violation of rights' (1117), provides a relevant context. While the snippet doesn't explicitly mandate notification, the omission of a mandatory notification clause weakens the ability to effectively pursue these remedies. The contradiction isn't direct (hence, not a score of 1.0) as the law doesn't explicitly require such a notification in a contract. However, it undermines the ability to address infringements promptly, affecting the enforcement of rights under trademark law, thus justifying a score of 0.6."

        "scraped_snippet_1": "to quantify precisely the amount of selective disclosure -- just as it is difficult to quantify precisely the amount of ordinary insider trading. Incidents of selective disclosure, like insider trading, by definition are not conducted openly and in public view. Nevertheless, we have noted numerous media reports in the past two years alleging selective, exclusionary disclosure practices. 11 More generally, surveys of practices of issuer personnel indicate significant acknowledgement of the use of selective disclosure of material information. 12 Based on these public reports, as well as our staff's experience, it is clear to us that the problem of selective disclosure is not limited, as some commenters have suggested, to just a few isolated incidents. Some commenters cited a February 2000 NIRI survey suggesting an improvement in issuer disclosure practices, in that most issuers responding to the survey now are opening certain of their conference calls to individual investors. 13 To the extent this demonstrates voluntary improvement in response to our efforts to focus attention on the problem, 14 we believe this is a positive development. However, these voluntary steps, while laudable, have been far from fully effective. We note, for example, that all of the public reports of selective disclosure cited above occurred after the Commission had begun to focus public attention on issuer selective disclosure. Some occurred even after we proposed Regulation FD. This suggests that the problematic practices targeted by Regulation FD are continuing to occur. Finally, the overwhelming support from investors for Regulation FD demonstrates a strong perception among the investing public that selective disclosure is a significant problem, and shows a corresponding need to prohibit this practice in order to bolster investor confidence in the fairness of the disclosure process. Some commenters contended that rulemaking on this topic was an inappropriately broad response to the issue. 15 They suggested instead that we use existing tools (namely, the law of insider trading) to bring individual enforcement actions in those cases that appear to involve significant selective disclosures. While we have considered this approach -- and of course we remain free to bring such cases where a selective disclosure does violate insider trading laws -- we do not agree that this is the appropriate response to the legal uncertainties posed by current insider trading law. In other contexts, we have been criticized for attempting to \"make new law\" in an uncertain area by means of enforcement action and urged instead to seek to change the law through notice-and-comment rulemaking. We believe that this rulemaking is the more careful and considered response to the problem presented by selective disclosure. 16 3. Effect of Regulation FD on Issuer Communications One frequently expressed concern was that Regulation FD would not lead to broader dissemination of information, but would in fact have a \"chilling effect\" on the disclosure of information by issuers. 17 In the view of these commenters, issuers would find it so difficult to determine when a disclosure of information would be \"material\" (and therefore subject to the regulation) that, rather than face potential liability and other consequences of violating Regulation FD, they would cease informal communications with the outside world altogether. 18 Some of these commenters therefore recommended that the Commission not adopt any mandatory rule prohibiting selective disclosure, like Regulation FD, but instead pursue voluntary means of addressing the problem, such as interpretive guidance, or the promotion of a \"blue ribbon\" panel to develop best practices for issuer disclosure. Other commenters recommended various ways that Regulation FD could be made narrower or more well-defined, in order to ameliorate some of the concerns about chilling. Other commenters, however, took issue with the supposition that issuer disclosu",

The omission of the mandatory consultation clause increases the potential for selective disclosure, aligning with the concerns expressed in Scraped Law Snippet 1. The score is moderate because the change doesn't directly violate a specific law mentioned in the snippets, but increases the risk of actions that could."

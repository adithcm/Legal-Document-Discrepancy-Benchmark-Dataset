This landmark law secures new privacy rights for California consumers, including: The right to know about the personal information a business collects about them and how it is used and shared; The right to delete personal information collected from them (with some exceptions); The right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information including via the GPC ; The right to non-discrimination for exercising their CCPA rights. In November of 2020, California voters approved Proposition 24, the CPRA , which amended the CCPA and added new additional privacy protections that began on January 1, 2023. As of January 1, 2023, consumers have new rights in addition to those above, such as: The right to correct inaccurate personal information that a business has about them; and The right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information collected about them. Businesses that are subject to the CCPA have several responsibilities, including responding to consumer requests to exercise these rights and giving consumers certain notices explaining their privacy practices . The CCPA applies to many businesses, including data brokers . CPRA amends the CCPA; it does not create a separate, new law. As a result, our office typically refers to the law as \u201cCCPA\u201d or \u201cCCPA, as amended.\u201d Links to Topics A. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CCPA B.

DATA BROKERS AND THE CCPA Other Consumer Resources on CCPA Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) These FAQs provide general consumer information about the CCPA and how you can exercise your rights under the CCPA. They are not legal advice, regulatory guidance, or an opinion of the Attorney General. We will update this information periodically. A. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CCPA 1. What rights do I have under the CCPA? If you are a California resident, you may ask businesses to disclose what personal information they have about you and what they do with that information, to delete your personal information, to direct businesses not to sell or share your personal information, to correct inaccurate information that they have about you, and to limit businesses\u2019 use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information: Right to know : You can request that a business disclose to you: (1) the categories and/or specific pieces of personal information they have collected about you, (2) the categories of sources for that personal information, (3) the purposes for which the business uses that information, (4) the categories of third parties with whom the business discloses the information, and (5) the categories of information that the business sells or discloses to third parties. You can make a request to know up to twice a year, free of charge. Right to delete : You can request that businesses delete personal information they collected from you and tell their service providers to do the same, subject to certain exceptions (such as if the business is legally required to keep the information). Right to opt-out of sale or sharing : You may request that businesses stop selling or sharing your personal information (\u201copt-out\u201d), including via a user-enabled global privacy control. Businesses cannot sell or share your personal information after they receive your opt-out request unless you later authorize them to do so again. Right to correc",

        "justification": "The changed text, which allows software installation without explicit user agreement, strongly contradicts the principles outlined in the CCPA. The Law Explanation states that the modified text circumvents the requirement for explicit consent for data collection (implicitly including software installation) under CCPA. Scraped Law Snippet 2 explicitly mentions the 'right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information' and that 'businesses cannot sell or share your personal information after they receive your opt-out request unless you later authorize them to do so again'. Installing software without affirmative consent effectively collects data without the user's explicit agreement, severely undermining the right to opt-out as described in Snippet 2 and the requirements for consent inferred by the Law Explanation. Scraped Law Snippet 1 also refers to methods of limiting the sale, sharing, and use of personal information, which implies a requirement to obtain consent before such activities, something the modified text disregards. Therefore, the contradiction is significant, warranting a score of 0.8."

        "justification": "The original contract mandated strict compliance with export laws, while the changed version only requires 'reasonable efforts'. This weakening of the obligation creates a contradiction with the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), as suggested by the Law Explanation, which indicates that the EAR requires strict compliance. Scraped Law Snippet 1, while primarily a navigation guide to the eCFR, indirectly supports this by highlighting the significance of Title 15, which contains regulations regarding commerce and trade relevant to export control. Scraped Law Snippet 2 is a 404 error page, and therefore cannot be used to strengthen the argument. The change from 'shall comply' to 'reasonable efforts' introduces ambiguity and the potential for non-compliance, justifying a contradiction score of 0.7."

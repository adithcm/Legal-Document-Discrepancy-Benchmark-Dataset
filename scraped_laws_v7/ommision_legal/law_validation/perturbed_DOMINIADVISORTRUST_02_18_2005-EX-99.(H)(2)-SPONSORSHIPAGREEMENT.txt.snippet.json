        "justification": "The changed text significantly reduces the Sponsor's duties, potentially contradicting 15 U.S. Code \u00a7 80a-30, which mandates the maintenance of records by registered investment companies. The original text explicitly lists numerous oversight, administrative, and management services performed by the Sponsor. The changed text limits the Sponsor's duties to merely 'maintaining office facilities.' This reduction could hinder the investment company's ability to maintain adequate records as required by law. Snippet 1 and 2 both highlight that 'each registered investment company... shall maintain and preserve such records... as the Commission, by rules and regulations, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.' The drastic reduction of Sponsor duties introduces a tangible risk that the investment company may fail to adequately uphold the record-keeping requirements as the sponsor's oversight is considerably limited. The score reflects a likely but not definitive contradiction, as the text doesn't explicitly state the Sponsor is solely responsible for all record-keeping, just that its diminished role poses a significant risk."

Each Party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction, forum and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court or the federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) over any and all claims, disputes, controversies or disagreements between the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns under or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including their execution, performance or enforcement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise.",

Each Party consents to the jurisdiction, forum and venue as determined appropriate by the other Party.",
        "explanation": "By removing the explicit consent to Delaware courts and replacing it with a clause allowing one party to unilaterally determine jurisdiction, the contract violates principles of fair contracting and could potentially force the other party into an unfavorable or inaccessible jurisdiction. This could be seen as a violation of good faith and fair dealing, especially if the chosen jurisdiction has no connection to the contract or the parties involved. This introduces legal risk by making the enforceability of the agreement questionable, particularly if it is challenged on the grounds of unfairness or unconscionability. ",

Depending on the exact setting, good faith may require an honest belief or purpose, faithful performance of duties , observance of fair dealing standards, or an absence of fraudulent intent . A fiduciary relationship creates a duty of good faith between the agent and the principal . The breach of this duty of good faith can lead to liability . Failure to act in good faith is known as bad faith and is generally considered to be a level of culpability greater than negligence .

        "justification": "The modified contract text contradicts the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as the clause unilaterally designating jurisdiction to one party allows for potentially biased or prejudicial forum selection, as explained in the Law Explanation. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 is missing, Scraped Law Snippet 2 defines good faith as requiring \"observance of fair dealing standards\". The original contract had mutually agreed upon jurisdiction. By removing this mutual agreement and handing it to a single party, the change introduces a risk of unfair dealing, weakening the protection afforded to the other party and potentially violating the standard of good faith. The unilateral nature of the jurisdiction clause allows for potential manipulation, making the contradiction score a 0.7."

While Delaware generally permits jury trial waivers, courts closely scrutinize them to ensure they are knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.

        "justification": "The modified contract removes a key element that supports the knowing and voluntary nature of the jury trial waiver. The Perturbation Explanation highlights that without the statement 'THIS SECTION HAS BEEN FULLY DISCUSSED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES AND THESE PROVISIONS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY EXCEPTIONS,' the waiver's validity is questionable. The Law Explanation specifies that Delaware courts scrutinize jury trial waivers to ensure they are knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. The omission weakens evidence of voluntariness and understanding, potentially rendering the waiver unenforceable under Delaware law. Since no scraped law snippets were provided, the score is based solely on the Law Explanation and Perturbation Explanation, which suggest a moderate contradiction as the removal of evidence impacts enforceability."

The original text explicitly required that interim measures be \u201cduly granted by a court of competent jurisdiction\u201d, while the changed text removes this stipulation. Since we have no law snippets to evaluate, the contradiction is based on the Perturbation Explanation and Law Explanation, which connect the removal of court oversight to potential due process concerns. Without a law snippet directly addressing interim measures or due process, the contradiction strength is moderate."

        "justification": "The changed text weakens the due diligence requirement, potentially contradicting the intent of securities regulations to ensure truthful disclosures, as stated in the Law Explanation. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 (17 CFR \u00a7 240.13d-1) focuses on the filing requirements of Schedules 13D and 13G for beneficial owners, it doesn't explicitly address the specific responsibility for the accuracy of information provided by other parties. However, the omission of the clause concerning awareness of inaccuracies in others' filings reduces overall accountability, which indirectly undermines the comprehensive disclosure sought by the regulation. Because the snippet doesn't directly address the removed clause, but the explanation suggests a conflict with overall disclosure goals, the contradiction score is moderate."

The original text explicitly mentions filing 'with the applicable regulatory authorities' and 'any future amendments thereto', directly acknowledging the need to keep filings current and compliant with the relevant bodies. The omission of these phrases in the changed text implies a lesser commitment to full regulatory compliance. Scraped Law Snippet 1, specifically 17 CFR \u00a7 240.13d-1 (a), mandates filing 'with the Commission' (meaning the SEC) within a specific timeframe. The omission of 'applicable regulatory authorities' undermines the explicit agreement to comply with this requirement, even though the text still mentions filing Schedule 13G or 13D. Additionally, the removal of 'any future amendments thereto' weakens the commitment to maintain accurate and updated filings, also required by securities regulations. The absence of Scraped Law Snippet 2 makes it difficult to provide more support but Snippet 1 offers strong support for a contradiction."

This regulation mandates that individuals acquiring beneficial ownership of more than five percent of a class of equity security must file a statement within five business days after the date of acquisition. While the rule doesn't explicitly state that the agreement itself must be dated, the date of the agreement is crucial to determining the acquisition date and therefore the deadline for filing. Without a date on the agreement, verifying compliance with the five-day filing requirement becomes significantly more difficult, increasing the risk of non-compliance. The missing date doesn't directly violate the rule but weakens its enforceability, supporting a contradiction score of 0.7. Scraped Law Snippet 2 could not be used to further evaluation due to document missing error."

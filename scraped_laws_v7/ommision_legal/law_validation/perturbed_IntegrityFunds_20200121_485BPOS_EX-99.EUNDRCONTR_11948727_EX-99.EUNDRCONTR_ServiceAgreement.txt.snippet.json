The Perturbation Explanation and Law Explanation suggest this omission violates Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which mandates approval by a majority of independent directors. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 is a 'Document not Found' error, Scraped Law Snippet 2 lists '15 80a-15' as corresponding to Section 15 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Although the snippet provides no direct text from the act itself, its linking of '15 80a-15' to the Act supports the assertion that Section 15 is indeed relevant. Removing the 'non-interested' trustee approval substantially weakens the investor protection intended by Section 15, making a strong contradiction."

If an investment adviser's primary business is advising Funds or other advisory clients, all of the investment adviser's directors, officers, and general partners are presumed to be Access Persons of any Fund advised by the investment adviser. All of a Fund 's directors, officers, and general partners are presumed to be Access Persons of the Fund . (ii) Any director, officer or general partner of a principal underwriter who, in the ordinary course of business, makes, participates in or obtains information regarding, the purchase or sale of Covered Securities by the Fund for which the principal underwriter acts, or whose functions or duties in the ordinary course of business relate to the making of any recommendation to the Fund regarding the purchase or sale of Covered Securities. (2) Advisory person of a Fund or of a Fund 's investment adviser means: (i) Any director, officer, general partner or employee of the Fund or investment adviser (or of any company in a control relationship to the Fund or investment adviser) who, in connection with his or her regular functions or duties, makes, participates in, or obtains information regarding, the purchase or sale of Covered Securities by a Fund , or whose functions relate to the making of any recommendations with respect to such purchases or sales; and (ii) Any natural person in a control relationship to the Fund or investment adviser who obtains information concerning recommendations made to the Fund with regard to the purchase or sale of Covered Securities by the Fund . (3) Control has the same meaning as in section 2(a)(9) of the Act [ 15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(9) ]. (4) Covered security means a security as defined in section 2(a)(36) of the Act [ 15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(36) ], except that it does not include: (i) Direct obligations of the Government of the United States; (ii) Bankers' acceptances, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper and high quality short-term debt instruments, including repurchase agreements; and (iii) Shares issued by open-end Funds. (5) Fund means an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act .

(9) Purchase or sale of a covered security includes, among other things, the writing of an option to purchase or sell a Covered Security .

        "justification": "The perturbation explanation states that by removing the clause holding Integrity liable for 'willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence,' the agreement becomes potentially unenforceable under Section 17(i) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Law Explanation further elaborates that Section 17(i) prohibits protection for breaches of fiduciary duty due to willful or bad faith conduct, making the omission contradictory. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 is a 'Document not Found' error and therefore cannot provide specific information, Scraped Law Snippet 2 discusses personal investment activities of investment company personnel under 17 CFR \u00a7 270.17j-1. Although this snippet does not directly address the indemnification issue, it indicates the presence of regulations under the Investment Company Act. The omission of the clause directly weakens the fund's protection against Integrity's potential breaches of fiduciary duty, thus creating a moderate contradiction; thus, a score of 0.7."

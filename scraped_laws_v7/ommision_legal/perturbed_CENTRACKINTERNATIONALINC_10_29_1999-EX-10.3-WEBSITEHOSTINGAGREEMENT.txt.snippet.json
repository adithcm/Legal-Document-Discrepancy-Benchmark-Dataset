        "explanation": "The original text contains a clause limiting liability for consequential damages. By removing the first sentence, 'i-on will not be liable under any circumstances for any lost profits or other consequential damages, even if i-on has been advised as to the possibility of such damages,' the contract becomes ambiguous regarding consequential damages, which may be subject to certain limitations or waivers under Florida law, but not a complete bar.

By removing the blanket waiver of liability for consequential damages, the contract opens up the possibility for such damages, and places it in compliance with this statute's allowance for such recovery in specific cases, but it is still an omission because it does not specify the exact conditions or allowable recovery.",

(2) Where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this code. (3) Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable.

        "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall instruct' with 'shall encourage,' making adherence discretionary rather than mandatory. The replacement of 'monitor and audit (in accordance with Valeant's standard practice)' with 'from time to time, monitor' introduces ambiguity regarding the frequency and rigor of monitoring, and replacing 'in adherence in all respects' with 'generally in accordance with' creates uncertainty and allows for deviations from full compliance.",

By weakening the obligation to 'encourage' instead of 'instruct,' reducing monitoring efforts, and allowing for 'general' rather than 'all respects' compliance, Valeant's activities may not meet the standards for lawful pharmaceutical promotion, potentially leading to the introduction of adulterated or misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.",

        "justification": "The modified contract language weakens the original obligation, potentially contradicting the FD&C Act as it relates to the introduction of adulterated or misbranded drugs. Snippet 2, 21 USC 331(a), prohibits the introduction or delivery of adulterated or misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. The change from 'shall instruct' to 'shall encourage,' coupled with the reduced monitoring ('from time to time' instead of 'in accordance with Valeant's standard practice') and the allowance for 'general' compliance ('generally in accordance with' instead of 'in adherence in all respects'), increases the risk that Valeant's activities may fail to prevent the introduction of such drugs. The original text creates a much stronger mandate for compliance with applicable laws, but the changed text gives considerably more leeway for non-compliance. Therefore, it creates a strong likelihood of contradiction."

Patient assistance programs must be structured carefully to avoid violating this statute. By weakening the assurance of full compliance with applicable laws and allowing for merely a 'generally compliant manner', the modified text raises concerns that the patient assistance program could be structured in a way that provides illegal remuneration to induce referrals, violating federal law.",

This introduces ambiguity regarding the level of compliance required. The Law Explanation suggests this could lead to violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute if the patient assistance program isn't carefully structured, potentially offering illegal remuneration for referrals. Although Scraped Law Snippet 1 is a 'Document not found' error, and Scraped Law Snippet 2 is 'None', the legal explanation highlights a potential conflict with federal law, which warrants a moderate contradiction score because the original text explicitly demands adherence to 'Applicable Law', whereas the changed text only requires a more ambiguous 'generally compliant manner.'"

        "justification": "The changed text weakens the original obligation to 'comply in all respects' to 'make reasonable efforts to comply', and changes 'require' to 'encourage' regarding Field Force Personnel compliance. The Law Explanation suggests this could lead to incomplete or inaccurate reporting under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. Scraped Law Snippet 2 points to 42 CFR Part 403 Subpart I, which concerns 'Transparency Reports and Reporting of Physician Ownership or Investment Interests.' While the snippet doesn't explicitly state the level of compliance required, the existence of penalties for failure to report (\u00a7 403.912) implies a stringent obligation. The changed text's ambiguity regarding compliance levels creates a potential contradiction by allowing for less than full compliance, increasing the risk of inaccurate reporting and possible violation of 42 CFR Part 403 Subpart I. The move from 'require' to 'encourage' further lowers the assurance of compliance. Therefore, a contradiction score of 0.7 is appropriate, indicating a likely, but not definitive, contradiction."

        "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT will conduct himself at all times with due regard to public morals and conventions. If the value of CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT is materially reduced or impaired because CONSULTANT: A.committed or shall commit any public act that involves moral turpitude, B.commits or violates any material foreign, U.S., federal, or other applicable state or local law, C.commits any act which brings him into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which insults or offends the community, D.makes any statements in derogation, in any material respect, of ADAMS GOLF or any of its affiliates or any of their respective PRODUCT or services and such statement is made to the general public or becomes a matter of public knowledge, then at any time after the occurrence of such act, thing or statement, ADAMS GOLF shall have the right, in addition to its other legal and equitable remedies, to immediately terminate this Agreement, by giving written notice to CONSULTANT. ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within ninety (90) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.",
        "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT will endeavor to conduct himself with general consideration for public perception. If ADAMS GOLF reasonably believes that CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT may be somewhat affected because CONSULTANT: A. possibly committed a public act, B. might have violated some law, C. arguably acted in a way that could be viewed negatively, D.made statements that could perhaps reflect poorly on ADAMS GOLF, then ADAMS GOLF may consider its options, potentially including termination, after notifying CONSULTANT. ADAMS GOLF should attempt to exercise its right of termination, if deemed necessary, within a reasonable timeframe of its management becoming aware of the conduct.",
        "explanation": "The modified text introduces significant ambiguity regarding the grounds for termination. Phrases like 'general consideration,' 'reasonably believes,' 'somewhat affected,' 'possibly committed,' 'might have violated,' 'arguably acted,' 'could perhaps reflect poorly,' 'may consider its options,' 'potentially including termination,' 'should attempt,' and 'reasonable timeframe' all weaken the original clear and objective standards. This makes it difficult to determine what constitutes a breach and when ADAMS GOLF can terminate the agreement, creating an ambiguous legal obligation.",

        "law_explanation": "The modified text contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which is recognized in Kansas law (K.S.A. \u00a7 84-1-304). The original clause provided specific and objective grounds for termination based on the consultant's behavior. The modifications introduce subjectivity and vagueness, allowing ADAMS GOLF to potentially terminate the contract based on loosely defined and easily manipulated interpretations, which could be seen as acting in bad faith. The duty of good faith requires honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. By making the termination clause so ambiguous, ADAMS GOLF could potentially use it to terminate the contract for reasons unrelated to the consultant's actual conduct, thus violating the duty of good faith.",

        "justification": "The Law Explanation argues the change contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Kansas law (K.S.A. \u00a7 84-1-304). The original contract had specific grounds for termination, while the modified version introduces subjective and vague terms, as detailed in the Perturbation Explanation ('general consideration,' 'reasonably believes,' etc.). Because the scraped snippets are empty, a direct contradiction to specific legal language cannot be established. However, the Law Explanation, combined with the significant weakening of obligations shown in the Perturbation Explanation, suggests a moderate contradiction of the duty of good faith by allowing ADAMS GOLF to potentially terminate for reasons unrelated to actual consultant conduct. Thus, a score of 0.6 reflects this level of contradiction based on the provided context, even without supporting legal snippets."

        "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, ADAMS GOLF shall provide CONSULTANT with sufficient quantities of such MANDATORY PRODUCTS for CONSULTANT'S use as CONSULTANT may reasonably need to fulfill his obligations under this agreement. ADAMS GOLF shall pay all charges in connection with the delivery of MANDATORY PRODUCTS to CONSULTANT.",
        "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, ADAMS GOLF will try to provide CONSULTANT with what it considers an adequate amount of MANDATORY PRODUCTS, considering CONSULTANT'S stated needs. ADAMS GOLF will address delivery charges in a manner it deems appropriate.",
        "explanation": "The original text clearly states that ADAMS GOLF 'shall provide sufficient quantities' and 'shall pay all charges.' The modified version uses weaker language such as 'will try to provide,' 'what it considers an adequate amount,' 'considering CONSULTANT'S stated needs' and 'will address delivery charges in a manner it deems appropriate.' This introduces ambiguity and allows ADAMS GOLF discretion in determining the quantity and payment of MANDATORY PRODUCTS. The phrase 'what it considers an adequate amount' is subjective and could lead to disputes over whether the consultant is receiving enough product to fulfill his obligations. 'Addressing delivery charges in a manner it deems appropriate' is very vague.",

        "law_explanation": "Under Kansas law, a material breach of contract occurs when a party fails to perform a substantial part of the agreement, or performs it in a way that defeats the purpose of the contract. By changing the language to allow ADAMS GOLF to subjectively determine the quantity of MANDATORY PRODUCTS, it creates a situation where the consultant may not be able to fulfill his endorsement obligations due to lack of product. This would likely constitute a material breach of contract. Also, by leaving the payment of delivery charges to ADAMS GOLF\u2019s discretion, it provides another avenue for non-compliance, giving them considerable leverage over a clearly defined obligation.",

        "justification": "The original contract language specified clear obligations for ADAMS GOLF regarding the provision of MANDATORY PRODUCTS and delivery charges. The perturbed text weakens these obligations by using subjective language like 'will try to provide,' 'what it considers an adequate amount,' and 'address delivery charges in a manner it deems appropriate.' While the law explanation suggests this could lead to a material breach under Kansas law if the consultant can't fulfill obligations, the lack of specific legal snippets weakens the directness of the contradiction. The perturbation explanation clearly indicates a shift towards ambiguity and discretion for ADAMS GOLF, which could potentially undermine the contract's purpose if interpreted in a way that deprives the CONSULTANT of necessary resources. Because there are no scraped law snippets to directly support a contradiction of law, and we are limited to analyzing based on provided inputs, the contradiction score reflects a moderate weakening of the original agreement, without a direct violation of a specific, cited law."

If CONSULTANT disapproves, the reasons therefore shall be given to ADAMS GOLF in writing within three (3) business days or shall be deemed approved. ADAMS GOLF agrees to protect, indemnify and hold CONSULTANT harmless from and against any and all expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs whatsoever, arising out of, or in any way connected with, any advertising material furnished by, or on behalf of, the company.",

The Consultant's comments will be taken into advisement but ADAMS GOLF is under no obligation to accommodate or comply with the feedback from the Consultant. ADAMS GOLF will endeavor to protect CONSULTANT to a reasonable extent from expenses clearly arising directly from advertising material originating solely from the company.",
        "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the consultant's control over the use of his image and likeness. Replacing 'shall submit the same to CONSULTANT... for approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed' with 'will generally attempt to show CONSULTANT... when practical. The Consultant's comments will be taken into advisement but ADAMS GOLF is under no obligation to accommodate or comply' removes the requirement for approval. Similarly, replacing 'ADAMS GOLF agrees to protect, indemnify and hold CONSULTANT harmless from and against any and all expenses, damages...' with 'ADAMS GOLF will endeavor to protect CONSULTANT to a reasonable extent from expenses clearly arising directly from advertising material originating solely from the company' limits the scope of indemnity by introducing subjective qualifications like 'to a reasonable extent' and 'clearly arising directly from'.",

        "law_explanation": "While Kansas doesn't have a specific right of publicity statute, it recognizes the right of publicity under common law. The right of publicity protects an individual's right to control the commercial use of their name, likeness, and other aspects of their identity. The modified text significantly weakens the consultant's control over their image and likeness. While Adams Golf will generally attempt to show the consultant advertising material using his likeness when practical, his comments are only taken into advisement. This creates a conflict with Kansas' common law right of publicity, by diminishing his ability to protect his own image from potentially damaging or unwanted commercial exploitation.",

        "justification": "The original contract afforded the consultant approval over advertising materials using his likeness, while the changed contract only requires Adams Golf to show the consultant such materials 'when practical' and to take his comments into advisement, without any obligation to comply. The Law Explanation states this conflicts with Kansas' common law right of publicity by diminishing his ability to protect his own image from potentially damaging or unwanted commercial exploitation. However, due to the absence of any concrete snippets from Kansas statutes or case law confirming the precise scope and application of the right of publicity, the contradiction score is moderate. While the Law Explanation claims a conflict exists, the lack of legal snippets reduces the certainty of a definitive legal contradiction."

        "explanation": "The original text specifies that the agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan. The modified text changes this to say that it is 'generally guided by principles similar to the laws of Japan.' This introduces ambiguity, as 'generally guided' is vague and does not ensure compliance with specific Japanese laws.",

        "law_explanation": "Article 3 of the Japanese Civil Code (Minp\u014d) stipulates that in cases where customs differ from laws and regulations, if the parties to a transaction have indicated their intention to be governed by those customs, such customs take precedence over the provisions of laws and regulations, provided that those customs are not contrary to public order. The changed text provides a vague statement of being 'generally guided by principles similar to the laws of Japan' opens the door for conflicting interpretations and potentially overrides the legal certainty provided by directly adhering to the Japanese Civil Code. This ambiguity weakens the legal obligation and could lead to disputes regarding which 'principles' are actually being followed.",

        "justification": "The original text mandates adherence to Japanese law, providing legal certainty. The changed text replaces this with a vague directive to be 'generally guided by principles similar to the laws of Japan.' This weakening of the obligation introduces ambiguity regarding the applicable legal standard. While neither scraped snippet directly addresses the specific article mentioned in the Law Explanation, the shift from 'governed by' to 'generally guided' creates a potential for diverging interpretations. Because the scraped snippets provide no direct conflict but the Law Explanation indicates a likely contradiction, and because the altered text removes explicit adherence to laws, the contradiction score is moderate."

        "explanation": "The original text states that the Nissin Parties 'agree to cause' VNBJ and VNBZ to comply with the indemnification provisions. The modified text changes this to 'will endeavor to encourage VNBJ and VNBZ to consider complying,' which weakens the obligation and makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. The phrase 'consider complying' introduces further ambiguity about the extent of their obligation.",

        "law_explanation": "Article 430 of the Japanese Companies Act (Kaisha-h\u014d) outlines the liabilities of directors and officers and the possibility of indemnification under certain conditions. By changing the obligation to a discretionary 'endeavor to encourage to consider complying,' the modified text weakens the assurance of indemnification, potentially exposing directors and officers to liabilities that the original clause intended to cover, and does not ensure that directors and officers' liabilities will be protected and indemnified, and, in fact, reduces the potential for such protection to happen.",

        "justification": "The original text imposes a stronger obligation on the Nissin Parties to ensure compliance with indemnification provisions. The changed text weakens this obligation to 'endeavor to encourage to consider complying,' making compliance discretionary. While the law snippets are not directly helpful (Snippet 1 is 'None' and Snippet 2 is a link to e-Gov), the Law Explanation suggests this weakening could potentially expose directors and officers to liabilities under Article 430 of the Japanese Companies Act, which outlines indemnification possibilities. The shift from a guaranteed outcome to a discretionary encouragement introduces ambiguity and reduces the assurance of indemnification, hence the contradiction score of 0.6."

        "explanation": "The original text clearly states that termination of the agreement does not release parties from liability for breaches prior to closing. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'might not release' instead of 'shall not release', creating uncertainty about whether liability will actually be enforced.

If a contract is canceled, each party is obligated to restore the other to their original condition. The phrase \u2018might not release\u2019 is ambiguous and undermines the definiteness expected under Article 545 by casting doubt on the parties\u2019 obligations to restore each other. Further adding the word 'more significant' creates doubt about what level of importance a breach has to reach to trigger legal action.",

        "contradiction_score": 0.6,
        "justification": "The original text states a clear obligation regarding liability, while the changed text weakens this obligation by introducing ambiguity and subjectivity. The phrase 'might not release' instead of 'shall not release' creates uncertainty. Furthermore, limiting liability to 'more significant' breaches introduces a subjective standard, making enforcement less predictable. The Law Explanation mentions Article 545 of the Japanese Civil Code (Minp\u014d), stating that contract cancellation obligates each party to restore the other to their original condition. The 'might not release' phrase, combined with the subjective 'more significant' criteria, introduces doubt regarding the parties' obligations, weakening the restorative effect expected under Article 545. While the scraped snippets themselves provide limited direct support, the Law Explanation highlights how the change introduces ambiguity that undermines the certainty expected in contract law related to restoration following cancellation, justifying a moderate contradiction score."

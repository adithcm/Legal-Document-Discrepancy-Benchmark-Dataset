        "justification": "The original contract language states the parties 'shall be responsible' for timely and accurate filings. The change weakens this obligation by using 'shall endeavor to be responsible' and 'to the best of their understanding', introducing ambiguity. The law explanation argues this contradicts the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically Rule 13d-1, which mandates accurate and timely filings. Scraped Law Snippet 1, 17 CFR \u00a7 240.13d-1(a), states that 'any person...is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the class shall, within five business days after the date of the acquisition, file with the Commission, a statement containing the information required by Schedule 13D'. The change to 'endeavor' weakens the obligation to file accurately and on time, moving it away from the strict filing requirements implied by the law. The addition of 'only if they have definitive proof that such information is inaccurate' introduces a higher evidentiary standard than 'knows or has reason to believe' in the original. This means parties can avoid responsibility for inaccuracies unless definitive proof exists, further weakening the original obligation. While the snippet itself doesn't explicitly state 'strict liability' or use the word 'endeavor', the change clearly undermines the prompt and absolute requirement to file accurate statements, thus creating a contradiction."

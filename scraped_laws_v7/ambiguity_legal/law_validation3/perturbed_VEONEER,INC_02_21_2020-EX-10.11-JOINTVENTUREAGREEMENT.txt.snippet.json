        "explanation": "The original text specifies that the agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan. The modified text changes this to say that it is 'generally guided by principles similar to the laws of Japan.' This introduces ambiguity, as 'generally guided' is vague and does not ensure compliance with specific Japanese laws.",

        "law_explanation": "Article 3 of the Japanese Civil Code (Minp\u014d) stipulates that in cases where customs differ from laws and regulations, if the parties to a transaction have indicated their intention to be governed by those customs, such customs take precedence over the provisions of laws and regulations, provided that those customs are not contrary to public order. The changed text provides a vague statement of being 'generally guided by principles similar to the laws of Japan' opens the door for conflicting interpretations and potentially overrides the legal certainty provided by directly adhering to the Japanese Civil Code. This ambiguity weakens the legal obligation and could lead to disputes regarding which 'principles' are actually being followed.",

        "justification": "The change from 'governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan' to 'generally guided by principles similar to the laws of Japan' significantly weakens the legal obligation. The original text establishes a clear legal standard, while the modified text introduces ambiguity, making compliance uncertain and potentially unenforceable. While the scraped snippets do not explicitly outline the requirement, the Perturbation Explanation and Law Explanation highlight the risk of conflicting interpretations and diminished legal certainty due to the vague nature of 'generally guided.' This introduces a significant risk of non-compliance, thus creating a High contradiction."

The modified text changes this to 'will endeavor to encourage VNBJ and VNBZ to consider complying,' which weakens the obligation and makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory.

        "law_explanation": "Article 430 of the Japanese Companies Act (Kaisha-h\u014d) outlines the liabilities of directors and officers and the possibility of indemnification under certain conditions. By changing the obligation to a discretionary 'endeavor to encourage to consider complying,' the modified text weakens the assurance of indemnification, potentially exposing directors and officers to liabilities that the original clause intended to cover, and does not ensure that directors and officers' liabilities will be protected and indemnified, and, in fact, reduces the potential for such protection to happen.",

        "justification": "The original text mandates that the Nissin Parties \"agree to cause\" VNBJ and VNBZ to comply with indemnification obligations. The changed text significantly weakens this by stating the Nissin Parties \"will endeavor to encourage VNBJ and VNBZ to consider complying.\" The phrase 'consider complying' introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation discretionary rather than mandatory. Although the scraped snippets are not directly relevant to the specific law, the Law Explanation identifies Article 430 of the Japanese Companies Act, which concerns director and officer liabilities and indemnification. The change undermines the assurance of indemnification, potentially exposing directors and officers to liabilities. The shift from a firm obligation to a discretionary consideration creates a high contradiction because it significantly reduces the protection originally intended, making compliance uncertain and unenforceable."

        "explanation": "The original text clearly states that termination of the agreement does not release parties from liability for breaches prior to closing. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'might not release' instead of 'shall not release', creating uncertainty about whether liability will actually be enforced.

If a contract is canceled, each party is obligated to restore the other to their original condition. The phrase \u2018might not release\u2019 is ambiguous and undermines the definiteness expected under Article 545 by casting doubt on the parties\u2019 obligations to restore each other. Further adding the word 'more significant' creates doubt about what level of importance a breach has to reach to trigger legal action.",

        "justification": "The modified text introduces significant ambiguity, directly contradicting the essence of legal contracts, which require clarity and enforceability. The original text used 'shall not release,' creating a clear obligation. The changed text uses 'might not release,' replacing a mandatory term with a discretionary one. This introduces uncertainty about whether liability will be enforced. Furthermore, adding 'more significant' before breaches creates a subjective standard, as it's unclear what constitutes a 'more significant' breach.

The Law Explanation says that this weakening can make it more difficult to enforce non-disclosure agreements, potentially conflicting with the DTSA's goal of protecting trade secrets. The provided snippet from the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 indicates the act's existence and relates to trade secret misappropriation, but doesn't directly address the level of obligation required in contracts regarding confidential information. While the change introduces ambiguity and reduces the enforceability of the non-disclosure agreement, it doesn't explicitly violate the DTSA, as the contract could be interpreted as still intending to provide some level of protection. The snippet doesn't provide specific language requiring 'shall' or prohibiting 'should endeavor'. Thus, while weakening the obligation, it doesn't create a high level of contradiction."

        "justification": "The modified contract introduces ambiguities and weakens restrictions on competitive activities, potentially conflicting with California Business and Professions Code Section 16600, which generally invalidates non-compete agreements. The original text used definitive language like 'shall not' and 'any other interest,' whereas the revised text uses more permissive and vague terms such as 'shall generally not' and 'significant interest,' and replaces 'substantially similar' with 'reasonably similar.' This shift allows for a broader interpretation of permissible activities, potentially circumventing the intent of Section 16600, which, according to Scraped Law Snippet 1, states that 'every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.' The change from 'otherwise approved' to 'may be approved' also weakens the requirement, introducing further ambiguity regarding the approval process. These changes collectively weaken the non-compete clause, making it more susceptible to legal challenge and potentially unenforceable under California law."

Judgment; Costs (a) Definition; Form. \u201cJudgment\u201d as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies. A judgment should not include recitals of pleadings, a master's report, or a record of prior proceedings. (b) Judgment on Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple Parties. When an action presents more than one claim for relief\u2014whether as a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim\u2014or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay. Otherwise, any order or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties\u2019 rights and liabilities. (c) Demand for Judgment; Relief to Be Granted. A default judgment must not differ in kind from, or exceed in amount, what is demanded in the pleadings. Every other final judgment should grant the relief to which each party is entitled, even if the party has not demanded that relief in its pleadings. (d) Costs; Attorney's Fees. (1) Costs Other Than Attorney's Fees. Unless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs\u2014other than attorney's fees\u2014should be allowed to the prevailing party. But costs against the United States, its officers, and its agencies may be imposed only to the extent allowed by law. The clerk may tax costs on 14 days\u2019 notice.

        "justification": "The changed text significantly undermines the original intent regarding the allocation of costs and fees in case of a breach, creating a high contradiction with the spirit of FRCP 54(d)(1). The original text clearly states the Member agrees to pay all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees. The revised text introduces ambiguity by stating the Member agrees to 'potentially contribute to court costs and possibly reasonable attorney's fees'.\n\nFRCP 54(d)(1) states that 'costs\u2014other than attorney's fees\u2014should be allowed to the prevailing party. Unless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order provides otherwise'. By changing 'all' to 'potentially contribute' and 'reasonable' to 'possibly reasonable', the modified contract introduces uncertainty and weakens the franchisor's ability to recover costs. This contradicts the principle that the prevailing party should generally be awarded costs, as stated in the scraped snippet. Furthermore, the added ambiguities weaken the enforceability of the agreement and introduce subjectivity, potentially conflicting with the goal of a 'just, speedy, and inexpensive determination' as highlighted in Scraped Law Snippet 2 regarding the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."

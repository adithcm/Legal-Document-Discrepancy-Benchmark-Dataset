        "explanation": "The original text specifies that the agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan. The modified text changes this to say that it is 'generally guided by principles similar to the laws of Japan.' This introduces ambiguity, as 'generally guided' is vague and does not ensure compliance with specific Japanese laws.",

        "law_explanation": "Article 3 of the Japanese Civil Code (Minp\u014d) stipulates that in cases where customs differ from laws and regulations, if the parties to a transaction have indicated their intention to be governed by those customs, such customs take precedence over the provisions of laws and regulations, provided that those customs are not contrary to public order. The changed text provides a vague statement of being 'generally guided by principles similar to the laws of Japan' opens the door for conflicting interpretations and potentially overrides the legal certainty provided by directly adhering to the Japanese Civil Code. This ambiguity weakens the legal obligation and could lead to disputes regarding which 'principles' are actually being followed.",

        "justification": "The original text mandates governance and construction in accordance with Japanese law, providing a clear legal standard. The changed text, however, states that the amendment is 'generally guided by principles similar to the laws of Japan,' which introduces ambiguity. The Law Explanation suggests this vagueness could lead to conflicting interpretations and weaken the legal obligation. The perturbation explanation highlights that 'generally guided' is vague and does not ensure compliance with specific Japanese laws. Although the provided scraped law snippets are unhelpful in solidifying the contradiction as there is no provided content, the combination of the Law Explanation and Perturbation Explanation support a MEDIUM contradiction, as the altered text weakens the original obligation but does not explicitly violate a law because it still suggests the laws of Japan will be used as guidance. It introduces an area for dispute, but it does not directly contradict the law."

The modified text changes this to 'will endeavor to encourage VNBJ and VNBZ to consider complying,' which weakens the obligation and makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory.

        "law_explanation": "Article 430 of the Japanese Companies Act (Kaisha-h\u014d) outlines the liabilities of directors and officers and the possibility of indemnification under certain conditions. By changing the obligation to a discretionary 'endeavor to encourage to consider complying,' the modified text weakens the assurance of indemnification, potentially exposing directors and officers to liabilities that the original clause intended to cover, and does not ensure that directors and officers' liabilities will be protected and indemnified, and, in fact, reduces the potential for such protection to happen.",

The Perturbation Explanation highlights that this change makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory, introducing ambiguity. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 is empty and Scraped Law Snippet 2 is a link to a search engine, the Law Explanation suggests that this change potentially undermines the indemnification assurance for directors and officers under Japanese Companies Act Article 430. The change introduces ambiguity regarding the level of assurance and action required by the Nissin Parties which creates a medium contradiction."

        "explanation": "The original text clearly states that termination of the agreement does not release parties from liability for breaches prior to closing. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'might not release' instead of 'shall not release', creating uncertainty about whether liability will actually be enforced.

If a contract is canceled, each party is obligated to restore the other to their original condition. The phrase \u2018might not release\u2019 is ambiguous and undermines the definiteness expected under Article 545 by casting doubt on the parties\u2019 obligations to restore each other. Further adding the word 'more significant' creates doubt about what level of importance a breach has to reach to trigger legal action.",

        "justification": "The original contract language mandates no release from liability for breaches before closing, while the changed text introduces ambiguity using 'might not release' and limits the scope to 'more significant' breaches. The LLM-generated Law Explanation cites Article 545 of the Japanese Civil Code (Minp\u014d), stating that upon contract cancellation, each party is obligated to restore the other to their original condition. The ambiguity in the changed text undermines this obligation, creating uncertainty about whether parties must restore each other, particularly concerning what constitutes a 'more significant' breach. While there are no explicit law snippets provided to confirm the obligations regarding liability after termination, the LLM explanation in combination with the change creates a potential undermining of required obligations, indicating a medium level contradiction."

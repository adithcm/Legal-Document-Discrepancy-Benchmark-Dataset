        "justification": "The changed text weakens the obligations of the Company. Replacing \"shall\" with \"endeavor to\" and \"will attempt to\" creates ambiguity and reduces the company's commitment. The Law Explanation suggests this might violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 does not directly address good faith and fair dealing, it provides context that Illinois law governs business transactions. The modification's move towards discretionary performance introduces potential for the company to act without genuine effort, undermining the distributor's reasonable expectations. Given that the law snippet doesn't directly address the good faith requirement, but rather provides context for Illinois business law, the contradiction is indirect, thus a MEDIUM score is appropriate."

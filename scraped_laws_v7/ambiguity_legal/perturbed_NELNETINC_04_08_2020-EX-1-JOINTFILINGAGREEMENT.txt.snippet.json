        "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other, except to the extent that she or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
        "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall endeavor to be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and to the best of their understanding, ensure the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other, only if they have definitive proof that such information is inaccurate.",
        "explanation": "The change replaces 'shall be responsible' with 'shall endeavor to be responsible' and adds 'to the best of their understanding' and 'only if they have definitive proof that such information is inaccurate.' This introduces ambiguity and weakens the legal obligation for accurate and timely filings.",

        "law_explanation": "The modification contradicts the strict requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically Rule 13d-1, which mandates accurate and timely filings. By introducing 'endeavor to be responsible' and 'to the best of their understanding,' the agreement allows for potential negligence or inaccuracies, undermining the intent of the law to ensure transparency and accountability in ownership reporting. Additionally, definitive proof introduces higher evidentiary standards when the legal standard is ‘knows or has reason to believe’.",

        "justification": "The changed contract text, by limiting the definition of 'Field' to exclude future approved indications, introduces a potential conflict with FDA regulations regarding the promotion of drugs. The Law Explanation suggests that promoting the product outside the defined 'Field' may violate labeling regulations. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 is empty, Scraped Law Snippet 2, 21 USC 351, addresses 'Adulterated drugs and devices.' Although it mainly focuses on issues like 'filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance' and 'insanitary conditions,' the overarching implication is that drugs must adhere to certain standards and regulations. By potentially restricting promotion to only currently approved indications, the changed text could lead to scenarios where the product is promoted in a way that deviates from its approved uses, which, while not directly causing adulteration as defined in the snippet, introduces a risk of misbranding or off-label promotion, thus conflicting with the general intent of drug regulation. The score reflects a moderate contradiction, as the snippet does not directly prohibit the change, but its spirit and the Law Explanation highlight a potential conflict."

        "justification": "The changed contract text restricts the definition of \"Target Professionals\" to only physicians, potentially excluding nurse practitioners and physician assistants who may have prescribing authority. The Law Explanation suggests this could be an attempt to subvert payments by excluding eligible medical professionals. However, the provided law snippets (42 CFR \u00a7 455.410) focus on enrollment and screening of providers for Medicaid, stating that the state Medicaid agency must require the enrollment of ordering or referring physicians or other professionals. While this regulation mentions 'other professionals', it is in the context of Medicaid enrollment, and the snippets do not explicitly state that all professionals with prescribing authority *must* be included in all contracts. Therefore, while the change limits the scope of 'Target Professionals' and could have implications, it doesn't directly contradict the provided law snippets. The contradiction score is therefore moderate."

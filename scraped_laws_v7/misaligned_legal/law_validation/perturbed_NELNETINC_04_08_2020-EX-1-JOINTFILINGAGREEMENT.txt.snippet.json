Amendments to Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements Overview The Securities and Exchange Commission is today adopting amendments to its rules relating to the reporting of beneficial ownership in publicly held companies. These amendments make the short- form Schedule 13G available, in lieu of Schedule 13D, to all investors beneficially owning less than 20 percent of the outstanding class that have not acquired and do not hold the securities for the purpose of or with the effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer of the securities. The purposes of the amendments are to improve the effectiveness of the beneficial ownership reporting scheme and to reduce the reporting obligations of passive investors.

        "justification": "The original contract text explicitly states that filings will be done in accordance with Rule 13d-1(k), implying mandatory compliance. The changed text, however, indicates that filing is at the sole discretion of the filing party. This creates a strong contradiction because 17 CFR \u00a7 240.13d-1, as shown in Scraped Law Snippet 1, states that any person acquiring beneficial ownership of more than five percent of a class of equity security 'shall' file with the Commission. The use of 'shall' denotes a mandatory requirement, which is directly undermined by the modified text's discretionary clause. Snippet 2 reinforces this by discussing amendments to beneficial ownership reporting *requirements*, confirming that the filings are not optional. The perturbation explanation and law explanation accurately describe this contradiction."

The changed text, by stating that filing is at the discretion of the filer and absolving them of accuracy concerns, directly undermines the legal requirement for 'proper protection of investors and to insure fair dealing in the security.' The original text established this responsibility. The modification's explicit removal of this duty creates a substantial conflict, warranting a high contradiction score."

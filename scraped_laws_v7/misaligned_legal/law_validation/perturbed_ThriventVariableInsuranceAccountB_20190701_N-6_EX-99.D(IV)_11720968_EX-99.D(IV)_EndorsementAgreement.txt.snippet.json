It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
        "changed_text": "If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra contribution. The Executive Committee will determine the amount of any extra contribution. It will be based on a subjective evaluation of what is deemed fair. You may only make the extra contribution by a reduction in benefits. If you do not make the extra contribution within 30 days from the date we notify you, the amount will be considered a donation.",
        "explanation": "The terms \"extra payment\" is replaced with \"extra contribution,\" and \"Board of Directors\" is replaced with \"Executive Committee.\" The method for determining the amount changes from \"each member's fair share of the deficiency\" to \"subjective evaluation of what is deemed fair.\" Acceptable payment methods are restricted, and failure to pay results in a \"donation\" rather than \"indebtedness.\" This creates ambiguity about the member's obligations and the society's recourse.",

The statute mandates a fair and equitable assessment based on deficiency, whereas the modified text allows for a subjective evaluation. By modifying the terms for repayment, there is no guarantee that the insurance company will receive the correct amount due to the changes in timelines and what happens if payments aren't made, therefore, violating code 611.03(1)(a).",

        "justification": "The modified contract introduces a potential contradiction by replacing 'fair share of the deficiency' with a 'subjective evaluation of what is deemed fair.' The LLM explanation highlights a potential violation of Wisconsin Statutes regarding fair and equitable assessments based on deficiency, particularly citing code 611.03(1)(a), although the specific text of 611.03(1)(a) is not provided in the scraped snippets. The shift to 'donation' instead of 'indebtedness' and the reduction in payment timeframe also weakens the original obligation. Because no scraped snippet is provided, the contradiction strength cannot be directly confirmed, hence the rating is not a 1.0. But the LLM explanation suggests a contradiction, thus raising the rating above 0.5."

However, Scraped Law Snippet 1 doesn't explicitly define the rights of members in a way that directly contradicts the 'may be considered' language in the Changed Text. The snippet mainly deals with definitions related to directors and officers of a medical society. Therefore, the contradiction is present but not definitively proven based on the limited context from the snippet, hence a score of 0.4."

        "law_explanation": "This is a violation of the law because it makes the process of figuring distributions of divisible surplus not by statute.

        "justification": "The original contract specifies dividends are linked to divisible surplus. The changed text replaces 'dividends' with 'distributions' and makes them discretionary and unrelated to the divisible surplus. The Law Explanation suggests this violates Wisconsin Statute 611.13, requiring dividends to be distributed according to the law. However, without access to the specific text of the law via the scraped snippets, the contradiction is not definitive. We cannot ascertain if the changed term 'distributions' is legally equivalent to 'dividends' or whether distributions can legally be considered separate from divisible surplus. Therefore, a moderate contradiction score is assigned because the LLM asserts the contract is violating the law, but there's no direct confirmation from the provided legal snippets."

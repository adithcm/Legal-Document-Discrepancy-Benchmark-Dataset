(c) A business described by Subsection (b)(1) is entitled to declaratory relief on the issue of whether the requirement of another state that the business collect and remit sales or use taxes to that state constitutes an undue burden on interstate commerce under Section 8, Article I, United States Constitution.

        "justification": "The changed text replaces 'laws of the State of Texas' with 'principles of equity', which weakens the adherence to statutory law. The Law Explanation states that Texas law requires courts to first look to applicable statutes, and using 'principles of equity' bypasses those statutes. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 doesn't directly address contract interpretation, it emphasizes the importance of statutory law within the Texas legal system by detailing the jurisdiction of district courts and declaratory judgments under specific Texas statutes. This suggests a legal framework primarily based on statutes, making the shift to 'principles of equity' a contradiction. Scraped Law Snippet 2 is empty, so it cannot be used."

The change from 'negligence or intentional misconduct' to 'actions' significantly broadens the scope of indemnification. The Law Explanation suggests this could render the provision vague and unenforceable, particularly concerning the indemnitee's own negligence, which Texas law regulates through fair notice requirements.

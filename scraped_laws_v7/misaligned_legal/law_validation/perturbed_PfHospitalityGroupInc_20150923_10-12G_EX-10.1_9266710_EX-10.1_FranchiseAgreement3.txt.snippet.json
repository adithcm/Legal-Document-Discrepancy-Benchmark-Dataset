        "justification": "The modified text allows the franchisee to operate under conditions they deem fit, directly contradicting the standard franchise agreement requirements as enforced by the FTC Franchise Rule. Scraped Law Snippet 2 states, 'The Franchise Rule gives prospective purchasers of franchises the material information they need in order to weigh the risks and benefits of such an investment. The Rule requires franchisors to provide all potential franchisees with a disclosure document containing 23 specific items of information about the offered franchise, its officers, and other franchisees.' The changed text undermines this requirement, allowing franchisees to deviate from the disclosed terms. Because it directly allows the agreement to be ignored, which the Franchise Rule prevents, the contradiction score is high."

        "justification": "The changed text, by limiting protected information to 'information they can remember,' significantly weakens the protection afforded to trade secrets, potentially contradicting the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA). The original text protects 'confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how,' which aligns with the intent of the UTSA to protect proprietary information. The changed text introduces a subjective element of memory, making enforcement more difficult as the trade secret holder would need to prove the former member remembers the information. Scraped Law Snippet 1 cites California's adoption of the UTSA in CIV 3426, indicating the state's intention to provide strong trade secret protection. Although Scraped Law Snippet 2 is about the Uniform Law Commission itself, it supports the idea that laws are created to be clear and stable. By introducing ambiguity, it undermines the purpose of the UTSA. Thus, the modified contract introduces ambiguity in trade secret protection and therefore creates a strong contradiction."

Arthur Andersen LLP (2008) 44 Cal.4th 937, to void the application of any noncompete agreement in an employment context, or any noncompete clause in an employment contract, no matter how narrowly tailored, that does not satisfy an exception in this chapter.

        "justification": "The modified contract text creates a strong contradiction with established legal principles, particularly concerning non-compete agreements. Scraped Law Snippet 1, specifically BPC 16600(a), states that \"every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.\" The change from 'in writing' to 'by a handshake' directly impacts the enforceability of the non-compete clause. Oral agreements, as suggested by 'by a handshake', are generally not enforceable for non-compete agreements due to Statute of Frauds concerns. Furthermore, while BPC 16600 provides exceptions, these are not relevant given the handshake agreement, emphasizing the voiding of such restraint. The increase in radius from 3 to 5 miles also adds to the unreasonableness, potentially further violating the spirit of free trade and competition that BPC 16600 intends to protect. Because a handshake is insufficient for non-compete agreements, and the increased radius exacerbates the issue of restraint of trade, the contradiction is strong."

        "justification": "The changed text grants Integrity 'the authority to act for or represent the Fund in all matters,' which significantly expands their control and authority. The Perturbation Explanation highlights that this contradicts the nature of an 'independent contractor.' The Law Explanation suggests this could lead to misclassification under IRS guidelines. While the provided law snippets (26 U.S. Code \u00a7 3121) focus on the definition of 'wages' and 'employment,' they implicitly address the employer-employee relationship. By granting Integrity such broad authority, the changed text blurs the lines between an independent contractor and an employee, suggesting a potentially stronger employer-employee relationship. Although the snippets don't directly define an independent contractor, the broad authority granted by the modified text raises concerns about proper classification for tax purposes, as alluded to in the Law Explanation. This warrants a high contradiction score, as the modification alters the fundamental nature of the relationship."

        "justification": "The changed text allows Integrity to offer non-uniform commissions, while the original text states that these commissions should be uniform to all dealers unless otherwise determined. The Law Explanation refers to FINRA Rule 2341(l)(3)(A), which prohibits offering discounts or concessions to some dealers that aren't available to all under similar terms. Scraped Law Snippet 1 contains the text '2341. Investment Company Securities' and defines 'Cash compensation' as 'any discount, concession, fee, service fee, commission...'. While Snippet 1 doesn't explicitly state the prohibition in (l)(3)(A), the Law Explanation correctly links the allowance of non-uniform commissions to a potential violation of that rule. This creates a strong contradiction, as the changed text directly permits what the rule seems to prohibit, making the contradiction score 0.8."

        "justification": "The changed text designates the laws of the Principality of Sealand as governing the contract. The Perturbation Explanation notes that Sealand is not a recognized sovereign state, implying its laws lack legal standing in US courts. The Law Explanation strengthens this by mentioning the Full Faith and Credit Clause, which mandates states to respect the laws of other states, but does not extend to unrecognized entities like Sealand. Scraped Law Snippet 2 contains the text of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution, which includes the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Although the snippet doesn't explicitly exclude unrecognized entities, the Law Explanation accurately states the implied limitation, meaning the contract would be unenforceable. Therefore, selecting Sealand's laws creates a significant conflict, as those laws have no standing, and the contract becomes practically unenforceable, justifying a high contradiction score."

A Web site may exist on a single computer system with other Web sites.",

        "explanation": "The modified definition of \"Web site\" restricts its functionality to only static HTML pages, conflicting with the common and legal understanding that a website can include dynamic content, applications, and interactive elements. By stating that a website 'may not exist on a single computer system with other Web sites' introduces a contradiction. Web hosting typically involves multiple sites on one server.",

(2) A person commits an offense against users of computers, computer systems, computer networks, or electronic devices if he or she willfully, knowingly, and without authorization or exceeding authorization: (a) Accesses or causes to be accessed any computer, computer system, computer network, or electronic device with knowledge that such access is unauthorized or the manner of use exceeds authorization; (b) Disrupts or denies or causes the denial of the ability to transmit data to or from an authorized user of a computer, computer system, computer network, or electronic device, which, in whole or in part, is owned by, under contract to, or operated for, on behalf of, or in conjunction with another; (c) Destroys, takes, injures, or damages equipment or supplies used or intended to be used in a computer, computer system, computer network, or electronic device; (d) Destroys, injures, or damages any computer, computer system, computer network, or electronic device; (e) Introduces any computer contaminant into any computer, computer system, computer network, or electronic device; or (f) Engages in audio or video surveillance of an individual by accessing any inherent feature or component of a computer, computer system, computer network, or electronic device, including accessing the data or information of a computer, computer system, computer network, or electronic device that is stored by a third party.

        "justification": "The changed contract text's narrow definition of \"Web site\" as a \"static collection of HTML pages\" and its prohibition of co-existence on a single server creates a potential contradiction with Florida Statutes \u00a7 815.06. While the statute itself does not explicitly define 'website', it addresses offenses against 'computer systems' and 'computer networks'. The changed text's limitation of a website's capabilities and hosting arrangements could impact the statute's application, potentially creating a contradiction in interpreting computer-related crimes or security breaches involving websites, as the definition provided in the contract is much more restrictive than what is usually encompassed by the term 'computer system'. The limitation on co-existence on a single server also contradicts the common understanding of how websites are typically hosted. The degree of contradiction isn't complete (1.0) because the statute doesn't directly define 'website', so this creates an interpretive issue."

The Law Explanation argues this potentially violates the implied warranty of merchantability under the UCC, suggesting the service might be unfit for its intended purpose. Although there are no Scraped Law Snippets provided to confirm the UCC's specifics on implied warranty of merchantability, the drastic shift from continuous operation to operation only during business hours with no uptime commitment suggests a weakening of the service's fitness, thus creating a noticeable contradiction. The absence of law snippets weakens the claim, thus the moderate score."

        "justification": "The changed text directly contradicts the legal principle that website owners are primarily responsible for the content they host, even if illegal. The changed text states \"The Customer assumes no responsibility for illegal content hosted on the site, even if placed there by the Customer.\" This directly contrasts with 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2252, which establishes liability for activities related to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors, implying that website owners can be held accountable for such content. While the snippet focuses on child exploitation, the broader principle is that individuals are responsible for illegal content they facilitate. The original text placed the burden on the customer, while the modified text shifts it entirely to the hosting provider, creating a strong contradiction of established liability principles, leading to a high contradiction score."

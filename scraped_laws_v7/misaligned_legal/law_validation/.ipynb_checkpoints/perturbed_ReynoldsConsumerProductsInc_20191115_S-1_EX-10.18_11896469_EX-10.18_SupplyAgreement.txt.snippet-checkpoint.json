        "explanation": "Changing \"compliance\" to \"substantial compliance\" introduces ambiguity and legal risk. \"Substantial compliance\" is less stringent, potentially allowing a party to operate while not fully adhering to all laws.

While the provided law snippets are empty, the Law Explanation argues that this shift impairs the initial commitment to follow 'Applicable Laws', potentially conflicting with the Contract Clause's prohibition of states impairing contract obligations. The Perturbation Explanation reinforces this by highlighting the ambiguity introduced by \"substantial compliance.\" Without specific law snippets to confirm a direct contradiction, the weakening of the obligation is the basis for the score."

        "justification": "The changed text replaces the legally mandated 'minimal amount required by Applicable Law' for workers' compensation with 'an amount deemed reasonable by the Party.' This contradicts the fundamental principle that workers' compensation benefits are determined by law, not by the employer's discretion. While the provided law snippets focus on OSHA record-keeping requirements (29 CFR Part 1904), they indirectly reinforce the overarching regulatory framework of workplace safety and compensation, which implicitly supports legally defined benefit levels. The perturbation explanation and the law explanation both directly state that this change circumvents legal requirements and could lead to insufficient coverage, solidifying the contradiction. The original text aligns with legal requirements, while the altered version allows the party to sidestep those mandates, creating a high degree of contradiction."

        "justification": "The changed contract text introduces potentially usurious interest rates and arbitrary expense reimbursement terms. While Scraped Law Snippet 1 pertains to employment discrimination in war defense contracts and is irrelevant to the contract modification, the Perturbation Explanation and Law Explanation strongly suggest a violation of usury laws, which are intended to protect borrowers from excessive interest rates. The increase to a 10% *daily* late fee, as well as the removal of the 'reasonable' qualifier from the expenses, clearly increases the risk of violating laws regarding debt collection and usury. The absence of a specific snippet addressing usury directly affects the confidence, but the potential for such a violation warrants a high contradiction score."

The basic elements required for the agreement to be a legally enforceable contract are: mutual assent , expressed by a valid offer and acceptance ; adequate consideration ; capacity ; and legality . In some states , elements of consideration can be satisfied by a valid substitute. Possible remedies for breach of contract include general damages , consequential damages , reliance damages , and specific performance . Background : Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. Contract law is generally governed by state common law , and while general overall contract law is common throughout the country, some specific court interpretations of a particular element of the contract may vary between the states. If a promise is breached, the law provides remedies to the harmed party, often in the form of monetary damages, or in limited circumstances, in the form of specific performance of the promise made. Elements -- Consideration and Mutual Assent Contracts arise when a duty comes into existence, because of a promise made by one of the parties. To be legally binding as a contract, a promise must be exchanged for adequate consideration. There are two different theories or definitions of consideration: Bargain Theory of Consideration and Benefit-Detriment theory of consideration. Benefit-Detriment Under the b enefit-detriment theory, an adequate consideration exists only when a promise made to the benefit of the promisor or to the detriment of the promisee, which reasonably and fairly induces the promisor to make a promise for something else for the promisee. For example, promises that are purely gifts are not considered enforceable because the personal satisfaction the grantor of the promise may receive from the act of generosity is normally not considered sufficient detriment to constitute adequate consideration. Bargain-for-Exchange Under Bargain-for-Exchange theory of consideration, adequate consideration exists when a promisor makes a promise in return for something else. Here, the essential condition is that the promisor was given something specifically to induce the promise being made. In other words, the bargain for exchange theory is different from the detriment-benefit theory in that the focus in bargain for exchange theory seems to be the parties\u2019 motive for making the promises and the parties\u2019 subjective mutual assent, while in detriment benefit theory, the focus seems to be an objective legal detriment or benefit to the parties. Governing Laws Contracts are mainly governed by state statutory and common (judge-made) law and private law (i.e. the private agreement). Private law principally includes the terms of the agreement between the parties who are exchanging promises. This private law may override many of the rules otherwise established by state law. Statutory law, such as the Statute of Fraud , may require some kinds of contracts be put in writing and executed with particular formalities, for the contract to be enforceable. Otherwise, the parties may enter into a binding agreement without signing a formal written document. For example, Virginia Supreme Court has held in Lucy v. Zehmer that even an agreement made on a piece of napkin can be considered a valid contract, if the parties were both sane, and showed mutual assent and consideration. Most of the principles of the common law of contracts are outlined in the Restatement of Law, Second Contracts published by the American Law Institute. The Uniform Commercial Code , whose original articles have been adopted in nearly every state, represents a body of statutory law that governs important categories of contracts. The main articles that deal with the law of contracts are Article 1 (General Provisions) and Article 2 (Sales) . Sections of Article 9 (",
        "scraped_snippet_2": "Contract Law & Business Transactions | Small Business Law Center | Justia Contract Law & Business Transactions For all business owners, transactions are a regular and fundamental part of business activity. Commercial transactions typically encompass the selling and purchasing of goods or services. While such transactions can sometimes be informal, most of them are formalized through the creation of contracts. What Is a Contract? Contracts are the central documents that govern business transactions. Technically, contracts are legally valid and enforceable agreements between two or more parties that create obligations that are binding on all parties involved. Parties can include any types of entities that are capable of participating in business transactions, including government agencies, individuals, corporations, and other private entities. What Does It Take for a Contract to Be Enforceable? Not every agreement to engage in a commercial transaction will be legally enforceable in a court of law if conflicts arise down the road. Instead, contracts must have certain elements in order to be enforced. These are largely legal requirements that have developed over the years. First, and foremost, contracts require consideration. This element means that each party agrees to provide something of value to the other. This can be an affirmative offering of something, or an agreement not to do something. Thus, for instance, consideration can involve agreeing not to compete with another business. Second, contracts require a clear offer and acceptance. Contracts are not necessarily created just because one party offers something to another. Typically, a clear acceptance is required. In offering and accepting a contract, the parties must also have a \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d as to what the contract entails. Both parties cannot believe that they are agreeing to entirely different contracts. 1 Valid offer and acceptance 2 Mutual assent 3 Adequate consideration 4 Capacity to contract 5 Legal purpose Additionally, in order for a contract to be enforceable, both parties must have the capacity to contract, meaning that they must mentally understand what they are agreeing to. Individuals who are incapacitated are often deemed unable to engage in contractual agreements, and those who are insane or are minors are presumed to lack such capacity. Lastly, contracts can only be enforceable if they have a legal purpose. This means that a contract agreeing to engage in illegal activity is not enforceable in a court of law. While these requirements for enforceability encompass important concepts that all contracts must include, there are also practical requirements in contract creation. In many states, certain contracts must be in writing, such as contracts for real estate or those will last more than a year. Even if a contract is not required to be in writing, it is often important to do so because oral contracts can be difficult, if not impossible, to prove in court. Laws Governing Contract Creation When business owners are developing business contracts, there are two primary sources of law that they can turn to in order to make certain that contracts are enforceable and transactions are valid. Contracts addressing the sale of goods are governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, which is a set of explicit rules governing commercial sales transactions. Contracts governing all other types of transactions, including real estate transactions and employment agreements, are governed by what is known as the \u201ccommon law.\u201d These sets of rules vary according to the state in which a business operates, and they are created largely through the decisions of courts and judges. If you are concerned about the laws applicable to a contract you are working on, it is often helpful to consult with a corporate attorney.

        "justification": "The changed text introduces several modifications to the license terms, including making it 'exclusive, time-limited, and revocable,' a significant shift from the original 'non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable' license. The Perturbation and Law Explanations highlight that such a significant change requires new consideration. Scraped Law Snippet 1 states, 'To be legally binding as a contract, a promise must be exchanged for adequate consideration,' and further explains the 'Bargain-for-Exchange' theory, requiring the promisor to be 'given something specifically to induce the promise being made.' The modification fundamentally alters the agreement's nature, which may render it unenforceable without additional consideration. Scraped Law Snippet 2 also emphasizes 'contracts require consideration. This element means that each party agrees to provide something of value to the other.' Since the provided text doesn't mention additional consideration for the revised terms, the change creates a strong legal contradiction because it alters fundamental aspects of the contract without addressing the requirement for new consideration."

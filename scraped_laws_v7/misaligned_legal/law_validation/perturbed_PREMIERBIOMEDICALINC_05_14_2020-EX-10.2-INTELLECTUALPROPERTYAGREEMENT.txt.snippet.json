        "justification": "The changed contract text introduces ambiguity by stating intellectual property rights 'may' revert to Marv, contingent upon Marv's discretion. This weakens the original text's clear statement that rights 'shall' revert. According to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 261, as shown in both scraped snippets, 'patents shall have the attributes of personal property' and 'applications for patent, patents, or any interest therein, shall be assignable in law by an instrument in writing.' The change, making reversion discretionary, undermines the clear assignment and attributes of personal property by creating uncertainty and potentially requiring further discretionary action for the transfer to occur. The use of 'may' introduces a conditionality that conflicts with the intended certainty of property rights assignment. Therefore, the changed text creates a notable, but not absolute, contradiction as the rights still 'may' revert."

        "justification": "The modified contract text introduces limiting terms like 'a few', 'some', 'certain', 'limited', and 'possible' before categories of confidential information. This narrowing of scope, as pointed out in the Perturbation Explanation, directly contradicts the intent to protect a broad range of information, including trade secrets. The Law Explanation states that the UTSA defines a trade secret broadly, deriving independent economic value from not being generally known. Although the law snippets are missing, the Law Explanation coupled with the modification weakens the protection that would otherwise be afforded to trade secrets, making enforcement more difficult. The use of quantifying adjectives creates ambiguity around what constitutes confidential information, potentially excluding information that would have been protected under a broader definition, thus contradicting the UTSA's broad definition as described in the Law Explanation. This justifies a contradiction score of 0.7, reflecting a significant weakening of the original clause's protective intent, even without specific snippet support."

        "justification": "The modified text replaces a defined rate for late payments with a discretionary charge determined by the institution and based on market rates. The LLM's law explanation states that Pennsylvania's Usury Law (41 P.S. \u00a7 201) sets limits on interest rates and late fees. The original text had a cap linked to the legal maximum, while the modified version provides no such limit and relies on the 'lending institution's discretion' without a clear calculation method, potentially exceeding legal limits. Scraped Law Snippet 1 is empty and Scraped Law Snippet 2 is a 404 error, so they cannot directly support or refute the contradiction. However, the LLM explanation is strong. A contradiction score of 0.7 is appropriate because while the snippets are unhelpful, the lack of a defined calculation method in the modified text, combined with the potential to exceed legal limits as described in the law explanation, constitutes a notable weakening of the legal safeguard."

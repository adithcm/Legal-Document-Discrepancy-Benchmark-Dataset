        "changed_text": "The seller shall not be liable for any damage and loss of the commodity, expenses incurred on account of improper packing, unless explicitly stated in a separate agreement, and any damage attributable to inadequate or improper protective measures taken by the seller in regard to the packing. All wooden material of shipping package will be treated without adhering to any particular requirements from any agency.",
        "explanation": "This change directly contradicts established standards for export packaging, particularly those related to phytosanitary measures for wooden packaging materials. By stating the seller is not liable and by removing any need for the wooden material to be treated, it violates regulations designed to prevent the spread of invasive species. This creates uncertainty as to who bears the risk and responsibility for non-compliant shipments.",

        "justification": "The changed text significantly weakens obligations related to international trade and phytosanitary measures, creating a strong contradiction. The original text mandated adherence to Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau of China requirements for wooden shipping materials. The changed text explicitly disregards these requirements and removes seller liability. Scraped Law Snippet 1 references ISPM standards, including ISPM 01, 'Phytosanitary principles for the protection of plants and the application of phytosanitary measures in international trade,' and ISPM 15 (implied by the Perturbation and Law Explanations concerning wood packaging). While the snippet doesn't directly quote the ISPM 15 standard, its inclusion in the list of ISPM standards indicates its relevance. By removing the responsibility for proper wood treatment, the changed text increases the risk of non-compliance with international phytosanitary standards, contradicting the principles outlined in ISPM 01 and related ISPMs, as explained. The lack of Scraped Law Snippet 2 does not diminish the strength of the observed contradiction."

        "justification": "The modified text significantly weakens the original contract's requirement for specific markings on packages, potentially contradicting safety regulations and standard shipping practices. The Law Explanation suggests a conflict with 49 CFR \u00a7 173.24, which outlines general requirements for packaging, especially for hazardous materials, including proper markings and instructions. Scraped Law Snippet 1, specifically 49 CFR \u00a7 173.24(b), states that each package used for shipping hazardous materials must be designed and constructed so that 'there will be no identifiable (without the use of instruments) release of hazardous materials to the environment' and 'the effectiveness of the package will not be substantially reduced'. By removing the mandatory nature of markings like 'KEEP AWAY FROM MOISTURE' and 'HANDLE WITH CARE', the modified text increases the risk of damage or mishandling, potentially leading to a release or reduced effectiveness, especially if the contents are hazardous. While the snippet focuses on hazardous materials, the original text did not explicitly exclude them, meaning there is a strong chance this law would apply. The modified text encourages only minimal marking, and waives responsibility for including crucial safety information. The 'encouraged' vs. 'shall' language weakens the obligation considerably. Therefore, the contradiction score is 0.7, reflecting a strong potential conflict."

The letter of credit should state that partial shipments are allowed. The Buyer's agent agrees to pay for the goods in accordance with the actual amount of the goods shipped. 80% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.1.

        "explanation": "This alteration introduces multiple contradictions to standard Letter of Credit (LC) practices. Changing 'irrevocable' to 'revocable' directly undermines the security an LC provides to the seller. The value and timing are now at the buyer's discretion, going against established guidelines that protect the seller. By saying that 'partial shipments are not allowed' makes the LC more restrictive.

While no specific law snippets are provided to directly contradict the changes, the Law Explanation points to the UCP 600 as the industry standard for letters of credit. The changes, such as making the LC revocable, arbitrary in value and payment terms, restricting partial shipments, and shortening the validity period, deviate substantially from typical LC practices, undermining the security and certainty typically associated with letters of credit, as explained in the Perturbation Explanation. Therefore, while there's no direct legal citation, the deviation from standard practice constitutes a notable contradiction, justifying a score of 0.7."

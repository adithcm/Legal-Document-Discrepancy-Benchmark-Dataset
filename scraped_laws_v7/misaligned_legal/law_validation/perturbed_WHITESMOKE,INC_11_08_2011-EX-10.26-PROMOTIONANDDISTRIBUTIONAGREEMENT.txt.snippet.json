The Law Explanation states that the changed contract text is in contradiction with the UTSA definition of trade secrets as it eliminates the requirements for reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy and that the information must derive independent economic value from not being generally known. While the provided snippets are empty, preventing direct comparison, the Law Explanation provides sufficient grounds to find a strong contradiction because the modified text could encompass information not typically considered confidential or a trade secret under standard legal interpretations, thus weakening protections afforded to legitimately confidential information. The absence of supporting snippets reduces the certainty of this assessment, but the provided Law Explanation, combined with the change in contract language, supports a relatively high contradiction score."

The Law Explanation states this infringes on the copyright holder's rights (Google), as the EULA governs the use and distribution of copyrighted material. While the snippets do not directly define EULA modification rights, Snippet 1 does mention copyright protection subsisting in 'original works of authorship' and that protection extending to 'literary works'. Modifying the EULA could impact the terms of use of that copyrighted work, and giving the distributor such right contradicts the spirit of copyright control. Snippet 2 confirms that the Copyright Act of 1976 is codified in 17 U.S.C., providing a basis for the copyright claim even if the snippet itself doesn't detail specific rights. The contradiction arises because Google, as the copyright holder, should be the entity controlling the terms of use, not a distributor."

        "scraped_snippet_1": "parol evidence rule | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! \u00d7 No thank you parol evidence rule Overview In contract disputes, parol evidence is any agreement that is not contained within the written contract. Under the parol evidence rule, these agreements made outside of the contract are inadmissible in court u nless there is evidence of fraud , duress , or a mutual mistake . The rationale behind the rule is to deter untruthful attacks on contracts. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence , including prior or contemporaneous oral agreements and prior or contemporaneous written agreements, that contradict or create a variation of a term in writing that the parties intended to be completely integrated . In other words, any information leading up to or during a contract that is not included in writing is considered inadmissible evidence and is excluded from the jury . The jury will therefore only look at the writing within the document itself to decide a contract dispute. The parol evidence rule is codified in U.C.C. \u00a7 2-202 , which states that terms in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented by course of dealing , usage of trade , or by course of performance ; and by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement. One factor the court will look at to determine whether or not to admit extrinsic evidence is whether the written contract reasonably appears to be completely or partially integrated . If the written contract reasonably appears to be, in view of its completeness and specificity, a complete statement of the terms related to the deal, the court will view the written contract as completely integrated. As such, the court will not allow anything outside the writing itself, let alone anything that contradicts the writing. If the contract does not reasonably appear to be, in view of its completeness and specificity, a complete statement of the terms related to the deal, the court can allow consistent, additional terms to supplement the written contract unless those terms contradict the written contract. There are two exceptions to the parol evidence rule: the collateral contract exception and the ambiguity exception . Collateral Contract Exception For the collateral contract exception, the court will look at preliminary evidence to determine if the contract was partially integrated. There are three conditions that must be met in order for the collateral contract exception to apply. The extrinsic agreement must, in form, be a collateral one. This means that the extrinsic agreement must not be distinct and independent from the original written agreement. For instance, the extrinsic agreement could be a side agreement to the original agreement that was made contemporaneously with or during negotiations. And, the same consideration for the original agreement must apply to the extrinsic agreement. The extrinsic agreement must not contradict the express or implied provisions of the written contract. The court gives primacy to writing and does not look at contradictory information. In Baker v. Bailey, 782 P.2d 1286 (Mont. 1989) , the court refused to admit the parol evidence and enforce the extrinsic agreement because the court found that the original written contract was clear and definite and the extrinsic agreement contradicted the original written contract. The extrinsic agreement must be one that the parties would not ordinarily be expected to embody in the writing. The court will apply the \u201cordinary or natural test,\u201d which asks whether the extrinsic agreement is the sort of promise that one might reasonably expect to be in the original written contract.

        "justification": "The changed text weakens the integration clause by stating the agreement contains 'some' of the terms instead of 'all' terms, making it potentially incomplete. Scraped Law Snippet 1 states that the parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence that contradicts or creates a variation of a term in writing that the parties intended to be completely integrated. The change from 'all' to 'some' suggests the parties did not intend the agreement to be completely integrated, thereby opening the door for the introduction of extrinsic evidence, which contradicts the purpose of an integration clause and undermines the parol evidence rule. The law snippet explains that if a contract does not appear to be a complete statement of the terms, the court can allow additional terms to supplement the written contract. The change directly undermines the intended integration of the contract, conflicting with the principles of the parol evidence rule.

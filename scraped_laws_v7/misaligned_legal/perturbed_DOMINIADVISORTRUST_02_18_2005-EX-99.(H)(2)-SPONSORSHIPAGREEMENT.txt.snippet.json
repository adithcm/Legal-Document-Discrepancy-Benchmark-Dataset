        "explanation": "Changing 'net assets' to 'gross assets' allows the sponsor to potentially extract more fees, while stating 'to be determined at the Sponsor's discretion' could allow for hidden fee increases and misreporting, potentially violating regulations around fund accounting.",

Changing the basis of the fee calculation from 'net' to 'gross' assets and making it discretionary could result in excessive fees, breaching that duty if it is not in the best interest of the fund and its shareholders. The change in asset calculation also affects the definition of 'net assets' required under the act.",

While this isn't directly an assignment issue, the substantial restriction on the Trust's ability to terminate effectively limits the Trust's freedom to choose its advisor, undermining the protections intended by Section 15 and general fiduciary duties.

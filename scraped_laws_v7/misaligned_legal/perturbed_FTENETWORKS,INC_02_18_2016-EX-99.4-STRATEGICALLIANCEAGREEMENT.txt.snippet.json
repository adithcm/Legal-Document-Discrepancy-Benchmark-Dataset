The original text clearly requires the subcontractor to prevent any liens from being placed on the property. The modified text only addresses 'frivolous claims,' which introduces ambiguity.

By limiting the subcontractor's responsibility to only 'frivolous claims', the modified contract contradicts the intent of the Texas Property Code to protect those who contribute to the improvement of property by allowing them to file liens to ensure payment. The change suggests that legitimate liens need not be addressed by the subcontractor, potentially exposing EDGE and the Customer to liability that the original clause sought to prevent.",

(c) A \"usage of trade\" is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question. The existence and scope of such a usage must be proved as facts. If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law. (d) A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties' agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement. A usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance. (e) Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (f), the express terms of an agreement and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade must be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other. If such a construction is unreasonable: (1) express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade; (2) course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade; and (3) course of dealing prevails over usage of trade. (f) Subject to Section 2.209 , a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance. (g) Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party.

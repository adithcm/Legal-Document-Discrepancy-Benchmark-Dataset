      "Okay, imagine a regular computer bit like a light switch: it's either on (1) or off (0). Quantum computers, on the other hand, are like a dimmer switch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Regular Bits:** These are the basic building blocks of regular computers. They can be either 0 or 1. Think of it like a coin that's either heads or tails.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Qubits (Quantum Bits):** These are the basic building blocks of quantum computers.  Instead of being just 0 or 1, a qubit can be 0, 1, or *both at the same time*!  This is called **superposition**. Think of it like that coin spinning in the air - it's not heads or tails until it lands.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Superposition:**  The ability to be in multiple states simultaneously (0, 1, or a combination of both).  This lets quantum computers explore many possibilities at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Entanglement:** When two qubits become linked together, their fates are intertwined. If you measure the state of one entangled qubit, you instantly know the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. Think of two of our spinning coins that are magically linked. If one lands on heads, the other *instantly* lands on tails.\n",
      "\n",
      "**So, what does this mean?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Because qubits can be in multiple states at once (superposition) and can be linked together in strange ways (entanglement), quantum computers can perform calculations that are impossible for regular computers.  They can explore many possibilities simultaneously, instead of having to try them one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Think of it like this:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Regular Computer:**  Trying to find the way out of a maze by trying each path one at a time.\n",
      "*   **Quantum Computer:**  Trying all possible paths at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this useful?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize fields like:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Drug Discovery:** Simulating molecules to design new drugs and therapies.\n",
      "*   **Materials Science:** Designing new materials with specific properties.\n",
      "*   **Finance:** Optimizing investment strategies and detecting fraud.\n",
      "*   **Cryptography:** Breaking existing encryption algorithms and creating new, more secure ones.\n",
      "*   **Artificial Intelligence:** Developing more powerful machine learning algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Caveats:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Quantum computers are still in their early stages of development.  They are not going to replace your laptop anytime soon.\n",
      "*   They are very complex and expensive to build and maintain.\n",
      "*   They are not good at everything. They are best suited for specific types of problems that are very difficult for regular computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short, quantum computers use the strange properties of quantum mechanics to perform calculations in a fundamentally different way than regular computers, potentially allowing them to solve problems that are currently impossible.**\n",

    "def generate_perturbation_new(original_text, file_name, prompt):    \n",
    "    \"\"\"Generates a perturbed version of the legal document section in structured JSON format.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"You are a financial contract auditor ensuring consistency in payment terms. Your task is to introduce a conflict between different payment deadline clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Inconsistencies also lead to **in-text contradictions** when **different sections of a contract provide conflicting deadlines, obligations, or penalties**. This creates ambiguity regarding which terms should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a **key term** in the contract.\n",
    "    2. Modify its definition in different sections so that they **conflict**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure the contradiction creates **uncertainty in enforcement**.\n",
    "    4. For that perturbation, make sure in the file there should be **2-3** of them. \n",
    "    5. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",
    "    6. Make sure that when taking the original texts, there should be no jumps between sentences. Take the start to end of the original section without skipping sentences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    --------\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Examples of Conflicting Payment Terms:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Section 4:** \"Invoices must be paid within 45 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 12:** \"Late fees apply if invoices are unpaid after 30 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** One section allows **45 days**, but the other **charges late fees after 30 days**, creating ambiguity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Section 6:** \"Security deposits are fully refundable.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 9:** \"Security deposits are non-refundable.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** It is unclear whether **deposits must be returned**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Section 3:** \"Early termination fees apply if the contract is ended before 12 months.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 10:** \"Clients may terminate at any time without penalty.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Conflicting clauses **cause uncertainty about termination fees**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Section 5:** \"Payment plans must be completed within 6 months.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 11:** \"Customers may extend payment plans up to 12 months.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Different sections **contradict the maximum payment period**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Section 8:** \"Interest on late payments accrues at 5% per month.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 14:** \"No interest will be charged on late payments.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** **Conflicting interest policies** could lead to legal disputes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"For the purposes of this Agreement, the term 'Affiliate' shall refer to any entity that is controlled by, controls, or is under common control with either party. The term 'control' shall mean ownership of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the voting equity in such entity. Affiliates shall be entitled to the same rights and obligations as the contracting party.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"For the purposes of this Agreement, the term 'Affiliate' shall refer to any entity that is affiliated with, works in conjunction with, or has a strategic partnership with either party. Affiliates may be granted certain rights and obligations as determined by the contracting party on a case-by-case basis.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The modified text **creates an in-text contradiction** by **changing the definition of \"Affiliate\"** to include strategic partnerships and loosely affiliated entities, rather than just entities **under majority control**. This contradicts other contract sections that **rely on the original definition** (51% ownership) to determine rights and obligations. Additionally, **allowing case-by-case determination** undermines the original intent of treating affiliates the same as contracting parties, introducing **legal uncertainty** and **potential disputes over obligations**.\n",

      "Warning: Could not find section in text: § 6 Advertising Cost Compensation (1) element 5 will pay Affiliate its advertising costs (including Vat, if any, on presentation of a valid VAT invoice) if an end user arrives via the link integrated in Affiliate's Web site at the order page hosted by element 5 for the respective Software Publisher's Product under this Agreement and end user uses the automatic ordering system that carries out the registration and payment processing, so that the Affiliate's link is deemed to be directly causative for the entry of the End User into the agreement with the Software Publisher and End User's payment, proving that all requirements are irrevocably met (\"agreements arising in a qualified manner\"). Affiliate is only eligible to earn the Advertising Cost Compensation on sales occurring during the term of this Agreement and fees earned up to the date termination will remain payable only if the related orders are not cancelled or returned. (2) Insofar as the referred end user accepts cookies when clicking on Affiliate's link, proceeds from orders will be taken into account which do arise within the lifespan (of max. 180 days) of the cookie(s) used and/ or possibly within the lifespan of a special action of the Software Publisher via integrated link. (3) element 5 shall record and compute on a monthly basis the amount of said Advertising Cost Compensation for the Affiliate. (4) The computation basis for determining the value of the Advertising Cost Compensation is calculated by the gross sales price (including taxes, shipping and handling, etc.) actually invoiced to the referred end user. The percentage of the respective Advertising Cost Compensation shall be stipulated by the Software Publisher, but shall not exceed 50% of the effective gross sales price of the software. (5) The Advertising Cost Compensation shall not be paid if and insofar as it is determined that the end user will not meet its payment obligations or will meet them only partially, or if for any other reason the invoice to the end user was cancelled (e.g. in cases where a charge back of a credit card charge, a debit advice or other return or refund of the software product occurs). If the Advertising Cost Compensation was previously paid by element 5, it can be offset or invoiced to Affiliate at element 5's own discretion. (6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly insofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not the case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100 EUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the Affiliate's participation in the Program. (7) The payment can be made by wire transfer, Direct Deposit (US only) or check, as chosen by the Affiliate. (8) The invoicing is deemed to be approved if the Affiliate does not object in writing, including a statement of reasons, within four weeks.\n",

If Shipper fails to notify MPL within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Project's in-service date or if MPL is unsuccessful in obtaining additional volume commitments as provided for in Section 3.8 to fully replace Shipper's original volume commitment as submitted in its Capacity Request Form in Exhibit C, Shipper will reimburse MPL for Shipper's pro rata portion of actual and committed Construction Costs, plus, an administrative fee of ten (10) percent of said costs (such reimbursement is hereinafter referred to as the \"Construction Cost Reimbursement\"). The Parties agree that the Construction Cost Reimbursement shall be deemed liquidated damages and that such amount shall not be deemed a penalty, but rather represents a reasonable amount of liquidated damages in light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by Shipper's termination of this Agreement as stated, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non- feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and that the payment of such amount shall be MPL's sole and exclusive remedy for such termination by Shipper.\n",

Operator shall cooperate with Owner's auditors by (i) making the applicable books and records available for inspection by Owner's auditors, and (ii) making such copies of books and records as may be reasonably requested by such auditors. In no event shall Owner's audits unreasonably interfere with Operator's operations. Owner will be responsible for all costs of any such audit; provided that if, in any audit, Owner discovers overpayments by Owner of at least $250,000 in the aggregate (\"Material Overpayment\"), Operator will reimburse Owner for such Material Overpayment and all reasonable costs incurred by Owner in connection with such audit (\"Audit Costs\"). Owner shall have up until two years after the close of a Calendar Year in which to make an audit of Operator's records for such Calendar Year. Except for any bill or statement with respect to which an Adjustment Claim is made within the two-year audit period, the bills and statements rendered for the Calendar Year prior to such two-year audit period shall be conclusively established as correct. An \"Adjustment Claim\" shall mean a written claim by Owner to Operator requesting a refund or other financial adjustment in respect of any overpayment by Owner (including in the case of a Material Overpayment, all Audit Costs) and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such claim. Operator shall, within 10 days of receipt of an Adjustment Claim, provide Owner with the requested refund or other financial adjustment; provided that if Operator shall dispute in good faith some or all of the amounts set forth in such Adjustment Claim, Operator may elect to withhold any disputed amounts, pending resolution of the dispute. If the Parties shall fail to resolve their dispute with respect to the remaining Adjustment Claim amount within 15 Business Days, Owner may, at its sole option, refer such dispute for resolution in accordance with the terms of Section 9.6. Unless otherwise resolved by the Parties, any bill or statement that is the subject of an Adjustment Claim shall be conclusively established as correct if dispute resolution procedures have not been initiated under Section 9.6 of this Agreement within 180 days of the submission of an Adjustment Claim. Any and all information pertaining to Operator and its business that is disclosed to Owner or discovered by Owner in connection with any audit hereunder shall be subject to the Confidentiality and Disclosure Agreement without regard to whether it has been designated as such and Owner shall be subject to the same restrictions and standard of care set forth therein with respect to Operator's confidential information.\n",

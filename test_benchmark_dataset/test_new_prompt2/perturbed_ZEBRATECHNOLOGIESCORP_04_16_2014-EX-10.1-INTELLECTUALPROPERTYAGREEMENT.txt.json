                "explanation": "This clause dictates the governing law and forum for dispute resolution, which is a fundamental aspect of contract enforceability. By changing this to allow any state to be arbitrated and saying there is no mandatory venue, it introduces contradiction as the contract is not clear in which jurisdiction it needs to be filed. This contradicts general legal practices where certainty and predictability in dispute resolution are crucial. The change introduces ambiguity about where disputes should be resolved, potentially leading to jurisdictional challenges and increased costs.",

                "explanation": "The original clause sets a clear timeframe of 90 days for the seller to provide crucial documents related to standards organizations (SDOs). By extending this to 1000 days, it significantly delays the purchaser's ability to assess and comply with SDO requirements. This creates uncertainty and potential risk of non-compliance during that extended period. By removing the reasonable efforts clause, the buyer is now burdened with a greater work-load to be able to ensure they get those documents, and the seller is not required to promptly inform the seller when there are changes with membership with any SDO.",

                "explanation": "This clause addresses the assignment of IP rights from employees and contractors. Changing 'have executed and delivered' to 'may or may not have executed and delivered' introduces uncertainty about whether proper assignment agreements exist. By taking out, the adverse effect on the business, there may not be a clear agreement and this creates doubt as to whether intellectual property was properly assigned and may make the IP unenforceable.

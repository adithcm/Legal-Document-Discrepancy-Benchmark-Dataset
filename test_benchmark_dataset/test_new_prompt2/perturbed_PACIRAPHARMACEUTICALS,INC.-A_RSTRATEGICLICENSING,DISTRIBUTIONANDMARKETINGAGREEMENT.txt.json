Such insurance shall be with a reputable insurance company and where  reasonably possible (taking into account the availability of such insurance) shall be maintained for not less than [**] ([**]) years following  the expiry or termination of this Agreement. During the Term, neither Party shall do or omit to do any act, matter or thing which could  prejudice or render voidable any such insurance.

The Parties agree that the venue for the resolution of all disputes arising under the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein will be the County of Pinellas, State of Florida.",

The Parties agree that the venue for the resolution of all disputes arising under the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein will be in a county decided by the company.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Florida law and Pinellas County as the venue, providing clarity and predictability. The revised clause introduces uncertainty by allowing the company to choose the governing state law and county for dispute resolution. This ambiguity undermines the enforceability of the contract, as the consultant is left without a defined legal framework or venue for resolving disputes, potentially violating principles of fair contracting.",

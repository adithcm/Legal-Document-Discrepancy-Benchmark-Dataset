If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

                "explanation": "Moving the solvency maintenance clause to the membership section obfuscates its importance and potential financial implications, as it's not logically related to membership benefits. This obscures the provision, making it less likely that a contract holder would understand their obligations if the company's solvency is threatened.",

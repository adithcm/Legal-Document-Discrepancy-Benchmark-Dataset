The exclusivity shall not prevent Dynamic Hearing entering into agreements with any Identified Party subject to the terms herein. On or before January 1, 2009, Dynamic Hearing will provide IntriCon with an updated version of Exhibit C which will include a complete list of identified parties. After January 1, 2009, no additions to Exhibit C are allowed unless agreed to by IntriCon in writing.",

The exclusivity shall not prevent Dynamic Hearing entering into agreements with any Identified Party subject to the terms herein. Dynamic Hearing reserves the right to add new parties to Exhibit C at any time, at its sole discretion, irrespective of IntriCon's consent.

                "explanation": "The original text grants IntriCon's exclusivity, but also notes identified parties are exceptions. The altered language explicitly removes IntriCon's right to approve Exhibit C additions post-January 1, 2009, which directly contradicts the intent of the original provision regarding IntriCon's control over exclusivity exceptions and creates uncertainty regarding the scope of IntriCon's exclusive license. This makes the exclusitivity terms uncertain.",

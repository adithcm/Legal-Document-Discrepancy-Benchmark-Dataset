                "explanation": "By adding 'at the discretion of PC Financial', the arbitration clause is altered to benefit one party. Originally it was binding but now only at the discretion of PC Financial. This significantly weakens the enforceability of the arbitration agreement and contradicts standard practices where arbitration agreements are intended to be mutually binding.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'will not violate' to 'will make commercially reasonable efforts to not violate', the obligation is weakened. This introduces ambiguity and reduces the enforceability of the anti-corruption provision.

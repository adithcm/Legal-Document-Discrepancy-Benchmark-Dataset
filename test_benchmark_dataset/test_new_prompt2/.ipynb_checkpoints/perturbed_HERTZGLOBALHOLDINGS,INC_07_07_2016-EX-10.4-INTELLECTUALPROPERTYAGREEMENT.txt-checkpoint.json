                "original_text": "2.2 In the case of the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks: 2.2.1 HSI will retain ownership and will grant a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to HERC to use the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks (those foreign trademarks owned by HSI related to the ERB that incorporate the mark/name HERTZ) as set forth on Schedule A, for the Interim Period, outside the United States and Puerto Rico, as more fully set forth in the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement attached as Exhibit A. HERC shall immediately discontinue use of the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks upon expiration of the Interim Period, or the earlier termination of this Agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "2.2 In the case of the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks: 2.2.1 HSI will retain ownership and may, at its sole discretion, grant a royalty-bearing, exclusive license to HERC to use the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks (those foreign trademarks owned by HSI related to the ERB that incorporate the mark/name HERTZ) as set forth on Schedule A, for a period determined by HSI, worldwide, as more fully set forth in a future Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement. HERC may continue to use the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks indefinitely, subject to HSI's ongoing approval, even after the initial term.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original clause by making the license potentially royalty-bearing and exclusive, instead of royalty-free and non-exclusive. The duration of the license is now at HSI's discretion, removing the fixed 'Interim Period'. This creates uncertainty about HERC's rights to use the trademarks and significantly alters the financial implications for HERC. Also, the territory is changed from outside the United States and Puerto Rico to worldwide.",

HERC shall immediately discontinue use of the HERC (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks and abandon or voluntarily withdraw or cancel any applications or registrations therefor upon expiration of the Interim Period as more fully set forth in the Coexistence Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit C and/or the earlier termination of this Agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement. The Parties shall cooperate to ensure that no confusion arises in the marketplace during the Interim Period, as more fully set forth in the Coexistence Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "2.5 In the case of the HERC (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks owned by HERC: 2.5.1 HERC will retain ownership but HSI has the perpetual right to use of the HERC (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks (those US trademarks owned by HERC related to the ERB that incorporate the mark/name HERTZ) as set forth on Schedule D indefinitely. HERC may continue the right to use the HERC (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks so long as the other terms of this agreement are valid. HERC is not required to discontinue use of the HERC (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks or abandon or voluntarily withdraw or cancel any applications or registrations therefor upon expiration of the Interim Period. The Parties are not required to cooperate to ensure that no confusion arises in the marketplace during the Interim Period.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several contradictions. First, it grants HSI a 'perpetual right' to use trademarks owned by HERC, undermining HERC's ownership rights. Second, it removes the obligation for HERC to discontinue using the trademarks after the Interim Period, directly contradicting the original text. Finally, the parties are not required to cooperate, directly opposing the prior cooperation agreement.",

In the event of a material breach of this Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements exhibited hereto, THC or HSI may notify HERC of such material breach and terminate this Agreement upon written notice. If HERC has not cured any such breach within thirty (30) days after HERC receives such notice, this Agreement shall automatically terminate without further notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the nature of the breach is such that it cannot be cured, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon notice of termination by THC or HSI to HERC (without any opportunity to cure the breach).",
                "changed_text": "8.1 By THC or HSI upon Notice. In the event of a breach of this Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements exhibited hereto, THC or HSI may terminate this Agreement upon verbal notice. If HERC cures any such breach, this Agreement shall not terminate, provided HERC pays the termination penalty, which will be decided at that time by the THC or HSI, and it will depend on the current market conditions. THC or HSI reserves the right to allow the breach to continue even after verbal notice, and HERC must respect this decision.",
                "explanation": "This revision directly contradicts the original termination clause. It allows termination upon 'verbal notice' instead of written notice, and introduces a highly subjective 'termination penalty' that can be arbitrarily determined by THC or HSI. It also allows the breach to continue, even after verbal notice, creating uncertainty.",

This affects how conflicts are resolved, making it difficult to enforce, as it allows either party to disregard the arbitration outcome and pursue litigation, contradicting the original intent of mandatory and binding arbitration.",

                "explanation": "The modification strategically delays the inclusion of required conditions (Corio's prompt notification and tendering of control) that trigger Commerce One's indemnification responsibilities. The new structure makes it seem as though Commerce One’s obligation is immediate, before revealing Corio's duties to enable such support, which could make it easier for Corio to argue for immediate compensation before those conditions are met. This creates ambiguity about when the indemnification obligation begins, potentially complicating enforcement of this section.",

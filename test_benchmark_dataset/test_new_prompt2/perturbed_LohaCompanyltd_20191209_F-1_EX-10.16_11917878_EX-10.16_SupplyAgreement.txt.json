                "original_text": "19. ARBITRATION: All disputes in connection with this Contract or the execution thereof shall be settled friendly through negotiations. In case no settlement can be reached, the case may then be submitted for arbitration to the Foreign Economic and Trade Arbitration Committee of the China Beijing Council for the Promotion of International Trade in accordance with its Provisional Rules of Procedures by the said Arbitration Committee. The Arbitration shall take place in Beijing and the decision of the Arbitration Committee shall be final and binding upon both parties; neither party shall seek recourse to a law court nor other authorities to appeal for revision of the decision. Arbitration fee shall be borne by the losing party.",
                "changed_text": "20. This final price is the confidential information. Dissemination, distribution or duplication of this price is strictly prohibited.\n\n19. ARBITRATION: In case no settlement can be reached through friendly negotiations, the case may then be submitted for discussion.",
                "explanation": "The original arbitration clause mandated arbitration in Beijing under specific rules. The modified clause severely weakens this by removing the mandatory arbitration, the location, and the binding nature of the decision. It now only suggests 'discussion' after failed negotiations, making any formal dispute resolution uncertain and unenforceable. Displacing the section and truncating content reduces enforceability.",

CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers. The Certificate so issued shall be accepted as the base of a claim. The Sellers, in accordance with the Buyers' claim, shall be responsible for the immediate elimination of the defect(s), complete or partial replacement of the commodity or shall devaluate the commodity according to the state of defect(s). Where necessary, the Buyers shall be at liberty to eliminate the defect(s) themselves at the Sellers' expenses. If the Sellers fail to answer the Buyers within one weeks after receipt of the aforesaid claim, the claim shall be reckoned as having been accepted by the Sellers.\n\n21. Law application It will be governed by an agreement between the buyer and seller.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specified that the contract is governed by the law of the People's Republic of China or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The changed text replaces the original clause with a vague statement that the contract is governed by an agreement between the buyer and seller, and moves it after the Claims clause. This obscures the applicable law, potentially leading to disputes over jurisdiction and enforceability and reducing enforceability.",

This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter shall be governed by,  and construed in accordance with, the laws of the People's Republic of China (without regard to its conflicts of laws rules that would mandate the  application of the laws of another jurisdiction).\n\n10.12. Dispute Resolution. (a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity  thereof (each, a \"Dispute\"), shall to the extent possible be settled through friendly consultation among the Parties hereto. The claiming Party (the  \"Claimant\") shall promptly notify the other Party (the \"Respondent\") in a dated written notice that a Dispute has arisen and describe the nature of  the Dispute. Any Dispute which remains unresolved within sixty (60) days after the date of such written notice shall be submitted to the China  International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the \"Commission\") to be finally settled by arbitration in Beijing, PRC in accordance  with the Commission's then effective rules (the \"Rules\") and this Section 10.12. The language of the arbitration shall be Mandarin Chinese.\n\n(b) The arbitration tribunal shall consist of three (3) arbitrators. The Claimant shall appoint one (1) arbitrator, the Respondent shall appoint one (1)  arbitrator, and the two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall appoint a third arbitrator. If the Claimant and the Respondent fail to appoint one (1)  arbitrator, or the two (2) arbitrators appointed fail to appoint the third arbitrator within the time periods set by the then effective Rules, the relevant  appointment shall be made promptly by the Commission.\n\n(c) Any award of the arbitration tribunal established pursuant to this Section 10.12 shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and enforceable in  any court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties shall use their best efforts to effect the prompt execution of any such award and shall render  whatever assistance as may be necessary to this end. The prevailing Party (as determined by the arbitrators) shall be entitled to reimbursement of  its costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred in connection with the arbitration and any judicial enforcement, unless the  arbitrators determine that it would be manifestly unfair to honor this agreement of the Parties and determine a different allocation of costs.\n\n(d) The foregoing provisions in this Section 10.12 shall not preclude any Party from seeking interim or conservatory remedies, including injunctive  relief, from any court having jurisdiction to grant such relief.",

                "explanation": "By changing the governing law from PRC to Delaware and significantly altering the dispute resolution process, we've introduced a substantial legal contradiction. The original clause mandated arbitration in Beijing under CIETAC rules, but the modified version allows for 'mutual agreement' on a dispute resolution process, and only defaults to remedies afforded by law, effectively removing the mandatory arbitration clause. Furthermore, awards of the arbitration tribunal is not final and binding, limiting the enforcement of the arbitration clause.",

The clause originally prevented either party from assigning or transferring the agreement without the other party's express written consent. Now, it states that either party can assign or transfer the agreement without written consent from the assigning party. Thus, any legal case brought with this language, there would be no enforcement.",

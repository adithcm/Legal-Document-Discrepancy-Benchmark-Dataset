                "original_text": "3.3.1 For each month during the Term, the Company will pay CNET a minimum of [XXXX] in cash, plus [XXX] of CNET Sales. Payments under this paragraph will be based on the reports prepared by the Company under Section 3.2 (although CNET may challenge such reports as contemplated by Section 9.5) and will be due within 30 days after the end of each month of the Term. 3.3.2 Payments under this Section 3.3 will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds and are nonrefundable once paid.",
                "changed_text": "3.3.1 For each month during the Term, the Company *may* pay CNET a minimum of [XXXX] in cash, plus [XXX] of CNET Sales, *contingent on CNET meeting certain unwritten performance benchmarks*. Payments under this paragraph will be based on *CNET's own assessment* of the reports prepared by the Company under Section 3.2, subject to the Company's approval, and will be due within 60 days after *CNET provides a detailed invoice, if CNET chooses to invoice*. 3.3.2 Payments under this Section 3.3 will be made by *a method mutually agreed upon* and *may be refundable under certain circumstances at CNET's discretion*.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the payment obligations of the Company to CNET, establishing a minimum payment amount, the basis of calculation, and the due date. The revised text introduces ambiguity by using \"may\" instead of \"will\", suggesting the payments are not guaranteed. The added phrase \"contingent on CNET meeting certain unwritten performance benchmarks\" creates uncertainty about what the Company must actually pay. Modifying the payment deadline from 30 days to 60 days, contingent on CNET invoicing, also introduces uncertainty. Finally, changing the refund policy from nonrefundable to refundable at CNET's discretion directly contradicts the original provision.",

For purposes of this agreement \"Competing Computer Products Retailer\" means any company other than the Company that is engaged in the retail sale of computer products, with the exception of CNET Direct, which operates BuyDirect.com. During the Term, CNET will not enter into more than two other agreements under which CNET receives consideration from a Competing Computer Products Retailer for displaying permanent links to or other fixed promotions for such Competing Computer Products Retailer on any CNET Site; provided that the foregoing will not restrict the display of(a) standard advertisements for any Competing Computer Products Retailer or its products or (b) any promotions within COMPUTERS.COM or within CNET's Snap! Online service (which are expressly excluded from this provision). The parties acknowledge that the foregoing will not prevent CNET from displaying text links and other references to Competing Computer Products Retailers as reasonably necessary to provide appropriate editorial and search related services on the CNET Sites. The Retail Promotions granted to the Company shall be placed in such a way as to provide no more or less prominence to the Company than is provided to any other Competing Computer Retailer signing an agreement with CNET.",

                "explanation": "The original clause grants a limited exclusivity to the company. The changes erode this exclusivity. Defining 'Competing Computer Products Retailer' as including companies that are suppliers introduces a contradiction. The original definition excludes these. The exclusivity is undermined by changing CNET's obligation to 'not enter into more than two agreements' to 'reserves the right to enter into agreements with any number'. The addition of 'However, CNET will attempt to limit the prominence' makes the clause unenforceable. Changing the word 'shall' to 'may' makes it non-obligatory.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the confidentiality terms of the agreement and exceptions to what is considered Confidential Information. Changing 'shall' to 'may or may not' creates uncertainty about whether confidentiality is even guaranteed. The phrase 'as determined by CNET' allows CNET to selectively choose what is confidential, contradicting the purpose of the clause. The change that 'will now be considered' contradicts the former statement that this information will not be considered confidential.",

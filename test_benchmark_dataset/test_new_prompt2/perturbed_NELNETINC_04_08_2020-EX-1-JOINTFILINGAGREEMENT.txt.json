                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare this document. The filing with regulatory authorities of Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments related to the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein is optional and at the discretion of each undersigned party, notwithstanding Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states an agreement to jointly file with regulatory authorities, adhering to Rule 13d-1(k). The modified text introduces ambiguity by suggesting that filing is optional, contradicting the mandatory filing requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and undermining the purpose of a joint filing agreement.",

No party shall be responsible for the accuracy of any information provided by other parties, regardless of knowledge or reason to believe inaccuracies exist.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes individual responsibility for timely and accurate filing. The modified text weakens this obligation by making contribution discretionary and absolving parties of responsibility for inaccurate information, even if known. This contradicts the intention of joint filing agreements, which rely on shared responsibility for regulatory compliance.",

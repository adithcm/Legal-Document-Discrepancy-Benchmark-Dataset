The Distributor acknowledges that is it                   aware that the  securities  laws  prohibit  any person who has                   material, non-public information concerning the Company or the                   matters  which  are  the  subject  of  this   Agreement   from                   purchasing  or selling  securities of the Company (or options,                   warrants and rights relating  thereto) and from  communicating                   such  information to any other person under  circumstances  in                   which it is reasonably  foreseeable that such person is likely                   to purchase or sell such securities.",

The revised text implies a lesser obligation and attempts to absolve the distributor of any responsibility, potentially conflicting with securities regulations.",

                "explanation": "Moving the statement about 'liability for defective products' creates ambiguity. By placing it after the distributor's compliance statement, it's less clear if the liability exclusion applies to situations where the distributor fails to comply with Magnuson-Moss, creating a potential loophole.",

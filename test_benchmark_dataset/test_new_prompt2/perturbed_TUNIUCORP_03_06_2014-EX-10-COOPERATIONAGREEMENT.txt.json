The total sum of Service Fee shall be equal to the amount of profits gained by Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. Party B shall have the right to adjust the amount of Service Fee at its own discretion, without the prior consent of Party A or its subsidiaries. Party A shall cause its subsidiaries to pay the Service Fee in respect of Party B's Services provided to such subsidiaries.",
                "changed_text": "4.1 Party A and Party B agree that they will allocate the proceeds generated from cooperation in accordance with the following provisions: Party B may charge, periodically, a service fee (\"Service Fee\") from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. The total sum of Service Fee shall be determined through mutual agreement between Party A and Party B, taking into account market conditions and the scope of services provided. Party A shall cause its subsidiaries to pay the Service Fee in respect of Party B's Services provided to such subsidiaries.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Party B has the right to adjust the service fee at its own discretion, without Party A's consent. The modified text changes this by stating that the fee will be determined through 'mutual agreement'. This directly contradicts the original statement, creating uncertainty about how the service fee is determined and potentially leading to disputes.",

For the purpose of this Article 12.3, \"Intellectual Property\" encompasses patents, trademarks, copyrights, and any other form of intellectual creation developed during the term of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that all intellectual property developed during the agreement belongs solely to Party B. The revised version contradicts this by stating that intellectual property is jointly owned, and the allocation is determined on a case-by-case basis with mutual agreement. This creates uncertainty about ownership, directly conflicting with the initial unambiguous assignment of rights.",

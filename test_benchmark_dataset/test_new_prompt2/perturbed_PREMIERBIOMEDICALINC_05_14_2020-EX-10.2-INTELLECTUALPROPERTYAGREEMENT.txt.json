This Agreement and the rights of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania including all matters of construction, validity, performance, and enforcement and without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws. Venue for any action brought under this Agreement shall be in the appropriate court in Mercer County, Pennsylvania.",

Felder shall have no obligation and/or involvement in any capital raising activities for THI or Premier at any time and for any reason. Further, the 150,000,000 (one hundred and fifty million) stock warrants previously ceded to Mitchell S. Felder by Halberd/THI shall not be eliminated, cancelled, or altered in any way, and for any reason, unless specifically directed at the request of Mitchell S. Felder.",
                "explanation": "This change moves the venue clause to a section dealing with stock warrants and obligations, making it difficult to determine the governing law and jurisdiction for disputes arising from the contract. Relocating the clause reduces its enforceability and clarity.",

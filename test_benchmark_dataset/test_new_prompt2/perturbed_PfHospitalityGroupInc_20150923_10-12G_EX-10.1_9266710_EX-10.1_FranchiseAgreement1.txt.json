This is subject to change based on the franchisorâ€™s discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that the governing law is subject to change based on the franchisor's discretion. This contradicts the original clause's explicit statement that Florida law governs the agreement.",

By having the modified text contain 'depending on the state in which the court case is filed', this introduces legal contradiction, as the new text implies that it is dependent on the state law in which the court case is filed, which may not be in the best interest of Pizza Fusion Holdings, Inc.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from Japan to Delaware introduces a potential conflict. The JV involves Japanese companies and operations. Altering the governing law might lead to disputes about which jurisdiction's laws should apply, weakening enforceability depending on where legal action is pursued.",

The arbitratorâ€™s decision shall be final and binding.",
                "explanation": "Adding the arbitration clause to the signature section makes it less visible and less likely to be read and understood by all parties. It is typically found in a separate section dedicated to dispute resolution.",

                "explanation": "Moving a liability disclaimer into a section discussing termination conditions makes it less prominent and reduces the likelihood that parties will fully understand the scope of the limitation of liability. It's also mixed into the legal jargon of the termination clause itself.",

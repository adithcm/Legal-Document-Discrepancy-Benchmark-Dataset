In the event a dispute arises out of, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Members will attempt to resolve the dispute through friendly consultation. 56. If the dispute is not resolved within a reasonable period then any or all outstanding issues may be submitted to mediation in accordance with any statutory rules of mediation. If mediation is not successful in resolving the entire dispute or is unavailable, any outstanding issues will be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida.

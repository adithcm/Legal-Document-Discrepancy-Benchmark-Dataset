                "original_text": "c. Litigation. If the Parties have been unable to resolve a Dispute through mediation as provided in the prior Subsection, a Party may file litigation against the other Party in a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States of America. With respect to litigation involving only the Parties or their Affiliates, the Parties irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the U.S. federal and Illinois state courts of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in Lake County, Illinois or Cook County, Illinois and their respective higher courts of appeal for the limited purpose of resolving a Dispute, and the Parties waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any defense of inconvenient forum. The Parties waive any right to trial by jury as to any Disputes resolved through litigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may file litigation to resolve a Dispute without undergoing either negotiation or mediation as provided in the prior Subsections for any Dispute involving: (i) infringement on intellectual property; (ii) the unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information; or (iii) a request for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or permanent injunction or any other type of equitable relief.",
                "changed_text": "c. Litigation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may file litigation to resolve a Dispute without undergoing either negotiation or mediation as provided in the prior Subsections.",
                "explanation": "The original clause contained specific details regarding the irrevocable consent to exclusive personal jurisdiction and waiver of 'inconvenient forum' defenses. Also removed was the waiver of jury trials. By removing these specifics and moving the reference to intellectual property, confidential information, and temporary restraining orders, from the litigation section, the enforceability of the dispute resolution clause becomes questionable, particularly regarding venue and jury trials. The new edit removes the part that waives trial by jury.",

This Agreement and all claims or causes of action arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be governed in all respects, including as to validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the State of Illinois and the United States of America, without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not govern or otherwise be applicable to this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By omitting explicit mention of Illinois and US law, the governing law clause becomes ambiguous. The removed text created a legal contradiction by specifically stating that Illinois law applies, but the modified text says that principles of conflict of laws apply. It does not make it clear what law governs the contract.",

Any notice required or permitted to be provided by a Party under this Agreement will be made to the notice address of the receiving Party set forth below or to an alternate notice address later designated by the receiving Party in accordance with this Subsection. Notices will be effective upon actual receipt by the receiving Party. An emailed notice will be effective against a receiving Party only if the Receiving Party acknowledge receipt of the emailed notice in a return notice to the notifying Party. A receiving Party agrees to acknowledge receipt of an email notice in good faith promptly following receipt.

                "explanation": "Removing the specific addresses and contact information for notices, especially those concerning default or termination, undermines the clarity and enforceability of the notice provision. Instead of providing the information directly, it indicates that the information is in Exhibit A. However, there is no Exhibit A in the contract, and no other Exhibit is mentioned in the contract either. This legal contradiction impairs contract enforceability.",

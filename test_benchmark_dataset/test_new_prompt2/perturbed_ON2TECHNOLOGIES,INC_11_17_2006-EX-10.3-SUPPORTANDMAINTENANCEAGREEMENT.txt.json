                "original_text": "The parties agree that any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to\nthis Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be instituted by a party in a Federal or state court sitting in the jurisdiction and venue of the other party, which shall be the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of said legal proceedings and each party hereto waives any objection which such party may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action, suit or proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any such action, suit or proceeding. Any and all service of process and any other notice in any such action, suit or proceeding shall be effective against such party (or the subsidiary of such party) when transmitted in accordance with Section 10.8. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any manner permitted by law.",
                "changed_text": "The parties agree that any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to\nthis Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be instituted by a party in a court of the party bringing the suit or in a mutually agreed location. Any and all service of process and any other notice in any such action, suit or proceeding shall be effective against such party (or the subsidiary of such party) when transmitted in accordance with Section 10.8. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any manner permitted by law.",

The modified clause removes the exclusive jurisdiction and venue to a mutually agreed location. This can cause confusion and delay in determining where legal proceedings should occur, potentially hindering enforcement.",

All Expenses incurred during each week of the GOB Sale (i.e. Sunday through Saturday) shall be paid by Agent to or on behalf of Merchant, or paid by Merchant and thereafter reimbursed by Agent as provided for herein; provided, however, in the event that the actual amount of an Expense is unavailable on the date of the reconciliation (such as payroll), Merchant and Agent shall agree to an estimate of such amounts, which amounts will be reconciled once the actual amount of such Expense becomes available. Agent and/or Merchant may review or audit the Expenses at any time.",

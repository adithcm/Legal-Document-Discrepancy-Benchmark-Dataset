Array shall notify Ono in writing within fifteen (15) Business Days after the achievement of each milestone set out in Section 6.2(a) by Array. Then, the corresponding milestone payment shall be due within thirty (30) days of receipt by Ono of an invoice for payment and the taxation documents delivered from Array. Ono shall notify Array in writing within fifteen (15) Business Days after the achievement of each milestone set out in Section 6.2(b) by Ono, or any of its Affiliates\n\n\n\nor Sublicensees. Then, the corresponding milestone payment shall be due within thirty (30) days of receipt by Ono of an invoice and the taxation documents delivered from Array. Any milestone payable by Ono pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be made only once with respect to the achievement of each milestone set out in Section 6.2(a) and Section\n\n\n\n6.2(b) above, regardless of subsequent or repeated achievement of such milestone event by any Product.",

Array shall notify Ono in writing within fifteen (15) Business Days after the achievement of each milestone set out in Section 6.2(a) by Array.

                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment deadline for milestone payments from 30 days to 60 days. The contract is between a company in Delaware, USA, and a company in Japan. Given that the payment is made in USD, US law applies here. While a 60-day payment term isn't *per se* illegal, it can be viewed as an unreasonably long delay, especially if it consistently puts the paying party beyond typical accounting cycles. This can potentially run afoul of good faith dealing requirements under contract law, especially UCC Article 2 if the payments are tied to sales of goods.",

Within forty five (45) days after the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the calendar quarter in which the First Commercial Sale occurs, Ono shall deliver to Array a report (each, a \"Royalty Report\") setting out all details necessary to calculate the payments due under this Section 6.3, including:\n\n(i) gross sales of the Product in the Ono Territory in the relevant calendar quarter on a country-by-country basis;\n\n(ii) Net Sales in the relevant calendar quarter on a country-by-country basis;\n\n(iii) all relevant exchange rate conversions in accordance with Section 7.2;\n\n(iv) all deductions in total in accordance with Sections 1.48 and 6.5; and\n\n(v) the amount of any payment due from Ono to Array, calculated in accordance with this Article 6.\n\nSimultaneously with the delivery of each such report, Ono shall pay to Array the total amounts due under Section 6.3 for the period covered by such report subject to Ono's receipt of taxation documents.",

                "explanation": "Extending the royalty report and payment deadline to 90 days after the end of each calendar quarter, while not inherently illegal, is an unreasonably long payment term that can breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. It is a red flag.",

Ono shall keep, and require its Affiliates and Sublicensees to keep, complete, true and accurate books of accounts and records for the purpose of determining the amounts payable to Array pursuant to this Agreement. Such books and records shall be kept for at least three (3) years following the end of the calendar quarter to which they pertain. Such records will be open for inspection during such three (3) year period by an independent certified public accounting firm of nationally (the US or Japan) recognized standing (the \"Auditor\"), chosen by Array and reasonably acceptable to Ono for the purpose of verifying the amounts payable by Ono hereunder. Such inspections may be made no more than once each Calendar Year, at reasonable times and on reasonable prior written notice. Such records for any particular calendar quarter shall be subject to no more than one inspection. The Auditor shall be obligated to execute a reasonable confidentiality agreement prior to commencing any such inspection. Inspections conducted under this Section 7.4 shall be at the expense of Array, unless a variation or error producing an underpayment in amounts payable exceeding [ * ] of the amount paid for a period covered by the inspection is established, in which case all reasonable costs relating to the inspection for such period and any unpaid amounts that are discovered shall be paid by Ono, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the rate set forth in Section 7.1 above. The Parties will endeavor in such inspection to minimize disruption of Ono's normal business activities to the extent reasonably practicable. For clarity, while Ono does not engage in the bundling of products as of the Effective Date, in the event that Ono elects in the future to provide a discount for the purchase of a bundle of products that includes a Product, or if its Affiliates or Sublicensees sell Product as part of said discounted bundle, such discount shall be allocated to Product, for purposes of this Agreement, based on the ratio, calculated on a quarterly basis, of Product sales to sales of all of Ono's products sold in the Ono Territory. It is understood that the foregoing audit rights shall include the right to have the Auditor verify Ono's compliance (and the compliance of its Affiliates and Sublicensees) with the above requirements.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the record-keeping period to one year and the inspection period to one year makes the audit rights nearly meaningless. This greatly harms Array's ability to verify royalties, which is the primary enforcement mechanism in this type of agreement. A one-year record retention period is insufficient for accurate audits and is against the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and it sets standards for financial recordkeeping and auditing.",

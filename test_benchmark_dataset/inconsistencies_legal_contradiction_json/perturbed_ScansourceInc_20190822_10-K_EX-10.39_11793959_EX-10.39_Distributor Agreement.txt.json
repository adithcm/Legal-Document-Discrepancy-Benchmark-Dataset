                "explanation": "Changing the training compliance period from 12 months to 24 months could be problematic if state or federal laws mandate annual training or updates on anti-corruption laws. This creates a contradiction by allowing a longer period than legally permissible for ensuring compliance and awareness of legal changes.",

The above-referenced cap shall be determined based on all Product purchases made under this Agreement. The responsibility to manage the Balancing Cap shall rest solely upon Distributor. Distributor shall be entitled to return Product once per quarter, provided such returns do not exceed the Balancing Cap. \"Dead on Arrival\" and Obsolete Products returned pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement shall be excluded from calculation of the Balancing Cap.

                "explanation": "Changing the return frequency from 'once per quarter' to 'once per year' may contradict industry-standard practices and potentially violate state-level franchise laws or distributor protection laws in states like South Carolina and California. Those laws usually mandate 'reasonable' return policies. Also, changing the credit to 50% can violate industry and fair-dealing laws. These adjustments introduce non-compliance with distributor protection regulations.",

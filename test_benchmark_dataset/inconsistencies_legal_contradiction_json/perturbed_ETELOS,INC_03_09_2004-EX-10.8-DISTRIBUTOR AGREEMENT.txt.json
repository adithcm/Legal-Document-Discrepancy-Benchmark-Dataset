                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.2 Tripath may discontinue manufacture or sale, or otherwise treat as obsolete, any or all of the Products covered by this Agreement upon thirty days written notice.",
                "changed_text": "1.2 Tripath may discontinue manufacture or sale, or otherwise treat as obsolete, any or all of the Products covered by this Agreement upon five days written notice.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for product discontinuation to five days is unreasonably short and contradicts general principles of contract law requiring reasonable notice for significant changes that affect a distributor's ability to operate. Thirty days is considered standard in the industry, but five days does not give the Distributor enough time to adjust.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding reasonable notice and good faith.",
                "location": "Section 1.2"

                "changed_text": "7.7 If Tripath notifies Distributor of any discrepancy in a credit request, Distributor has seven days to resolve the discrepancy and pay the amount of the discrepancy.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame to resolve credit discrepancies to seven days from one month places an undue burden on the distributor and can be deemed commercially unreasonable. It doesn't allow the distributor adequate time to investigate, gather evidence, and respond appropriately, thus being considered too short a timeframe.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles of reasonableness and fair dealing.",
                "location": "Section 7.7"

Sales data will include, without limitation, Product part number, quantity, resale price, special pricing, distributor invoice number, and customer name. Distributor will submit these reports electronically on a timely basis each month and in no case later than two weeks after the beginning of the month.",
                "changed_text": "11.1 Distributor will submit reports as may be reasonably requested by Tripath, including, without limitation, monthly reports of inventory on hand and sales relating to the Products. Sales data will include, without limitation, Product part number, quantity, resale price, special pricing, distributor invoice number, and customer name. Distributor will submit these reports electronically on a timely basis each month and in no case later than one day after the beginning of the month.",
                "explanation": "Requiring the distributor to submit comprehensive sales and inventory reports within one day of the month's beginning is an unreasonably tight deadline. This requirement may be difficult or impossible to meet, particularly for smaller distributors with limited administrative resources. This is against general contract law principles of good faith and reasonableness. This action can impede day to day operations",

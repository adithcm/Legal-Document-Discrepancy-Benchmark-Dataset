                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be deemed a contract made under and shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Actions arising out of this Agreement may only be resolved through binding arbitration to be held in New York City, New York.",
                "explanation": "The original contract specifies Texas law and Harris County courts for dispute resolution. The modification changes the governing law to Delaware and mandates binding arbitration in New York City. This introduces several potential inconsistencies. First, Delaware law may have different interpretations of contract provisions compared to Texas law, creating uncertainty. Second, forcing arbitration in New York City, rather than allowing litigation in Texas courts, as initially agreed, may increase costs and inconvenience for the parties, especially if they are based in Texas, conflicting with standard legal expectations of convenient forum selection. Binding arbitration clauses may also conflict with state laws regarding access to courts and jury trials.",

                "original_text": "Prime will, during the term of the Credit Agreement, maintain liquidity consisting of unused revolver availability\" under the Credit Agreement dated  December!, 2002, as amended, with Prime et aland Guaranty, and/or unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $25,000,000. This required liquidity\"  win reduce dollar-for-dollar with any additional shareholder advance s and increase dollar-for-dollar to a maximum of $21,000,000 with any  repayment of shareholder advances. To the extent that shareholder repayment has occurred, Prime agrees to fund additional shareholder loans  equal to the amount repayed by the shareholder, as needed to ensure Project Clomp let ion",
                "changed_text": "Prime will maintain liquidity at its discretion, based on its internal assessment of market conditions. There is no fixed amount for required liquidity, and this obligation may be waived by Prime at any time without prior notice to Guaranty. Prime is not obligated to fund additional shareholder loans even if shareholder repayment has occurred.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires Prime to maintain a minimum liquidity of $25,000,000, adjustable based on shareholder advances/repayments. The modification removes the fixed amount and gives Prime complete discretion over liquidity maintenance. This could violate banking regulations or lending agreements that require borrowers to maintain certain financial ratios or liquidity levels. Furthermore, waiving the liquidity requirement without notice undermines the purpose of the liquidity maintenance clause, which is to protect Guaranty's investment.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall automatically terminate six months from the effective date, regardless of Project Completion status. Prime's obligations to Guaranty, including funding commitments, will cease upon termination, even if Project Completion is not achieved.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement ties its duration to the completion of the project. The modified version sets a fixed termination date (six months), irrespective of the project's status. This directly contradicts the purpose of the agreement, which is to ensure project completion. It could render the entire agreement unenforceable if it's impossible to complete the project within six months, effectively releasing Prime from its obligations prematurely and potentially harming Guaranty's interests, contradicting the original intent and implied duty of good faith.",

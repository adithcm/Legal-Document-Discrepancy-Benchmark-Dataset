                "original_text": "Not later than the fifteenth (15th) calendar day of each calendar quarter (or the first business day thereafter), Licensee shall deliver to Licensor (i) a report accurately showing Gross Revenues of the Licensee for the previous quarter, the number of Subscribers on the last day of such previous quarter and the amount of Royalties due thereon, and (ii) payment of the Royalties payable for such previous quarterbased on the Subscriber information as reflected in the report.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates royalty reports and payments within 15 days of the end of each quarter. The modification extends this deadline to the last day of the subsequent quarter, potentially conflicting with state laws requiring more prompt payment schedules and reporting, ensuring licensors get proper and punctual reports. Nevada law requires parties to perform contractual obligations in good faith and can imply reasonable timelines for performance.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires a 90-day notice for non-renewal. The modification reduces this to 30 days, which may be insufficient under certain state franchise laws or other regulations that require longer notification periods to protect the interests of parties in ongoing commercial relationships. This is especially true if the agreement is interpreted as a franchise under Nevada law, which can require more extensive notice periods.",

                "explanation": "The original text enforces a five-year confidentiality period post-termination. The modification reduces this to one year, potentially inadequate for trade secrets or other highly sensitive information.

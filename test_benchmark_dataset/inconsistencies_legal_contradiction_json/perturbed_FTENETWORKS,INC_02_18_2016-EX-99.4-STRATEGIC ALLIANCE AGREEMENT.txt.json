                "changed_text": "After the Initial Term, this Agreement shall continue on a month to month basis until terminated by either party upon ten (10) days prior written notice to the other setting forth the effective date of such termination.",
                "explanation": "In Texas, for certain commercial agreements, a 30-day notice period is considered a standard reasonable timeframe. Reducing the notice period to 10 days may be deemed unreasonable and could lead to legal challenges, conflicting with general contract law principles requiring reasonable notice.",

                "explanation": "Texas law provides specific timelines for addressing mechanic's liens. Requiring a subcontractor to discharge a lien or furnish an indemnity bond within two days may be an unreasonably short timeframe, potentially conflicting with their legal rights and ability to adequately respond to the lien claim, thus creating a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the time for a Subcontractor to remove the filing after the original period to one day, creates an unreasonable burden on the Subcontractor that the filing is not removed. This is not enough time and would create a legal challenge because it conflicts with the Subcontractor's right to defense.",

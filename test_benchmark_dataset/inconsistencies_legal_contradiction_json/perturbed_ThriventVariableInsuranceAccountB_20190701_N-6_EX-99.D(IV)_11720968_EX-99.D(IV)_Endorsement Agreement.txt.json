                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "If you do not make the extra payment within 15 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the payment period to 15 days may not provide sufficient time for the member to understand the deficiency and arrange for payment, potentially conflicting with state laws requiring reasonable notice and opportunity to cure before adverse actions are taken on financial contracts. The Wisconsin Consumer Act, for example, requires reasonable opportunity to cure defaults.",

                "changed_text": "You may transfer ownership of this contract only with the Society's express written consent, which may be withheld for any reason. Society membership rights and privileges cannot be transferred or assigned.",
                "explanation": "Granting the Society unlimited discretion to deny transfer of ownership could conflict with state laws that protect the free transferability of property and contracts, unless there are specific, legitimate reasons for restricting transfer. Such an unrestricted clause may be deemed unconscionable or an unreasonable restraint on alienation in some jurisdictions.",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws regarding the free transferability of property and contracts, unconscionability doctrines.",

                "original_text": "Each year, we will determine our divisible surplus. This contract's share, if any, will be credited as a dividend. Since we do not expect this contract to contribute to divisible surplus, it is not expected that any dividends will be credited.",
                "changed_text": "Dividends, if any, will be determined and distributed at the sole discretion of the Society. The Society is under no obligation to declare or pay any dividends.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the language about 'divisible surplus' and states that dividends are purely discretionary. This may violate state laws requiring fair and equitable treatment of policyholders regarding dividends for participating policies. Fraternal benefit societies often have specific regulations regarding the distribution of surplus to members.",

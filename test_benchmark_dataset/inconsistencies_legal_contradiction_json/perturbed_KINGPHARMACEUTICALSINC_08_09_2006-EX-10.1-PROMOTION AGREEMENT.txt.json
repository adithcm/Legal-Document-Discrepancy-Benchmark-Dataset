                "original_text": "Each party shall notify the other: (i) of all Serious Adverse Drug Experience Reports within forty-eight (48) hours of the time such Serious Adverse Drug Experience Report becomes known to such party (including its employees); and (ii) of all Adverse Drug Experience Reports within five (5) calendar days of the time such Adverse Drug Experience Report becomes known to such party (including its employees).",
                "changed_text": "Each party shall notify the other: (i) of all Serious Adverse Drug Experience Reports within seventy-two (72) hours of the time such Serious Adverse Drug Experience Report becomes known to such party (including its employees); and (ii) of all Adverse Drug Experience Reports within ten (10) calendar days of the time such Adverse Drug Experience Report becomes known to such party (including its employees).",
                "explanation": "The original text requires notification of Serious Adverse Drug Experience Reports within 48 hours and Adverse Drug Experience Reports within 5 days. FDA regulations (21 CFR 314.80) mandate expedited reporting of serious and unexpected adverse drug experiences, but the specific reporting timeframe may vary (often 15 calendar days for serious, unexpected events). Delaying the reporting timeframe to 72 hours and 10 days respectively introduces non-compliance with regulatory expectations for prompt reporting, particularly for serious events.",

                "original_text": "Each party agrees that the other party is entitled to seek, in addition to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, preliminary and permanent injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent or curtail any breach of this Agreement by the other party; provided, however, that no specification in this Agreement of a specific legal or equitable remedy will be construed as a waiver or prohibition against the pursuing of other legal or equitable remedies in the event of such a breach.",
                "changed_text": "Each party agrees that the other party is entitled to seek only monetary damages for any breach of this Agreement by the other party, and waives any right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief. There is no entitlement for preliminary or permanent injunctive relief or any equitable remedies.",
                "explanation": "By explicitly waiving the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, the modified text limits the remedies available to the parties in the event of a breach. This may conflict with legal principles that allow parties to seek equitable relief where monetary damages are insufficient, potentially rendering the clause unenforceable under general contract law principles and potentially violating state laws that provide for equitable remedies in certain situations.",

                "original_text": "King will not make any false or misleading representations to Professionals, customers or others regarding Depomed or the Product and will not make any representations, warranties or guarantees with respect to the specifications, features or capabilities of the Product that are not consistent with the applicable then-current FDA approved labeling, package insert or other documentation accompanying or describing the Product, including Depomed's standard limited warranty and disclaimers. King agrees to undertake timely and complete corrective action for any deviations from this Section 4.2, subject to discussion and review by Depomed's regulatory affairs and quality assurance department.",
                "changed_text": "King may make representations to Professionals and customers regarding Depomed or the Product as King deems appropriate, provided such representations are made in good faith and without intent to deceive. King is not obligated to adhere strictly to the FDA-approved labeling and may provide additional information or assurances as necessary to promote sales. King will undertake corrective action for any deviations from this Section 4.2 only upon Depomed's explicit written request.",
                "explanation": "Allowing King to make representations as they deem appropriate and not strictly adhering to FDA-approved labeling can lead to off-label promotion and false or misleading statements. Furthermore, the clause weakens the obligation for corrective action, making it contingent on Depomed's explicit request. These changes may violate federal regulations on pharmaceutical marketing and promotion, specifically those prohibiting the promotion of drugs for uses not approved by the FDA.",

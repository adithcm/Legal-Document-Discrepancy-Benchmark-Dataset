                "original_text": "MediWound shall have the right, for a period of [***] days following receipt, to reject any Bromelain SP sample which:\n\n6.4.1 fails to comply with MediWound's purchase order; or\n\n6.4.2 fails to comply with the sample incoming inspection Specifications.\n\nWithin the said [***] days, MediWound shall notify CBC of either: (i) its approval and acceptance of such batch sample (\"Acceptance Sample Notice\"); or (ii) its rejection of the batch sample in which case MediWound shall detail the reason(s) for the rejection of any such Bromelain SP sample. In the event of rejection by MediWound, CBC shall deliver complying Bromelain SP sample to MediWound within [***] days of rejection, free of cost (including transportation, duty, handling and insurance costs). For clarification purposes, MediWound's Acceptance Sample Notice in accordance with this section above shall in no event derogate from CBC's responsibilities hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "MediWound shall have the right, for a period of 5 days following receipt, to reject any Bromelain SP sample which:\n\n6.4.1 fails to comply with MediWound's purchase order; or\n\n6.4.2 fails to comply with the sample incoming inspection Specifications.\n\nWithin the said 5 days, MediWound shall notify CBC of either: (i) its approval and acceptance of such batch sample (\"Acceptance Sample Notice\"); or (ii) its rejection of the batch sample in which case MediWound shall detail the reason(s) for the rejection of any such Bromelain SP sample. In the event of rejection by MediWound, CBC shall deliver complying Bromelain SP sample to MediWound within 60 days of rejection, free of cost (including transportation, duty, handling and insurance costs). For clarification purposes, MediWound's Acceptance Sample Notice in accordance with this section above shall in no event derogate from CBC's responsibilities hereunder.",
                "explanation": "The original contract allows a certain timeframe for MediWound to reject Bromelain SP samples and for CBC to deliver complying samples after rejection. By reducing MediWound's rejection timeframe to 5 days, it may be insufficient for thorough quality control testing, potentially violating quality standards required by regulations like cGMP. Extending CBC's delivery timeframe to 60 days contradicts standard pharmaceutical supply chain practices, where prompt replacement of non-conforming materials is essential to maintain production schedules and regulatory compliance.",

MediWound shall have the right, for a period of [***] days following receipt, to reject any Bromelain SP batch which:\n\n6.4.3 fails to comply with MediWound's purchase order; or\n\n6.4.4 fails to comply with the batch incoming inspection Specifications.\n\nWithin the said [***] days, MediWound shall notify CBC of either: (i) its approval and acceptance of such batch (\"Acceptance Batch Notice\"); or (ii) its rejection of the batch in which case MediWound shall detail the reason(s) for the rejection of any such Bromelain SP batch. In the event of rejection by MediWound, at CBC's request and expense, MediWound shall return any such Bromelain SP batch to CBC and CBC shall deliver complying Bromelain SP batch to MediWound within [***] days of rejection, free of cost (including transportation, duty, handling and insurance costs). For clarification purposes, MediWound's Acceptance Batch Notice in accordance with this section above shall in no event derogate from CBC's responsibilities hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "After CBC receives MediWound's Acceptance Sample Notice, CBC shall deliver the corresponding batch to MediWound for inspection and approval.

In the event of rejection by MediWound, at CBC's request and expense, MediWound shall return any such Bromelain SP batch to CBC and CBC shall deliver complying Bromelain SP batch to MediWound within 90 days of rejection, free of cost (including transportation, duty, handling and insurance costs). For clarification purposes, MediWound's Acceptance Batch Notice in accordance with this section above shall in no event derogate from CBC's responsibilities hereunder.",
                "explanation": "The original contract specifies a timeframe for MediWound to reject a Bromelain SP batch upon receipt and for CBC to deliver a complying batch after rejection. Shortening the rejection period to 2 days is insufficient for thorough inspection and testing required by cGMP. Extending the delivery period for a complying batch to 90 days introduces a significant delay, contradicting pharmaceutical regulations that require timely supply of materials and adherence to production schedules.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement provides a 90-day cure period for breaches of contract, which is a reasonable timeframe for addressing significant issues. Reducing the cure period and termination notice period to just 10 days may be deemed commercially unreasonable, especially for complex breaches requiring substantial investigation and corrective action. This shortened timeframe could conflict with principles of contract law that require parties to act in good faith and provide reasonable opportunities to remedy breaches.",

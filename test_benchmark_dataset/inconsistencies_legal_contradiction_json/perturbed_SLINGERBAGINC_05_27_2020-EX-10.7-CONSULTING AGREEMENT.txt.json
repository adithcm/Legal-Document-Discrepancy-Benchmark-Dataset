                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All subsequent monthly payments of Base Consulting Fee shall be paid within the first five days of the following calendar month.",
                "changed_text": "All subsequent monthly payments of Base Consulting Fee shall be paid within 60 days of the following calendar month.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates payment within the first five days of the following month. The modified text delays this to 60 days, potentially violating state wage payment laws (e.g., New York Labor Law) that require prompt payment of wages or consulting fees, often much sooner than 60 days.",

                "original_text": "The Company may terminate Consultant's engagement at any time by giving Consultant 60 days prior written Notice of the termination.",
                "changed_text": "The Company may terminate Consultant's engagement at any time by giving Consultant 14 days prior written Notice of the termination.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 60-day notice period for termination without cause. Reducing this to 14 days could violate implied contract terms or reasonable notice requirements under state law, especially considering the consultant's role and the agreement's three-year term. Courts may deem 14 days insufficient, making the termination clause potentially unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied contract law and state-specific employment law regarding reasonable notice periods.",
                "location": "ARTICLE 4 TERMINATION 4.1 Termination of Engagement (a)(ii)"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Upon the termination (whether for cause, disability, death, without cause, or by way of change of control), the Company shall pay to Consultant on the date required under applicable law: (i) any accrued but unpaid Base Consulting Fee for services rendered as of the date of termination, (ii) (if applicable) any accrued but unpaid vacation pay, and (iii) the business expenses reasonably incurred by the Consultant up to the date of termination or resignation and properly reimbursable, in each case less any applicable deductions or withholdings required by law.",
                "changed_text": "Upon the termination (whether for cause, disability, death, without cause, or by way of change of control), the Company shall pay to Consultant within 90 days of termination: (i) any accrued but unpaid Base Consulting Fee for services rendered as of the date of termination, (ii) (if applicable) any accrued but unpaid vacation pay, and (iii) the business expenses reasonably incurred by the Consultant up to the date of termination or resignation and properly reimbursable, in each case less any applicable deductions or withholdings required by law.",
                "explanation": "The original text adheres to the 'date required under applicable law'. Changing 'on the date required under applicable law' to 'within 90 days of termination' contradicts many state wage laws that mandate final payment of wages (including accrued consulting fees and vacation pay) much sooner than 90 days after termination. This delay violates legal requirements for prompt payment.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York Labor Law ยง 191 requiring prompt payment of final wages.",

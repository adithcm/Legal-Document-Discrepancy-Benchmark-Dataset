                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Distributor will also keep Hydraspin informed as to any problems encountered with any of the Products. Hydraspin will repair or replace all defective or damaged Products at the time of delivery at its sole cost and expense.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will also keep Hydraspin informed as to any problems encountered with any of the Products. Hydraspin will, at its discretion, repair or replace defective or damaged Products within a 'commercially reasonable' timeframe, with Distributor to cover 75% of the costs.",
                "explanation": "This modification contradicts established warranty laws. By shifting a significant portion of the repair/replacement costs to the Distributor and using a vague 'commercially reasonable' timeframe, Hydraspin is attempting to circumvent implied warranty obligations that typically require the seller (Hydraspin) to bear the full cost of repairing or replacing defective goods within a reasonable period. This would place an undue burden on the distributor in violation of commercial and consumer protection laws.",

                "original_text": "If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity within ten (10) business days of the date the opportunity is presented to Distributor, Hydraspin shall have no obligation to enter into a contract with Distributor regarding the new territory.",
                "changed_text": "If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity within two (2) business days of the date the opportunity is presented to Distributor, Hydraspin shall have no obligation to enter into a contract with Distributor regarding the new territory.",
                "explanation": "The modified text shortens the negotiation period for exclusivity terms in a new territory from 10 business days to just 2. This creates a potential contradiction with good faith negotiation requirements, especially if the distributor needs more time to assess the viability of the new territory. A very short timeframe could be deemed unreasonable, violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in contract law. Texas law requires parties to act in good faith.",

                "original_text": "Upon expiration of the Initial Term of this Agreement, this Agreement will automatically renew for additional, successive five (5) year periods unless either Party provides the other Party written notice of its desire to terminate at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any renewal.",
                "changed_text": "Upon expiration of the Initial Term of this Agreement, this Agreement will automatically renew for additional, successive five (5) year periods unless either Party provides the other Party written notice of its desire to terminate at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any renewal.",
                "explanation": "The change reduces the notice period required to prevent automatic renewal from 120 days to 30 days. While not directly illegal, a 30-day notice period for a substantial five-year renewal may be deemed unconscionably short under Texas law, especially considering the potential investment and reliance the distributor may have placed on the agreement. A longer notice period is typically considered commercially reasonable, and a shorter period could be seen as giving undue advantage to one party, potentially violating principles of fairness and good faith. There should be sufficient time for each party to consider whether they would like to renew or terminate the agreement.",

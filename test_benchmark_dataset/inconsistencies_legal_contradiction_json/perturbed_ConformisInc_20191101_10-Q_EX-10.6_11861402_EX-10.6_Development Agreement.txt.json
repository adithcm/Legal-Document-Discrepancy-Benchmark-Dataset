                "original_text": "If such alleged material breach is not remedied in the time period set forth above, the Party alleging material breach shall refer the matter to the chief executive officers of each Party, who shall meet and confer within [**] after notice from the non-breaching Party of its desire for such a meeting. If the Parties are unable to resolve any dispute in such meeting and no Action has been brought in accordance with Section 10.8 with respect to such dispute, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon delivery to the defaulting Party of a Termination Notice.",
                "changed_text": "If such alleged material breach is not remedied, the Party alleging material breach shall immediately terminate this agreement with no cure period or chance to meet.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by removing the cure period and the obligation for executives to meet and confer. Many jurisdictions mandate a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach of contract before termination can occur. By eliminating this opportunity, the contract becomes non-compliant with standard legal practices regarding contract termination and dispute resolution.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts standard payment terms that were agreed upon. By unilaterally extending the payment deadline, Stryker is violating the original contract agreement. Also, some state and federal laws mandates a business needs to pay the vendor in 30 days time frame.",

                "explanation": "This change imposes a short, inflexible redelivery period. If a breach occurs with a product issue, Conformis may need more than 5 days to solve the problem.

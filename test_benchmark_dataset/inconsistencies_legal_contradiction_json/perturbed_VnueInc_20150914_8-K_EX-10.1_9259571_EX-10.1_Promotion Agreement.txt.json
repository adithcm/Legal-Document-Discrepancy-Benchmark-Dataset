                "explanation": "The payment term has been extended to ninety (90) days, potentially conflicting with state laws regarding prompt payment to independent contractors. Some states require payment within a shorter timeframe, such as 30 days, and Nevada law does not permit the delay in payment to a contractor. This change introduces non-compliance by delaying payment beyond what is considered reasonable or legally permissible.",

Promoter shall deliver to VNUE an itemized accounting of expenses incurred on a weekly basis, and VNUE shall reimburse Promoter within Ninety (90) Days of receipt of such accounting.",
                "explanation": "Changing the reimbursement timeframe from thirty (30) days to ninety (90) days may violate state laws requiring prompt payment of expenses to independent contractors. Some states mandate quicker expense reimbursements, and a 90-day delay could be deemed unreasonable or illegal.",

At any time prior to the end of the Term, the Parties may agree in writing to extend the Agreement for successive One (1) Year periods (the \"Renewal Terms\") under the same conditions set forth herein.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall commence on September 10, 2015 and shall continue for One (1) Year (the \"Term\"). The agreement will renew indefinitely unless either party provides a 14-day notice of termination.",
                "explanation": "By making the agreement automatically renew indefinitely with only a 14-day termination notice, this conflicts with standard contract law principles requiring reasonable notice periods for termination, especially considering the investment the Promoter will put in. Reasonable notice periods, depending on the industry and investment, are typically 30-90 days. A short 14-day notice could be deemed unconscionable or violate good faith and fair dealing principles.",

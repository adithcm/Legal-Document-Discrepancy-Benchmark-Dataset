                "original_text": "3.2 In the event that the consideration is not paid by Hydron on or before the applicable payment due date, said failure to pay shall be considered a material breach by Hydron, and the Dolphins may elect to charge Hydron a late fee of 1.5% per month of the payment then due and owing until it is paid in full. The Dolphins agree to provide written notice to Hydron of the failure to receive any payment, and Hydron shall have a five (5) business day period following delivery of written notice in which to cure the payment default before the Dolphins may elect to terminate this Agreement and pursue applicable remedies.",
                "changed_text": "3.2 In the event that the consideration is not paid by Hydron on or before the applicable payment due date, said failure to pay shall be considered a material breach by Hydron, and the Dolphins may elect to charge Hydron a late fee of 5% per month of the payment then due and owing until it is paid in full. The Dolphins agree to provide written notice to Hydron of the failure to receive any payment, and Hydron shall have a two (2) business day period following delivery of written notice in which to cure the payment default before the Dolphins may elect to terminate this Agreement and pursue applicable remedies.",
                "explanation": "Florida law restricts the maximum interest rate that can be charged on certain debts. By increasing the late fee to 5% per month, the contract exceeds the allowable limits, potentially constituting usury. Shortening the cure period to two business days is unreasonable and might conflict with standard commercial practices, making it difficult for Hydron to rectify the default within the given timeframe.",

                "original_text": "8.1(a) Without prejudice to any other rights, the Dolphins shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Hydron if Hydron fails to perform or comply with any term or condition of this Agreement within five (5) business days following delivery of written notice for a payment default or within thirty (30) days following written notice of any other breach of this Agreement sent to Hydron stating such failure or failures; provided that any such failure remains uncured at the end of such period.",
                "changed_text": "8.1(a) Without prejudice to any other rights, the Dolphins shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Hydron if Hydron fails to perform or comply with any term or condition of this Agreement within one (1) business day following delivery of written notice for any breach of this Agreement sent to Hydron stating such failure or failures; provided that any such failure remains uncured at the end of such period.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for any breach to just one business day is highly unreasonable and likely unenforceable under general contract law principles. It does not provide sufficient time for Hydron to address and rectify any potential breach, irrespective of its nature or complexity. This change creates a scenario where even minor or easily resolvable breaches could lead to immediate termination, conflicting with principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

Jurisdiction and venue for any legal proceedings arising out of this Agreement shall exclusively lie in the state and federal courts situate in Broward County, Florida.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement specifies Florida law, appropriate given the principal offices of both parties are in Florida. Changing the governing law to California while maintaining venue in Florida creates a conflict of laws issue. California and Florida have different legal precedents and statutes, which could lead to confusion and legal challenges in interpreting and enforcing the contract. A Florida court would generally apply Florida's choice-of-law rules to determine which state's law governs, but the contractual provision adds uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "Within [***] after the Effective Date, the Parties shall establish a joint governance committee (the \"Joint Governance Committee\" or \"JGC\"). The JGC shall consist of [***] representatives from each of the Parties, each with the requisite experience and seniority to enable such person to make decisions on behalf of the Parties with respect to the issues falling within the jurisdiction of the JGC. From time to time, each Party may substitute [***] or more of its representatives to the JGC on written notice to the other Party. [***] shall select from its representatives the chairperson for the JGC. From time to time, [***]",
                "changed_text": "Within [***] after the Effective Date, the Parties shall establish a joint governance committee (the \"Joint Governance Committee\" or \"JGC\"). The JGC shall consist of [***] representatives from each of the Parties, each with the requisite experience and seniority to enable such person to make decisions on behalf of the Parties with respect to the issues falling within the jurisdiction of the JGC. Each Party may only replace a representative on the JGC in the event of death or incapacitation of the representative. [***] shall select from its representatives the chairperson for the JGC. From time to time, [***]",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a legal inconsistency by unduly restricting a party's ability to change its representatives on the JGC. Under standard contract law principles, such restrictions must be reasonable and not impose undue hardship. Preventing a party from replacing a representative for any reason other than death or incapacitation could hinder its ability to effectively participate in the JGC, thereby creating a legal vulnerability.",

The Parties shall agree on the minutes of each meeting promptly, but in no event later than the next meeting of the JGC.",
                "changed_text": "The chairperson of the JGC shall prepare and circulate for review and approval of the Parties minutes of each meeting within [***] after the meeting. The chairperson may discard any feedback from the other party, and the minutes will be considered correct if they are not challenged within 24 hours.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a potential for disputes and inconsistencies. By allowing the chairperson to unilaterally determine the content of the minutes and setting an unreasonably short challenge period, it contradicts standard contract law principles that require good faith and fair dealing. This is further compounded by regulations and case law relating to corporate governance which emphasizes the importance of accurate record-keeping and transparency.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction because it gives AbbVie the unilateral right to extend the License Option Period indefinitely, undermining the defined timeline and creating uncertainty. This violates contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms and could be deemed unenforceable for lack of mutuality. In this case, if they choose not to extend the date, Harpoon shall have no further obligations to perform any Initial Development Activities, which is contradictory to Abbvie having the right to perform.

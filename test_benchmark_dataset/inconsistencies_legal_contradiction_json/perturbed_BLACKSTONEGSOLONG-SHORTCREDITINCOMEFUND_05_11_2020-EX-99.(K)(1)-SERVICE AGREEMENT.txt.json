                "original_text": "All amounts owed to Agent hereunder are due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Delinquent payments are subject to a late payment charge of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month commencing sixty (60) days from the invoice date.",
                "changed_text": "All amounts owed to Agent hereunder are due within sixty (60) days of the invoice date. Delinquent payments are subject to a late payment charge of two percent (2%) per month commencing thirty (30) days from the invoice date.",

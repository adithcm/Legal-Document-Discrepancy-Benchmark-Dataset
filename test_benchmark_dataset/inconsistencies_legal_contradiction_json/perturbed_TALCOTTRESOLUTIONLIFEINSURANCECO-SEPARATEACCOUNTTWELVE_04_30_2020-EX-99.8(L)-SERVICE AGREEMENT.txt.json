The Fund will also provide the Administrator with account positions and activity data using the NSCC's Networking platform. The Administrator shall pay for Fund shares by the scheduled close of federal funds transmissions on the same Business Day it places an order to purchase Fund shares in accordance with this section using the NSCC's Fund/SERV System. Payment shall be in federal funds transmitted by wire from the Fund's designated Settling Bank to the NSCC.",
                "changed_text": "The Fund will receive all orders to purchase Fund shares using the NSCC's Defined Contribution Clearance & Settlement (\"DCC&S\") platform. The Fund will also provide the Administrator with account positions and activity data using the NSCC's Networking platform. The Administrator shall pay for Fund shares within five (5) Business Days of the order being placed. Payment shall be made via company check.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts standard payment processing timelines required by the SEC and federal banking regulations for mutual fund transactions. Requiring payment within five business days is significantly longer than the standard settlement timelines typically mandated, creating a delay that could violate regulations concerning timely settlement and net asset value calculations. Payment also must be made via company check which can create additional delays.",

                "original_text": "Payment for Fund shares redeemed shall be made in accordance with this section using the NSCC's Fund/SERV System. Payment shall be in federal funds transmitted by the NSCC to the Separate Account's Settling Bank as designated by the Administrator, on the same Business Day the Fund or the underwriter receives notice of the redemption order from the Administrator provided that the Fund or the underwriter receives notice by 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on such Business Day.",
                "changed_text": "Payment for Fund shares redeemed shall be made at the Fund's discretion, no more than thirty (30) calendar days after the redemption order is received. Payment will be made via standard mail.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly alters the legally required timeframe for processing redemptions of fund shares. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations mandate that mutual funds must typically process redemptions and transmit payments within one or two business days. Delaying payment up to thirty days and delivering the payment via mail violates these regulations, potentially harming investors. Also, the payment is at the discretion of the fund.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall terminate (a) at the option of any party, upon 90 days' advance written notice to the other parties hereto; or (b) in the event of a material breach that has not been cured within ten days following a written notice of breach to the breaching party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall terminate (a) at the option of any party, upon 15 days' advance written notice to the other parties hereto; or (b) in the event of a material breach that has not been cured within one day following a written notice of breach to the breaching party.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts standard contract law practices by substantially reducing the advance notice period required for termination and the cure period for material breaches. Depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the services provided, a 15-day notice period may be deemed unreasonably short, particularly given the complexity and financial implications of the service agreement. Likewise, a one-day cure period for a material breach is an unrealistically short timeframe to remedy significant issues, and depending on the issues can be viewed as not giving the other party adequate time to address the breach. This makes the agreement unreasonable.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding reasonable notice and cure periods; potential violation of state laws governing fair business practices and contract enforceability.",

                "original_text": "PSS agrees that it will publish such results as promptly as practicable following the Merger in the sole discretion of PSS, but in any event within 45 days after the end of the first fiscal quarter of PSS containing the required period of post-Merger combined operations and that it will notify the undersigned promptly following such publication.",
                "changed_text": "PSS will publish such results within 90 days after the end of the first fiscal year of PSS containing the required period of post-Merger combined operations and will notify the undersigned within 180 days following such publication. The decision to publish is at the discretion of PSS.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 45-day timeframe for publishing post-merger financial results after the first fiscal quarter, which provides a degree of certainty to the affiliate shareholders. The modified text extends this period to 90 days after the end of the fiscal *year*, significantly delaying the availability of this information and contradicting SEC guidelines and best practices for timely financial disclosures. Extending the notification period to 180 days introduces further ambiguity and potential delays in informing shareholders. It also violates general fiduciary duties and corporate governance principles requiring transparency and timely disclosure of material information to shareholders.",

                "original_text": "During the 30 days immediately preceding the Effective Time of the Merger, the undersigned has not sold, transfered, or otherwise disposed of his interests in, or reduced his risk relative to, any of the shares of GSMS Common Stock beneficially owned by the undersigned as of the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the Shareholders' Meeting of GSMS held to approve the Merger.",
                "changed_text": "During the 5 days immediately preceding the Effective Time of the Merger, the undersigned has not sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of his interests in, or reduced his risk relative to, any of the shares of GSMS Common Stock beneficially owned by the undersigned as of the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the Shareholders' Meeting of GSMS held to approve the Merger.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the period to 5 days may not provide sufficient time to detect potential insider trading or market manipulation activities that could affect the fairness and legality of the merger transaction. SEC regulations and securities laws often require a more extended look-back period to ensure compliance and prevent abuses related to material non-public information.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the reporting period from three years to one year limits the availability of public information necessary for the affiliates to comply with Rule 145(d) when transferring shares. This contradicts the intent and purpose of securities regulations designed to ensure transparency and adequate information for investors. The three-year period is a standard duration considering statute of limitations and audit review windows for financial transactions.",

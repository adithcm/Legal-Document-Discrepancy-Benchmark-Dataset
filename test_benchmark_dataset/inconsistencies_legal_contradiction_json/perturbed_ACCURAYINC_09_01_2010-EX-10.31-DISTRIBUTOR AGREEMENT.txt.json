An irrevocable trade finance letter of credit issued by Distributor's bank, confirmed by a bank  designated by Accuray in all respects and delivered to Accuray upon the acceptance of the Purchase Order  by Accuray. The letter of credit will provide that Accuray can draw against the letter of credit according to the  following schedule:\n\n5.4.1.1.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied  to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase  Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment  date; and\n\n5.4.1.1.2.

                "explanation": "Changing the deposit to be forfeited upon cancellation and shortening the timeframe to one month before shipment could be deemed unreasonable and potentially violate good faith and fair dealing principles, which are implied in many jurisdictions' contract law, especially if the cancellation occurs due to unforeseen circumstances or events outside the distributor's control. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, such a non-refundable and forfeiture clause could be challenged as a penalty clause, particularly if it is disproportionate to the actual damages suffered by Accuray as a result of the cancellation.",

Distributor",
                "explanation": "Reducing the warranty period to 30 days post-installation and capping it at 45 days post-shipment, and shrinking the installation notification time to 5 days, creates a high risk of rendering the warranty practically useless, especially for complex medical equipment. This change could be viewed as unconscionable and against public policy, violating consumer protection laws in jurisdictions that require reasonable warranties for such products. Additionally, the limited timeframe may contradict implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, making the contract vulnerable to legal challenges.",

                "changed_text": "Each driver will have a set amount of time (e.g. 2 seconds) to accept or reject the order, or the order will automatically be rejected by time and the lack of response will be recorded for future reference/internal driver ranking in the future.",
                "explanation": "Limiting the driver's response time to 2 seconds may create an unsafe working condition for drivers who may be driving when an order is received. This may violate Washington state labor laws related to safety and reasonable working conditions.",

                "explanation": "If the agreement was signed in February 11th, 2020, mandating completion of milestones that are in the past, specifically December 1st, 2018 and January 1st, 2019, is clearly inconsistent and would not be legally enforceable. This contradicts fundamental contract law principles of feasibility and mutual agreement. The client is being binded to completing tasks before the contract was written.",

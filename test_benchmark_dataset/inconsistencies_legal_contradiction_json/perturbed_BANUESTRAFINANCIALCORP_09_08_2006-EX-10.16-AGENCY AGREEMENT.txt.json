                "changed_text": "The Company and the Agent shall transmit all funds received from subscribers to the Escrow Agent within five business days following receipt thereof.",
                "explanation": "This change violates SEC Rule 15c2-4, which requires funds received from subscribers to be promptly transmitted to the escrow agent, typically interpreted as by the end of the next business day.",

Any out-of-pocket expenses or commissions payable under this Agreement shall be paid in next day funds on the earlier of the initial Closing Date or a determination by the Company to terminate or abandon the Offering, and on each subsequent Closing Date thereafter.",

Any out-of-pocket expenses or commissions payable under this Agreement shall be paid within 30 days of the initial Closing Date or a determination by the Company to terminate or abandon the Offering, and on each subsequent Closing Date thereafter.",
                "explanation": "This change alters the payment timeframe for expenses and commissions from 'next day funds' to 'within 30 days'. Such a delay in payment can violate regulations requiring prompt payment of earned commissions and expenses, particularly if such payments are deemed wages or compensation under applicable state laws (e.g., Georgia wage payment laws).",

                "explanation": "Changing the refund requirement to occur at the 'Company's discretion' directly contradicts SEC regulations and NASD rules regarding the handling of escrowed funds in contingent offerings. Funds must be promptly returned to investors if the contingency is not met by the specified date. The modified text introduces uncertainty and potential violation of investor protection rules.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Compensation Options will be exercisable for a period of 24 months at the Offering Price.",
                "changed_text": "The Compensation Options will be exercisable for a period of 6 months at the Offering Price.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the exercisable period of the Compensation Options to 6 months may conflict with standard market practices and investor expectations, potentially violating regulations related to fair dealing and adequate consideration in securities offerings. A shorter exercise period may be deemed unreasonable or coercive, especially if it does not allow sufficient time for investors to assess the investment's performance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities regulations related to fair dealing and adequate consideration (e.g., SEC regulations in the United States or equivalent regulations in Canada)",

                "original_text": "Each notice shall be personally delivered to the addressee or sent by fax or e-mail to the addressee. A notice which is personally delivered or delivered by fax or e-mail shall, if delivered prior to 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on a Business Day, be deemed to be given and received on that day and, in any other case, be deemed to be given and received on the first Business Day following the day on which it is delivered.",
                "changed_text": "Each notice shall be personally delivered to the addressee or sent by fax or e-mail to the addressee. A notice which is personally delivered or delivered by fax or e-mail shall be deemed to be given and received three days after the date of delivery, regardless of whether it is a business day.",
                "explanation": "Changing the notice period to a fixed three-day period, irrespective of whether it falls on a business day, creates non-compliance. Standard legal practice and many commercial laws require that if a deadline falls on a non-business day, it is extended to the next business day. This alteration directly contradicts that principle, potentially invalidating notices served close to deadlines.",

                "original_text": "The Agents shall have received at the Closing Time an opinion of U.S. counsel to the Corporation, Troutman Sanders LLP, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agents, acting reasonably, to the effect that the offer and sale of the Offered Shares in the United States do not require registration under the U.S. Securities Act.",
                "changed_text": "The Agents shall accept the Corporation's self-certification, without independent legal review, that the offer and sale of the Offered Shares in the United States do not require registration under the U.S. Securities Act.",
                "explanation": "Bypassing the requirement for an independent legal opinion from U.S. counsel regarding the registration of shares under the U.S. Securities Act creates a legal contradiction. Securities laws necessitate due diligence and reasonable investigation to ensure compliance with registration requirements. Accepting a self-certification removes this critical safeguard, increasing the risk of non-compliance and potential legal liabilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "U.S. Securities Act registration requirements and the need for reasonable investigation and due diligence in securities offerings.",

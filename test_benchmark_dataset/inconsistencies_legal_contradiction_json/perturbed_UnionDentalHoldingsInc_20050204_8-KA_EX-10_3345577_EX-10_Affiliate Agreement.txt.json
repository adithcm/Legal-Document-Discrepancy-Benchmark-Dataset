                "explanation": "This change reduces the reporting timeframe for unauthorized disclosures of confidential information to one day. This may be an unreasonably short timeframe, especially considering the complexities of investigating a potential breach, and potentially conflicts with breach notification laws that require a reasonable investigation period before notification is triggered. State laws may vary regarding data breach notification, but a single day is likely insufficient in many jurisdictions.",

                "explanation": "This change extends the timeframe for providing records related to confidential information from 10 to 30 days. While seemingly innocuous, this conflicts with legal obligations to provide information promptly during investigations or audits. Extending the response time may hinder timely compliance checks, conflicting with regulatory expectations for data protection and transparency. This could lead to non-compliance if a government audit requires a faster response time.",

                "explanation": "This change extends the timeframe for returning or destroying confidential information upon termination from 15 to 30 days. This may violate certain state laws. For example, in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) grant consumers the right to request that businesses delete their personal information. While this agreement deals with 'Confidential Information,' the delayed deletion could potentially be seen as a violation of a consumer's right to prompt data deletion if that information falls under personal data. While a 30-day delay is not egregious on its own, it should comply with specific regulatory or contractual timelines for data return/destruction.",

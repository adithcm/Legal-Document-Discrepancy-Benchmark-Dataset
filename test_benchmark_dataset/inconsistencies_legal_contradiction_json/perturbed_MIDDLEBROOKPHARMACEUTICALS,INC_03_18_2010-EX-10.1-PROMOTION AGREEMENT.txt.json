            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Parties agree to meet via conference call within five (5) business days of the end of  each month to determine the necessary adjustment, if any, to the Deposit. If it is determined that the Deposit must be  increased, within ten (10) business days of the date upon which the new Deposit is determined, MBRK shall send to  DD the funds necessary to increase the Deposit.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties agree to meet via conference call within thirty (30) business days of the end of each quarter to determine the necessary adjustment, if any, to the Deposit. If it is determined that the Deposit must be increased, within sixty (60) business days of the date upon which the new Deposit is determined, MBRK shall send to DD the funds necessary to increase the Deposit.",
                "explanation": "Changing the meeting and payment deadlines to longer periods could cause financial strain and violate general payment term standards, creating inconsistencies with typical business regulations. Some states have prompt payment laws that could be contradicted by significantly extending payment timeframes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state prompt payment laws and general standards of reasonable commercial payment terms.",
                "location": "Section 5.2"

                "changed_text": "The Promotion Fees shall be paid to DD by MBRK ninety (90) days after the receipt of an invoice from DD by MBRK.",
                "explanation": "Extending the payment timeframe to 90 days contradicts common standards for payment terms and could violate state prompt payment laws if applicable. This delay could create financial inconsistencies for DD.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state prompt payment laws and general standards of reasonable commercial payment terms.",
                "location": "Section 5.5"

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All records maintained by DD pertaining to DD's services to MBRK pursuant to this Agreement shall be provided to  MBRK within 48 hours of MBRK's request. DD shall also make its records and other documents relevant to MBRK and  this Agreement available for audit or review by MBRK upon MBRK's request at a mutually agreed upon time.",
                "changed_text": "All records maintained by DD pertaining to DD's services to MBRK pursuant to this Agreement shall be provided to MBRK within 30 days of MBRK's request. DD shall make its records and other documents relevant to MBRK and this Agreement available for audit or review by MBRK only with DD's consent.",
                "explanation": "Changing the timeframe for providing records to 30 days significantly delays access, hindering timely auditing and compliance checks. Also, it becomes a contradiction because MBRK needs to get consent from DD to audit or review the document that DD already gives MBRK, which is not compliant.",

                "original_text": "Charterer agrees to pay to Owner a fee of $______ per gallon of product transported. Owner will invoice such fees to Charterer on a monthly basis and Charterer will pay such invoiced amounts within 30 days of invoice date.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment term from 30 days to 60 days could potentially violate prompt payment laws in certain states, depending on the specific industry and the nature of the agreement. Many states have laws that mandate faster payment timelines, particularly for smaller businesses or specific types of contracts.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a breach of contract from 10 days to 5 days may be deemed unreasonably short under general contract law principles and potentially violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, especially if the breach involves complex issues requiring more time to resolve. Some jurisdictions may have specific requirements for reasonable notice and cure periods, particularly in commercial contracts.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "7.3 In case of a breach of the Agreement that is capable of being cured, the non-breaching party shall, before terminating the Agreement, give the breaching party written notice of such breach, and a thirty (30) day period in which to cure such breach.",
                "changed_text": "7.3 In case of a breach of the Agreement that is capable of being cured, the non-breaching party shall, before terminating the Agreement, give the breaching party written notice of such breach, and a ten (10) day period in which to cure such breach.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 30-day cure period for breaches of contract. Modifying this to a 10-day cure period may violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in many US jurisdictions. A shorter cure period could be deemed unreasonable, particularly for complex breaches, and may not provide the breaching party with sufficient time to rectify the issue, potentially leading to wrongful termination claims.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; potential violation of contract law principles regarding reasonable notice and opportunity to cure.",

                "original_text": "The Options shall not be assigned, transferred or alienated by the Professional. Any attempt to assign, transfer or alienate the Options without the prior written consent of the Company shall be void.",
                "changed_text": "The Options shall not be assigned, transferred or alienated by the Professional, except in cases of death where transfer may occur by will or intestate succession with the express consent of Square Two Golf Inc. Any attempt to assign, transfer or alienate the Options without the prior written consent of the Company shall be void.",
                "explanation": "The original text prevents transfer of stock options even upon death of the professional. This stricture might be an unreasonable restriction that violates laws regarding property rights and inheritance. Many jurisdictions have laws protecting the right to transfer property, including stock options, to heirs upon death. ",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws regarding inheritance and property rights; potential violation of public policy against unreasonable restraints on alienation.",

However, the Company will have the right to dispose of its inventory of Products existing at the time of termination or expiration of this Agreement and the right to use the name, likeness, image and personal identification of the Professional in connection with the disposition of such inventory. The right granted in this section shall expire six (6) months after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "2.8 The Company shall cease use of the name, likeness, image or personal identification of the Professional upon expiration or termination of this Agreement. However, the Company will have the right to dispose of its inventory of Products existing at the time of termination or expiration of this Agreement and the right to use the name, likeness, image and personal identification of the Professional in connection with the disposition of such inventory. The right granted in this section shall expire two (2) years after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The contract originally permits use of the Professional's likeness for inventory disposal for six months after termination. Extending this to two years could violate right of publicity laws in certain states. Many states have laws that protect an individual's right to control the commercial use of their likeness, and an extended period without consent or compensation could be deemed an infringement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Right of Publicity laws; potential infringement on the individual's right to control the commercial use of their likeness.",

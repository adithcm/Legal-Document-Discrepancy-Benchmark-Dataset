                "explanation": "This change extends the review period for marketing materials from three business days to ten business days. FINRA Rule 2210(c)(2)(A) requires firms to have reasonable procedures for reviewing communications to ensure they are fair, balanced, and not misleading. While FINRA doesn't prescribe a specific review timeline, a ten-business-day delay could be deemed unreasonable, especially in a rapidly changing market, potentially hindering timely and compliant communication with the public.",

                "explanation": "This change modifies the terms for expedited review, increasing the review period to five business days while significantly decreasing the charge for the expedited review. FINRA Rule 2210(c)(2)(A) requires firms to have reasonable procedures for reviewing communications. Although the change would not directly contradict the rule, the new review timeline of five business days for an 'expedited' review may be considered unreasonable under the FINRA regulation, especially if this longer period could hinder timely and compliant communication with the public or cause misleading communications to be released.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 10 days could be problematic under general contract law principles. While not directly violating a specific statute, such a short notice period may be deemed unreasonable, particularly given the complexity of the agreement and the potential disruption to the involved parties. A court might find that 10 days does not allow sufficient time to wind down operations, transition responsibilities, or secure alternative arrangements, potentially rendering the termination clause unenforceable.",

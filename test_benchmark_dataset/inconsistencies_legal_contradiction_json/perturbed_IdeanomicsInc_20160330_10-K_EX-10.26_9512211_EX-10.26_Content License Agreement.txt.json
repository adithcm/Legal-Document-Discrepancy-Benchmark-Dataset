Each party agrees that, during the Term and for two (2) years thereafter: (i) it will not disclose to any third party any Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; (ii) it will only permit access to Confidential Information of the disclosing party to those of its employees or authorized representatives or advisors (including, without limitation, the receiving party's auditors, accountants, and attorneys) having a need to know and who, prior to obtaining such access, are legally bound to protect the disclosing party's Confidential Information at least to the same extent as set forth herein; (iii) it will use any Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party only for the purpose of performing its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement and not for any other purpose, whether for such party's own benefit or the benefit of any third party; (iv) it will maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information of the other party in its possession or control; and (v) that (x) upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, or (y) at any time the disclosing party may so request, it will deliver promptly to the disclosing party, or, at the disclosing party's option, it will destroy, all Confidential Information of the disclosing party that it may then possess or have under its control.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Restrictions. Each party agrees that, during the Term and for one (1) year thereafter: (i) it will not disclose to any third party any Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; (ii) it will only permit access to Confidential Information of the disclosing party to those of its employees or authorized representatives or advisors (excluding, without limitation, the receiving party's auditors, accountants, and attorneys) having a need to know and who, prior to obtaining such access, are legally bound to protect the disclosing party's Confidential Information at least to the same extent as set forth herein; (iii) it will use any Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party only for the purpose of performing its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement and not for any other purpose, whether for such party's own benefit or the benefit of any third party; (iv) it will maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information of the other party in its possession or control; and (v) that (x) upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, or (y) at any time the disclosing party may so request, it will deliver promptly to the disclosing party, or, at the disclosing party's option, it will destroy, all Confidential Information of the disclosing party that it may then possess or have under its control.",
                "explanation": "The modification of the confidentiality restriction from two years to one year reduces the protection period for confidential information. Additionally, excluding auditors, accountants, and attorneys from the authorized representatives who can access Confidential Information is problematic because these roles often require access to such information for legitimate business purposes and this could lead to legal disputes. These edits weaken the protection of confidential information and may conflict with standard business practice and potentially breach fiduciary duties.",

Such books and records shall be made available at Licensor's normal place of business during normal business hours.

Until six (6) months after the expiration of the Profit Participation of each Project, the books and records will be available for inspection by a certified accounting firm or CPA once per year without any advance notice. Such books and records shall be made available at Licensor's discretion. If any examination of Licensor's books and records reveals that Licensor has failed to properly account for any Profits owing to the parties, Licensor will pay such past due amounts when licensor is financially viable.",
                "explanation": "The change from one year to six months for record inspection reduces the time Licensee has to verify profit calculations. Removing the requirement for 'reasonable advance notice' and stating records will be available 'at Licensor's discretion' hinders Licensee's ability to conduct meaningful audits, and is in conflict with generally accepted accounting principles regarding transparency and access to records. Delaying payment until Licensor is 'financially viable' undermines the obligation to promptly pay due amounts, potentially violating accounting and contract law principles.",

Delivery of the Titles shall be deemed complete if Licensor makes the Titles available in accordance with the previous sentence. If, from time to time, Licensee requests an alternate delivery method for the Titles and/or the implementation of Licensee's technical specifications relating to the online delivery of the Titles, then Licensor will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with each such request.",

                "explanation": "Changing the delivery timeframe from 15 days to 30, and pushing the date one year further delays the availability of content, impacting Licensee's ability to utilize the content and potentially affecting projected revenue. Changing 'Licensor's sole expense' to 'Licensee's sole expense' shifts the financial burden, making Licensee responsible for costs typically borne by the content provider. Stating that Delivery is completed once Licensor attempts to makes the titles available reduces the obligation on Licensor, while also weakening Licensee's rights. Also, the statement that Licensor 'may choose if they comply with each request' means that they can reject the requests. These changes significantly alter the delivery terms, making the Licensee's rights not as good.",

                "original_text": "In the event that Oceanic Time Warner Cable removes the above content and or terminates this agreement prior to December 31, 2006, Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to pay a cancellation fee of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) per month multiplied by the number of months remain on the agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that Oceanic Time Warner Cable removes the above content and or terminates this agreement prior to December 31, 2006, Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to pay a cancellation fee of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) total, regardless of the number of months remaining on the agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly reduces the cancellation fee owed by Oceanic Time Warner Cable upon early termination. Many jurisdictions, including several states within the United States (where Time Warner Cable operates), have regulations regarding reasonable cancellation fees, particularly in service agreements. A flat fee that disregards the remaining term of the contract may be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable if it doesn't fairly reflect the actual damages suffered by Watchit Media due to the early termination.",

                "explanation": "By removing the part about 'does not provide any guarantees of winning or improving your odds of winning on this program' and 'The rules of the games as shown may not apply to all properties and may change from time to time,' the disclaimer is now inadequate to protect Oceanic Time Warner Cable from liability related to potential misrepresentation or misleading advertising, especially given the gambling-related content.

                "changed_text": "This agreement will be in effect for 10 years.",
                "explanation": "This changes the agreement from a short-term contract (ending in 2006) to a 10-year contract. This is a significant change in the agreement. A 10-year contract could be unreasonable and may be subject to stricter scrutiny under unconscionability principles, requiring clearer evidence of mutual understanding and informed consent, especially given the potentially volatile nature of content licensing agreements and advertising revenue. This could lead to legal challenges questioning the enforceability of the extended term.",

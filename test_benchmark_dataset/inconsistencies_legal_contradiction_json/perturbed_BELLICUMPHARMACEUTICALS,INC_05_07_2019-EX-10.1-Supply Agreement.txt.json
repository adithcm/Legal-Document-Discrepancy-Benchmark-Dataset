                "original_text": "The Alliance Managers may attend meetings of the JSC, assist in resolving Disputes at the initial level of the Parties' good faith discussions, and may raise issues for discussion by the JSC.",
                "changed_text": "The Alliance Managers are discouraged from attending meetings of the JSC, will never assist in resolving Disputes at the initial level of the Parties' good faith discussions, and will never raise issues for discussion by the JSC.",
                "explanation": "Discouraging the Alliance Managers from participating or facilitating dispute resolution contradicts standard practices that promote open communication and conflict resolution in contract management. Discouraging dispute resolution efforts can cause delays in resolution.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of good faith and fair dealing; breach of contract leading to potential claims.",

Bellicum will order Miltenyi Product in undefined numbers of units, not subject to reasonable minimum order size requirements that may vary according to product type.",
                "explanation": "Changing the requirement to \"undefined numbers of units\" and removing the \"reasonable minimum order size requirements\" creates ambiguity and potential for dispute, conflicting with standard commercial practices that require clear, defined terms in purchase orders.",

Each Party will use [...***...] to not provide additional notice by email and the failure to provide such notice will affect the validity of any such notice. Either Party may never change its address by giving the other notice thereof in the manner provided herein.",
                "explanation": "Eliminating the acknowledgement of receipt of important notices creates uncertainty and disregards common legal practices. Also, stating either party may never change its address will cause issues as addresses are subject to change. This directly affects the enforceability and validity of the notice provisions.",

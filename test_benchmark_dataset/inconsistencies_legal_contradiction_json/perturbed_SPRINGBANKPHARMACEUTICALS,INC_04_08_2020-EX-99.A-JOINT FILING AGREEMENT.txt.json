                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13G (including amendments thereto) with respect to the Common Stock of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and further agree that this agreement be included as an exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned agree to delay the joint filing on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13G (excluding any amendments thereto) with respect to the Common Stock of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and further agree that this agreement not be included as an exhibit to such filing until one year after the initial filing date.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts Rule 13d-1(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which mandates joint filing agreements and their inclusion as exhibits. The changed text actively delays the filing and excludes amendments, creating a direct violation of SEC regulations regarding timely and accurate disclosure of beneficial ownership.",

                "changed_text": "No party to this agreement authorizes any other party to file on its behalf any amendments to such statement without the express written consent of legal counsel, such consent to be provided no earlier than six months following the initial filing date.",
                "explanation": "This modification restricts the ability of parties to authorize each other to file amendments, which is a common practice under Rule 13d-1(k). Requiring explicit legal counsel consent, delayed by six months, imposes an unreasonable burden and creates a potential obstruction to the timely filing of necessary amendments, contradicting the spirit and intent of the SEC's disclosure requirements.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall not be considered fully executed until all parties have provided notarized signatures, to be completed no later than December 31st, 2021.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an unreasonable delay in the agreement's effective date. Delaying full execution until December 31, 2021, significantly extends the period before the agreement is legally binding, potentially hindering timely compliance with SEC reporting requirements related to beneficial ownership. While a delay is not explicitly illegal, it contradicts the assumed promptness for securities filings and may introduce legal risk.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "CAPSUGEL shall notify CARDAX immediately, and in no event, no later than three (3) business day(s), after it receives any contact or communication from any governmental or regulatory authority, including without limitation the FDA, that in any way relates to or may have an impact on a Product or the CAPSUGEL Development Activities.",
                "changed_text": "CAPSUGEL shall notify CARDAX within ten (10) business days after it receives any contact or communication from any governmental or regulatory authority, including without limitation the FDA, that in any way relates to or may have an impact on a Product or the CAPSUGEL Development Activities.",
                "explanation": "Changing the notification period from three (3) business days to ten (10) business days for regulatory communications weakens the timely communication required for compliance. This delay could potentially violate FDA regulations that expect prompt responses and reporting of significant findings, especially those affecting product safety or efficacy. Drug manufacturers must report certain adverse events to the FDA within 15 days, so a 10 day delay hinders prompt investigation and reporting.",

                "changed_text": "CAPSUGEL agrees to retain all such Records for a period of two (2) years after the expiration of the Term or after termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period from five (5) years to two (2) years could violate FDA recordkeeping requirements for drug and device manufacturers. These regulations often mandate longer retention periods to facilitate post-market surveillance, inspections, and potential litigation. A shorter period may lead to non-compliance and inability to adequately address safety concerns discovered later.",

                "original_text": "A material breach that is subject to cure that is not cured within [***] of written notice of breach shall be cause for termination, provided that if the breaching party is diligently pursuing in good faith the remedy of the breach at the expiration of such [***] cure period, then such [***] cure period shall be extended for a reasonable period to effect the cure.",
                "changed_text": "A material breach that is subject to cure that is not cured within five (5) days of written notice of breach shall be cause for termination, with no extensions permitted.",
                "explanation": "Limiting the cure period for a material breach to just five (5) days and eliminating any possibility of extension, even if the breaching party is diligently working to remedy the breach, is unreasonable and potentially contradicts principles of contract law that favor giving parties a fair opportunity to cure defaults. Such a short, inflexible timeframe could lead to premature and unjust terminations, especially when the breach involves complex issues. Also, 5 days is insufficient time to address legal matters under state law, where a company should have a minimum reasonable time to respond to a breach of contract, with 30 days being more reasonable.",

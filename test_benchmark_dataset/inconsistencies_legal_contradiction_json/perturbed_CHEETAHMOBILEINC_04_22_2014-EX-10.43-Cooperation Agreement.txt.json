                "original_text": "Party B confirms the share of revenues of the preceding month payable to Party A on the first day of each calendar month (hereinafter referred to as (the \"Reference Date,\" and postponed in the event of public holidays) according to the above Article 5.2.2. Upon the confirmation of the share of revenues of such month, it shall not be adjusted, unless there is sufficient proof evidencing the statistics is not correct.\n\n  5.2.4 The financial settlement between the parties will be carried out monthly.\n\nParty A provides the invoice of the share of revenues in the preceding month within the first 5 working days in each month in advance, Party B warrants to pay the share of revenues to Party A prior to the 20t h day of each month (postponed in the event of public holidays) according to Article 4.1 hereof. In the event that Party A objects the payment from Party B, it shall propose within the first 5 working days in each month in writing, or it will be deemed as no objection. Party B shall review within three working days upon receipt of Party A's written objection and notify the results thereof to Party A.",
                "changed_text": "Party B confirms the share of revenues of the preceding month payable to Party A within 60 days. Upon the confirmation of the share of revenues of such month, it can be adjusted at Party B's discretion.\n\n  5.2.4 The financial settlement between the parties will be carried out quarterly.\n\nParty A provides the invoice of the share of revenues in the preceding quarter within 30 working days. Party B warrants to pay the share of revenues to Party A within 90 days. In the event that Party A objects the payment from Party B, it shall propose within 15 working days in writing, or it will be deemed as no objection. Party B is not obligated to review Party A's written objection.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a specific timeline for revenue sharing and payment, which is perturbed by extending the payment timeframe and introducing ambiguity. The original text's \"first day of each calendar month\" becomes \"within 60 days,\" and the payment deadline extends from \"prior to the 20th day of each month\" to \"within 90 days.\" Furthermore, the switch from monthly to quarterly settlements contradicts standard payment practices and creates ambiguity. Finally, removing Party B's obligation to review objections from Party A contradicts fair business practices.",

                "original_text": "In the event either party breaches its obligations hereunder, the breach party shall immediately suspend its breach upon the receipt of the non-breach party's written notice requiring it to rectify its breach, and pay all the losses to the non-breaching party arising from such breach within ten (10) days. If the breach party continue to carry on the breaching conduct or does not perform its obligations, the non- breaching party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in addition to the compensation for the breach.",
                "changed_text": "In the event either party breaches its obligations hereunder, the breaching party will have no obligation to suspend its breach. The breaching party is only obligated to pay 10% of the non-breaching party's initial investment as compensation. The non-breaching party can only terminate the agreement after 180 days from the day the breach was first noticed.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that the breaching party must immediately cease the breach upon notice and compensate for losses within 10 days. The modified text removes the obligation to immediately suspend the breach and drastically reduces the compensation amount to a fixed percentage (10% of initial investment), regardless of actual losses. This limited compensation could be far less than the actual damages suffered by the non-breaching party, conflicting with principles of contract law that aim to make the injured party whole. Moreover, delaying the termination right to 180 days restricts the non-breaching party's ability to mitigate damages promptly.",

                "changed_text": "The parties are encouraged, but not required, to delete the links between their websites within 180 days upon the termination of this Agreement. Party B holds the discretion to extend this deletion period indefinitely.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates the deletion of website links within 15 days of termination. The modified clause weakens this requirement by making it optional (\"encouraged, but not required\") and extending the period to 180 days. More significantly, it gives Party B unilateral discretion to extend the deletion period indefinitely. This contradicts principles of contract law by creating an imbalance of power, potentially allowing Party B to benefit from the links while disadvantaging Party A after termination. The open-ended extension also creates uncertainty and could lead to disputes about the intent and interpretation of the termination agreement.",

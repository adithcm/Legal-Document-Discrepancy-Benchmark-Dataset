                "original_text": "C. Subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable content agreement with such Licensor, the Net Advertising Revenue shall be calculated on a quarterly calendar basis (the \"Net Advertising Revenue Period\") and shall be payable no later than sixty (60) days after the termination of the preceding full quarter-annual period, i.e., commencing on the first (1st) day of January, April, July and October except that the first and last calendar periods may be \"short,\" depending on the effective date of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "C. Subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable content agreement with such Licensor, the Net Advertising Revenue shall be calculated on a quarterly calendar basis (the \"Net Advertising Revenue Period\") and shall be payable no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the termination of the preceding full quarter-annual period, i.e., commencing on the first (1st) day of January, April, July and October except that the first and last calendar periods may be \"short,\" depending on the effective date of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "California law mandates specific payment deadlines for royalties and revenue sharing, and generally requires more prompt payment than 120 days. By extending the payment deadline to 120 days, the contract risks non-compliance, particularly if the underlying content agreements with Licensors require quicker royalty payouts. This creates a legal contradiction where the contractual timeline is longer than what might be legally permissible, potentially leading to disputes and legal challenges.",

                "explanation": "Record-keeping requirements for financial transactions in California often extend beyond six months, especially concerning potential audits or legal challenges related to royalties. Reducing the record retention period to six months creates a contradiction, as it might not comply with statutes of limitations for breach of contract or fraud claims, potentially harming the Licensor's ability to pursue legal remedies.",

                "explanation": "Trade secrets in California are protected potentially indefinitely as long as they remain secret and provide a competitive advantage. Limiting the confidentiality period to one year may be insufficient to protect trade secrets, conflicting with California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA), especially given the nature of 'technical data, trade secret, know-how' as defined earlier in the agreement. This creates a legal contradiction where the contract's confidentiality term is shorter than the potential duration of trade secret protection under state law.",

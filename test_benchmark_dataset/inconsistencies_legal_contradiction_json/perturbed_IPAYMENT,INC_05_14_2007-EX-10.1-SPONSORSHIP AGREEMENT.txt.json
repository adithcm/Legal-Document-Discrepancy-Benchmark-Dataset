                "explanation": "This modification extends the deadline for ISO to forward application materials and merchant processing agreements to SERVICERS to 30 business days. While seemingly generous, this could violate regulations requiring prompt submission of merchant data to acquiring banks for compliance and risk monitoring, especially in high-risk industries. The delay could lead to non-compliance with KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations.",

Many breaches, especially those involving complex regulatory compliance issues, cannot realistically be resolved within such a short timeframe. This could violate principles of good faith and fair dealing, especially if the SERVICERS use this shortened period to unfairly terminate the agreement.",

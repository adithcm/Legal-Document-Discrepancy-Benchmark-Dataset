                "original_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any delay by Service Recipient in its payment of any Service Fee to Service Provider, for each day of delay in such payment, Service Recipient must pay Service Provider liquidated damages at 0.5 percent (0.5%) of the Service Fee that are due and unpaid. In the event that such delay in payment is more than fifteen (15) days, Service Provider may terminate this Agreement. Service Recipient shall be liable for indemnifying Service Provider in full for the losses it incurred therefrom.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any delay by Service Recipient in its payment of any Service Fee to Service Provider, for each day of delay in such payment, Service Recipient must pay Service Provider liquidated damages at 5 percent (5%) of the Service Fee that are due and unpaid. In the event that such delay in payment is more than five (5) days, Service Provider may terminate this Agreement. Service Recipient shall be liable for indemnifying Service Provider in full for the losses it incurred therefrom.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies liquidated damages at 0.5% per day of delay and allows termination after 15 days of delay. The modified text increases the liquidated damages to 5% per day and reduces the delay period for termination to 5 days. This could be considered an unreasonably high penalty under Chinese Contract Law, which requires liquidated damages to be commensurate with actual losses. A 5% daily penalty may be viewed as excessive and punitive, and a 5-day grace period may be deemed insufficient, potentially violating fairness principles.",
                "contradicted_law": "Chinese Contract Law Article 114: If the agreed-upon liquidated damages are significantly higher than the actual losses, the party can request the court or arbitration institution to reduce them appropriately.",

                "original_text": "Any written notice sent by registered or express mail shall be deemed being delivered three (3) business days after the date on which the mail is dispatched (evidenced by the postmark) unless the address on the mailing slip is different from the address specified in this Agreement. Any written notice sent by facsimile shall be deemed being delivered when the receipt is confirmed.\n\nIn addition, Service Provider may send any notice by email to the email address provided by Service Recipient in this Agreement, and the notice shall be deemed as being delivered when such email is successfully sent.",
                "changed_text": "Any written notice sent by registered or express mail shall be deemed being delivered one (1) business days after the date on which the mail is dispatched (evidenced by the postmark) unless the address on the mailing slip is different from the address specified in this Agreement. Any written notice sent by facsimile shall be deemed being delivered when the receipt is confirmed.\n\nIn addition, Service Provider may send any notice by email to the email address provided by Service Recipient in this Agreement, and the notice shall be deemed as being delivered immediately when such email is successfully sent.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the deemed delivery time for mail to one business day and email to 'immediately' creates an unreasonably short timeframe. This is likely to contradict standard notification clauses and could violate principles of reasonable notice, potentially conflicting with civil code requirements for adequate opportunity to respond. In practice, it's unlikely that such a short timeframe for mail delivery is possible or reasonable.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China Article 153: Civil juristic acts that violate the mandatory provisions of laws or administrative regulations are null and void, unless the violation of the mandatory provisions does not render the act null and void.",

This Agreement shall be renewed automatically for another twenty (20) years upon the expiration unless the Parties confirm, in writing, the termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Extending the initial term and automatic renewal to twenty years may violate regulations or principles regarding fair contract terms and potential restrictions on competition or freedom to contract. While there isn't a hard limit in all cases, such a long, automatically renewing term could be deemed unreasonable or unconscionable, particularly if it creates an unfair imbalance of power between the parties or restricts the Service Recipient's ability to engage with competitors.",

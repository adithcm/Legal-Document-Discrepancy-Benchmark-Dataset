                "original_text": "Any proposed response by a Party to a Customer Complaint shall be sent to the other Parties not less than five (5)  Business Days prior to the response being sent to any person, including the Certificate Owner or any Governmental  Entity, provided, however, that if a more prompt response is required, the Parties shall send to the other Parties the  proposed response as soon as practicable under the circumstances but in no event shall any Party submit such  response to another person without providing the other Party with prior written notice of and a copy of the  response.",
                "changed_text": "Any proposed response by a Party to a Customer Complaint shall be sent to the other Parties not less than one (1) Business Day prior to the response being sent to any person, including the Certificate Owner or any Governmental Entity, provided, however, that if a more prompt response is required, the Parties shall send to the other Parties the proposed response as soon as practicable under the circumstances but in no event shall any Party submit such response to another person without providing the other Party with prior written notice of and a copy of the response.",
                "explanation": "The change reduces the required notice period for responding to customer complaints from five business days to one business day.  This could potentially violate state regulations requiring insurers to have sufficient time to adequately investigate and respond to complaints, which in many states is longer than one business day. For instance, some states mandate a 10-day review period before responding to customer complaints.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'promptly notify in writing' to 'notify when they deem necessary' introduces ambiguity and allows for delayed notification of critical events.  This conflicts with regulatory requirements for timely reporting of material changes in licensure status to relevant counterparties, particularly in regulated industries such as insurance and securities.  Delayed notification could lead to regulatory violations and potential harm to customers.",

                "changed_text": "The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon notice to the Indemnified Party within two business days after the receipt of any such notice, to undertake the defense of or, with the consent of the  Indemnified Party, (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), to settle or compromise such claim.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame for the Indemnifying Party to decide on undertaking the defense of a claim from ten business days to two business days may conflict with legal standards of reasonableness and fairness.  A shorter time frame may not allow sufficient time for proper investigation and assessment of the claim, potentially leading to rushed decisions that prejudice the Indemnified Party's rights, and some states have timeframes longer than two business days.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring reasonable time for decision-making and potential conflict with procedural rules regarding litigation deadlines.",

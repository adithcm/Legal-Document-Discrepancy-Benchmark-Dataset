                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Aduro shall pay Consultant any amounts due that are not reasonably disputed by Aduro, by check or direct bank deposit, within thirty days after receiving the invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Aduro shall pay Consultant any amounts due that are not reasonably disputed by Aduro, by check or direct bank deposit, within sixty days after receiving the invoice.",
                "explanation": "California law requires prompt payment to independent contractors. While 'prompt' is subject to interpretation, 60 days is an unreasonably long period, and would be considered a violation, especially if the industry standard is shorter.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Labor Code Sections 2750.5 and 2751",
                "location": "Section 2"

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "From the Effective Date and for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "From the Effective Date and for eighteen (18) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates.",
                "explanation": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally prohibits non-solicitation agreements. Although there is some narrow exception to the law, the law disfavors such agreements that restrict an employee's ability to earn a living. The change to eighteen months increases the likelihood a court will rule the non-solicitation agreement is invalid under California law due to being overly broad and restrictive.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(c) On Aduro's request, or upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, Consultant shall immediately: (i) stop using Confidential Information; (ii) return all materials provided by Aduro to Consultant that contain Confidential Information, except for one copy that may be retained by Consultant's legal counsel to confirm compliance with the obligations under this Agreement; (iii) destroy all copies of Confidential Information in any form including Confidential Information contained in computer memory or data storage apparatus or materials prepared by or for Consultant; and (iv) provide a written warranty to Aduro that Consultant has taken all the actions described in the foregoing Subparagraphs 4(c)(i-iii).",
                "changed_text": "(c) On Aduro's request, or upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, Consultant shall use best efforts to: (i) stop using Confidential Information; (ii) return all materials provided by Aduro to Consultant that contain Confidential Information, except for one copy that may be retained by Consultant's legal counsel to confirm compliance with the obligations under this Agreement; (iii) destroy all copies of Confidential Information in any form including Confidential Information contained in computer memory or data storage apparatus or materials prepared by or for Consultant; and (iv) provide a written confirmation to Aduro that Consultant has taken all the actions described in the foregoing Subparagraphs 4(c)(i-iii) to the best of their ability.",
                "explanation": "Changing the language from 'shall immediately' to 'use best efforts to' significantly weakens the consultant's obligation to protect confidential information upon termination. This creates ambiguity and makes enforcement difficult. Under California law, employers have a right to the protection of their trade secrets, especially post-termination. 'Best efforts' does not provide the same level of protection as 'shall immediately' and can violate the spirit of trade secret protection laws.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the legal requirement for accuracy and timely filing of financial statements. By stating that the undersigned are not responsible, even if they know the information is inaccurate, it violates SEC regulations regarding truthful and accurate disclosures in Schedule 13G filings.",

                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts SEC regulations which require amendments to Schedule 13G filings when there are material changes in ownership or control of the underlying securities. Stating that no subsequent amendments are required is a violation of these regulations.",

                "explanation": "The change of date to January 1, 1970 can be a legal contradiction under certain circumstances. The document is signed April 8, 2020. An earlier date of January 1, 1970 can be contradictory since it's not possible to sign something before the company exists or before relevant information is available. This renders the validity of the document questionable.",

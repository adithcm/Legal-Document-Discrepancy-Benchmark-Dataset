                "original_text": "Agency Agreement Expiration Date and Last Delivery Date:  October 31, 2006",
                "changed_text": "Agency Agreement Expiration Date and Last Delivery Date: December 1, 2005",
                "explanation": "The original contract allows almost a year for equipment delivery. By shortening the delivery timeframe to less than a month after the agreement date, it may be impossible to fulfill the equipment orders, creating a breach of contract. This violates general contract law principles requiring a reasonable timeframe for fulfilling obligations.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period from 30 days to 5 days is an unreasonably short timeframe. This could be considered a breach of good faith and fair dealing, particularly if significant actions or investments are required within the agreement's scope.",

                "original_text": "Section 2.03 Payment of Purchase Price. On or before the Lease Commencement Date for any Schedule, the Company shall present to Lessor documentation (\"Purchase Documentation\"), in form and substance satisfactory to Lessor in its sole discretion, which (i) describes all units of Equipment ordered, received and accepted by the Company as agent for Lessor in connection with such Schedule, and (ii) if Company has paid any Supplier for any of the Equipment, includes evidence of the Purchase Price paid to Supplier for each such unit of Equipment and of passage of title thereto to Lessor. Upon the latter of (A) Lessor's receipt of the Purchase Documentation or (B) the satisfaction of all conditions precedent on or after the applicable Lease Commencement Date, Lessor shall pay the Supplier or reimburse the Company, as the case may be, for the aggregate Purchase Price for all Equipment purchased hereunder in connection with such schedule.",
                "changed_text": "Section 2.03 Payment of Purchase Price. The Lessor is under no obligation to pay the supplier or reimburse the company the aggregate purchase price for all equipment purchased under this schedule. Payment is at the sole discretion of the lessor.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the Lessor to pay the supplier or reimburse the company after receiving purchase documentation. The modified text gives complete discretion to the Lessor, essentially negating the obligation to pay. This violates basic contract law principles of mutual obligation and consideration. If the Lessor never has to pay, then the agreement becomes illusory.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "2.4 CRO will provide a detailed account of all time and tasks, as against project specific task and time addenda, and will be payable within 30 days of receipt of invoice by Client.",
                "changed_text": "2.4 CRO will provide a detailed account of all time and tasks, as against project specific task and time addenda, and will be payable within 60 days of receipt of invoice by Client.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment deadline beyond what is considered standard and reasonable in many jurisdictions. Delayed payment terms can create financial hardship for CRO and are often subject to legal limitations regarding late payment penalties or interest.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of prompt payment laws, breach of contract if 30 days is industry standard.",
                "location": "Section 2.0"

                "original_text": "4.1. Either party may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days written notice if the other materially breaches this Agreement; provided, however that the party in breach shall have the right to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of the other party's intention to terminate.",
                "changed_text": "4.1. Either party may terminate this Agreement on ten (10) days written notice if the other materially breaches this Agreement; provided, however that the party in breach shall have the right to cure such breach within ten (10) days after receipt of written notice of the other party's intention to terminate.",
                "explanation": "This reduces the notice and cure periods for a material breach. A shorter cure period might be considered unreasonable, especially for complex breaches, and could violate principles of good faith and fair dealing, making termination easier and potentially unlawful.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with principles of contract law regarding reasonable notice and opportunity to cure a breach.",

                "changed_text": "12.5 Any action of any kind by either party arising out of this Agreement must be commenced within one (1) year from the date the right, claim, demand, or cause of action shall first arise.",
                "explanation": "This reduces the statute of limitations for claims arising from the agreement. The standard statute of limitations for contract claims in Connecticut is typically longer than one year. Reducing it may violate state laws or be deemed unconscionable, especially if it unduly burdens one party's ability to seek legal recourse.",

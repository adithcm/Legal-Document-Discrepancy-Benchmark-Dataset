                "original_text": "From and after the Closing Date and until 5:00 pm Denver time on the date which is eighty (80) days from the Closing Date (the \"Option Expiration Date\"), HOC shall have the option (the \"Option\"), at its sole discretion, to subscribe for all, but not less than all, of an additional 4,330,000 Shares from the Company (the \"Additional Shares\") at a price of US$3.00 per share, or a total of US$12,990,000. If HOC wishes to exercise the Option, it shall give written notice to the Company (the \"Option Exercise Notice\") prior to the Option Expiration Date in the manner set forth in Section 12.1 of this Agreement. If HOC fails to deliver the Option Exercise Notice on or before the Option Expiration Date, HOC shall be deemed to have waived its rights under this Section 2.1. In the event HOC exercises the Option, one or more of the HOC Entities shall subscribe and pay for and the Company shall issue to the relevant HOC Entities, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances, the Additional Shares and the Parties shall exchange representations and warranties substantially similar to those contained in the Subscription Agreement and execute such documents as may be necessary to complete the subscription and sale of the Additional Shares. Closing of the purchase and sale of the Additional Shares shall take place within ten (10) business days of the delivery of the Option Exercise Notice, such date being referred to as the \"Subsequent Closing Date\".",
                "changed_text": "From and after the Closing Date and until 5:00 pm Denver time on the date which is thirty (30) days from the Closing Date (the \"Option Expiration Date\"), HOC shall have the option (the \"Option\"), at its sole discretion, to subscribe for all, but not less than all, of an additional 4,330,000 Shares from the Company (the \"Additional Shares\") at a price of US$3.00 per share, or a total of US$12,990,000.

Closing of the purchase and sale of the Additional Shares shall take place within twenty (20) business days of the delivery of the Option Exercise Notice, such date being referred to as the \"Subsequent Closing Date\".",
                "explanation": "Shortening the option period to 30 days and extending the closing date to 20 days after notice could be problematic if it doesn't allow sufficient time for regulatory approvals or due diligence which may be a violation of business laws or securities regulations. Setting the closing date to 20 days after the option exercise notice may not provide sufficient time for the company to prepare necessary documentation and obtain required approvals.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of securities regulations, breach of fiduciary duty if insufficient time for due diligence.",

                "original_text": "HOC shall have ten (10) Business Days from delivery of such notice in which to notify the Company that it desires to provide all of such financing (the \"Financing Election\"). If HOC delivers the Financing Election, the purchase price for each share shall be equal to eighty percent (80%) of the average closing price of the Shares during the thirty (30) calendar days preceding the date HOC delivers the Financing Election. Closing of the subscription, purchase and sale shall be at such place and time as the Parties agree but not more than ten (10) days from delivery of the Financing Election.",
                "changed_text": "HOC shall have two (2) Business Days from delivery of such notice in which to notify the Company that it desires to provide all of such financing (the \"Financing Election\"). If HOC delivers the Financing Election, the purchase price for each share shall be equal to ninety-five percent (95%) of the average closing price of the Shares during the five (5) calendar days preceding the date HOC delivers the Financing Election. Closing of the subscription, purchase and sale shall be at such place and time as the Parties agree but not more than twenty (20) days from delivery of the Financing Election.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time for HOC to make a Financing Election to just 2 business days may be insufficient for them to conduct proper due diligence or secure necessary approvals, potentially violating their rights or fiduciary duties. Similarly, restricting the pricing calculation to the 5 days before election and increasing it to 95% could be viewed as unfair pricing or manipulation under securities laws.",

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Rights Notice shall be deemed to include sufficient information to make such investment decision if it includes the information specified in items (i) to (iv) of Section 4.1(d).

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification and acceptance periods to two business days severely limits HOC's ability to conduct due diligence or make informed investment decisions, potentially breaching their pre-emptive rights. It doesn't allow reasonable time to assess the offering and it may affect their business with this action.

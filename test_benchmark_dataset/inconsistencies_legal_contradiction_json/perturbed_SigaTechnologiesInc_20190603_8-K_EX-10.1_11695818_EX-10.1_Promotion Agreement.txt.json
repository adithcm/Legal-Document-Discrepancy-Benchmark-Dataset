                "explanation": "The original text specifies that MMT must report all safety reports to SIGA within two business days or four calendar days of awareness, whichever is shorter. By changing this to within one business day, it creates a contradiction. FDA regulations and guidelines often provide timelines that allow for more than one business day to report safety concerns, depending on the nature and severity of the report. This change may make it difficult for MMT to comply with the contractual deadline and still adhere to internal and external regulatory procedures, creating non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires Promoter to retain safety reports for a minimum of ten years after the agreement's expiration. Changing this to five years creates a potential conflict with FDA requirements for pharmacovigilance, which may mandate longer retention periods for certain safety data depending on the product and the nature of the reports. This could lead to non-compliance with regulatory standards if the legally required retention period exceeds the contractual one.",

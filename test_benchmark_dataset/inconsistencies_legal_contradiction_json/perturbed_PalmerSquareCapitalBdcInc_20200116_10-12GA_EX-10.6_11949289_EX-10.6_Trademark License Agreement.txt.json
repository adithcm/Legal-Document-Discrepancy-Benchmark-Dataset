                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for termination from 60 days to 15 days could be considered unreasonable in certain jurisdictions, especially where the licensee has made significant investments based on the agreement. This may conflict with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in New York contract law (the governing law of the contract per section 5.5), potentially rendering the termination clause unenforceable or leading to disputes over its enforceability.",

For six (6) months following termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall specify on all public-facing materials in a prominent place and in prominent typeface that Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the period for which the Licensee must disclaim association with the Licensor from 24 months to 6 months may be insufficient to protect the Licensor's brand and prevent consumer confusion, particularly given the investment company context. This could be seen as a breach of the licensee's duty to cooperate under trademark law which dictates that the licensee uphold the licensor's rights even after termination and ensure no consumer confusion happens. The Lanham Act dictates protection of brands so cutting this timeline drastically hurts the Licensor's rights.",

Licensee shall not be obligated to notify Licensor of any action that must be taken by Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements unless the licensor has notified Licensee first.",
                "explanation": "Removing the Licensee's proactive obligation to notify the Licensor of compliance issues creates a potential conflict with regulatory obligations, especially in the financial services industry where both parties could be held responsible for ensuring compliance. This violates the premise under law of good faith and fair dealing by putting all responsibility to find compliance issues on the Licensor which is not involved in the Licensee's day to day affairs.",

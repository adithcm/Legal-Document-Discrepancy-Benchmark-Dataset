                "explanation": "The original text allows for a 10-day cure period after notice of breach. Reducing this cure period to 2 business days creates a contradiction, as PRC law (which governs this agreement per section 11.1) typically provides for reasonable cure periods which are often longer than 2 days, especially considering the complexity of potential breaches. This unreasonably short period may be deemed unenforceable.",

In the event that such dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) Business Days following such notice,  either Party may upon the expiration of the such 30-day notice period submit such dispute to arbitration by the Hong Kong International  Arbitration Centre in accordance with the arbitration rules of such centre then in effect.",

In the event that such dispute is not resolved within five (5) Business Days following such notice,  either Party may upon the expiration of such 5-day notice period submit such dispute to arbitration by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the arbitration rules of such centre then in effect.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a 30-day negotiation period before arbitration. Reducing this to 5 business days introduces a legal contradiction. PRC law, while allowing for arbitration, generally expects a reasonable period for good-faith negotiation before resorting to arbitration. A 5-day period is arguably too short to allow for meaningful negotiation, potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing which are implied into contracts under PRC law.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 30-day period to provide a detailed report and certification for a force majeure event. Reducing this to 5 days creates a potential conflict with PRC law. Obtaining official certification from a public notary within 5 days for a force majeure event (which could involve significant disruptions) is often impractical, especially considering potential bureaucratic delays. This could be considered an unreasonable burden on the affected party, potentially making the clause unenforceable under PRC law principles of fairness and reasonableness.",

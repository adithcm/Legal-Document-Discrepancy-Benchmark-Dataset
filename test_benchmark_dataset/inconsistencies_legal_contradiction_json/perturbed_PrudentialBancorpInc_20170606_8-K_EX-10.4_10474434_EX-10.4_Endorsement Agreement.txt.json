                "explanation": "The change extends the deadline for the employer to provide a written statement to the insurer regarding the employee's beneficiary's entitlement to policy proceeds from 60 days to 180 days. Pennsylvania law requires prompt payment of life insurance proceeds and does not allow undue delays. A delay of 180 days could be construed as unreasonable and a violation of Pennsylvania's Unfair Insurance Practices Act, which prohibits unfair claim settlement practices.",

If a claim request is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator will furnish to the Claimant a notice of the decision within 90 days in writing and in a manner calculated to the understood by the Claimant, which notice will contain the following information: (a) The specific reason or reasons for the denial; (b) Specific reference to the pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial is based; (c) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the Claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and (d) An explanation of the Plan's claims review procedure describing the steps to be taken by a Claimant who wishes to submit his claim for review.",

If a claim request is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator will furnish to the Claimant a notice of the decision within 150 days in writing and in a manner calculated to the understood by the Claimant, which notice will contain the following information: (a) The specific reason or reasons for the denial; (b) Specific reference to the pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial is based; (c) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the Claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and (d) An explanation of the Plan's claims review procedure describing the steps to be taken by a Claimant who wishes to submit his claim for review.",
                "explanation": "Extending the claim denial notification period to 150 days contradicts ERISA's requirement for timely claim processing. While ERISA doesn't explicitly define 'timely' for all claims, an unreasonably long delay can violate its fiduciary responsibility provisions, particularly in a split-dollar life insurance plan context.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe to request a review of a denied claim from 60 days to 30 days is a contradiction. Although there's no explicit federal or Pennsylvania state law mandating a minimum review request period for this specific type of split-dollar plan claim, shortening it could be deemed unreasonably restrictive, particularly if it hinders the claimant's ability to gather information and prepare a comprehensive appeal. It is a contradiction since it potentially violates the standard for a 'full and fair review' of the claim denial, as outlined in ERISA regulations.",

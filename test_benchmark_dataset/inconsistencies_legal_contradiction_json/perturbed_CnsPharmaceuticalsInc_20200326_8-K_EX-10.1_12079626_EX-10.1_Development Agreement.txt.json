                "original_text": "within thirty Business Days from the date of this Agreement, CNS will make an upfront payment of $225,000 to WPD; and (ii) within thirty days of the verified achievement of the Phase II Milestone, (such verification shall be conducted by an independent third party mutually acceptable to the parties hereto), CNS will make a payment of $775,000 to WPD.",
                "changed_text": "within ninety Business Days from the date of this Agreement, CNS will make an upfront payment of $225,000 to WPD; and (ii) within fifteen days of the verified achievement of the Phase II Milestone, (such verification shall be conducted by an independent third party designated solely by CNS), CNS will make a payment of $775,000 to WPD.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the payment deadline for the Phase II Milestone from thirty days to fifteen days. This potentially creates an undue burden on CNS, particularly if the verification process is lengthy. Furthermore, the change from a 'mutually acceptable' third party to one 'designated solely by CNS' introduces a conflict of interest. Generally, payment terms must be reasonable, and reducing the timeframe and eliminating the mutually acceptable verifier may be viewed as unreasonable. Also, it increased the days to pay the first payment, which might be challenged.",

                "original_text": "The first Development Fees payment shall be due forty-five days after the end of the Calendar Quarter in which the first Sale of a Development Product took place. Thereafter, WPD shall furnish to CNS Development Fees no later than forty-five days after the end of each Calendar Quarter for the Sale of Development Products through the end of such Calendar Quarter and shall further furnish CNS with a written statement setting forth an accounting showing the calculation of the Development Fees.",
                "changed_text": "The first Development Fees payment shall be due ninety days after the end of the Calendar Quarter in which the first Sale of a Development Product took place. Thereafter, WPD shall furnish to CNS Development Fees no later than ninety days after the end of each Calendar Quarter for the Sale of Development Products through the end of such Calendar Quarter and shall further furnish CNS with a verbal statement, without any accounting, showing the calculation of the Development Fees.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment deadline from forty-five days to ninety days after the end of the calendar quarter where the sale took place is a legally questionable delay. Additionally, changing the requirement from a written statement with accounting to a verbal statement without accounting creates a material contradiction because the verbal agreement alone can introduce ambiguity and is less enforceable.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period from five years to one year weakens the protection of confidential information. This may be deemed unreasonable, especially concerning trade secrets and sensitive business data, potentially conflicting with reasonable expectations for confidentiality agreements. It also changes from 'competent written proof' to 'oral proof'. Oral proof has a higher chance of not being defendable compared to written proof.",

Exact, within thirty (30) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter of the Term, shall deliver to Pfizer a consolidated report in the form of and containing the information necessary to confirm the calculation of the Promotion Fee for such Calendar Quarter, together with the underlying spreadsheets with respect to such Calendar Quarter. The Promotion Fee due with respect to such Calendar Quarter and reflected on the consolidated report shall be remitted at the time such report is made.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Payment of Promotion Fee. Exact, within ninety (90) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter of the Term, shall deliver to Pfizer a consolidated report in the form of and containing the information necessary to confirm the calculation of the Promotion Fee for such Calendar Quarter, together with the underlying spreadsheets with respect to such Calendar Quarter. The Promotion Fee due with respect to such Calendar Quarter and reflected on the consolidated report shall be remitted at the time such report is made.",
                "explanation": "The change modifies the payment timeline, making it potentially inconsistent with standard business practices and potentially violating prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions. By extending the period for delivering the report to 90 days, it delays the payment and introduces a legal inconsistency.  Standard business practice requires payments to be made in a timely manner, usually within 30-60 days.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement stipulates a five-year confidentiality period post-termination. Changing this to one year introduces an inconsistency, potentially violating trade secret laws if five years is found to be commercially reasonable and necessary to protect the Disclosing Party's legitimate interests. Some jurisdictions may consider a one-year term inadequate for protecting sensitive information, leading to legal challenges.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the advance notice for audits from 30 days to 10 days introduces an inconsistency. This timeframe may be unreasonably short, hindering the Audited Party's ability to adequately prepare and gather the necessary documentation for the audit. This may violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in the contract.",

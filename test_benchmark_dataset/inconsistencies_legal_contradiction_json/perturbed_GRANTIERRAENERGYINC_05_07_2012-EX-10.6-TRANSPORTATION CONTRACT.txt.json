                "explanation": "The original contract stipulates that payment must be made within 20 calendar days of the invoice date.  Extending this to 60 days contradicts standard business practices and possibly regulations around payment terms, which generally require prompt payment. This may violate laws concerning fair and timely payment for services rendered.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the payment timeframe for the shipment tax from 15 to 5 calendar days could violate regulations granting businesses reasonable time to process and remit taxes.  This creates an unreasonably short deadline that conflicts with typical tax compliance standards.",

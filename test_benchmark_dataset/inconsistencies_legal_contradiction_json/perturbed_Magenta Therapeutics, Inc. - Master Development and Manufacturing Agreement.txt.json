                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Unless specifically agreed otherwise in writing by the Parties, including as agreed in a Project Plan, (i) all invoices and payments hereunder shall be in U.S. Dollars, (ii) payments will be made payable to Bachem at the address set forth in applicable Project Plan(s), and (iii) all undisputed payments shall be made within [***] of receipt of invoice by Magenta.",
                "changed_text": "Unless specifically agreed otherwise in writing by the Parties, including as agreed in a Project Plan, (i) all invoices and payments hereunder shall be in U.S. Dollars, (ii) payments will be made payable to Bachem at the address set forth in applicable Project Plan(s), and (iii) all undisputed payments shall be made within 90 days of receipt of invoice by Magenta.",
                "explanation": "The original contract stipulates that payments will be made within a certain timeframe of receipt of the invoice. Payment terms that exceed standard and legally protected durations can be seen as an abuse of power. The modification extends the payment timeframe to 90 days, which may violate state laws regarding prompt payment, particularly if the jurisdiction offers legal protection for vendors requiring payment in a more reasonable time frame.",

                "original_text": "Magenta shall have [***] after receipt of the Product to notify Bachem in writing of any rejection of Product based on a sufficiently documented claim that the Product fails to meet the Specifications. In the event that Magenta does not inform Bachem within the [***] period that the Product does not meet the Specifications, Magenta shall be deemed to have accepted the Product.",
                "changed_text": "Magenta shall have 24 hours after receipt of the Product to notify Bachem in writing of any rejection of Product based on a sufficiently documented claim that the Product fails to meet the Specifications. In the event that Magenta does not inform Bachem within the 24-hour period that the Product does not meet the Specifications, Magenta shall be deemed to have accepted the Product.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame for rejection of products to 24 hours is unreasonably short, considering the complexity of pharmaceutical products and necessary testing. This conflicts with standard commercial practices and implied warranties that allow a reasonable time for inspection and acceptance, potentially violating the Uniform Commercial Code.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be renewed for additional periods of one (1) year (each such additional period, a \"Renewal Term\") unless either Party provides notice of nonrenewal upon not less than 1 day prior written notice to the other Party.",
                "explanation": "Changing the non-renewal notice period to just one day violates standard contract law principles, requiring a reasonable notice period for termination or non-renewal. This short notice period is unreasonable and could be deemed unconscionable, especially given the long-term nature and significant investment typical in manufacturing agreements.",

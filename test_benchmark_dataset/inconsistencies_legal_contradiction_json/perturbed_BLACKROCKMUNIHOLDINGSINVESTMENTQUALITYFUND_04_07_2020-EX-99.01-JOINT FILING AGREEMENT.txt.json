                "original_text": "This agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This agreement shall remain in full force and effect for 30 days, after which it will automatically renew for successive 30-day terms unless revoked with 24 hours' notice.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement allows revocation by any party with written notice. The modified version imposes a 30-day term with automatic renewal and requires an unreasonably short 24-hour notice for revocation. This contradicts standard contract law principles that generally require reasonable notice periods for termination, especially in agreements of this nature. Many jurisdictions require a reasonable timeframe for parties to adjust their business operations following contract termination; 24 hours is unlikely to be considered reasonable.",

                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and the rules and regulations thereunder, each party hereto hereby agrees to the joint filing, on behalf of each of them, of any filing required by such party under Section 13 or Section 16 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (and, if such security is registered on a national securities exchange, also with the exchange), and further agrees to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant to the parties' discretion, filings under Section 13 or Section 16 of the Exchange Act will be jointly considered. Joint filings are not required and will occur only if all parties agree. This agreement does not obligate any party to ensure compliance with Exchange Act regulations.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates joint filing as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The modified text makes joint filing discretionary and removes the obligation to comply with the Exchange Act. This directly contradicts the legal requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, which mandates certain filings by parties involved in securities transactions.",

                "changed_text": "This agreement will terminate automatically if any party fails to meet a margin call or if any BlackRock fund underperforms its benchmark index by 10% in any quarter.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement outlines a clear revocation process (signed writing). The modified version introduces automatic termination triggers based on financial performance and margin calls. While financial performance clauses are common, the lack of any cure period or notice for margin calls before termination introduces inconsistencies. Introducing the performance benchmark of 10% directly contradicts established practices, creating potential conflict with investment mandates.",

                "original_text": "WHEREAS, Bank of America and Supplier entered into the SLCMA in order to set forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which Supplier provides certain Software to Bank of America,\n\nWHEREAS, the parties desire to add to the SLCMA the Supplier Offer Placement System Software;\n\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and accords made herein, and the exchange of such good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Bank of America and Supplier agree as follows:\n\nThe attached Schedule [A] is hereby incorporated into the SLCMA describing the Offer Placement System Software for use by Bank of America.",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Bank of America and Supplier entered into the SLCMA in order to set forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which Supplier provides certain Software to Bank of America,\n\nWHEREAS, the parties desire to add to the SLCMA the Supplier Offer Placement System Software;\n\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and accords made herein, and without any valuable consideration, Bank of America and Supplier agree as follows:\n\nThe attached Schedule [A] is hereby incorporated into the SLCMA describing the Offer Placement System Software for use by Bank of America. If any dispute arises regarding payment, Bank of America has 30 days from the invoice date to raise objections; otherwise, Bank of America is deemed to have waived such dispute.",
                "explanation": "The modified text states that the agreement is made 'without any valuable consideration', which contradicts basic contract law principles requiring consideration for a contract to be valid. Furthermore, imposing a 30-day limit for dispute resolution on invoices is an unfair practice, particularly since the law requires sufficient time to investigate and challenge invoices, especially complex software service invoices. This is particularly poignant given the size and scale of Bank of America.",

                "changed_text": "Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned as solely determined by Cardlytics, Inc.",
                "explanation": "Giving Cardlytics the sole discretion to define undefined terms creates a significant power imbalance and undermines the principle of mutual agreement in contract law. This can lead to arbitrary interpretations that disadvantage Bank of America, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

Any claims related to this agreement must be submitted within 90 days of the event giving rise to the claim.",
                "explanation": "The modified text imposes a 90-day limitation period for filing claims related to the agreement. This contradicts standard statutes of limitations for contract disputes, which typically range from 2 to 6 years, depending on the jurisdiction. Reducing the claim period to 90 days can unfairly prejudice Bank of America by significantly shortening the time available to discover and pursue valid claims. This is especially burdensome given the complexity often associated with software agreements and can be argued to be an unconscionable contract term.",

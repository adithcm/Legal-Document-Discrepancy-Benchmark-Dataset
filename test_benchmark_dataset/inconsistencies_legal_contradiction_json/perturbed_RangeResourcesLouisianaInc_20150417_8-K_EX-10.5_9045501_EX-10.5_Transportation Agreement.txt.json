                "original_text": "B. All payments are due on the later of: (1) within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice; (2) the twenty-seventh (27th) of the month following receipt of the invoice, or; (3) if the twenty-seventh (27th) of the month following receipt of the invoice is not a Business Day, on the next Business Day thereafter.",
                "changed_text": "B. All payments are due 90 days after receipt of the invoice.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment due date to 90 days contradicts standard business practices and potentially violates regulations regarding timely payments to service providers. Many jurisdictions have laws or guidelines that expect payment within a 'reasonable' timeframe, typically 30-60 days. This creates an inconsistency with typical regulatory expectations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied contract law principles requiring 'reasonable' payment terms, state laws regarding prompt payment for services.",

                "original_text": "As a condition precedent to recovery by Shipper for loss, damage, or delay in receipt or delivery of Shipper's Products for which Carrier may be responsible, Shipper's claim must be filed in writing with Carrier within nine (9) months after delivery of the affected Products, or, in case of Carrier's failure to make delivery of Shipper's Products, then within nine (9) months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits shall be instituted against Carrier only within two (2) years and one (1) day from the day when notice in writing is given by Carrier to Shipper that Carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts thereof specified in the notice. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted by Shipper on such claims in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such claims will not be paid and Carrier will not be liable.",
                "changed_text": "As a condition precedent to recovery by Shipper for loss, damage, or delay in receipt or delivery of Shipper's Products for which Carrier may be responsible, Shipper's claim must be filed in writing with Carrier within 30 days after delivery of the affected Products, or, in case of Carrier's failure to make delivery of Shipper's Products, then within 30 days after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits shall be instituted against Carrier only within six (6) months from the day when notice in writing is given by Carrier to Shipper that Carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts thereof specified in the notice. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted by Shipper on such claims in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such claims will not be paid and Carrier will not be liable.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the claim filing period to 30 days and the suit initiation period to six months is likely to conflict with statutes of limitations and general contract law principles. Statutes of limitations often allow for longer periods (e.g., 1-5 years) to file claims, especially for contract disputes or property damage. Shortening these periods can make it unreasonably difficult for the shipper to pursue legitimate claims, potentially violating principles of fairness and access to legal remedies.",

If Shipper fails to pay an invoice by the due date, Carrier will notify Shipper of the failure, and if Shipper has not remedied the failure within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice from Carrier, in addition to any other remedies under this Tariff or under applicable law, Carrier shall have the right, either directly or through an agent, to sell any Products of such Shipper in Carrier's custody at public auction, on any day not a legal holiday, not less than forty-eight (48) hours after publication of notice of such sale in a daily newspaper of general circulation published in the town, city, or general area where the sale is to be held, stating the time and place of sale and the quantity and location of the Products to be sold. At said sale, Carrier shall have the right to bid, and, if it is the highest bidder, to become the purchaser. The proceeds of any sale shall be applied in the following order: (1) To the reasonable expenses of holding, preparing for sale, selling, and to the extent allowed by law, reasonable attorney's fees and legal expenses incurred by Carrier; and (2) To the satisfaction of Shipper's indebtedness including interest herein provided from the date payment is due. The balance of the proceeds of the sale remaining, if any, shall be paid to Shipper or, if there is a dispute or claim as to entitlement, held for whoever may be lawfully entitled thereto. Carrier will have a claim for and against Shipper with respect to any deficiency arising from the debt due to Carrier from Shipper and the proceeds of any sale after reduction as set forth above.",
                "changed_text": "J. If Shipper fails to pay an invoice by the due date, Carrier has the right, either directly or through an agent, to immediately sell any Products of such Shipper in Carrier's custody at private sale, without notice to Shipper. At said sale, Carrier shall have the right to bid, and, if it is the highest bidder, to become the purchaser. The proceeds of any sale shall be applied in the following order: (1) To the expenses of sale, including attorney's fees incurred by Carrier; and (2) To the satisfaction of Shipper's indebtedness including interest herein provided from the date payment is due. The balance of the proceeds of the sale remaining, if any, shall be paid to Shipper.",
                "explanation": "Allowing immediate private sale of Shipper's products without notice significantly deviates from standard commercial practices and legal protections. Most jurisdictions require 'reasonable' notice and opportunity to cure a default before exercising such drastic remedies. Depriving the Shipper of notice and the chance to redeem their products could violate due process rights and potentially conflict with state laws governing secured transactions or property rights.",

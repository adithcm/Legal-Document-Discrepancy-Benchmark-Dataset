                "original_text": "All public liability and property damage policies shall contain a provision that El Pollo Loco, although named as an insured, shall nevertheless be entitled to recover under such policies on any loss incurred by El Pollo Loco, its affiliates, agents and/or employees, by reason of the negligence of Developer, its principals, contractors, agents and/or employees. All policies shall provide Franchisor with at least thirty (30) days' notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.",
                "changed_text": "All public liability and property damage policies shall contain a provision that El Pollo Loco, although named as an insured, shall nevertheless be entitled to recover under such policies on any loss incurred by El Pollo Loco, its affiliates, agents and/or employees, by reason of the negligence of Developer, its principals, contractors, agents and/or employees. All policies shall provide Franchisor with at least ten (10) days' notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for cancellation or termination of insurance coverage to 10 days contradicts standard insurance regulations and potentially state laws, which often require insurers to provide at least 30 days' notice to additional insured parties like El Pollo Loco. This reduction could leave El Pollo Loco with insufficient time to secure alternative coverage, violating their risk management requirements.",

                "changed_text": "Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the initial request for a meeting, the parties shall meet within a location chosen by the Franchisor, to discuss and negotiate toward a resolution of the controversy.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the meeting timeframe to 15 days may not provide sufficient time for the Developer to adequately prepare or seek legal counsel, potentially violating principles of fair dispute resolution and good faith negotiation. Also, by forcing them to meet at the Franchisor's location, this puts undue hardship and could imply a power imbalance during negotiations.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the review period for the Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) to five days violates the FTC Franchise Rule and state franchise laws, which mandate a minimum 14-day review period. This reduction unfairly pressures the franchisee to sign the agreement without adequate time to assess the risks and benefits, rendering the franchise agreement potentially voidable.",

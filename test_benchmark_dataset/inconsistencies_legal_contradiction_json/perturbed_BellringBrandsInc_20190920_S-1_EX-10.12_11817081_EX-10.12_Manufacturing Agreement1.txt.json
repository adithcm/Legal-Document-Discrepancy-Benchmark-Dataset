Heritage agrees to do so within [***] of Heritage or Jasper receiving the Report or of sending the response as appropriate.",
                "changed_text": "Heritage agrees to provide to Premier each FDA Form 483 and any related Establishment Inspection Report (\"EIR\") that is received from the FDA by Heritage or Jasper, along with any response provided to the regulatory authority by Heritage or Jasper, as long as this Agreement is in effect. Heritage agrees to do so within 90 days of Heritage or Jasper receiving the Report or of sending the response as appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires Heritage to provide FDA form 483 and EIR within a certain timeframe. By changing the deadline to 90 days, this may cause non-compliance with FDA regulations that require more prompt reporting or corrective action depending on the severity of the findings.",

For Product produced at Heritage facilities, Heritage shall invoice Premier on the date the Products are loaded onto Premier's carrier. Payment terms for all these Product invoices shall be [***]. Failure by Premier to meet payment terms of any invoice shall result in interest being imposed on any unpaid balance at the rate of [***] per month, pro rata on a daily basis for partial months, accrued from its due date or in the event such rate exceeds that permitted to be charged by law, the maximum rate permitted by law.",
                "changed_text": "Payment terms for these Product invoices shall be [***]. For Product produced at Heritage facilities, Heritage shall invoice Premier on the date the Products are loaded onto Premier's carrier. Payment terms for all these Product invoices shall be 180 days. Failure by Premier to meet payment terms of any invoice shall result in interest being imposed on any unpaid balance at the rate of 25% per month, pro rata on a daily basis for partial months, accrued from its due date or in the event such rate exceeds that permitted to be charged by law, the maximum rate permitted by law.",
                "explanation": "Extended payment terms of 180 days may violate California Prompt Payment Act, which provides faster payment timeline. Also, imposing an interest rate of 25% per month, which equals 300% annually, is usurious and violates California's usury laws.",

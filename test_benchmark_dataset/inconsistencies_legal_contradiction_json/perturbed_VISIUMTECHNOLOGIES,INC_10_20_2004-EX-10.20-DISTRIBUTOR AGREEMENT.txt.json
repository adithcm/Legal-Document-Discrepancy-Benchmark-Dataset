The total price for both of the Licensed Programs together is $[*] per month per Product (\"License Fee\"). The License Fee shall begin on the date the Product is shipped to a customer and shall be paid by Power2Ship to WLI by the 7th of each month for the prior month (prorated if the Unit was shipped during the prior month) and shall continue for as long as the Product is active on any wireless network. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Power2Ship is obligated to pay the License Fee to WLI for a minimum of 36 months.",

                "explanation": "This change increases the minimum payment period for the License Fee from 36 months to 120 months. This could be deemed an unreasonable term, especially if the product becomes obsolete or unmarketable, potentially violating contract law principles regarding fair and reasonable contractual terms. Depending on the jurisdiction, such an extended minimum payment commitment might be challenged as unconscionable.",

                "explanation": "The change increases the interest rate on past due amounts from the lower of 18% or the highest rate permitted by law to a fixed 25%.

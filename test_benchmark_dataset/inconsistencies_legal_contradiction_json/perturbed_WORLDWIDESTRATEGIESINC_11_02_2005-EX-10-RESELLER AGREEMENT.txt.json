                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "TouchStar will invoice Reseller for payment of the Fee incurred within ten (10) days after the end of each billable month. Payment of the Fees shall be due and payable within ten (10) days of the date of the invoice.",
                "changed_text": "TouchStar will invoice Reseller for payment of the Fee incurred within thirty (30) days after the end of each billable month. Payment of the Fees shall be due and payable within five (5) days of the date of the invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an inconsistency by reducing the payment timeframe to five days. Many jurisdictions have laws or established business practices that require a reasonable timeframe for payment, typically longer than five days. Setting an unreasonably short payment window could violate fair business practice laws or be deemed unconscionable, especially for smaller businesses.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of fair business practices and unconscionability principles under contract law.",

                "original_text": "Reseller shall report promptly to TouchStar all claimed or suspected defects in the TouchStar Software or Support Services and shall notify TouchStar in writing of any claim or proceeding involving the TouchStar Software or Support Services within five (5) days after Reseller learns of the claim or proceeding.",
                "changed_text": "Reseller shall report promptly to TouchStar all claimed or suspected defects in the TouchStar Software or Support Services and shall notify TouchStar in writing of any claim or proceeding involving the TouchStar Software or Support Services within one (1) day after Reseller learns of the claim or proceeding.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the notification timeframe to one day, creating an unreasonableness with legal requirements. It's unusual to expect a company to notify another party within such a tight window, especially considering they might need time to assess the claim or proceeding, which might be impossible in one day.",
                "contradicted_law": "Unreasonableness under contract law regarding notification periods.",
                "location": "Section 4.9"

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Prior to the end of the Term, each of TouchStar and Reseller may notify the other if it desires to negotiate a further agreement by written request received at least ninety (90) days in advance of the termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Prior to the end of the Term, each of TouchStar and Reseller may notify the other if it desires to negotiate a further agreement by written request received at least five (5) days in advance of the termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for renewal negotiation to five days is unreasonable. Under contract law, parties are entitled to enough time to meaningfully assess whether they would like to renew the contract. Most legal jurisdictions have provisions for commercially reasonable notice, where the amount of time depends on the complexity and impact of the decision on the business. A five-day notification period could be viewed as legally unconscionable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Unreasonable notice period that may violate fair contract law and unconscionability principles.",

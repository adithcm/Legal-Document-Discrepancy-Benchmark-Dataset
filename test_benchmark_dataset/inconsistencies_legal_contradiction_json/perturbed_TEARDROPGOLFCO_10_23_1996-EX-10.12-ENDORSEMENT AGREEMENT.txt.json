                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "TPC shall pay any Tournament Bonuses due Consolidated Artists for a Major Tournament win within sixty (60) days following TPC's receipt of an invoice from Consolidated Artists or Advantage and any Tournament Bonuses due Consolidated Artists for a network televised US PGA Tour Tournament win shall be paid within forty-five (45) days following TPC's receipt of an invoice from Consolidated Artists or Advantage. All other Tournament Bonuses due to Consolidated Artists shall be paid by TPC within thirty (30) days following TPC's receipt of an invoice from Consolidated Artists or Advantage.",
                "changed_text": "TPC shall pay any Tournament Bonuses due Consolidated Artists for a Major Tournament win within ninety (90) days following TPC's receipt of an invoice from Consolidated Artists or Advantage and any Tournament Bonuses due Consolidated Artists for a network televised US PGA Tour Tournament win shall be paid within seventy-five (75) days following TPC's receipt of an invoice from Consolidated Artists or Advantage. All other Tournament Bonuses due to Consolidated Artists shall be paid by TPC within sixty (60) days following TPC's receipt of an invoice from Consolidated Artists or Advantage.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment deadlines for tournament bonuses, potentially conflicting with prompt payment laws that mandate quicker payment terms. By extending the period beyond a reasonable timeframe, it introduces a legal contradiction.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state-specific prompt payment laws (e.g., Virginia prompt payment act for construction, which requires payments be made within certain timeframes or face penalties).",

                "original_text": "Such past due payments shall bear interest at a rate of two percent (2%) per month OR the maximum rate permissible by law, whichever is less.",
                "changed_text": "Such past due payments shall bear interest at a rate of fifteen percent (15%) per month OR the maximum rate permissible by law, whichever is less.",
                "explanation": "This modification increases the interest rate on past due payments to 15% per month. This could violate state usury laws that set limits on the maximum permissible interest rates. Depending on the state (governed by Virginia law as per section 28), this rate may be significantly higher than the legal limit, making this provision unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "State usury laws (e.g., Virginia's usury laws under Title 6.2 of the Code of Virginia).",
                "location": "Paragraph 16"

                "changed_text": "Consolidated Artists and Advantage, at Consolidated Artists' expense, shall have the right during the Contract Period and until six (6) months after the termination of this Agreement to inspect and make copies of the books and records of TPC insofar as they relate to the computation of royalty payments due and owing to Consolidated Artists hereunder.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the period during which Consolidated Artists can inspect TPC's financial records from two years post-termination to just six months. This reduction could violate legal standards related to accounting practices, statute of limitations for breach of contract, or reasonable access to records, depending on the specifics of the state law (governed by Virginia law as per section 28) and the context of any disputes arising after the contract ends. A shorter period may not provide sufficient time to uncover discrepancies.",

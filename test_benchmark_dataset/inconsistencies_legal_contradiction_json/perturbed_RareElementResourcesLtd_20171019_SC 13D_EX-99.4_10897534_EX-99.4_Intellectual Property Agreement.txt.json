If Company fails to cure the identified breach within thirty (30) days after the date of the notice, Investor may terminate this IP Agreement by written notice to Company.",

If Company fails to cure the identified breach within ten (10) days after the date of the notice, Investor may terminate this IP Agreement by written notice to Company.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from 30 days to 10 days could be considered unreasonably short, especially given the complexity of IP agreements and the potential need for extensive investigation and remediation. This could violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most US jurisdictions, as it doesn't allow a reasonable timeframe for the breaching party to address the issue.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Company elects to abandon any patent application, to not pay maintenance fees or annuities to keep a patent in force, or to otherwise take or fail to take any action that will result in a loss of patent rights, Company shall give Investor at least sixty (60) days prior written notice and an opportunity to take over the prosecution of the patent application that would be abandoned and/or pay the fees necessary to keep the patent in force and/or take any other action necessary to avoid the loss of patent rights.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for patent abandonment from 60 days to 10 days is insufficient to allow the investor to properly assess the value of the patent and take necessary steps to continue prosecution or maintenance. This can be considered a breach of good faith, especially if the patents are critical to the investor's business, as the investor needs time to assess its options, secure funding, and engage patent counsel.",

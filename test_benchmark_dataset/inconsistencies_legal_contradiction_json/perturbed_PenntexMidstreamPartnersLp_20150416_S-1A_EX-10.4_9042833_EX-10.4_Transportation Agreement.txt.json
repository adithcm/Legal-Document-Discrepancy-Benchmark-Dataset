                "explanation": "Delaying the invoice date until the end of the month could contradict prompt payment laws in some states, which may require invoices to be sent sooner to ensure timely payment. While specific regulations vary, a significant delay can trigger penalties or legal challenges.",

Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid. If Customer fails to pay Transporter undisputed amounts due hereunder and such failure is not cured within ten (10) calendar Days' of written notice from Transporter to Customer, Transporter may suspend receipt and delivery of Customer Gas without prejudice to any other available remedies at law or in equity.",

Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid. If Customer fails to pay Transporter undisputed amounts due hereunder and such failure is not cured within five (5) calendar Days' of written notice from Transporter to Customer, Transporter may suspend receipt and delivery of Customer Gas without prejudice to any other available remedies at law or in equity.",
                "explanation": "Extending the payment term to 60 days might conflict with typical industry standards or state laws that specify shorter payment periods for gas transportation services. Shortening the cure period to 5 days may not provide sufficient time for the customer to resolve payment issues, potentially leading to premature suspension of services and legal disputes.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the period for disputing invoices to 6 months might be considered unreasonably short under certain state laws or regulations, especially considering the complexity of gas transportation calculations. This could limit the customer's ability to identify and rectify billing errors, potentially violating fairness or consumer protection principles.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state-specific statutes of limitations or laws related to fair business practices.",

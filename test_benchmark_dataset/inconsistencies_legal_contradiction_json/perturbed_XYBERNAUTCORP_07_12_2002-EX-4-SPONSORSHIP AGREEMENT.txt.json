                "original_text": "XC may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to AJR upon the occurrence of any of the following events (each an \"AJR Event of Default\"):\n\n                (i)     AJR breaches any material term, provision or covenant of                         this  Agreement  on the  part of AJR to be  observed  or                         performed  and such breach is not cured  within ten (10)                         days after written  notice of the breach is given by XC;                         or",

                "explanation": "The original text allows for a 10-day cure period for breaches. This has been shortened to 2 days, which may be unreasonably short depending on the nature of the breach and could be deemed unconscionable, particularly in Virginia where courts consider the fairness of contract terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with general contract law principles of fairness and reasonable opportunity to cure breaches, as interpreted in Virginia.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the event a registration  statement covering all of the Registrable  Securities  has\n\n                                      -3-\n\nnot been filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on or before July 1, 2002, XC agrees to pay to AJR $10,000. XC shall pay to AJR an additional $10,000 for each thirty-day  period  thereafter  (e.g.,  ending,  August 1, September 1, etc.) in which a  registration  statement has not been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for purposes of registering all Registrable  Securities. All such  payments  due  hereunder  shall be payable on or before the 5th of the month in which such payment  becomes due.",

Any prior agreement for a penalty payment will be considered completely voided after the agreed date.",
                "explanation": "By stating that XC will not be obligated to provide any form of payment to AJR after July 1, 2002, it potentially violates securities laws requiring timely registration of securities, as well as laws relating to fulfilling contractual obligations. This contradicts securities regulations and principles of contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates securities laws related to registration requirements (e.g., Securities Act of 1933) and general contract law principles regarding breach of contract.",

In addition,  AJR's  obligations  under  Section  11(a) above shall survive  for a  period  of one (1)  year  after  the  date  of  this  Agreement. Thereafter,  AJR's  obligations under Section 11(a) shall terminate and be of no further force and effect,  except to the extent of any claims made thereunder by XC  prior  to  such  date,  which  claims  shall  survive.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,  AJR's liability under  this  Section  11 shall not exceed One  Hundred  Dollars ($100).  In addition,  AJR's  obligations  under  Section  11(a) above shall terminate immediately after the date of this agreement and be of no further force and effect.",
                "explanation": "By drastically reducing the liability limit to $100 and terminating the indemnification obligations immediately, the modification undermines the purpose of indemnification, potentially conflicting with Virginia law requiring contracts to be conscionable and provide adequate remedies. The extremely low limit may be deemed unconscionable, especially given the nature of the sponsorship agreement.",

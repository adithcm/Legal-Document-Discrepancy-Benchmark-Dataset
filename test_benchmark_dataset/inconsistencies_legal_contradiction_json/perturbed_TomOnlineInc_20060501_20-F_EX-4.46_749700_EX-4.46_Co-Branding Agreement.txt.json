The statements are only required to show in reasonable detail (i) the annual Gross Revenue received and (ii) the calculation of Adjusted Net Revenue.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires quarterly statements within 30 days, while the modification requires annual statements within 90 days of the fiscal year end.

Not more than once per calendar quarter, each Party or its independent auditor (who shall be a certified public accountant) shall have the right, on not less than fifteen (15) calendar days prior notice and not during the first twenty (20) days after the close of any fiscal quarter of the other Parties, or within sixty (60) day of the close of such Parties' respective fiscal years, to audit the books of account and records of any and all such Parties.",

The modification eliminates any audit rights, which conflicts with standard business practices and could be legally problematic, especially given the revenue-sharing arrangement and international nature of the agreement. Lack of audit rights makes it difficult to verify financial statements, particularly because one of the parties, Tom Holding, is listed on the NASDAQ.",

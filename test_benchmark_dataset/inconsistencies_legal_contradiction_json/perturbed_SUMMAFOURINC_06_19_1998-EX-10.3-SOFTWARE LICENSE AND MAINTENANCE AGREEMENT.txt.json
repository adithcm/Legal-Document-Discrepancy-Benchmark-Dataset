                "original_text": "LICENSEE shall, within thirty (30) days after delivery of any Licensed Technology, either accept such Licensed Technology or reject such Licensed Technology because of nonconformance with the Specifications. LICENSEE shall provide D2 with written notification of any rejection of Licensed Technology which explains the basis for such rejection.",
                "changed_text": "LICENSEE shall, within ten (10) days after delivery of any Licensed Technology, either accept such Licensed Technology or reject such Licensed Technology because of nonconformance with the Specifications. LICENSEE shall provide D2 with written notification of any rejection of Licensed Technology which explains the basis for such rejection.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the acceptance period to 10 days puts undue pressure on the licensee, potentially conflicting with implied warranty laws that provide a reasonable time for inspection and acceptance. A shorter timeframe may be deemed unconscionable, especially for complex software.",

                "original_text": "LICENSEE shall maintain records of its distribution of Licensee Products containing the Licensed Technology, for a period of one year after the date on which LICENSEE distributes the Products to which such records pertain. D2 may audit such records by engaging an independent public audit firm, approved in advance by Licensee, upon thirty days written notice, provided that (i) no more than one such audit may be made in any twelve month period, (ii) D2 may only audit LICENSEE's records for a particular time period once, and (iii) D2 shall be responsible for ensuring that the auditor executes and abides by LICENSEE's confidentiality agreement.",
                "changed_text": "LICENSEE shall maintain records of its distribution of Licensee Products containing the Licensed Technology, for a period of six months after the date on which LICENSEE distributes the Products to which such records pertain. D2 may audit such records by engaging an independent public audit firm, without the need for approval in advance by Licensee, upon ten days written notice, provided that (i) two such audits may be made in any twelve month period, (ii) D2 may audit LICENSEE's records for a particular time period multiple times, and (iii) D2 shall not be responsible for ensuring that the auditor executes and abides by LICENSEE's confidentiality agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the record-keeping period to six months may violate accounting standards that require records to be kept for a longer period. Also, removing the requirement for advance approval of the audit firm, increasing audit frequency, allowing multiple audits for the same period, and removing the confidentiality obligation for the auditor can be seen as unreasonable and in bad faith, contravening fair business practices.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the minimum maintenance and support period to one year may be considered unconscionable if the software has a longer expected lifespan, and it could be argued that the licensee reasonably expected longer support. Some jurisdictions might view this as an unfair business practice.",

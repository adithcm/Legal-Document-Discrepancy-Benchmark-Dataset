                "original_text": "You shall submit to us copies of all Unit Franchise Agreements executed with Unit Franchisees within ten (10) days of the date of their execution, together with a copy of all checks presented to you at closing. You shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, not later than the first (1 s t ) day of each month, of Franchise Sales Revenue generated by you during the previous calendar month. Contemporaneously with the submission of the Franchise Sales Revenue report, you shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, in such form and including such detail as we require, reflecting royalty fees paid and owed to you by your Unit Franchisees for the previous calendar month. Any report not actually received by us when due shall be deemed overdue and you shall pay us a late charge as described above.",
                "changed_text": "You shall submit to us copies of all Unit Franchise Agreements executed with Unit Franchisees within forty-five (45) days of the date of their execution. You shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, no later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the second month following the reported revenue, of Franchise Sales Revenue generated by you during the previous calendar month. You do not need to submit the monthly report, Contemporaneously with the submission of the Franchise Sales Revenue report, you shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, in such form and including such detail as we require, reflecting royalty fees paid and owed to you by your Unit Franchisees for the previous calendar month. Any report not actually received by us when due shall be deemed overdue and you shall pay us a late charge as described above.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction by extending the deadline for submitting Unit Franchise Agreements and the monthly report for Franchise Sales Revenue. The modified deadlines conflict with typical franchise agreement requirements and may also fail to comply with state franchise laws. States require more frequent and prompt reporting to maintain transparency and oversight. Changing the timing on the monthly revenue report conflicts with standard reporting practices that allow franchisors to ensure accurate and timely royalty payments, potentially violating financial reporting regulations.",

If any such default is not cured within the specified time, or such longer period as applicable law may require, we shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice of termination to you. You shall be in default pursuant to this Section 10.3 for failure to substantially comply with any of the requirements imposed by this Agreement, as it may from time to time reasonably be modified or supplemented by the Manuals, or your failure to carry out the terms of this Agreement in good faith.",

If any such default is not cured within the specified time, we shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice of termination to you. You shall be in default pursuant to this Section 10.3 for failure to substantially comply with any of the requirements imposed by this Agreement, as it may from time to time reasonably be modified or supplemented by the Manuals, or your failure to carry out the terms of this Agreement in good faith.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives the franchisee 30 days to cure a default. By reducing the cure period to 5 days, the modification could be viewed as an unreasonably short time frame. This directly contradicts franchise laws in some states (e.g., California) that mandate specific minimum cure periods to protect franchisees. The change creates a legal contradiction by providing an insufficient opportunity for the franchisee to address the default, making the termination provision potentially unenforceable under state franchise laws.",

Such transfers, including, without limitation, transfers by devise or inheritance, shall be subject to the same conditions as any inter vivos transfer, except that the transfer fee shall be waived. In the case of transfer by devise or inheritance, however, if the heirs or beneficiaries of any such person are unable to meet the conditions of this Section 12, the executor, administrator, or personal representative of the decedent shall transfer the decedent's interest to another party approved by us within twelve (12) months, which disposition shall be subject to all the terms and conditions for transfers contained in this Agreement. We may, at our option, assume management and control of the Franchised Business during such twelve (12) month period and shall be paid a reasonable monthly management fee for our services as determined by us.

                "explanation": "Reducing the transfer timeframe to 3 months introduces a legal contradiction. Many states provide legal frameworks that ensure reasonable timeframes for estate administration and asset transfer after death. Decreasing the allowed timeframe may be insufficient to comply with legal requirements for probate, potentially causing conflict with state probate law. This could invalidate the clause, requiring the timeframe extension to align with legal standards for asset transfers after death or disability.",

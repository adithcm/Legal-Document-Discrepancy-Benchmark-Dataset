                "changed_text": "Licensor shall provide to Rogers at least fifteen (15) days prior notice of the availability date of any Licensed Program added to such list during the Term; (ii) Licensor shall provide to Rogers at least five (5) days prior notice of the deletion of any Licensed Program from such list; and (iii) Licensor shall not be responsible for any costs and/or losses incurred by Rogers as a result of any deletions from such list during the Term.",
                "explanation": "Reduced notice periods for availability and deletion of licensed programs, and removing the responsibility for costs associated with deletion. These modifications are designed to conflict with industry standards and potentially reasonable business practices, increasing risk for Rogers. Notice periods are unreasonably short.",

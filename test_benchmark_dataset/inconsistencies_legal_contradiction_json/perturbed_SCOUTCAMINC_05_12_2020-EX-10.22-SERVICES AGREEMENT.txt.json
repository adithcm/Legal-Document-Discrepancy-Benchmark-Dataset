                "original_text": "5. Termination. If Maimon should become unable to serve as CEO, or should fail to perform any of the obligations hereunder for any cause including death or disability, always in the sole judgment and decision of the Company, then the Company shall have the right to terminate this agreement on five days prior written notice. Maimon shall have the right to resign at any time upon 30 days prior written notice. The Company may in its discretion and at its option terminate this Agreement at any time after the Minimum Period upon five days prior written notice to Maimon.",
                "changed_text": "5. Termination. If Maimon should become unable to serve as CEO, or should fail to perform any of the obligations hereunder for any cause including death or disability, always in the sole judgment and decision of the Company, then the Company shall have the right to terminate this agreement on two days prior written notice. Maimon shall have the right to resign at any time upon 10 days prior written notice. The Company may in its discretion and at its option terminate this Agreement at any time after the Minimum Period upon two days prior written notice to Maimon.",
                "explanation": "The modified text shortens the notice periods for termination by the Company and resignation by Maimon. This could potentially violate New York law, which requires reasonable notice for termination of employment contracts, especially for high-level executives. What constitutes 'reasonable' depends on the circumstances, but 2 days notice, especially for a CEO position, may be deemed unreasonable.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years after expiration or termination for any reason of this Agreement, Maimon agrees not to: (a) compete with the business of the Company, whether individually or through any entity, or to use (or permit the use of) any Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of competing with the business of the Company; or (b) suggest to, induce or persuade any customer, client, vendor, supplier, employee, consultant or agent of the Company to terminate or diminish its relationship with the Company.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years after expiration or termination for any reason of this Agreement, Maimon agrees not to: (a) compete with the business of the Company, whether individually or through any entity, or to use (or permit the use of) any Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of competing with the business of the Company; or (b) suggest to, induce or persuade any customer, client, vendor, supplier, employee, consultant or agent of the Company to terminate or diminish its relationship with the Company.",
                "explanation": "Extending the non-compete period to five years may be considered overly broad and unreasonable under New York law, which scrutinizes non-compete agreements to ensure they are not unduly restrictive and are necessary to protect the employer's legitimate business interests. A five-year restriction, especially without geographic limitations (which are absent in the original agreement) increases the risk of the non-compete being unenforceable in New York.",

                "original_text": "4. Compensation. In consideration of the services to be rendered by Maimon hereunder and for Maimon's service as a director on the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company will pay Maimon a monthly fee of $1,000 during the Minimum Period, beginning on the Effective Date.",

In consideration of the services to be rendered by Maimon hereunder and for Maimon's service as a director on the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company will pay Maimon a monthly fee of $200 during the Minimum Period, beginning on the Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "The change reduces the monthly payment from $1,000 to $200. Given that Maimon is the CEO, such low compensation could be deemed unconscionable and indicative of exploitation, especially in light of the responsibilities and fiduciary duties associated with the CEO role. While there's no specific statute dictating minimum CEO pay, a court could find that such a low rate violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or is so inadequate as to render the agreement unenforceable.",

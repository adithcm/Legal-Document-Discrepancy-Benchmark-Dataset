                "original_text": "If Cano fails to make any payment when required by this Agreement, the Company shall have the option of canceling this Agreement following the passage of ten (10) days after having given Cano written notice of its default. While the Company shall have no further obligation to Cano following cancellation of the Agreement, Cano shall remain liable for all unpaid installments for the then current term of the Agreement, which installments shall be immediately due and payable.",
                "changed_text": "If Cano fails to make any payment when required by this Agreement, the Company shall have the option of canceling this Agreement following the passage of two (2) days after having given Cano written notice of its default. While the Company shall have no further obligation to Cano following cancellation of the Agreement, Cano shall remain liable for all unpaid installments for the then current term of the Agreement, which installments shall be immediately due and payable.",
                "explanation": "The original contract allows for a 10-day cure period after notice of default for payment. Reducing this to 2 days contradicts standard commercial practices and potentially Texas law regarding reasonable notice and opportunity to cure in contract disputes. This abbreviated cure period could be deemed unconscionable or commercially unreasonable.",

                "explanation": "The original contract is for one year. Changing it to five years without corresponding adjustments to payment terms, obligations, or termination clauses introduces inconsistencies. The payment is for one year, not five. It creates a contradiction within the contract itself, making the five-year term potentially unenforceable due to lack of consideration and mutual agreement for the extended period. If the actual term is greater than one year it must comply with the Statute of Frauds to be enforceable.",

Notice to Cano shall be sufficient if made or addressed to Cano Petroleum, Inc., 801 Cherry  Street, Suite 3200, Fort Worth, Texas 76102.

                "explanation": "The original contract specifies written notice via personal delivery or registered/certified mail. Changing this to email and text message without explicit consent and acknowledgement of receipt creates a potential contradiction with standard contract law principles. Some legal interpretations in Texas may not recognize email or text as sufficient legal notice without affirmative confirmation, especially regarding critical matters like default or termination. This also creates a risk of undelivered notice and disputes over whether notice was properly given. These methods are not written, and are not official under most regulations. Emails can sometimes go to spam.",

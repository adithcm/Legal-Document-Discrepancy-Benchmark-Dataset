            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Telnet shall give notice to Galaxy of all errors and inaccuracies in an invoice within 15 days of receipt by Telnet of the invoice at issue. Thereafter, Telnet will be deemed to have agreed with the accuracy of the invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Telnet shall give notice to Galaxy of all errors and inaccuracies in an invoice within 5 days of receipt by Telnet of the invoice at issue. Thereafter, Telnet will be deemed to have agreed with the accuracy of the invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the time Telnet has to dispute an invoice from 15 days to 5 days, potentially conflicting with standard accounting practices and fairness principles that usually allow for a more reasonable period to review financial documents. This could be considered an unfair business practice.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates principles of fair business practices and could be challenged under contract law if deemed unconscionable.",

                "original_text": "Telnet hereby covenants to pay all invoices rendered to its account by Galaxy within 15 days of the date of invoice; Interest shall accrue on overdue accounts at the rate of 1.5% per month calculated and payable from the date of invoice until the date of payment in full of the overdue amount.",
                "changed_text": "Telnet hereby covenants to pay all invoices rendered to its account by Galaxy within 5 days of the date of invoice; Interest shall accrue on overdue accounts at the rate of 5% per month calculated and payable from the date of invoice until the date of payment in full of the overdue amount.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the payment timeframe to 5 days and increases the monthly interest rate on overdue accounts to 5%.  The significantly shortened payment window coupled with a very high interest rate is unreasonable and may be considered usurious, and thus illegal.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of usury laws and unfair business practice regulations.",

                "changed_text": "All covenants of confidentiality herein shall survive the term of this agreement by three (3) months counting from the date of termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This reduces the confidentiality period from 3 years to 3 months. Given the sensitive nature of confidential information outlined in the contract, such a short confidentiality period might be deemed unreasonably short and could potentially violate trade secret protection principles. Reducing it from 3 years to 3 months may not provide adequate protection of Trade Secrets in countries like Canada (British Columbia) or Romania where standard protection periods are longer.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential conflict with trade secret laws and principles of reasonable contract terms.",

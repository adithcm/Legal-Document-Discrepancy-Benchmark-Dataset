                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Distributor agrees to abide by Lucid's standard payment terms, which are as follows; One Hundred (100) per cent of order value by sixty ( 90 ) day irrevocable letter of credit when order is placed on Lucid.",
                "changed_text": "The Distributor agrees to abide by Lucid's standard payment terms, which are as follows; One Hundred (100) per cent of order value by thirty (30) day irrevocable letter of credit when order is placed on Lucid.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a 90-day letter of credit payment term. Reducing it to 30 days could be considered unconscionable and conflict with standard commercial practices, particularly if this is significantly shorter than industry norms and places undue financial strain on the distributor. This could also be seen as a violation of good faith and fair dealing, potentially making the term unenforceable under New York law if it's deemed oppressive.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provisions regarding good faith and fair dealing; principles of unconscionability under New York contract law.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this agreement by providing Thirty days Written Notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 90 days' written notice for termination. Reducing this to 30 days could be problematic if state laws (e.g., New York, the governing law) require a longer notice period for contract termination, particularly if significant investments or ongoing obligations are involved. A shorter notice period might be deemed unreasonable and a violation of good faith.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential conflict with New York state law requirements for reasonable notice in contract termination, especially if the agreement implies ongoing obligations or investments. Principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Notice shall be effective (a) upon receipt if personally delivered (b) upon confirmation of transmission if sent via facsimile and (c) two (2) business days after deposit with the courier or an official depository of the US Post Office, if sent via recognised overnight courier of via Certified Mail, as the case may be.",
                "changed_text": "Notice shall be effective (a) upon dispatch if personally delivered (b) upon sending if sent via facsimile and (c) upon deposit with the courier or an official depository of the US Post Office, if sent via recognised overnight courier of via Certified Mail, as the case may be.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that notice is effective upon receipt or after a specific period (2 business days). Changing this to be effective upon dispatch, sending, or deposit (depending on the method) can create legal issues. This is because it shifts the risk of non-delivery or delays to the recipient, potentially conflicting with legal standards that require reasonable assurance of notice. If a critical deadline is tied to 'effective notice,' this change could unfairly prejudice the recipient if the notice is lost or delayed in transit. This could violate principles of due process and fairness, making the notice provision unenforceable in some jurisdictions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential conflict with principles of due process and fairness in contract law; may violate requirements for reasonable assurance of notice under common law or state statutes.",

                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 90 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment terms to NET 90 days could create inconsistency. While not universally illegal, such an extended payment term, especially for smaller businesses (which Sibannac, Inc. might be considered), could be deemed unconscionable or violate prompt payment laws in certain states, depending on the specific industry and business size. Texas prompt payment act for construction projects have specific deadlines, but generally a Net 90 is not permissible and is unusual.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state prompt payment laws and unconscionability principles under contract law.",

Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof, and will be automatically renewed for one (1) additional twelve month period unless either party shall notify the other in writing of its intention not to renew. Such notice must be given thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the original term. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days written notice.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for non-renewal or termination to 30 days may be problematic. Depending on the specific business relationship and the investments made by either party in reliance on the agreement, a 30-day notice period could be deemed unreasonably short and a violation of good faith and fair dealing, particularly if significant business adjustments are required. Some states, through case law, imply a reasonable notice period for contract termination, which could be longer than 30 days depending on the context.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, possible conflict with state case law requiring reasonable notice periods for contract termination.",

                "original_text": "For a period of five (5) years after termination of this Agreement, the parties shall treat as confidential all information and take every reasonable precaution and use all reasonable efforts to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of the same. The parties agree to take all steps reasonably necessary and appropriate to ensure that their employees, agents, and/or assistants treat all information as confidential and to ensure that such employees, agents, and/or assistants are familiar with and abide by the terms of this Agreement.",

The parties agree to take all steps reasonably necessary and appropriate to ensure that their employees, agents, and/or assistants treat all information as confidential and to ensure that such employees, agents, and/or assistants are familiar with and abide by the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one (1) year may be insufficient to protect trade secrets or other confidential information, depending on the nature of the information and industry practices. If the confidential information has a longer commercially valuable life, a one-year restriction may be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable, especially if it significantly harms one party while providing little benefit to the other. This could violate Texas trade secret laws.",

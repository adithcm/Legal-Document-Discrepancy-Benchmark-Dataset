                "original_text": "A Party will have ten (10) days to provide adequate assurances of performance to the other Party in a form acceptable to the other Party in its good faith discretion.",
                "changed_text": "A Party will have two (2) days to provide adequate assurances of performance to the other Party in a form acceptable to the other Party in its good faith discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides ten days for a party to provide adequate assurances of performance. Reducing this timeframe to two days creates a conflict with Section 2-609 of the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code, which implies a 'reasonable time' for providing such assurances. Two days may be deemed unreasonably short, particularly for complex issues, thus contradicting the implied 'reasonable time' standard.",

                "changed_text": "An insuring Party must deliver the following written evidence of the required insurance coverage to the other Party (Attention: Risk Management), or its designated insurance monitoring service, within one (1) day of written request and at least five (5) days in advance of the expiration of a then current policy term (if a declaration or endorsement is not available from an insurer at the time requested or required, an insuring Party will provide them as soon as the declaration or endorsement is available from the insurer):",
                "explanation": "The original text requires insurance documentation to be provided within ten days of a written request and thirty days before policy expiration. Shortening these periods to one day and five days respectively, introduces impractical and legally questionable deadlines. Insurers often require more than one day to process such requests. The change could be deemed an unreasonable business practice and contradict the implicit requirement of 'reasonable time' for compliance.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows ten days for returning or destroying confidential information. Reducing this to one day is an unreasonable timeframe. Depending on the volume and location of data, it may be impossible to comply within 24 hours. This creates a risk of non-compliance and potential breach, conflicting with the reasonable business practices required under contract law, especially regarding data handling obligations.",

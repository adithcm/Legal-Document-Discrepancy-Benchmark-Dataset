                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Adviser hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless FASC and its trustees, officers and employees (each of the foregoing an \"Indemnified Party\" and collectively the \"Indemnified Parties\") against and from any and all losses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments and suits and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Party, other than as a consequence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Indemnified Party, arising out of or in connection with this Limited Power of Attorney or any other agreement, instrument or document executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, including without limitation the reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements in connection with defending such Indemnified Party against any claim or liability related to the exercise or performance of any of FASC's powers or duties under this Limited Power of Attorney or any of the other agreements, instruments or documents executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, or the taking of any action under or in connection with any of the foregoing. The obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Limited Power of Attorney with respect to actions taken by FASC on behalf of the Adviser during the term of this Limited Power of Attorney.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless FASC and its trustees, officers and employees (each of the foregoing an \"Indemnified Party\" and collectively the \"Indemnified Parties\") against and from any and all losses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments and suits and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Party, including those arising from gross negligence on the part of an Indemnified Party but excluding only claims directly resulting from intentional willful misconduct, arising out of or in connection with this Limited Power of Attorney or any other agreement, instrument or document executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, including without limitation the reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements in connection with defending such Indemnified Party against any claim or liability related to the exercise or performance of any of FASC's powers or duties under this Limited Power of Attorney or any of the other agreements, instruments or documents executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, or the taking of any action under or in connection with any of the foregoing. The obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall terminate immediately upon the termination of this Limited Power of Attorney.",
                "explanation": "The original text excludes indemnification for gross negligence, aligning with standard practice and legal norms. The modified text includes indemnification even for gross negligence, shifting the risk unfairly and potentially violating legal standards regarding fiduciary duty and gross negligence in financial agreements. Further, changing survival language to termination contradicts typical indemnification standards, requiring indemnification to survive termination for actions taken during the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates fiduciary duty standards and legal norms concerning gross negligence. Additionally, conflicts with general contract law principles related to the survival of indemnification clauses.",

                "original_text": "Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the powers and authorities herein granted may be revoked or terminated by the Adviser at any time provided that no such revocation or termination shall be effective until FASC has received actual notice of such revocation or termination in writing from the Adviser.",
                "changed_text": "Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the powers and authorities herein granted may be revoked or terminated by the Adviser at any time without providing any notice whatsoever to FASC. FASC is responsible for monitoring the status of the agreement and assuming all risks related to the potential for revocation without notice.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the requirement for written notice before revocation is effective. Depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the agency relationship, this could be seen as a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, particularly if FASC undertakes significant obligations or expenses based on the power of attorney. Many states imply a duty to provide reasonable notice before terminating an agency relationship, especially when the agent has relied on the agreement to their detriment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in contract law, and possibly agency law depending on the degree of reliance by FASC.",

                "original_text": "This Limited Power of Attorney shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without reference to principles of conflicts of laws.",
                "changed_text": "This Limited Power of Attorney shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada, irrespective of any conflict of law principles that might otherwise apply, and the parties agree that any dispute arising under this agreement shall be subject to binding arbitration in Reno, Nevada, with no right to appeal the arbitrator's decision.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law to Nevada could introduce legal complications if the parties are primarily located and operating in Pennsylvania, as indicated earlier in the document (Delaware incorporation but Pennsylvania choice of law). More importantly, mandating binding arbitration with no right to appeal severely limits the recourse available to either party, especially FASC. While arbitration is generally enforceable, eliminating all avenues for appeal (even for egregious errors of law) is looked upon unfavorably by many courts and could be deemed unconscionable, particularly if there's a significant power imbalance between the parties. Pennsylvania has specific rules on arbitration. Furthermore, the change of location from Pennsylvania to Nevada constitutes a severe change of jurisdiction that could be deemed unenforceable depending on the relation of the contract to either state.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with principles of contract law regarding choice of law, enforceability of arbitration clauses, and the duty of good faith and fair dealing, as well as Pennsylvania's rules on arbitration.",

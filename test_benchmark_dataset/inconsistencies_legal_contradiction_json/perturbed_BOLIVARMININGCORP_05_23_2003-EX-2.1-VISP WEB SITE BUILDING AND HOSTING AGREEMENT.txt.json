                "original_text": "This agreement shall renew automatically each year thereafter, unless either party serves written notice of its intention not to renew, on the other at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the then current term of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This agreement shall renew automatically each year thereafter, unless either party serves written notice of its intention not to renew, on the other at least 15 days prior to the expiration of the then current term of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the notice period for non-renewal to 15 days. New York law, which governs the contract according to section 11, might require a longer notification period for automatic renewal clauses to be enforceable, especially in contracts with small businesses or consumers. A 15-day notice period may be deemed unreasonable and thus conflict with New York's general contract law principles of fairness and reasonable notice.",

In the event the Company fails to have its attorney issue the required opinion letter within 20 days of a written request from YourNetPlus.com or its nominee, the Company shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of 10% interest per 30 days on the value of the shares based on the closing bid price of the Company's common stock on the 20th business day following the date it receives written notice from YourNetPlus.com or their nominee. The damages shall accrue until the transfer agent receives the opinion letter",

In the event the Company fails to have its attorney issue the required opinion letter within 5 days of a written request from YourNetPlus.com or its nominee, the Company shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of 50% interest per 7 days on the value of the shares based on the closing bid price of the Company's common stock on the 5th business day following the date it receives written notice from YourNetPlus.com or their nominee. The damages shall accrue until the transfer agent receives the opinion letter",
                "explanation": "The original contract provides 20 days for the company's attorney to issue an opinion letter and stipulates a 10% interest penalty per 30 days for failure to comply. The change reduces the timeframe to 5 days and increases the penalty to 50% interest per 7 days. This could be deemed an unreasonably short timeframe and an excessive penalty, potentially violating New York law regarding liquidated damages. New York courts often scrutinize liquidated damages clauses to ensure they are not punitive and bear a reasonable proportion to the probable loss.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York law on liquidated damages, which requires that such damages be a reasonable estimate of the actual loss and not a penalty. The modified clause may be considered an unenforceable penalty due to the short timeframe and high penalty.",

The agreement to arbitrate shall not be specifically enforceable.",
                "explanation": "The modified text changes the arbitration clause in several ways that could make it unconscionable or unenforceable under New York law. Specifically, allowing the Provider to unilaterally select the arbitrator creates bias, and reducing the arbitration timeframe to 15 days is unreasonably short. Moreover, stating that the agreement to arbitrate is 'not specifically enforceable' contradicts standard arbitration practices and legal principles, rendering the entire clause questionable under New York contract law.",

                "changed_text": "Diplomat will pay such invoice within 60 days of receipt.",
                "explanation": "The change extends the payment deadline to 60 days. While not inherently illegal, excessively long payment terms could be deemed unreasonable under New York law (governing law per section 10(b)) if they significantly deviate from industry standards or create undue hardship, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing. Commercial transactions typically have shorter payment cycles, and 60 days might be considered an unfair burden on Tadeo, especially for smaller businesses relying on timely payments. Also, extending the payment time to 60 days may constitute a breach of contract which may cause damages and legal issues.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to one day is commercially unreasonable and potentially conflicts with principles of fairness and good faith implied in New York contract law. A one-day cure period may be insufficient for Diplomat to rectify complex breaches, such as technical issues or financial shortfalls. This could be seen as an oppressive term, especially if Tadeo strategically uses it to terminate the agreement. Additionally, under New York law, the breaching party is afforded a reasonable time to cure the breach, and one day will not be sufficient.",

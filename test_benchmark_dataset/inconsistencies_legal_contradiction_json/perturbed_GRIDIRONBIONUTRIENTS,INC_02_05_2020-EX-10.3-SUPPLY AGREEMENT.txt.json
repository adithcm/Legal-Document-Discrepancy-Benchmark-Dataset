                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Both Parties agree that once the Parties have agreed to transaction which includes the purchase and sale of the Product that the Buyer will remit payment upon execution of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Both Parties agree that once the Parties have agreed to transaction which includes the purchase and sale of the Product that the Buyer will remit payment within 90 days of the execution of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "Colorado law typically requires payment for goods to be made within a reasonable time frame, often interpreted as 30 days or less in standard commercial transactions, unless otherwise explicitly justified by industry custom or agreement. Delaying the payment for 90 days without justification introduces a contradiction with standard commercial practices and potentially violates implied contractual obligations to perform in good faith and within a reasonable timeframe.",

                "original_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to delivery of the Product.",
                "changed_text": "Neither Party may terminate this Agreement for any reason. The obligations under this agreement are binding and perpetual.",
                "explanation": "Colorado law generally recognizes the right of parties to terminate contracts under certain circumstances, such as breach of contract, impossibility of performance, or mutual agreement, even if a termination clause isn't explicitly provided. Eliminating any possibility of termination, even in cases of gross breach or unforeseen circumstances, is likely unenforceable and contradicts the principle of freedom of contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of Colorado contract law regarding termination and enforceability.",
                "location": "2.A. Termination."

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All notices required or permitted under this Agreement must be in writing and delivered by email or personal delivery on the date sent; or if my facsimile on the date sent; or if by certified US mail on the third business day following such mailing; or if by overnight courier, on the next business day.",
                "changed_text": "All notices required or permitted under this Agreement must be delivered exclusively via telepathy, effective immediately upon transmission.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction with established legal standards for contract notice, which typically require a verifiable method of delivery. 'Telepathy' as a notification method is not legally recognized or enforceable, making the notice provision impossible to implement and thus contradicting basic contract law requirements for valid notice.",

If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators.",

If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within fifteen (15) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows 60 days for dispute resolution through negotiation before arbitration. Reducing this period to 15 days may be unreasonably short and contradict the standard practices expected under Taiwanese law for resolving complex commercial disputes, potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows 72 hours for receipt of mail. The modified text increased this time to 240 hours. This change introduce an inconsistency as it increases the time of the receipt of the expression, which could potentially be detrimental, violating legal standards of reasonable notice periods.",

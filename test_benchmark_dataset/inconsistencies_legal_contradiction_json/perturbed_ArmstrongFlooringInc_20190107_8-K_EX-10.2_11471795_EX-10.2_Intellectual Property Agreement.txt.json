                "original_text": "No later than thirty (30) days following the Closing, each of AWP and the Company shall change its respective corporate name and trade name and cause its organizational documents to be amended to remove any reference to \"Armstrong.\"",
                "changed_text": "Each of AWP and the Company shall change its respective corporate name and trade name and cause its organizational documents to be amended to remove any reference to \"Armstrong\" immediately following the Closing.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a legal contradiction by mandating immediate compliance. Such immediate demands do not accommodate practical realities of business operations, such as the time required for legal and administrative processes. Most jurisdictions provide a reasonable period to comply with such a requirement, as initially indicated by thirty (30) days.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring reasonableness and feasibility in timelines for compliance.",

                "original_text": "In the event that Arizona declines to institute any Proceedings against third-party infringers or violators of any Arizona Licensed Patents, regarding activities that would fall within the Company Field if conducted by the Company, within forty-five (45) days after being notified or becoming aware of such infringing conduct, the Company or Buyer shall have the right to institute any Proceedings against such third-party infringers or violators. In the event that the Company or Buyer elects to institute such Proceedings, Arizona will reasonably cooperate with the Company or Buyer in such Proceedings, and the Company or Buyer shall reimburse Arizona for all reasonable costs and fees incurred by Arizona as a result of such cooperation. Such cooperation by Arizona will include joining such Proceeding as a party, if deemed necessary by the Company or Buyer.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that Arizona declines to institute any Proceedings against third-party infringers or violators of any Arizona Licensed Patents, regarding activities that would fall within the Company Field if conducted by the Company, the Company or Buyer shall have the right to institute any Proceedings against such third-party infringers or violators, without providing notice to Arizona. In the event that the Company or Buyer elects to institute such Proceedings, Arizona has no obligation to cooperate with the Company or Buyer in such Proceedings.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides the Company or Buyer a period of forty-five (45) days to institute proceedings, thereby enabling them time to assess the impact and feasibility of legal action following Arizona's decision not to pursue. Most jurisdictions would find this to be a reasonable and fair expectation in these types of agreements. By removing this time and the requirement to provide Arizona with notification before doing so, and also removing Arizona's requirement to cooperate if Buyer decides to take such action, the modification is a contradiction that deprives Arizona's Licensed IP of protection and represents a breach of standard contract law.",

                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately if the other Party breaches this Agreement. There is no requirement to provide written notice or allow any time for remedy.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'thirty (30) days' written notice' for remedying a breach and allowing immediate termination, this modification contradicts standard contract law principles of providing a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach. Most jurisdictions require that a party be given adequate notice and time to rectify a breach before termination can be enforced. This is deemed a more equitable and fair process for both parties.",

                "original_text": "(a) pay OntoChem 100,002 Euros in six (6) equal installments as follows: (i) 16,667 Euros within five (5) days after the Effective Date; and (ii) five (5) installments in the amount of 16,667 Euros on each one-month anniversary of the Effective Date, except that the last such payment will be due within thirty (30) days after completion of all activities under the Research Plan;",
                "changed_text": "(a) pay OntoChem 100,002 Euros in six (6) equal installments as follows: (i) 16,667 Euros within ninety (90) days after the Effective Date; and (ii) five (5) installments in the amount of 16,667 Euros on each three-month anniversary of the Effective Date, except that the last such payment will be due within one-hundred and eighty (180) days after completion of all activities under the Research Plan;",
                "explanation": "The original payment terms required Anixa to make initial payments to OntoChem within a short timeframe (five days after the effective date), which is now extended to ninety days. This introduces a legal contradiction because payment terms must be commercially reasonable and not create undue hardship. The modified text extends the payment deadlines significantly, potentially violating standard business practices and prompt payment laws that exist in many jurisdictions, including those impacting international transactions. These laws often mandate timely payment for services rendered. Furthermore, the extended final payment deadline (180 days) could be considered an unreasonable delay, especially in international contracts, and might conflict with regulations ensuring fair and timely compensation for services.",

                "changed_text": "4.2 Termination by Anixa. This Agreement may be terminated by Anixa, without cause, upon at least ten (10) days written notice to OntoChem.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allowed Anixa to terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice. The modified clause reduces this notice period to 10 days. This creates a legal contradiction because a 10-day notice period for termination may be considered unreasonable, especially in agreements involving substantial research and development efforts. Courts often assess the reasonableness of termination notice periods based on industry standards and the complexity of the contractual relationship. A shorter notice period could be deemed a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which is present in Delaware contract law, as it might not provide OntoChem with sufficient time to mitigate damages or wind down its activities.",

                "original_text": "2.7 Records. Each Party will retain such records for at least three (3) years following expiration or termination of this Agreement or such longer period as may be required by applicable law or regulation.",
                "changed_text": "2.7 Records. Each Party will retain such records for at least one (1) year following expiration or termination of this Agreement regardless of applicable law or regulation.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires records to be retained for at least three years or longer if required by law. The modified text shortens this to one year and overrides any longer retention periods mandated by law. This is a legal contradiction because it directly conflicts with various federal and state regulations that require longer retention periods for certain types of business records, particularly in the context of research, healthcare, and intellectual property. For example, regulations related to clinical trials or patent filings often mandate longer retention periods to ensure compliance and auditability. By explicitly stating that records will only be kept for one year 'regardless of applicable law,' the modified text creates a clear violation of these legal obligations, potentially leading to legal and regulatory penalties.",

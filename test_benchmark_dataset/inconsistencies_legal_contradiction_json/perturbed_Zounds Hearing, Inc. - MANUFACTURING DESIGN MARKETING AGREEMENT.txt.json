                "original_text": "In the event Manufacturer in good faith believes that Manufacturer's Products are nonconforming under the specifications agreed to among the Parties (the \"Standards\"), Manufacturer shall give written notice to Subcontractor specifying in detail the nonconformity within thirty (30) days of Manufacturer's receipt of such Manufacturer's Products. Upon Manufacturer's request, Subcontractor will facilitate such Manufacturer's Products being repaired or replaced, Manufacturer must return the Manufacturer's Products to Subcontractor, transportation charges prepaid by Manufacturer, within fifteen (15) days of the end of such thirty (30) date notice period.",
                "changed_text": "In the event Manufacturer in good faith believes that Manufacturer's Products are nonconforming under the specifications agreed to among the Parties (the \"Standards\"), Manufacturer shall give written notice to Subcontractor specifying in detail the nonconformity within ten (10) days of Manufacturer's receipt of such Manufacturer's Products. Upon Manufacturer's request, Subcontractor will facilitate such Manufacturer's Products being repaired or replaced, Manufacturer must return the Manufacturer's Products to Subcontractor, transportation charges prepaid by Manufacturer, within five (5) days of the end of such ten (10) date notice period.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the notification period for nonconforming products from 30 days to 10 days and the return period from 15 days to 5 days. This could be considered unreasonable under Arizona law, which generally implies a reasonable time for inspection and rejection of goods. A significantly shortened period may be deemed insufficient, especially for complex manufactured goods, thereby creating a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "This change extends the non-solicitation period from 5 years to 10 years. While Arizona law permits non-solicitation agreements, a 10-year duration, particularly in a rapidly evolving technology field, might be considered unreasonably long and an undue restraint of trade under Arizona law, especially if it significantly hinders an employee's ability to find work.",

                "explanation": "This change modifies the notice period to be 'immediately after mailing' instead of 'three days after mailing' when using certified mail. This is problematic because the sender would have no way of knowing if the package has been delivered. This is not reasonable and could cause legal implications. Three business days is an appropriate standard. The new change could be seen as a violation of standard contract law.",

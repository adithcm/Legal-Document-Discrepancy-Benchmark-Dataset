                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the British Virgin Islands.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law to the British Virgin Islands could potentially create inconsistencies, as some provisions valid under Pennsylvania law may not be valid or enforceable under British Virgin Islands law. This is especially true regarding regulations related to investment management companies, where compliance with US federal laws (like the Investment Company Act of 1940) is critical, and might be difficult to enforce under British Virgin Islands law. This introduces regulatory uncertainty.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicting with the Investment Company Act of 1940 and related SEC regulations enforced within the United States.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Amendment shall be effective as of the date first above written upon its execution and delivery by each of the parties hereto.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be effective 90 days after the date first above written, regardless of execution or delivery by either party.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the effective date by 90 days and making it independent of execution creates a conflict. Contract law generally dictates that an agreement is effective upon mutual assent (execution and delivery). Enforcing a 90-day delay regardless of when the parties actually agree introduces ambiguity and potential disputes about when obligations begin.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding the effective date of agreements upon mutual assent.",

                "original_text": "Employees of Federated Advisory Services Company provide support to portfolio managers and other employees of affiliated advisers. Such services may include development of risk management programs, production of portfolio and compliance reports for clients and/or fund Boards, coordination of client portfolios and related fixed income trade execution implementation and administration, completion of required broker and custody documentation, development and documentation of operational procedures, coordination of proxy voting activities, on-site support of hardware and software, etc.",
                "changed_text": "Employees of Federated Advisory Services Company provide support to portfolio managers and other employees of affiliated advisers. Federated Advisory Services Company is not responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable securities laws or regulations regarding any support provided. The affiliated advisors are solely responsible for compliance.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a potential conflict with regulatory requirements. By stating that Federated Advisory Services Company is not responsible for ensuring compliance, despite providing support related to risk management, compliance reports, and trade execution, it may violate regulations that require entities providing such services to share responsibility for compliance. This attempts to shift all liability to the affiliated advisors which may not be legally permissible for the services provided.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates securities laws and regulations mandating shared responsibility for compliance among parties involved in providing investment advisory services.",

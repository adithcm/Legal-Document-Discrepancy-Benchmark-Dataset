                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "You must find a suitable Center site within 90 days of signing the Franchise Agreement, unless we mutually agree otherwise. If we cannot agree on a Center location, within 4 months, we may a) extend your search time, b) exchange your territory, or c) terminate your Franchise and refund up to 70% of your Franchise Fee, at our sole discretion.",
                "changed_text": "You must find a suitable Center site within 30 days of signing the Franchise Agreement. If we cannot agree on a Center location, within 60 days, we may a) extend your search time, b) exchange your territory, or c) terminate your Franchise and refund up to 70% of your Franchise Fee, at our sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows 90 days to find a suitable center site. Reducing this to 30 days places an unreasonable burden on the franchisee and could violate franchise laws requiring a reasonable time for site selection. The text allows 4 months to agree on a center location. Reducing this to 60 days places an unreasonable burden on the franchisee.",
                "contradicted_law": "Franchise laws regarding reasonable timeframes for site selection and due diligence (Varies by state, but generally requires a reasonable period).",

                "changed_text": "AIRSOPURE shall notify You of its approval or disapproval within 2 days from the date of receipt by AIRSOPURE of such materials.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame for approving marketing and promotional materials to 2 days is an unreasonably short period for AIRSOPURE. Franchise laws require a reasonable timeframe to review advertising materials, so this modified text could be seen as an abuse of power, therefore a legal contradiction.",
                "contradicted_law": "Franchise laws regarding reasonable timeframes for franchisor approval of marketing materials (Varies by state, but generally requires a reasonable period).",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "AIRSOPURE shall have the option, within 15 days after receipt of such written notice, to notify You that AIRSOPURE elects to purchase the rights and license granted herein or stock ownership on the same terms and conditions as the bona fide written offer.",
                "changed_text": "AIRSOPURE shall have the option, within 5 days after receipt of such written notice, to notify You that AIRSOPURE elects to purchase the rights and license granted herein or stock ownership on the same terms and conditions as the bona fide written offer.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that AIRSOPURE has 15 days to decide whether to purchase the franchise rights and license. Changing it to 5 days puts pressure on the franchisee when the review for decision to either purchase the franchise or the stock can take longer to come to a sound decision. This is a legal contradiction of franchise agreements because it is an unreasonable review time.",
                "contradicted_law": "Franchise laws regarding the right of first refusal and reasonable timeframes for exercising that right (Varies by state, but generally requires a reasonable period).",

                "explanation": "The change from 30 days to 10 days to cure a ratings event may be deemed unreasonable and insufficient time to find a suitable assignee or provide adequate collateral, potentially triggering a termination event prematurely and violating implicit obligations of good faith and fair dealing under New York law, the governing law of the contract, especially if market conditions make quick resolution difficult.  This could expose UBS AG to undue penalties or force hasty and unfavorable actions.",

                "explanation": "Shortening the timeframe for compliance after a Swap Disclosure Event from 5 to 1 business day creates an unreasonably tight deadline. This could lead to non-compliance with Regulation AB, as it may be impossible to gather and provide the necessary financial disclosures or find a suitable replacement entity in such a short period.

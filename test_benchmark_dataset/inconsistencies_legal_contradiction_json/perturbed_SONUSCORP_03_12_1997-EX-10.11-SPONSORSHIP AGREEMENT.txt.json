                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All such representations and warranties shall not merge in or be prejudiced by, and shall survive for a period of three years from the completion of the distribution of the Units.",
                "changed_text": "All such representations and warranties shall not merge in or be prejudiced by, and shall survive for a period of six months from the completion of the distribution of the Units.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the survival period of representations and warranties to six months may be unreasonably short and contradict common legal expectations for the duration of such protections, especially considering the complexities and potential long-term impacts of securities distributions. This short survival period could violate the principle of good faith and fair dealing, rendering the clause potentially unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding reasonable terms and good faith, potentially conflicting with common law principles regarding enforceability of contract terms.",

                "original_text": "Any notice mailed as aforesaid shall be deemed to have been received by and given to the addressee on the fifth  Business Day following the date of mailing except in the event of a  disruption  of postal  service,  in which event  notice shall be delivered  personally  or given by telex,  telegram or  telecopy.",
                "changed_text": "Any notice mailed as aforesaid shall be deemed to have been received by and given to the addressee on the tenth Business Day following the date of mailing except in the event of a disruption of postal service, in which event notice shall be delivered personally or given by telex, telegram or telecopy.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the notice period to 10 business days, especially in a context where securities regulations and timely information are crucial, is an unreasonably long notice period. This is especially problematic if it delays responses or actions required by securities laws. Such extended delays may violate obligations to provide prompt and timely disclosures as required by the British Columbia Securities Commission.",
                "contradicted_law": "British Columbia Securities Act, which mandates timely disclosure of material information and regulatory guidelines on notice periods.",

                "changed_text": "Time shall not be strictly of the essence of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the \"time is of the essence\" clause, the contract now introduces ambiguity and uncertainty regarding deadlines and performance timelines. In British Columbia law and generally, having time of the essence means strict compliance with deadlines is required and failure to comply is a material breach. Removing this clause could result in uncertainty and delays in fulfilling obligations.",

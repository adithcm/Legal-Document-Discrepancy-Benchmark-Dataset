                "changed_text": "Turpin shall deliver to the Company all Work Product and Company Property, including all originals and copies thereof, in Turpin's possession and/or control, only upon the Company's explicit request within 180 days of the termination of Turpin's employment with the Company; otherwise, Turpin has no obligation to return Work Product or Company Property.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the return of company property upon termination of employment, or at the request of the company. The modified text limits the time the company can request the return of company property to 180 days, implying that after this deadline, the returning of the property is no longer required. This conflicts with general legal principles related to the protection of trade secrets and company property, which generally do not have such strict time limitations and depend on how long the information remains protectable as a trade secret.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement states that after the termination of the agreement, Turpin is obliged to help with any legal documentation. By limiting this to 30 days, the modified text restricts the company's ability to secure intellectual property rights, potentially conflicting with legal obligations for reasonable cooperation in intellectual property matters. This is legally problematic as it creates a finite timeframe in assisting the company, regardless of the legal requirements.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires written notice for termination. The modified version allows immediate termination without notice. This contradicts employment standards legislation, which requires employers (and sometimes employees) to provide reasonable notice of termination or pay in lieu thereof. Terminating 'at will' without notice can violate these laws.",

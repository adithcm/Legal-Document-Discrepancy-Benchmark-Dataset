                "original_text": "1.6 HDI shall have the Site fully operational and accessible on demand by users of the Internet no later than sixty (60) days from the date this Agreement has been executed by both Parties. In the event that HDI fails to have the Site fully operational within seventy (70) days from the date of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without penalty.",

In the event that HDI fails to have the Site fully operational within one hundred thirty (130) days from the date of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without penalty.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the deadline for HDI to make the site fully operational. If the operational location is in California, California law requires certain contracts to be completed within a reasonable time frame.

                "explanation": "The payment term has been changed from monthly within 30 days to quarterly within 90 days. Delayed payment terms, especially for smaller businesses, can be seen as an unfair business practice under various state laws relating to prompt payment, potentially leading to legal challenges.",

Subject to the provisions of subparagraph 2.6(b) below, and if you have substantially complied with all provisions of this Agreement and all other agreements between us, on expiration of the Initial Term, if you refurbish and decorate the Premises, replace fixtures, furnishings, wall decor, furniture, equipment, and signs and otherwise modify the Franchise in compliance with specifications and standards then applicable under new or renewal franchises for The Joint Corp. Location franchises, you will have the right to renew the Franchise for one (1) additional term of ten (10) years (the \"Renewal Term\").",

                "explanation": "Franchise agreements often have regulations regarding renewal terms. Changing the renewal term from 10 years to 5 years could be problematic, as it may be seen as an unreasonably short renewal period, potentially violating laws related to fair franchising practices, depending on specific state regulations.",

If we will permit renewal, our notice will state what actions, if any, you must take to correct the deficiencies in your operation of the Franchise or of the Premises, and will specify the time period in which those deficiencies must be corrected or other requirements satisfied. Renewal of the Franchise will be conditioned on your continued compliance with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement up to the date of expiration. If we send a notice of non-renewal, it will state the reasons for our refusal to renew.",

However, you must pay to us a renewal fee equal to 25% of our then-current initial franchise fee for Start-up Locations. You and your Principal Owners and your and their spouses must also execute general releases, in a form satisfactory to us, of any and all claims against us and our affiliates, and our and their respective owners, officers, directors, employees, and agents.",

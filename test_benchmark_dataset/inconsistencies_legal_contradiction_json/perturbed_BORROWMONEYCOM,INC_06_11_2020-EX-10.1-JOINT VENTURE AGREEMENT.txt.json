                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "25. Regular Member meetings will be held quarterly. Minutes of the meetings will be maintained on file.",
                "changed_text": "25. Regular Member meetings will be held annually. Minutes of the meetings will be maintained on file.",
                "explanation": "Changing the meeting frequency to annually may violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Florida law, particularly if critical decisions are delayed unreasonably.  While Florida law doesn't mandate specific meeting frequency for joint ventures, unreasonably infrequent meetings could be challenged if they demonstrably harm a member's interests or impede the venture's purpose.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Florida Law)",
                "location": "Section 25"

                "original_text": "37. On dissolution, the Venture will be liquidated promptly and within a reasonable time.",
                "changed_text": "37. On dissolution, the Venture will be liquidated at the Managers' sole discretion with no specific timeframe.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 'promptly and within a reasonable time' requirement introduces ambiguity and potential for abuse in the liquidation process. Florida law requires that liquidation of assets after the dissolution of a business venture be done in a fair and reasonable manner, and giving managers sole discretion with no specific timeframe could be construed as a breach of fiduciary duty if it unduly delays payments to members or diminishes the value of assets.",

                "location": "Section 37"

                "original_text": "67. Any notices or delivery required here will be deemed completed when hand-delivered, delivered by agent, or seven (7) days after being placed in the post, postage prepaid, to the Members at the addresses contained in this Agreement or as the Members may later designate in writing.",
                "changed_text": "67. Any notices or delivery required here will be deemed completed when hand-delivered, delivered by agent, or two (2) days after being placed in the post, postage prepaid, to the Members at the addresses contained in this Agreement or as the Members may later designate in writing.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the mail delivery timeframe to two days is likely unreasonable and contradicts the concept of reasonable notice, potentially violating due process, especially if critical decisions or deadlines are dependent on timely receipt of notice.  While Florida law doesn't specify notice periods for joint ventures, courts generally require notice to be reasonable under the circumstances.",

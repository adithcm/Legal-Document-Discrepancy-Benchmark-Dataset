                "original_text": "(d) As used in this Agreement, the term \"Post-Term Period\" shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of two (2) years from the date of: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement (regardless of the cause for termination); (c) termination of Member's employment with Franchisee; and/or (d) a final order of a duly authorized arbitrator, panel of arbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been taken) with respect to any of the foregoing or with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement; either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or entity).",
                "changed_text": "(d) As used in this Agreement, the term \"Post-Term Period\" shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of five (5) years from the date of: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement (regardless of the cause for termination); (c) termination of Member's employment with Franchisee; and/or (d) a final order of a duly authorized arbitrator, panel of arbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been taken) with respect to any of the foregoing or with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement; either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or entity).",
                "explanation": "Increasing the non-compete period to five years may be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable in some states, such as California, which disfavors overly broad non-compete agreements, especially those extending beyond one year from termination of employment. This alteration creates a potential legal contradiction, especially if the agreement is enforced in a state with stricter limitations on non-compete durations.",

                "original_text": "3. Injunctive Relief. Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury, and Member agrees to pay all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "3. Injunctive Relief. Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will automatically entitle Franchisor to immediate injunctive relief without the necessity of proving irreparable harm or inadequacy of monetary damages, and Member agrees to pay all court costs and attorney's fees incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text acknowledges potential irreparable injury, the modified text eliminates the requirement for the Franchisor to prove irreparable harm to obtain injunctive relief, which is generally required by courts before granting an injunction. Therefore, this creates a potential legal contradiction to accepted legal practice for injunctive relief. This is not in accordance with common law and is intended to make it exceedingly difficult for the Member to defend against an injunction.",

No delay or failure by the Franchisor or Franchisee to exercise any right under this Agreement, and no partial or single exercise of that right, shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right provided herein, and no waiver of any violation of any terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any succeeding violation of the same or any other provision of this Agreement.",

No delay or failure by the Franchisor or Franchisee to exercise any right under this Agreement, regardless of the duration or frequency, shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right provided herein, and no waiver of any violation of any terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any succeeding violation of the same or any other provision of this Agreement, even if such violations are ongoing and known.",
                "explanation": "This alteration attempts to eliminate any possibility of implied waiver through continued tolerance of breaches. However, courts may still find a waiver if the franchisor consistently fails to enforce a provision over a significant period, creating an implied agreement to modify or waive the requirement. Some states have specific regulations regarding implied waivers; this change aims to negate those protections, potentially leading to legal challenges.",

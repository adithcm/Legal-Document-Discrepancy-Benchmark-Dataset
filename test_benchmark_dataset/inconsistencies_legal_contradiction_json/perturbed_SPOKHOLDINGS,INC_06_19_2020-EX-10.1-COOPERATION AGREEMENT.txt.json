                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The White Hat Parties shall provide written evidence of the votes made in accordance with the foregoing sentence to the Company no later than ten business days before the 2020 Annual Meeting.",
                "changed_text": "The White Hat Parties shall provide written evidence of the votes made in accordance with the foregoing sentence to the Company no later than one business day before the 2020 Annual Meeting.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement allows ten business days for providing written evidence of votes. Reducing this to one business day may not provide sufficient time for the Company to review and address any potential issues, potentially hindering their ability to respond effectively, especially if the meeting involves complex proposals or unexpected voting outcomes. This is particularly problematic under Delaware law, which emphasizes the importance of informed decision-making by boards and stockholders.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware General Corporation Law, which implies duties of care and good faith, requiring sufficient time for informed decision-making.",
                "location": "Section 4"

                "changed_text": "The White Hat Parties agree that they shall not issue a press release regarding the subject matter of this Agreement for a period of one (1) week after the date of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Extending the restriction to a period of one week is an unreasonably short duration. This restriction could be challenged as an unreasonable restraint on free speech, particularly if the information contained in the press release is material to investors. Under Delaware law, restrictions on communications must be narrowly tailored and reasonable in scope and duration to be enforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (freedom of speech) and Delaware law regarding reasonable restrictions on communications related to corporate matters.",

                "original_text": "Unless earlier terminated as provided in this Agreement, upon the expiration of the Support Period in accordance with Section 4, this Agreement shall immediately and automatically terminate in its entirety and no Party shall have any further rights or obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, no Party shall be released from any breach of this Agreement that occurred prior to the termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Unless earlier terminated as provided in this Agreement, upon the expiration of the Support Period in accordance with Section 4, this Agreement shall immediately and automatically terminate in its entirety and no Party shall have any further rights or obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, any existing claims of breach of this Agreement that occurred prior to termination must be reported to the opposing party within three (3) days.",
                "explanation": "Imposing a three-day deadline for reporting any existing claims of breach is unreasonably short. This timeline could prejudice a party's ability to investigate and assess the full extent of damages arising from a breach, potentially violating fundamental fairness principles and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Delaware law. A more reasonable period would typically be aligned with the statute of limitations for contract claims.",

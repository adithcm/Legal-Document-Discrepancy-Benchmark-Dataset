                "original_text": "5.2 Contractor's Right to Terminate Agreement for any Reason. The Contractor may terminate this Agreement and his or her engagement for any reason at any time upon providing 30 days advance notice in writing to Emerald. Termination will be effective, at Emeralds' election, on a date which is no earlier than the date such notice is received and no later than the date which is 30 days following that date.",
                "changed_text": "5.2 Contractor's Right to Terminate Agreement for any Reason. The Contractor may terminate this Agreement and his or her engagement for any reason at any time upon providing 5 days advance notice in writing to Emerald. Termination will be effective, at Emeralds' election, on a date which is no earlier than the date such notice is received and no later than the date which is 5 days following that date.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires 30 days' notice for termination by the Contractor. This has been changed to 5 days. In British Columbia, Canada, where this contract is governed, a 30-day notice period is generally considered standard and reasonable for such agreements to allow the company sufficient time to find a replacement or redistribute workload. Reducing it to 5 days may not meet the standard of 'reasonable notice' required under common law principles of contract law, especially considering the senior role of the consultant.",

                "original_text": "5.5 Consequences of Termination of Agreement. All obligations of the Company to the Contractor hereunder shall immediately terminate and cease as of the date of the termination of the Contractor's engagement. The Company shall only be obliged to pay the Fees agreed to but not yet paid as of the date of termination, with such payment to be made within 30 days of the date of termination.",
                "changed_text": "5.5 Consequences of Termination of Agreement. All obligations of the Company to the Contractor hereunder shall immediately terminate and cease as of the date of the termination of the Contractor's engagement. The Company shall only be obliged to pay the Fees agreed to but not yet paid as of the date of termination, with such payment to be made within 60 days of the date of termination.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states that final payment to the contractor will be made within 30 days of termination. Increasing this period to 60 days may violate employment standards, depending on the specifics of the contractor's status and the nature of the fees owed. Delayed payment could be construed as a breach of contract and potentially violate provincial labour laws regarding timely payment of wages or fees for services rendered.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of British Columbia's Employment Standards Act regarding timely payment of wages or fees upon termination.",

                "original_text": "6.2 Confidentiality. \"Confidential Information\" means information disclosed to the Contractor as a consequence of or through its, his or her position as a director, officer, employee or consultant of Emerald, which information is not generally known in the industry in which Emerald operates. All Confidential Information will, during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five years thereafter, be held by the Contractor in a fiduciary capacity for Emerald, in the strictest confidence, and will be used by the Contractor solely for the benefit of Emerald, and will not be used by the Contractor, directly or indirectly, for any purpose other than for the benefit of Emerald, nor will the Contractor divulge or communicate, directly or indirectly, such verbally, in writing or otherwise to any party.",

                "explanation": "The original confidentiality clause extends for five years post-termination. Reducing this to one year could be deemed insufficient to protect Emerald's legitimate business interests, particularly concerning trade secrets and proprietary information. Depending on the industry and the nature of the confidential information, a one-year period might be challenged as unreasonably short, particularly in comparison to what is considered standard in British Columbia for similar consulting agreements, risking its enforceability in court.",

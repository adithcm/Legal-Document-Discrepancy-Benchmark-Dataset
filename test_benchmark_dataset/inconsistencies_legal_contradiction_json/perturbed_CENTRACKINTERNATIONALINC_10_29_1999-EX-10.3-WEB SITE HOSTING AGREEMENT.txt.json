                "original_text": "The Customer is responsible for paying i-on the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450. The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
                "changed_text": "The Customer is responsible for paying i-on the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450. The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 28th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment due date to the 28th of the month could potentially conflict with Florida's prompt payment laws if the contract involves services related to construction or other industries where specific payment deadlines are mandated. Florida Statute 215.422 dictates that state agencies, and by extension, contracts involving those agencies, must adhere to payment schedules which this change could violate if invoices are not processed within the mandated timeframe. This creates a legal inconsistency.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than five (5) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the non-renewal notice period to five (5) days may conflict with general principles of contract law, which often require reasonable notice for termination or non-renewal, especially in ongoing service agreements. While Florida does not have a specific statute mandating notice periods for all contracts, case law suggests that commercially reasonable notice is required. Five days may be deemed insufficient, creating a legal challenge to the enforceability of the automatic renewal clause. In certain contexts, particularly those involving significant business relationships, such short notice can be seen as unconscionable and legally dubious.",

                "original_text": "i-on will not be liable under any circumstances for any lost profits or other consequential damages, even if i-on has been advised as to the possibility of such damages. i-on's liability for damages to the Customer for any cause whatsoever, regardless of the form of action, and whether in contract or in tort, including negligence, shall be limited to one (1) month's fees and the remaining portion of any prepaid fees.",
                "changed_text": "i-on will not be liable under any circumstances for any lost profits or other consequential damages, even if i-on has been advised as to the possibility of such damages. i-on's liability for damages to the Customer for any cause whatsoever, regardless of the form of action, and whether in contract or in tort, including negligence, shall be limited to $100.",
                "explanation": "Limiting liability to a fixed amount of $100, regardless of the severity of the damages or the fees paid by the customer, could be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable under Florida law, particularly if i-on's negligence is significant. Florida courts scrutinize limitation of liability clauses, and such a drastically low cap might be viewed as against public policy, especially if it effectively absolves i-on of responsibility for serious breaches of contract or gross negligence. This fixed amount may not be considered an adequate remedy, leading to a potential legal conflict.",

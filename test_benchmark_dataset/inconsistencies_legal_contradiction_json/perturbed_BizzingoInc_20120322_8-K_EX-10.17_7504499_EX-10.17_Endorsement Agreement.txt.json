                "original_text": "Theismann agrees that such material, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Bizzingo to have been approved hereunder if the same is  not disapproved by the Theismann in writing within fourteen (14) days after Theismann's receipt thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Theismann agrees that such material, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Bizzingo to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by the Theismann in writing within two (2) days after Theismann's receipt thereof.",
                "explanation": "This change shortens the approval timeframe for endorsement materials to two days. Such a short period could be deemed unreasonable, especially considering potential legal reviews or personal considerations Theismann might need to undertake, potentially conflicting with general contract law principles requiring reasonable timeframes for review and approval.",

                "explanation": "This revision extends the payment deadline for royalties to 90 days after the quarter's end. This alteration can create conflict with wage and payment laws in several states, including Virginia and New Jersey (where the involved parties are located), which often mandate quicker payment schedules for contracted services. Extended payment delays can lead to disputes and legal repercussions under these laws.",

                "explanation": "This modifies the timeline for Bizzingo to obtain the required insurance policy, extending it from 30 days to 180 days. While potentially contractually permissible, significantly delaying insurance coverage can increase Theismann's risk exposure during the endorsement period, potentially conflicting with industry standards of reasonable risk management.",

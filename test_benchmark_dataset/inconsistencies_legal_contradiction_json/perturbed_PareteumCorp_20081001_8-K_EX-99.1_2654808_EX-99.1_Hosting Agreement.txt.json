                "explanation": "The original text requires ELEPHANT TALK to pay all invoices within an unspecified timeframe (***). Modifying this to '10 days' creates a legal contradiction because, according to standard business practices in the Netherlands, 30 days payment terms are common and a shorter timeframe might be considered unreasonable, potentially conflicting with Dutch contract law principles that require fairness and reasonableness. Furthermore, changing the consequence of failing to meet payment terms to 'may withhold payments for up to 60 days' contradicts the creditor's right to receive timely payments and could be seen as undermining the contract's enforceability under Dutch law.

                "explanation": "Reducing the claim notification period from six months to one month could be deemed unreasonably short under Dutch law, particularly for complex commercial disputes where gathering evidence and assessing damages may require more time. This abbreviated timeframe could unduly prejudice the claimant's ability to pursue a valid claim, potentially conflicting with principles of fairness and due process under Dutch civil law.",

                "explanation": "Changing the initial period of the agreement to 6 months creates a contradiction. The agreement is a hosting agreement for mobile virtual network services and the 6 month period will be too short. This would violate Dutch commercial standards of having fair business operations. The business would likely need a year or 2 in order to generate enough profits.",

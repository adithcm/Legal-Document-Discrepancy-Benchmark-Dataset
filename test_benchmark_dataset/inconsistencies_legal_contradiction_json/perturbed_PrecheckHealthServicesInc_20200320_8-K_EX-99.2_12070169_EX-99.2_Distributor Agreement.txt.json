                "changed_text": "10. This Agreement shall be in effect until March 18. 2021, unless sooner terminated by either party upon (10) days written notice, without cause.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the written notice period for termination without cause to 10 days. Many states require a minimum of 30 days' notice for contract termination, especially for agreements of this nature, creating a potential breach of implied contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied Contract Law, potentially breach of good faith and fair dealing depending on jurisdiction and specific circumstances.",

                "changed_text": "11. In the event of termination, the Distributor shall be entitled to receive all orders accepted by the Principal prior to the date of termination and may sell the ordered Products in the Territory. Payment to be made within 90 days of Principal's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment terms to 'within 90 days of Principal's discretion' contradicts the original 'payment to be made upon shipment' and introduces ambiguity. This could violate prompt payment laws that exist in many states (including Texas, as specified in section 17) which mandates payment within a reasonable timeframe.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Prompt Payment Act and similar state laws requiring timely payment for goods and services.",

                "changed_text": "17. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the governing law from Texas to Delaware. While permissible in principle, this could conflict with specific regulations or statutes in Texas that might otherwise apply to the agreement, especially if the agreement is substantially performed in Texas. Changing the jurisdiction could impact the enforceability of certain clauses if they are valid under Texas law but not under Delaware law, or vice versa.",
                "contradicted_law": "Choice of law principles and potential conflicts with specific Texas statutes applicable to the contract's subject matter (e.g., franchise laws, if applicable).",

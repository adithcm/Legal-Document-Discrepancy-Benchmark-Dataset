                "original_text": "4.3 NTC shall invoice ALFA AESAR for payment of Products delivered to ALFA AESAR on a Net 30 day basis. Excepting any amounts disputed in good faith, balances unpaid after such period will be subject to a finance charge of 1% per month or may be offset against any balances owed by NTC to ALFA AESAR. The parties agree to work in good faith to resolve any disputed invoice. In the event such efforts do not resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days, either party may initiate Arbitration proceedings pursuant to Section 16.",
                "changed_text": "4.3 NTC shall invoice ALFA AESAR for payment of Products delivered to ALFA AESAR on a Net 90 day basis. Excepting any amounts disputed in good faith, balances unpaid after such period will be subject to a finance charge of 3% per month or may be offset against any balances owed by NTC to ALFA AESAR. The parties agree to work in good faith to resolve any disputed invoice. In the event such efforts do not resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days, either party may initiate Arbitration proceedings pursuant to Section 16.",
                "explanation": "The change to 'Net 90 day basis' and '3% per month' finance charge could potentially violate usury laws depending on the state and the specific nature of the transaction, as some states have limits on interest rates that can be charged. The requirement to initiate arbitration within 30 days of a dispute not being resolved may also be considered an unreasonably short timeframe, conflicting with standard commercial arbitration practices and potentially hindering a party's ability to adequately prepare their case.",

                "changed_text": "5.2 NTC may discontinue offering any Product for any reason by providing thirty (30) days advance written notice to ALFA AESAR, provided however, NTC shall continue supplying ALFA AESAR with such discontinued Product until the expiration of such thirty (30) day notice period.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the advance written notice period to thirty days may be deemed unreasonable or insufficient under certain state franchise laws or business opportunity laws, which often require a longer notice period to protect distributors from abrupt termination or significant changes in their business relationship.",

NTC shall promptly pay ALFA AESAR for any deficiencies between the commission earned and the commission paid to ALFA AESAR.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the audit timeframe and notification conflicts with standard accounting practices and legal principles requiring reasonable access to records for verification purposes, especially post-termination. States mandate specific timeframes for retaining financial records for audit purposes.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Alternate Director shall not hold office for a period longer than that permissible to the Original IMPCO Director in whose place he has been appointed.",
                "changed_text": "The Alternate Director shall hold office indefinitely, irrespective of the Original IMPCO Director's presence or term.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts corporate governance norms and regulations. In many jurisdictions, including India (where the JVC is being incorporated), an alternate director's term is directly linked to the original director's term and absence. Allowing an alternate director to hold office indefinitely, even when the original director is present and capable, violates these established legal principles and can lead to conflicts of interest and mismanagement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Companies Act, 1956 (India) - provisions related to the appointment and tenure of alternate directors.",
                "location": "Article 3.7 a)"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "For calling a Board meeting, a notice of at least fourteen [14 ] days in advance in writing shall be given to each of the Directors, including those outside India. However, a meeting of Directors may be called by giving a shorter notice provided it is mutually agreed by the Directors.",
                "changed_text": "For calling a Board meeting, a notice of at least two [2] days in advance in writing shall be given to each of the Directors, including those outside India. A meeting of Directors may always be called by giving a shorter notice regardless of the agreement of the Directors.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts standard corporate governance practices and potentially violates legal requirements for adequate notice to directors. Reducing the notice period to two days, especially for directors outside India, significantly impairs their ability to prepare for and participate effectively in board meetings. The second sentence removes the requirement that directors must agree to waive a longer notice period. This disregards basic director rights and could lead to legal challenges based on lack of due process.",
                "contradicted_law": "Companies Act, 1956 (India) - provisions related to the notice requirements for board meetings.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, all the Parties to this Agreement shall take reasonable steps to prevent disclosure of any confidential or proprietary information to any third party, which it may have received from the JVC or other Parties to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, all the Parties to this Agreement can disclose confidential or proprietary information to third parties without taking any prevention methods.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts standard confidentiality practices and could be deemed commercially unreasonable. Reducing the confidentiality period to one year is inadequate to protect sensitive business information, especially given the nature of the joint venture and the technical know-how involved. By stating that all Parties can disclose confidential information to third parties without prevention methods violates trade secret laws, potentially causing substantial harm to the JVC.",
                "contradicted_law": "Indian Contract Act, 1872 - Section 27 (Restraint of Trade), and potential violation of trade secret laws (though India lacks specific trade secret legislation, courts often apply principles of equity and breach of confidence).",

                "original_text": "Within 7 Business Days after the end of each calendar quarter, the Billing Party shall provide the other party with an itemized statement, subject to adjustment within 30 days of receipt of such statement, setting forth the Net Revenue achieved over the preceding calendar quarter, and shall include such other information as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties (the \"Revenue Report\").",
                "changed_text": "Within 60 Business Days after the end of each calendar quarter, the Billing Party shall provide the other party with an itemized statement, subject to adjustment within 10 days of receipt of such statement, setting forth the Net Revenue achieved over the preceding calendar quarter, and shall include such other information as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties (the \"Revenue Report\").",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the Billing Party to provide an itemized statement within 7 business days, which is reasonable. Modifying this to 60 business days introduces an unreasonable delay that could be seen as a breach of contract or bad faith dealing, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most US contract laws. Also, the time to adjust the statement is reduced to 10 days, which makes it burdensome.",

The Billing Party will bear the costs of such audit if a discrepancy or error of computation in an amount greater than $10,000 in favor of the Non-Billing Party is identified.",
                "changed_text": "During such six-month period, and upon unreasonable notice to the Billing Party, the Non-Billing Party shall have the right to have an audit conducted through an unlicensed accounting firm, of any billings, collections, and taxes on such itemized statement, and to examine the records and books of account of the Billing Party in connection therewith. The Billing Party will bear the costs of such audit if a discrepancy or error of computation in an amount greater than $1,000,000 in favor of the Non-Billing Party is identified.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for audits within a reasonable two-year period by a licensed accounting firm. Changing this to a six-month period and allowing audits by an unlicensed firm creates an unreasonable restriction on the Non-Billing Party's audit rights and increases the threshold of discrepancy to $1,000,000 which is difficult to meet, making it essentially impossible to trigger the clause where the billing party bears the costs.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period from 60 days to 10 days after a *verbal* notice creates an unreasonably short timeframe to remedy a breach, potentially leading to wrongful termination. Most jurisdictions require written notice for material breaches to allow for proper documentation and reasonable opportunity to cure. Verbal notice and a short cure period could be deemed a breach of good faith.",

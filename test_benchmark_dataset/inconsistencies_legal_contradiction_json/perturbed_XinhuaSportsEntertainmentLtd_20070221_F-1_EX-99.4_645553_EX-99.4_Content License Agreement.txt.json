                "explanation": "Under contract law principles of reasonable notice, especially in international commercial agreements, thirty days is a common benchmark for termination notices. Reducing this to ten days may be deemed unreasonable and could potentially conflict with legal expectations for fair notice, leading to legal challenges.",

Delaying that delivery to one week may cause issues that can cause harm to either party.

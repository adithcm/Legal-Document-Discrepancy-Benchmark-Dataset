CONSULTANT agrees that during its consultancy for REIT and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of its consultancy with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, it will not, for itself or any other person or entity: (a) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company's employees, contractors, independent contractors or any person who provides services to the Company to terminate or reduce their employment or other relationship with the Company; (b) hire any individual who is (or was within the six (6) months immediately preceding such hiring, unless such employee was terminated from such employment by Company) an employee, exclusive contractor, or exclusive independent contractor of the Company; or (c) attempt to do any of the foregoing.",

CONSULTANT agrees that during its consultancy for REIT and for a period of twenty-four (24) months immediately following the termination of its consultancy with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, it will not, for itself or any other person or entity: (a) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company's employees, contractors, independent contractors or any person who provides services to the Company to terminate or reduce their employment or other relationship with the Company; (b) hire any individual who is (or was within the twelve (12) months immediately preceding such hiring, unless such employee was terminated from such employment by Company) an employee, exclusive contractor, or exclusive independent contractor of the Company; or (c) attempt to do any of the foregoing.",
                "explanation": "The modified text extends the non-solicitation period to 24 months and the period of not hiring former employees to 12 months which may be considered unreasonably long and broad under Virginia law, especially if the consultant's role is not highly sensitive or the restrictions are not narrowly tailored to protect legitimate business interests. Virginia courts disfavor non-compete agreements and restrictive covenants.",

CONSULTANT agrees that during its consultancy for REIT and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of its consultancy with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, it will not: (a) solicit, entice or induce any Customer for the purpose of providing, or provide, products or services that are competitive with the products or services provided by the Company, or (b) solicit, entice, or induce any Customer to terminate or reduce its business with (or refrain from increasing its business with) the Company. As used in this Section 7.2, \"Customer\" means any person or entity to which the Company provided products or services, including any tenants of the Company's properties, (or was invested in real estate owned by the Company), and with which CONSULTANT had contact on behalf of the Company, within the last twelve (12) months of its consultancy with the Company.",

                "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period for customers to twenty-four (24) months may be deemed overly broad and unreasonable under Virginia law. The definition of 'Customer' also relies on contact within the past twenty-four (24) months. This prolonged restriction could be challenged as unduly hindering the consultant's ability to earn a livelihood, particularly if the consultant's role involved a limited subset of customers or if the company's customer base is vast and rapidly changing. Under Virginia law, covenants must be narrowly tailored to protect the employer's legitimate business interests and must not be unduly restrictive on the employee's ability to find employment.",

CONSULTANT agrees that during its consultancy for REIT and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of its consultancy with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, it will not: (a) have any ownership interest in, or participate in the financing, operation, management or control of, any Competitor; or (b) engage in or perform services for any Competitor, if such services either (1) are the same as or similar to (individually or in the aggregate) the services CONSULTANT performed for the Company during its consultancy with the Company, or (2) are performed with respect to products or services of the Competitor that are competitive with the products or services provided by the Company with which CONSULTANT was involved during its consultancy with the Company or about which it received Proprietary Information during its consultancy with the Company. As used in this section, \"Competitor\" means: (i) any private or publicly traded real estate investment trust, fund or other investment vehicle or program whose principal place of business is in Virginia or any other state in which the Company owns real estate and whose business strategy is based on investing in, acquiring or developing flex/industrial, retail, multifamily and limited service hotel real estate, whether directly or indirectly through joint ventures, or (ii) any entity whose principal place of business is in Virginia or any other state in which the Company owns real estate and that advises (including any external advisor) such investment vehicles or programs. It is agreed that ownership of no more than 1% of the outstanding voting stock of a publicly traded corporation will not constitute a violation of Section 7.3.",

CONSULTANT agrees that during its consultancy for REIT and for a period of eighteen (18) months immediately following the termination of its consultancy with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, it will not: (a) have any ownership interest in, or participate in the financing, operation, management or control of, any Competitor; or (b) engage in or perform services for any Competitor, if such services either (1) are the same as or similar to (individually or in the aggregate) the services CONSULTANT performed for the Company during its consultancy with the Company, or (2) are performed with respect to products or services of the Competitor that are competitive with the products or services provided by the Company with which CONSULTANT was involved during its consultancy with the Company or about which it received Proprietary Information during its consultancy with the Company.

It is agreed that ownership of no more than 1% of the outstanding voting stock of a publicly traded corporation will not constitute a violation of Section 7.3.",
                "explanation": "By expanding the non-compete period to eighteen (18) months and broadening the definition of 'Competitor' to include entities whose principal place of business is in *any* state in the United States, the non-compete clause becomes overly broad. This significantly restricts the consultant's future employment options, potentially beyond what is reasonably necessary to protect the company's legitimate business interests. Virginia courts require non-compete agreements to be narrowly tailored geographically and temporally.",

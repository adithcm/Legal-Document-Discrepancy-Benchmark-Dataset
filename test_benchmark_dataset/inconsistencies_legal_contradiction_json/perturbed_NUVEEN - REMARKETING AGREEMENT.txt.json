                "explanation": "The original text requires 90 days' notice for the Remarketing Agent to resign and 60 days' notice for the Fund to remove the Remarketing Agent. The modified text reduces these notice periods to 10 days and 5 days, respectively. Such short notice periods may not provide adequate time for the Fund or Remarketing Agent to find a suitable replacement, potentially disrupting the remarketing process and harming the interests of the Fund's investors. This can violate general principles of contract law that require reasonable notice for termination to avoid undue hardship or prejudice to either party.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the delivery timeframe for the portfolio holdings report to 60 days weakens investor protection by delaying access to vital portfolio information. This delay may hinder their ability to make informed decisions and assess the Fund's risk profile accurately, contradicting regulatory emphasis on transparency and timely information dissemination for investors.",

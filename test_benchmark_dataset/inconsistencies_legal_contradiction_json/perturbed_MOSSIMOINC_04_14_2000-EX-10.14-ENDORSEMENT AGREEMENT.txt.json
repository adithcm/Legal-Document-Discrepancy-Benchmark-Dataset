                "original_text": "Company shall provide and maintain, at its own expense, commercial general liability insurance and advertising injury coverage, with limits of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00), and shall cause such policy to be endorsed to state that Duval is an additional named insured thereunder. A certificate of insurance evidencing such coverage shall be furnished to Duval within thirty (30) days of the full execution of this Agreement. Such insurance policy shall provide that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such policy or remove Duval as an additional named insured without prior written notice to Duval at least twenty (20) days in advance thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall provide and maintain, at its own expense, commercial general liability insurance and advertising injury coverage, with limits of not less than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00), and shall cause such policy to be endorsed to state that Duval is an additional named insured thereunder. A certificate of insurance evidencing such coverage shall be furnished to Duval within sixty (60) days of the full execution of this Agreement. Such insurance policy shall provide that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such policy or remove Duval as an additional named insured without prior written notice to Duval at least ten (10) days in advance thereof.",
                "explanation": "The modified text decreases the minimum insurance coverage to $500,000, which may be below the legally required minimum coverage for endorsement agreements, increases the time to furnish insurance certificate to 60 days, and reduces the prior written notice for policy termination/modification to 10 days, creating non-compliance. Many states have minimum liability coverage requirements exceeding $500,000, especially considering the endorsement's potential value and associated risks.",

                "changed_text": "If either party at any time during the Contract Period shall (i) fail to make any payment of any sum of money herein specified to be made, or (ii) fail to observe or&bbsp;perform any of the covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder (other than the payment of money), the nondefaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: as to (i) if such payment is not made within five (5) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make payment, or as to (ii) if such default is not cured within fifteen (15) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default.",
                "explanation": "The modified text reduces the cure period for payment defaults to 5 days and general defaults to 15 days. This is a legal contradiction because many jurisdictions and standard business practices consider such short cure periods unreasonable, particularly for complex contractual breaches. It also may conflict with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing. For instance, Ohio law requires a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach.",

                "changed_text": "Past due payments hereunder shall bear interest at the rate of five percent (5%) per month.",
                "explanation": "The original clause sets the interest rate at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum permitted by law. The modified clause sets the interest rate at a flat 5% per month, or 60% annually. This potentially violates usury laws in Ohio (where arbitration is designated), as Ohio Revised Code Section 1343.01 generally limits interest rates significantly below 60% annually. The change removes the safeguard of complying with the maximum permissible legal rate.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree that the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, will occur at the sole discretion of OneMain Holdings, Inc. and may not be filed at all.",
                "explanation": "The modified text makes the filing of Schedule 13D and its amendments discretionary rather than obligatory, directly contradicting SEC regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which mandates timely and accurate filings by beneficial owners of more than 5% of a company's equity securities. This change creates non-compliance because it removes the legal requirement to file, effectively nullifying the purpose of Rule 13d-1(k).",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement will only be considered valid if executed in a single original counterpart. Copies or electronic signatures will not be accepted.",
                "explanation": "This change restricts the manner of execution, contradicting the common and legally accepted practice of executing agreements in counterparts, as recognized under contract law and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), which allows for electronic signatures to have the same legal effect as handwritten signatures. By invalidating counterparts and electronic signatures, the modified text creates an unnecessary obstacle to contract formation and potentially jeopardizes the agreement's enforceability under modern legal standards.",

                "changed_text": "IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned hereby execute this Agreement effective three months retroactively from today's date.",
                "explanation": "This clause attempts to make the agreement effective retroactively, which can create legal issues, particularly regarding liability and regulatory compliance. If today's date is after February 20, 2020, making the agreement retroactively effective could create issues with past securities filings, tax liabilities, or other obligations arising during the period not covered by the agreement. Retroactive application is permissible in certain situations but generally avoided where it impacts vested rights or legal obligations. This creates uncertainty about the true effective date and potential conflicts with regulatory requirements regarding the timing of disclosures and filings.",

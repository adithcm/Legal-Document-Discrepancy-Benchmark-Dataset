                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Agent accepts and acknowledges that the Kallo 3 day Sales and 5 day Technical Training  Program is required to be completed by the Agent within 90 days of execution of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Agent accepts and acknowledges that the Kallo 3 day Sales and 5 day Technical Training  Program is required to be completed by the Agent within 14 days of execution of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the training completion timeframe from 90 days to 14 days could be considered an unreasonable expectation, potentially conflicting with labor laws that require sufficient time for training and professional development. Forcing employees or agents to complete extensive training in a short period may lead to inadequate preparation and potential legal challenges.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of labor laws regarding reasonable training periods.",

                "changed_text": "This agreement shall terminate:\n\ni.upon notification of a Material Breach that is not cured within 2 business days thereafter;\n ii.Failure to cure a non-material breach within fifteen days of written notice;",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure periods for both material and non-material breaches to 2 and 15 days respectively is unreasonable. Depending on the nature of the breach and the actions needed to resolve it, these shortened timeframes may not provide adequate opportunity for the breaching party to rectify the situation. This could conflict with principles of contract law that emphasize fairness and reasonable opportunity to cure breaches, potentially leading to legal disputes over premature termination.",

                "original_text": "During the term hereof and for a period of two years thereafter, each of Agent and Kallo  agrees that it will refrain from making any representation, statement, comment or any other form of communication, whether written or oral (hereinafter collectively referred to as a \"Communication\"), to any third party, including but  not limited to the principals, customers, suppliers and competitors of the other party, which Communication reflects any opinion, judgment, observation or\n\nPage 17\n\nrepresentation of fact, which has the effect or tendency to, or could have the effect or tendency to, disparage,  denigrate, criticize or otherwise reflect negatively on the other party and/or the other party's products, services,  officers, directors, shareholders, employees or investors (a \"Disparaging Communication\").",

                "explanation": "Changing the non-disparagement clause from 'two years' to 'perpetually thereafter' is unreasonable and likely unenforceable. Perpetual non-disparagement violates public policy favoring free speech and creates an undue restriction on future conduct. Courts are unlikely to uphold such a broad and indefinite restriction. It can contradict applicable laws related to free speech and restraint of trade.",

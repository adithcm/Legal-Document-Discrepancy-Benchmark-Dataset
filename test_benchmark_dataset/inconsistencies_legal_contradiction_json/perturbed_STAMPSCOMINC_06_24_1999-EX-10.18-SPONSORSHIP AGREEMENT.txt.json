                "original_text": "Client may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Intuit, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect all relevant records of Intuit upon which the calculation of Impressions under the Usage Reports are based during Client's normal business hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in connection with the inspection will be paid by Client unless the number of Impressions are determined to have been less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the Impressions due to Client, in which case Client will be responsible for the payment of the reasonable fees for such inspection.   In addition, if the audit reveals such shortfall in the number of Impressions generated, Intuit shall continue to display Client's Banner Advertisements, Client Graphics, Sponsor Client Graphics and Links on the Intuit Sites as set forth herein.  The audit rights set forth herein shall continue for one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement for any reason.  No such audit may occur more than once a year during the Term.",
                "changed_text": "Client may, upon no less than fifteen (15) days prior written notice to Intuit, cause an independent auditor selected by Intuit to inspect all relevant records related to Impressions. The fees charged by such auditor will always be paid by the Client. The audit rights set forth herein shall expire immediately upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason. No such audit may occur more than once a quarter during the Term.",
                "explanation": "The modified text reduces the notice period for audits from 30 days to 15 days, potentially conflicting with standard audit notification practices and fairness principles. It also mandates that the auditor is selected by Intuit, creating a potential conflict of interest and compromising the independence of the audit, which could be seen as a breach of good faith and fair dealing. The audit rights are shortened to end immediately after termination of the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding good faith and fair dealing; potential conflict with California regulations on audit practices if the auditor is not independent.",

                "original_text": "Within fifteen (15) days after the end of each month, Client will provide a monthly report (the      \"Transaction Fee Report\") to Intuit. The Transaction Fee Report will report      the Net Transaction Revenue and Transaction Fees for such month. All      Transaction Fees due per the Transaction Fee Report will be paid with the      submission of such Report.",
                "changed_text": "Within forty-five (45) days after the end of each month, Client will provide a monthly report (the \"Transaction Fee Report\") to Intuit. Transaction Fees due per the Transaction Fee Report will be paid within 90 days of the submission of such Report.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the payment timeline can create legal and financial inconsistencies. The original timeline of 15 days for report submission and immediate payment ensures timely revenue for Intuit. Extending the timeline to 45 days for report submission and 90 days for payment introduces significant delays, potentially impacting Intuit's cash flow and financial planning. Additionally, it creates a potential breach of contract if the original agreement stipulated a shorter payment period.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract if the original agreement's payment terms are not met; potential violation of California's prompt payment laws if applicable.",

                "explanation": "Extending the payment deadline after termination from 30 to 90 days significantly delays Intuit's receipt of outstanding payments. This delay can lead to financial strain and may violate generally accepted accounting principles, which typically require timely payment of obligations. Additionally, it could be interpreted as a breach of contract, as the original agreement stipulated a shorter payment period.",

                "original_text": "Schoolpop shall track information about its Clients which shall meet compliance requirements related to the above stated laws, track all Card shipment(s) to each such Client, and maintain appropriate records for its Clients for a period of seven (7) years after termination of the Agreement and to provide such records and other information to AEIS upon reasonable request and subject to applicable law. Schoolpop shall further inform in writing all of its Clients of their requirement to comply with all applicable laws concerning the use of Cards, including those laws stated in the previous sentence. School shall inform its Clients of the requirement to maintain records with respect to the Cards and Cardholders, and to verify the identity of Cardholders as required by law, to maintain records of the information used to verify each Cardholder's identity, to retain such records for at least seven (7) years following the date of distribution, including name, home address, Card number, and other identifying information, and the name, title and phone number of the individual responsible for maintaining such records, and to provide such records and other information to AEIS upon reasonable request and subject to applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "Schoolpop shall track minimal information about its Clients and shall maintain records for its Clients for a period of one (1) year after termination of the Agreement. Schoolpop shall further inform its Clients that they are not required to comply with all applicable laws concerning the use of Cards. Schoolpop shall inform its Clients that they do not have to maintain records with respect to the Cards and Cardholders, or verify the identity of Cardholders as required by law. Records of the information used to verify each Cardholder's identity do not need to be retained following the date of distribution. Only the Card number of the Cardholder needs to be stored, and no identifying information is required. There is no need to record the name, title and phone number of the individual responsible for maintaining such records, and Schoolpop is not required to provide such records and other information to AEIS.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires compliance with record-keeping obligations, for a period of seven years. This change reduces record keeping to one year and reduces the amount of client information Schoolpop must collect, store and verify, and implies that its clients do not need to comply with applicable laws.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each policy required hereunder shall provide that AEIS shall receive thirty (30) days advance written notice in the event of a cancellation or material change in such policy. Each policy of insurance which Schoolpop is required to possess under this Agreement shall name AEIS, and its Directors, Officers, and Employees, as additional insured in the insurance policy limits herein required.",
                "changed_text": "Each policy required hereunder shall provide that AEIS shall receive ten (10) days advance written notice in the event of a cancellation or material change in such policy. The insurance policies which Schoolpop is required to possess under this Agreement will not name AEIS, and its Directors, Officers, and Employees, as additional insured.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for policy changes or cancellation, and removing AEIS as an additional insured on Schoolpop's policies, exposes AEIS to greater risk. Standard commercial practice and prudent risk management dictates at least 30 days' notice and additional insured status, but the reduction to 10 days and removal of additional insured status creates non-compliance.",

                "original_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement, Schoolpop shall have the right to continue to sell any Cards in its possession for a period of three (3) months following the effective date of termination, subject to compliance with the applicable terms and conditions set forth herein, provided however, that termination of the Agreement is not due to a breach of representation or warranty of the Agreement by Schoolpop in which case Schoolpop shall discontinue selling Cards immediately upon termination.",
                "changed_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Schoolpop shall immediately discontinue the selling of the cards.",
                "explanation": "The initial excerpt gives Schoolpop the right to sell cards in its possession for a period of three months following the effective date of termination, but the revised text takes that right away. This is a legal contradiction because even if Schoolpop is performing up to standard, they will be unable to sell any cards after termination of the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - the original text allows time to recoup losses. The new text changes that.",

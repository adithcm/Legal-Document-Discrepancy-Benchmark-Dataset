                "explanation": "The changes to the notice clause create inconsistencies regarding when notices are deemed given. Specifically, the modification stating that a facsimile transmission will be considered 'delivered' only within 7 days of being sent and standard mail taking 90 days from being sent introduces unreasonable delays that conflict with the general requirement of timely notice, which is against standards of good faith and fair dealing under New York law, the governing law of the agreement.",

This license can be terminated by MS at any time with or without cause.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'perpetual' and 'irrevocable' and adding a termination clause creates an inconsistency. The original language provides a permanent license, while the modified version allows MS to terminate the license at will. This contradicts the concept of a 'perpetual' license, which suggests a permanent right. The modification introduces uncertainty and conflicts with the established understanding of the license agreement and could violate intellectual property law principles.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from New York to Delaware and stating that MSCI Inc. is not required to be registered to do business in New York introduces legal issues. The original text acknowledges that MSCI Inc. is registered to do business in New York under the name NY MSCI, which implies it has established a presence and conducts business in the state. Changing the text to state that it is not required to be registered to do business in New York contradicts this established fact, which is inconsistent with statutory requirements governing foreign corporations doing business in New York and could result in conflict of laws issues and the agreement being invalid.",

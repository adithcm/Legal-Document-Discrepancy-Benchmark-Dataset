                "original_text": "Such payments will be paid by Shipper to MPL within fifteen (15) Days of the invoice date or resolution of any dispute, if applicable.",
                "changed_text": "Such payments will be paid by Shipper to MPL within thirty (60) Days of the invoice date or resolution of any dispute, if applicable.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date. The modified text extends this period to sixty (60) days, which conflicts with standard commercial practices and potentially violates prompt payment laws. Under the Ohio Revised Code 131.02, payments are generally due according to the terms within the contract but should not exceed 30 days. This modification may cause significant financial strain, especially if the contract involves substantial amounts.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires MPL to provide thirty (30) days' notice to the Shipper regarding the in-service date. The modified text shortens this to fifteen (15) days. Shortening the notification period to 15 days could violate state regulations pertaining to adequate notification periods for significant operational changes. This is because a 30-day notice provides reasonable time for the Shipper to prepare for the operational changes, which directly violates laws that mandate adequate notification for operational changes.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement will automatically renew for up to two (2) renewal terms of five (5) years each (each, an \"Extension Period\") unless either Party provides the other Party with written notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement at least three (3) months prior to the end of the Initial Term or the then current Extension Period.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement requires six (6) months' notice for termination prior to renewal. Reducing this to three (3) months may not provide sufficient time for the other party to make necessary arrangements. Therefore, the modification potentially violates standard contract law principles requiring reasonable notice for significant changes or termination of long-term agreements.",

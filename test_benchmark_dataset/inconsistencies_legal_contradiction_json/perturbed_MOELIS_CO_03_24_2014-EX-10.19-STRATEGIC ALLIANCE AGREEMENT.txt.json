                "original_text": "Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees not to solicit or hire any employee of the other party during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 12 months thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed to employees of other party (or employment of applicants to such solicitations). Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees, during the term of this Agreement (except pursuant to this Agreement) and for a period of 12 months thereafter, not to solicit any Client Introduced by the other party in connection with an assignment on Covered\nBusinesses involving Japanese Companies where all principal parties involved are located within Covered Regions.",
                "changed_text": "Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees not to solicit or hire any employee of the other party during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 36 months thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed to employees of other party (or employment of applicants to such solicitations). Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees, during the term of this Agreement (except pursuant to this Agreement) and for a period of 36 months thereafter, not to solicit any Client Introduced by the other party in connection with an assignment on Covered\nBusinesses involving Japanese Companies where all principal parties involved are located within Covered Regions.",
                "explanation": "The non-solicitation clause is modified from 12 months to 36 months after the termination of the agreement. While the enforceability depends on specific state laws and the specific facts, it is a red flag that 36 months can be seen as overly broad and unreasonable, particularly if the employee's role is not highly specialized or if the geographic scope is extensive, increasing the risk of legal challenge and unenforceability.",

                "original_text": "This Section 10.1 shall terminate with respect to Confidential Information relating to a (prospective) Client, two years following receipt of such information, and with respect to any other Confidential Information, two years following the termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Section 10.1 shall terminate with respect to Confidential Information relating to a (prospective) Client, six months following receipt of such information, and with respect to any other Confidential Information, six months following the termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to six months may be deemed unreasonably short, especially for trade secrets or sensitive business strategies, potentially conflicting with established legal standards for trade secret protection under the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) or state laws like the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA). A very short confidentiality period weakens the protection of valuable information.",

                "original_text": "The initial term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for three (3) years, subject to the prior termination rights provided below. At the end of such initial term, and any renewed term, as applicable, this Agreement shall automatically renew for an additional one (1) year term, unless a party provides written notice to the other parties at least six (6) months prior to the end of the initial term. At any time during a renewed term, this Agreement may be terminated by any party on six (6) months prior notice that it wishes to terminate the Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The initial term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for three (3) years, subject to the prior termination rights provided below. At the end of such initial term, and any renewed term, as applicable, this Agreement shall automatically renew for an additional five (5) year term, unless a party provides written notice to the other parties at least one (1) month prior to the end of the initial term. At any time during a renewed term, this Agreement may be terminated by any party on one (1) months prior notice that it wishes to terminate the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Extending the renewal term to five years and shortening the termination notice period to one month could raise concerns about unconscionability or undue influence, especially if one party has significantly less bargaining power. This may contradict general contract law principles requiring fair and reasonable terms, making it more difficult for a party to exit the agreement.",

                "original_text": "5.3 Rejection of defective products The Customer shall inspect all Products promptly upon receipt thereof and may reject any defective Product, provided that the Customer shall within seven (7) days after receipt of such alleged defective Product, notify the Manufacturer of its rejection and either: (i) request to destroy in field for credit of the value of the defective product and the associated shipping costs (with approval), or (ii) request a Return Material Authorization (\"RMA\") number and within seven (7) days of receipt of the RMA number from the Manufacturer return such rejected Product to the Manufacturer. Products not rejected within the foregoing time periods shall be deemed accepted by the Customer.",
                "changed_text": "5.3 Rejection of defective products The Customer shall inspect all Products promptly upon receipt thereof and may reject any defective Product, provided that the Customer shall within two (2) days after receipt of such alleged defective Product, notify the Manufacturer of its rejection and either: (i) request to destroy in field for credit of the value of the defective product and the associated shipping costs (with approval), or (ii) request a Return Material Authorization (\"RMA\") number and within two (2) days of receipt of the RMA number from the Manufacturer return such rejected Product to the Manufacturer. Products not rejected within the foregoing time periods shall be deemed accepted by the Customer.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows the customer 7 days to report and begin the return process for defective products. This has been reduced to 2 days. This could be considered unreasonably short, potentially violating consumer protection laws that implicitly require a reasonable timeframe for inspection and rejection of goods. The definition of 'reasonable' varies but 2 days is likely insufficient for international shipments and complex products, particularly for smaller businesses.",

A six (6) months notice must be given by either party of their intention to terminate relations due to any reason other than breach of this agreement.",

A one (1) months notice must be given by either party of their intention to terminate relations due to any reason other than breach of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a six-month notice for termination. This has been reduced to one month. Some jurisdictions might consider this insufficient notice, especially given the long-term nature of the agreement and the potential investment involved. This could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, depending on the circumstances and the jurisdiction.",

(ii) The remaining 50% of the total order cost must be paid prior to the goods leaving the warehouse of the manufacturer.",

(ii) The remaining 10% of the total order cost must be paid prior to the goods leaving the warehouse of the manufacturer.",
                "explanation": "The original payment terms require 50% upfront and 50% before shipping. The modified terms now require 90% upfront. While not strictly illegal, this heavily favors the manufacturer and could be considered unconscionable, particularly if the Customer is a small business and this constitutes predatory practices. It also places a large financial burden on the customer before they have received the goods. ",
                "contradicted_law": "Could be challenged as unconscionable under contract law, particularly if the bargaining power is unequal or if other unfair contract terms are present. This may violate laws relating to unfair business practices.",

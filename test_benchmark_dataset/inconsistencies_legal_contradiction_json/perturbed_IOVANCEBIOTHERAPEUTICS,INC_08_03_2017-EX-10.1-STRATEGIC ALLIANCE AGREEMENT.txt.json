                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Principal Investigator and MD Anderson shall notify LBIO within twenty-four (24) hours after learning of any serious AE and any special situation report (both as defined in the applicable Protocol) incurred during or as the result of the Study, and provide a written confirmation report of such individual serious adverse event and special situation report promptly thereafter, as well as a monthly listing of all such serious adverse events and special situation reports, by electronic mail to: lionbiosafety@lionbio.com.",
                "changed_text": "Principal Investigator and MD Anderson shall notify LBIO within seventy-two (72) hours after learning of any serious AE and any special situation report (both as defined in the applicable Protocol) incurred during or as the result of the Study, and will provide a written confirmation report of such individual serious adverse event and special situation report within seven (7) days, as well as quarterly listing of all such serious adverse events and special situation reports, by electronic mail to: lionbiosafety@lionbio.com.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires reporting of serious adverse events within 24 hours and a written confirmation promptly thereafter, followed by monthly listings. Changing the notification period to 72 hours, the written confirmation to within seven days, and the listing to quarterly, reduces the frequency of safety reporting, potentially conflicting with FDA guidelines and regulations for expedited safety reporting in clinical trials, which often mandate faster reporting timelines for certain serious and unexpected adverse events.",

                "original_text": "Following receipt of such proposed Publication, LBIO shall have the right to cause MD Anderson to (i) withhold publication or other public disclosure thereof for a period of up to 90 days in order to provide LBIO time to obtain appropriate intellectual property protection thereof, and (ii) remove any proprietary, or otherwise confidential, information of LBIO contained in such Publication (excluding Research results).",
                "changed_text": "Following receipt of such proposed Publication, LBIO shall have the right to cause MD Anderson to (i) withhold publication or other public disclosure thereof indefinitely in order to provide LBIO time to obtain appropriate intellectual property protection thereof, and (ii) remove any proprietary, or otherwise confidential, information of LBIO contained in such Publication (excluding Research results).",
                "explanation": "The original contract allows LBIO to withhold publication for up to 90 days. Changing this to an indefinite period could be seen as an unreasonable restriction on academic freedom and the dissemination of scientific findings, potentially conflicting with principles of academic freedom and open science, especially in the context of a university research center. This could also make it difficult for MD Anderson researchers to comply with 'publish or perish' requirements often stipulated by academic institutions.",

                "original_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement for the material breach or default of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement by the other Party upon thirty (30) days' written notice and the opportunity to cure during such notice period; and such termination shall be in addition to any other remedies that it may have at law or in equity.",
                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement for the material breach or default of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement by the other Party upon ten (10) days' written notice and the opportunity to cure during such notice period; and such termination shall be in addition to any other remedies that it may have at law or in equity.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period from 30 days to 10 days for a material breach of contract might be considered unreasonably short, particularly in complex research agreements. A shorter cure period could be deemed insufficient to address complex breaches, potentially violating general principles of contract law that require reasonable opportunities to remedy defaults. In certain jurisdictions or under specific circumstances, courts might find a 10-day cure period to be commercially unreasonable.",

                "original_text": "Company shall have forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) from receipt of the notice to elect, by written notice, whether it will participate in accordance with Section 2.3. BP shall not Complete the Initial Well until Company has notified BP in writing whether or not it will participate or until forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) have elapsed since Company's receipt of BP's notice. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in the Completion of the Initial Well.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall have twelve (12) hours from receipt of the notice to elect, by written notice, whether it will participate in accordance with Section 2.3. BP shall Complete the Initial Well even if Company hasn't notified BP in writing whether or not it will participate before the twelve (12) hours have elapsed since Company's receipt of BP's notice. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election to participate in the Completion of the Initial Well.",
                "explanation": "This modification shortens the decision-making timeframe for Company to only 12 hours. A very short time frame such as 12 hours might be considered commercially unreasonable and could violate principles requiring fair dealing and sufficient opportunity to evaluate complex decisions, especially in oil and gas development. Also, change the failure to respond is an election to participate. If the company fails to reply within the required time, this would force them to participate regardless if they didn't want to. This goes against the best business practices.",

                "changed_text": "If BP does not drill the Initial Well to the Objective Zone, Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date the drilling rig used to drill the Initial Well is removed from the well site location for the Initial Well (the \"Rig Release Date\"), to participate in the drilling of a Substitute Well.",
                "explanation": "This modification reduces the period for Company to decide on participating in a Substitute Well from one year to thirty days. This could be argued as an unreasonably short period, especially considering the complexities and potential costs of oil and gas drilling, and the need for thorough geological and economic evaluations.",

                "explanation": "This modification drastically shortens the time frame for BP to exercise its preferential right to purchase Company's interest from 15 days to 2 days. Such a short time frame could be deemed commercially unreasonable, as it doesn't allow sufficient time for due diligence, legal review, and financial assessment, especially for complex transactions in the oil and gas industry.",

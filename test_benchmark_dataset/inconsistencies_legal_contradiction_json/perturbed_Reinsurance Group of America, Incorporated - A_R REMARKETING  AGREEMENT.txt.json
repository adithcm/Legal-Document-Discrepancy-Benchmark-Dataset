                "explanation": "This change creates a perturbation by modifying the payment and redemption timelines. A discrepancy arises between the due date of Debentures (180 days) and redemption of Preferred Securities (30 days). Such misalignment complicates financial planning and introduces potential defaults due to differing payment obligations. Modifying the deadline conflicts with standard contract law principles.",

                "explanation": "Perturbation: This change introduces inconsistencies by fixing the interest rate on Debentures at 15% while setting the Distribution rate for Preferred Securities at 5%. This divergence lacks a clear, justifiable basis, potentially violating standard financial practices. Furthermore, it contravenes fairness and predictability by deviating from the market-determined reset rate. This conflict undermines clarity and equitable distribution of returns, conflicting with general contract law principles.",

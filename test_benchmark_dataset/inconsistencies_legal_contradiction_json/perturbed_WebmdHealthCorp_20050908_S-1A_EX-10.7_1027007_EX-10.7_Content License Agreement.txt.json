                "original_text": "All amounts payable shall be due be due thirty (30) days after the receipt of WebMD's invoice.",
                "changed_text": "All amounts payable shall be due fifteen (15) days after the receipt of WebMD's invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a legal contradiction because while a 30-day payment term is generally acceptable, reducing it to 15 days may violate certain state laws regarding prompt payment, particularly if Emdeon is considered a small business or the services provided are essential. Some states have regulations ensuring fair and reasonable payment timelines, especially to smaller entities, and requiring payment in 15 days could be deemed unconscionable or a violation of good faith.",

                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of six (6) months after termination hereof, neither party will use, copy, or disclose, or permit any unauthorized person access to, any of the other party's Confidential Information, except as expressly directed by such party or as permitted herein.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly reduces the protection period for confidential information from two years to six months. This could be deemed unreasonably short, especially considering the nature of the content being licensed (anatomical line drawings and related data). Under New York law (specified as the governing law), courts may find a six-month confidentiality period insufficient to protect legitimate business interests, particularly trade secrets or proprietary information with lasting value, therefore making it unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially unenforceable under New York state law regarding protection of trade secrets and confidential information due to insufficient duration.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All material notices and other communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and notices will be deemed given three (3) days after they are sent by first class mail, return receipt requested, and one (1) day after they are sent by overnight courier or upon receipt if delivered by hand delivery, to the receiving party's address as set forth in the first paragraph above, or to such other address that the receiving party may have provided in writing to the other party for purposes of receiving notices as provided in this Section.",
                "changed_text": "All material notices and other communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and notices will be deemed given ten (10) days after they are sent by first class mail, return receipt requested, and five (5) day after they are sent by overnight courier or upon receipt if delivered by hand delivery, to the receiving party's address as set forth in the first paragraph above, or to such other address that the receiving party may have provided in writing to the other party for purposes of receiving notices as provided in this Section.",
                "explanation": "This change increases the notice periods required for legal purposes from (3) to (10) and (1) to (5) days after dispatch of first class and overnight mail, respectively. For contract termination due to breach, this extended timeline contradicts typical legal standards of reasonableness and good faith dealing, particularly when critical business operations depend on rapid communication. Under New York law, unreasonably delaying notification of termination can create a cause of action for breach of contract and duty of good faith, making the provision contestable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of duty of good faith and fair dealing under New York contract law due to unreasonable delay in providing material notices.",

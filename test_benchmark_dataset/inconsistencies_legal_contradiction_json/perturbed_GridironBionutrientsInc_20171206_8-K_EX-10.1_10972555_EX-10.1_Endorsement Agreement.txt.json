                "original_text": "Past due payments under this Agreement shall bear interest at the rate of: (a) 1% per month; or (b) the maximum interest rate permissible under law, whichever is less.",
                "changed_text": "Past due payments under this Agreement shall bear interest at the rate of: (a) 25% per month; or (b) the maximum interest rate permissible under law, whichever is less.",
                "explanation": "Usury laws in California (where the contract is governed) restrict the amount of interest that can be charged on certain types of loans. Charging 25% per month (300% annually) would likely exceed the maximum legal interest rate for many types of transactions, making this clause potentially unenforceable and in violation of California usury laws. This creates non-compliance with regulatory standards.",

                "changed_text": "If either party at any time during the Contract Period shall: (i) fail to make any payment of any sum of money specified in this Agreement to be made; or (ii) fail to observe or perform any of the covenants, agreements or obligations under this Agreement (other than the payment of money), the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: As to a default under clause (i) above, the non-defaulting party can immediately terminate the agreement. As to a default under clause (ii) above, if such other default is not cured within 5 days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for defaults other than payment to 5 days is commercially unreasonable and potentially contradicts the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in all California contracts. A court might find that 5 days is insufficient time to cure many types of breaches, rendering this clause unenforceable. This creates non-compliance with regulatory standards.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the liquidation period to 15 days may be deemed commercially unreasonable. It could create hardship for the Company to liquidate their inventory in that period. Also, changing the sales report deadline to 60 days after termination, regardless of quarter end, is contradictory, since the original text requires it to be within 30 days following the end of the first full quarter following termination.",

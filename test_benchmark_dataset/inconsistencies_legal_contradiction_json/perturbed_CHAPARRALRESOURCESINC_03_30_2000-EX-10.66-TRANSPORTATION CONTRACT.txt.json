                "original_text": "(iii) obtain, at its own expense, required official export permissions      (certificate of origin of the Commodity at place of the load output,      customs declaration on Commodity output) for release of the batch of      Commodity being delivered from the customs territory of the Republic of      Kazakstan and deliver them before the 5th day of the Delivery Month;",

                "explanation": "The original contract requires the Principal to deliver export permissions before the 5th day of the Delivery Month. The modified contract changes this deadline to the 1st day of the Delivery Month, potentially creating an unreasonably short timeframe that may contradict regulations or standard business practices in Kazakhstan. This accelerated deadline could be impractical or impossible to meet, especially given the complexities of obtaining export permissions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts regulations or standard business practices related to export permissions in Kazakhstan, though the exact law is unspecified. This can be used to create legal challenges based on feasibility and fairness.",

                "changed_text": "(ix) reimburse the Company for all expenses reasonably incurred in connection      with the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Contract      within 10 (ten) days of delivery to the Principal of proper invoices and      other supporting documents for such expenses;",
                "explanation": "The original contract stipulates a 30-day reimbursement period for expenses. By shortening this to 10 days, the modification creates a tight timeline for the Principal to verify invoices and process payments. While there isn't a specific, universally mandated reimbursement timeframe law, such a short period could be deemed commercially unreasonable or inconsistent with standard accounting practices, potentially leading to disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts principles of 'reasonable time' for payment under general contract law and could be challenged as commercially unreasonable.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires 65 days' notice for contract termination. Reducing this notice period to 15 days makes it significantly shorter and could be considered insufficient time for the other party to prepare for the termination and find alternative arrangements. This could potentially violate regulations related to fair notice periods or general principles of good faith in contractual relationships, depending on specific Kazakhstan laws regarding contract termination.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts requirements for reasonable notice periods under Kazakhstan's contract law or general principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "The appointment of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) forty-five (45) days after the last day of the Subscription and Community Offering, unless the Company and the Agent agree in writing to extend such period and the OTS agrees to extend the period of time in which the Securities may be sold, or (b) the receipt and acceptance of subscriptions and purchase orders for all of the Securities, or (c) the completion of the Syndicated Community Offering.",
                "changed_text": "The appointment of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) fifteen (15) days after the last day of the Subscription and Community Offering, unless the Company and the Agent agree in writing to extend such period, or (b) the receipt and acceptance of subscriptions and purchase orders for all of the Securities, or (c) the completion of the Syndicated Community Offering.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for the agent's appointment termination to 15 days after the offering, without requiring OTS approval for extensions, contradicts standard regulatory practices that necessitate regulatory body consent for significant alterations in securities offerings.",

                "original_text": "The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement covering a twelve month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158 of the Securities Act Regulations) that will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but not later than 120 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement covering a twelve month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158 of the Securities Act Regulations) that will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the release of earnings statements to 120 days contradicts Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which mandate that publicly traded companies must file their annual reports (Form 10-K) within 60 to 90 days after the end of the fiscal year, depending on the company's size and filer status.",

                "original_text": "Other than in connection with any employee benefit plan or arrangement described in the Prospectus, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Agent, sell or issue, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, any shares of Common Stock other than the Securities for a period of 180 days following the Closing Time.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the lock-up period to 30 days contradicts typical underwriting agreements, which mandate a longer period (usually 90 to 180 days) during which the company and its insiders cannot sell additional shares, intended to prevent dilution and protect the initial offering price. Such short lock-up period would not provide sufficient price stability and potentially violates general principles of securities market regulation.",

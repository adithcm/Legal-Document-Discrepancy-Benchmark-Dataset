                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of termination to the other party, which termination will be effective immediately upon such notice, if the other party defaults in the performance of any of its material obligations provided for in this Agreement and fails to cure such default within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice from the other party of such default, unless a plan for remedying such default has been proposed by the defaulting party and accepted by the non- defaulting party within such period.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of termination to the other party, which termination will be effective immediately upon such notice, if the other party defaults in the performance of any of its obligations provided for in this Agreement and fails to cure such default within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice from the other party of such default, unless a plan for remedying such default has been proposed by the defaulting party and accepted by the non- defaulting party within such period.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a default from 60 days to 15 days may be considered unreasonable in some jurisdictions, especially for complex contractual obligations. This could be deemed a breach of good faith and fair dealing, potentially conflicting with legal standards requiring reasonable notice and opportunity to cure.",

                "original_text": "After the Initial Term, this Agreement may only be renewed if authorized officers of ARGO and YEC agree in writing at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the Initial Term or any renewal term to a renewal, including the period of the renewal term.",
                "changed_text": "After the Initial Term, this Agreement may only be renewed if authorized officers of ARGO and YEC agree verbally at least five (5) days before the expiration of the Initial Term or any renewal term to a renewal, including the period of the renewal term.",
                "explanation": "Requiring only a verbal agreement for renewal just five days before the expiration of the term contradicts standard contract law principles, which often require written agreements for significant contract modifications or renewals, particularly for agreements with a long initial term. This short notice period also introduces uncertainty and could be seen as providing insufficient time for proper consideration and negotiation.",

The address for all notices or other communications required to be sent to ARGO or YEC will be the mailing address stated on the signature page to this Agreement, or such other address as may be provided from one party to the other on at least ten (10) days prior written notice. Any such notice will be effective upon the date of receipt.",

The address for all notices or other communications required to be sent to ARGO or YEC will be the mailing address stated on the signature page to this Agreement, or such other address as may be provided from one party to the other on at least one (1) days prior written notice. Any such notice will be effective upon the date of release.",
                "explanation": "Changing the notification form to 'carrier pigeon' is not an acceptable form of written notification. Also, the time frame to change an address before it is valid is only one day, which does not allow ample time to ensure receipt of the notification.",

                "original_text": "Section 11.03. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. Any disputes relating to, arising out of or resulting from this Agreement, including to its execution, performance, or enforcement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof. Each Party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction, forum and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court or the federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) over any and all claims, disputes, controversies or disagreements between the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns under or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including their execution, performance or enforcement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "Section 11.03. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. Any disputes relating to this Agreement will be subject to binding arbitration in a forum chosen solely by Nuance. The arbitration decision will be final and there will be no right to appeal. Each Party consents to the jurisdiction of this forum. The laws of Massachusetts, excluding its conflict of laws principles, govern this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction by imposing a mandatory arbitration clause with no right to appeal and giving Nuance sole discretion in choosing the arbitration forum. This may conflict with state laws (e.g., California) that require fairness and impartiality in arbitration proceedings. Additionally, limiting the choice of law to Massachusetts, even though both companies are incorporated in Delaware and the agreement might have connections to other jurisdictions, could be challenged if it unduly restricts a party's rights or defenses. The lack of appeal contradicts the established legal procedures where there are grounds to appeal to a higher court.",

EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING THEIR EXECUTION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS TRANSACTION, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. THIS SECTION HAS BEEN FULLY DISCUSSED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES AND THESE PROVISIONS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY EXCEPTIONS.",

                "explanation": "Completely removing the waiver of jury trial and replacing it with a coin flip is an absurd and unenforceable clause. While parties can waive their right to a jury trial, resolution by coin flip is not a recognized or legally sound method of dispute resolution and could be deemed against public policy. It contradicts due process and established legal frameworks for resolving disputes in a fair and just manner.",

                "explanation": "Changing the method of notice to solely \"carrier pigeon\" is legally problematic. Modern contract law requires reasonable means of notice. Relying solely on carrier pigeons is unreliable, impractical, and could be deemed an unreasonable method of providing notice, potentially rendering the notice provisions unenforceable. This would conflict with legal requirements for providing proper and effective notification, particularly in time-sensitive or legally critical matters.",

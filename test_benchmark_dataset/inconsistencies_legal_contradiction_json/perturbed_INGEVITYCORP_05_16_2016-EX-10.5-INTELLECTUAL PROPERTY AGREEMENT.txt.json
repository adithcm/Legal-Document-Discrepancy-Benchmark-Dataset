                "original_text": "(a) Each of Parent and SpinCo, on behalf of itself and each member of its Group, acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to Information that it will own as a result of the Separation, each is entitled to physical possession of Information that exists in tangible and intangible form, including Software, Technology, or electronic data that may exist on hard-drives, or other electronic storage means (\"Tangible/Intangible Information\"). Subject to subsections (i)-(iii) of this Section 5.1(a), each Party agrees that prior to the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time (\"Delivery Date\"), it will deliver possession of any Tangible/Intangible Information of the other Party that is in its possession or control to the other Party, without retaining any copies.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Each of Parent and SpinCo, on behalf of itself and each member of its Group, acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to Information that it will own as a result of the Separation, each is entitled to physical possession of Information that exists in tangible and intangible form, including Software, Technology, or electronic data that may exist on hard-drives, or other electronic storage means (\"Tangible/Intangible Information\"). Subject to subsections (i)-(iii) of this Section 5.1(a), each Party agrees that prior to the date that is one (1) month after the Effective Time (\"Delivery Date\"), it will deliver possession of any Tangible/Intangible Information of the other Party that is in its possession or control to the other Party, without retaining any copies.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires delivery of tangible/intangible information within six months after the effective date. Reducing this to one month introduces a potential legal contradiction because such a short period might be deemed unreasonable, particularly considering the volume and complexity of the information likely involved in a corporate separation. This could be viewed as a breach of good faith and fair dealing, especially if compliance is practically impossible within that timeframe.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; potential violation of reasonable business practices.",

                "original_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that signage, letterhead, invoices, business cards, promotional materials and similar items may reference the Parent Name or Parent Mark \"MeadWestvaco\" and \"MWV\" in the same manner as used by SpinCo prior to the Effective Time, during a twelve-month phase out period as SpinCo replaces such Parent Name and Parent Mark with the SpinCo Name and SpinCo Mark.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that signage, letterhead, invoices, business cards, promotional materials and similar items may reference the Parent Name or Parent Mark \"MeadWestvaco\" and \"MWV\" in the same manner as used by SpinCo prior to the Effective Time, during a three-month phase out period as SpinCo replaces such Parent Name and Parent Mark with the SpinCo Name and SpinCo Mark.",
                "explanation": "The clause initially allows for a 12-month phase-out period for using the Parent's trademarks. Shortening this to 3 months could be problematic. Trademark law dictates that a company must take reasonable steps to protect its brand, and an unreasonably short phase-out period might not be sufficient to avoid consumer confusion or infringement claims, particularly if the SpinCo's branding is similar or operates in the same market. Three months may also be too short for a company to replace all the old marketing materials with the new ones.",

                "original_text": "(ii)  if SpinCo does not initiate such an IP Action itself or through its designee with respect to infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Licensed SpinCo IP within the Parent Field by a Third Party within ninety (90) days after receipt of a written request from Parent to assume control over the enforcement of such violation of such Licensed SpinCo IP inside the Parent Field, then Parent shall have, with the prior consent of SpinCo, which will not be unreasonably withheld, the right, but not the obligation, to bring and to control such IP Action (provided that if Parent does not do so within thirty (30) days after the end of such original ninety (90) day-deadline, the right to initiate and control an IP Action shall revert back to SpinCo and shall again be subject to the terms set forth above).",
                "changed_text": "(ii)  if SpinCo does not initiate such an IP Action itself or through its designee with respect to infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Licensed SpinCo IP within the Parent Field by a Third Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written request from Parent to assume control over the enforcement of such violation of such Licensed SpinCo IP inside the Parent Field, then Parent shall have, with the prior consent of SpinCo, which will not be unreasonably withheld, the right, but not the obligation, to bring and to control such IP Action (provided that if Parent does not do so within ten (10) days after the end of such original thirty (30) day-deadline, the right to initiate and control an IP Action shall revert back to SpinCo and shall again be subject to the terms set forth above).",
                "explanation": "Changing the timeframe from ninety (90) days to thirty (30) days for SpinCo to initiate an IP Action, and then reducing Parent's subsequent action window from thirty (30) days to ten (10) days introduces potential legal issues related to adequacy of opportunity to act. Intellectual Property cases often require significant investigation and preparation. The shortened timeframe could be seen as unreasonably limiting SpinCo's ability to adequately assess and act on potential IP infringements, and unreasonably limiting Parent's ability to bring such action. This could potentially lead to accusations of bad faith, and could prevent the party from reasonably protecting their IP rights.",

                "original_text": "1.2. Extension of Term. This Agreement will extend automatically for monthly periods unless either party to this Agreement notifies the other party in writing at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the then current term.",
                "changed_text": "1.2. Extension of Term. This Agreement will extend automatically for monthly periods unless either party to this Agreement notifies the other party in writing at least ten (10) days before the expiration of the then current term.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 30 days' notice for non-renewal, whereas the change requires only 10 days. This could be problematic because some states require a longer notification period to ensure adequate time for both parties to prepare for the termination of the agreement and violates common practice.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires 180 days' written notice for termination. The modification shortens this to 30 days. This creates a legal contradiction as some jurisdictions require longer notice periods for contract termination to allow the other party sufficient time to find a replacement or adjust their operations.",

The Provider will obtain and maintain appropriate liability insurance in an amount of not less than $1,000,000 combined single limit for accidents or occurrences which cause bodily injury, death or property damage related to the performance of the Services. The insurance policy willname the Company as an additional insured. The Provider will provide the Company with a certificate of insurance issued to evidence such coverage. Such certificate will provide that there shall be no cancellation, non-renewal, or modification of such coverage without thirty days' prior written notice to the Company.",

The insurance policy will name the Company as an additional insured. The Provider will provide the Company with a certificate of insurance issued to evidence such coverage. Such certificate will provide that there shall be no cancellation, non-renewal, or modification of such coverage without ten days' prior written notice to the Company.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a 30-day notice for insurance policy changes (cancellation, non-renewal, etc.). This is changed to 10 days. Many jurisdictions require insurance companies to provide at least 30 days' notice to policyholders (and additional insureds) before any policy changes, to provide adequate time to secure alternative coverage. Reducing this to 10 days contradicts such requirements.",

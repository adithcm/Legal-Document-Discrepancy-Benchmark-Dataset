                "original_text": "Subject to the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff and Rate Schedule FTS/ITS, this Agreement shall be effective as of the date of physical completion of and initial deliveries on Transporter's pipeline and shall continue for a primary term of ten years. Thereafter, this\n\n\n\nAgreement shall be effective month to month, until terminated\nby Transporter or Shipper upon the following written notice to\nthe other specifying a termination date: sixty (60) days for\n\ninterruptible transportation under Rate Schedule ITS and 180\ndays for firm transportation under Rate Schedule FTS.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff and Rate Schedule FTS/ITS, this Agreement shall be effective as of the date of physical completion of and initial deliveries on Transporter's pipeline and shall continue for a primary term of ten years. Thereafter, this\n\n\n\nAgreement shall be effective month to month, until terminated\nby Transporter or Shipper upon the following written notice to\nthe other specifying a termination date: thirty (30) days for\n\ninterruptible transportation under Rate Schedule ITS and thirty (30) days for firm transportation under Rate Schedule FTS.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement specifies 60 days' notice for interruptible transportation and 180 days for firm transportation. Shortening both to 30 days introduces a legal contradiction, because in the natural gas industry, particularly concerning agreements subject to FERC regulations, such short notice periods for terminating long-term firm transportation agreements can be deemed unreasonable and may not provide sufficient time for parties to make alternative arrangements, potentially conflicting with standard practices and regulatory expectations. FERC typically requires reasonable notice periods.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential conflict with FERC regulations and standard industry practice regarding reasonable notice for termination of firm transportation agreements.",

                "original_text": "All written notices, requests, statements or other communications shall\nbe sufficiently given if mailed postage prepaid by registered,\ncertified, or regular mail and shall be deemed to have been duly\ndelivered on the third business day following the date on which same\nwas deposited in the United States mail, addressed in accordance with\nthis Article VIII.",
                "changed_text": "All written notices, requests, statements or other communications shall\nbe sufficiently given if mailed postage prepaid by registered,\ncertified, or regular mail and shall be deemed to have been duly\ndelivered on the first business day following the date on which same\nwas deposited in the United States mail, addressed in accordance with\nthis Article VIII.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the deemed delivery time to one business day is inconsistent with standard legal practice, particularly when dealing with important contractual notices. This modification introduces a potential legal issue because one business day may not provide sufficient time for the notice to actually reach the intended recipient, especially considering potential mail delays or internal processing times. A three-business-day window is considered more reasonable and standard.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with principles of fairness and reasonableness in contract law related to notice provisions.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement constitutes the entire\nagreement between Transporter and Shipper concerning the\nsubject matter hereof and supersedes all prior understandings\nand written and oral agreements relative to said matter.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement constitutes a preliminary understanding between Transporter and Shipper concerning the\nsubject matter hereof and does not supersede any prior understandings\nand written and oral agreements relative to said matter.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the \"entire agreement\" or integration clause. By stating the agreement is a \"preliminary understanding\" and does not supersede prior agreements, it creates ambiguity about the finality of the contract and whether previous agreements remain in effect. This creates potential for disputes and contradicts the purpose of an integration clause, which is to ensure that the written contract is the complete and final agreement between the parties.",
                "contradicted_law": "Undermines the principle of contract integration, potentially violating the parol evidence rule and creating ambiguity regarding the terms of the agreement.",

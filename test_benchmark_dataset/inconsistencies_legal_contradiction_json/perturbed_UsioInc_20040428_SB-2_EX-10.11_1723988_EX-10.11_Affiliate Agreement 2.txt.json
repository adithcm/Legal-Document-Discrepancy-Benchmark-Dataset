The  term  (\"Term\")  of  this Agreement shall be for one hundred eighty  days  (180)  from  the  date set forth below unless Network 1 or Visa or MasterCard  or Harris Bank doesn't approve Affiliate's ISO application, in which case,  the  Term  will  be  3 years. This Agreement will automatically renew for successive  one-year  terms  unless  terminated by either party by providing the other  with  30  days  written notice that this Agreement will not be renewed or Affiliate  enters  into  a  Processing  agreement  with  Network  1  and  an ISO Sponsorship  agreement  with  Harris  Bank  in  which  case  this Agreement will automatically  terminate  concurrent  with  the  execution  of  such agreements.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for non-renewal to 10 days could be considered an unreasonably short timeframe under general contract law principles, particularly if the agreement involves significant investments or ongoing obligations. Many states require a 'reasonable' notice period, and 10 days may be deemed insufficient, potentially conflicting with common law requirements for fair notice. Some states require 30-60 days.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for default to 10 days may be deemed unreasonable, especially for complex contractual breaches. Contract law often requires a reasonable opportunity to cure a default. A 10-day cure period may be insufficient in many circumstances, potentially conflicting with general principles of contract fairness and good faith.",

As compensation for Affiliate's services hereunder, Network 1, or  an  affiliate, shall pay to Affiliate the following (the \"Affiliate's Fee\"): A.     The  surplus  funding  amount after costs noted in Exhibit A based on all Merchant  applications  obtained  for  Equipment  and Products sold or leased by Affiliate  or  Contractors  located  by  Affiliate  pursuant  to  Section  1.01  [CONTRACTORS]. Affiliate  shall  receive the buy rate with revenue share as noted in Exhibit A. B.     Affiliate  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  all merchants and subscribing businesses  referred  by  Affiliate are a party to a contract with Network 1 and it's Member bank and that Network 1 and the Member bank has a direct contractual relationship  with  the  merchants  and  subscribing  businesses.  Network  1 acknowledges and agrees that Affiliate has certain rights to residual revenue as specifically  defined in this agreement.  Affiliate acknowledges and agrees that it  has  no  claims  or  rights  of  ownership  over  Merchants  and subscribing businesses,  Unless  ISO  agreement is consummated or Network 1 does not approve Affiliate  or Network 1 cancels Affiliate and that it is a service provider to a customer  of  Network  1  (namely Merchants and subscribing businesses). In such case,  Affiliate  shall  have  the right to Transfer accounts in accordance with Section  2.03  (b)  [RETENTION OF CONTRACTORS]  and  2.03  (c).

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for fee modifications to five days is likely unreasonable and could be considered a breach of good faith.

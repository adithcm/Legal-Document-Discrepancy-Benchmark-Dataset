                "explanation": "Modifying the reporting deadline from the 10th to the 25th of each month may violate laws in Brazil that mandate timely financial reporting and tax compliance. Brazilian regulations often require businesses to submit financial data and pay taxes within specific deadlines, typically within the first 10-20 days of the month.

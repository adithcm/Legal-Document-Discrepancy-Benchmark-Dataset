If either party materially breaches one or more of its obligations hereunder, the other party may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice, if the breaching party does not cure such breach within 15 days after written notice thereof (or any mutually agreed extension). Licensor may terminate this Agreement immediately, effective upon written notice, if (i) Licensee attempts to violate Section 8 or (ii) a sublicensee materially breaches its sublicense in a manner that harms the Brand, and (a) such sublicensee does not cure the same within 15 days after notice from Licensor or Licensee or (b) Licensee does not terminate such sublicense within 15 days after notice from Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "Section 4.3. Termination for Breach. If either party materially breaches one or more of its obligations hereunder, the other party may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice, if the breaching party does not cure such breach within 5 days after written notice thereof (or any mutually agreed extension). Licensor may terminate this Agreement immediately, effective upon written notice, if (i) Licensee attempts to violate Section 8 or (ii) a sublicensee materially breaches its sublicense in a manner that harms the Brand, and (a) such sublicensee does not cure the same within 5 days after notice from Licensor or Licensee or (b) Licensee does not terminate such sublicense within 5 days after notice from Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 15-day cure period for a material breach of contract. Shortening this cure period to 5 days could be deemed unreasonable in some jurisdictions, particularly for complex breaches. Many states favor providing a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach, and 5 days may be insufficient, leading to potential legal challenges to the termination. Breaching the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by providing such a short time frame may also cause legal issues.",

                "explanation": "The modification alters the notice provisions. Changing the receipt of notices via courier to the 'fifth business day' creates potential delays in important communications, which is generally inappropriate in legal settings. Moreover, providing emails shall be delivered when acknowledged within 12 hours of sending might be considered unreasonable and contradict common business practices in certain contexts.",

Many jurisdictions require some form of reasonable notice even in at-will contractual relationships to avoid unfair surprise or undue hardship. Lack of notice could lead to claims of breach of implied contractual duties.",

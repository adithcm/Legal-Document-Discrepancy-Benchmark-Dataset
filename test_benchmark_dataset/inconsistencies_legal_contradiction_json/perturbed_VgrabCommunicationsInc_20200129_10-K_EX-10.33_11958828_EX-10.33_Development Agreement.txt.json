                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Payment to the following individual below within 7 days upon completion and handover on the Project to VAL.",
                "changed_text": "Payment to the following individual below within 60 days upon completion and handover on the Project to VAL.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the payment beyond a reasonable timeframe contradicts prompt payment laws, which vary by jurisdiction but generally require timely wage payments. The original text states payment within 7 days. Extending this to 60 days introduces a legal contradiction, potentially violating labor laws in various regions (including the U.S. and other countries).",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal wage payment laws (e.g., California Labor Code Section 204, Fair Labor Standards Act in the US, or similar legislation in Hong Kong requiring timely wage payment).",
                "location": "Clause 5"

                "original_text": "Change Orders do not however cover any bug or glitch fixing produced out of the code written by Developer as any \"bug\" will be fixed by Developer for free up to 3 months after final delivery (Bug Fixing Warranty).",
                "changed_text": "Change Orders do not however cover any bug or glitch fixing produced out of the code written by Developer as any \"bug\" will be fixed by Developer for free up to 1 week after final delivery (Bug Fixing Warranty).",
                "explanation": "Reducing the bug fixing warranty to 1 week after delivery is an unreasonable and unconscionable term, particularly for complex software development projects. This may conflict with implied warranties and consumer protection laws in jurisdictions like Hong Kong or the United States, where a longer reasonable period for addressing defects is typically expected.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied Warranty of Merchantability/Fitness for a Particular Purpose (UCC in the US), Sale of Goods Ordinance (Hong Kong), and related consumer protection laws.",

                "original_text": "VAL shall, in the event of Developer committing any breach of any of the terms and conditions of this agreement or for any other reason considered as sufficient, be entitled to terminate this agreement by giving two (2) weeks' notice in writing and it is applicable only when the project is not completed. If the customer terminates the agreement, then VAL shall compensate the Developer up to the date of termination with a fee calculated on Pro-rata basis. Developer may also terminate this Agreement by giving two (2) weeks' notice in writing to VAL. It is applicable only when the project is not completed. In case Developer terminates the agreement, it shall handover the entire project related IPR, work done till date to VAL.",
                "changed_text": "VAL shall, in the event of Developer committing any breach of any of the terms and conditions of this agreement or for any other reason considered as sufficient, be entitled to terminate this agreement by giving 24 hours' notice in writing and it is applicable only when the project is not completed. If the customer terminates the agreement, then VAL shall compensate the Developer up to the date of termination with a fee calculated on Pro-rata basis. Developer may also terminate this Agreement by giving two (2) weeks' notice in writing to VAL. It is applicable only when the project is not completed. In case Developer terminates the agreement, it shall handover the entire project related IPR, work done till date to VAL.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination by VAL to 24 hours is likely unreasonable and may violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, depending on the jurisdiction. Such a short notice period doesn't allow the developer adequate time to mitigate damages or transition responsibilities, potentially violating contract law principles.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (common law principle applied in many jurisdictions), principles of unconscionability in contract law.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time with 30 days written notice.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time with 14 days written notice.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 14 days may contradict state laws that require longer notice periods for contract termination, particularly if the agreement implies an ongoing business relationship or dependence.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts state laws regarding reasonable notice for contract termination.",
                "location": "VI. TERM AND TERMINATION"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "AVDU agrees that for a twenty four months (24) following the execution of this Agreement, AVDU shall not, without UTEK's prior written consent, directly or indirectly solicit for employment any present employee of UTEK, or request induce or advise any employee of UTEK to leave the employ of UTEK. In turn, UTEK agrees that it will not directly or indirectly solicit any present employee of AVDU.",
                "changed_text": "AVDU agrees that for a thirty six months (36) following the execution of this Agreement, AVDU shall not, without UTEK's prior written consent, directly or indirectly solicit for employment any present employee of UTEK, or request induce or advise any employee of UTEK to leave the employ of UTEK. In turn, UTEK agrees that it will not directly or indirectly solicit any present employee of AVDU.",
                "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to 36 months could be viewed as an unreasonable restraint of trade, especially in certain jurisdictions that limit the duration of such clauses to shorter periods, thereby potentially rendering the clause unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with state laws regarding non-compete agreements and unreasonable restraint of trade.",

                "changed_text": "AVDU will have 10-days to determine if they want to go forward with the technology license.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the decision period for technology licensing to 10 days could be deemed unreasonable, especially considering the due diligence required for assessing such agreements. This could clash with industry standards or fair dealing principles, making the provision potentially contestable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with general contract law principles of fair dealing and reasonableness.",

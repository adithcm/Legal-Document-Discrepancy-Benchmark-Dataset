                "original_text": "Each purchase order shall set forth a delivery date for the quantities of Product ordered, which date will in no event be less than *** from the date of the purchase order. MacroGenics will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to deliver each order on or before the applicable deliver date.",
                "changed_text": "Each purchase order shall set forth a delivery date for the quantities of Product ordered, which date will in no event be less than *2 days* from the date of the purchase order. MacroGenics will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to deliver each order on or before the applicable deliver date.",
                "explanation": "Changing the delivery timeframe to 2 days is likely not commercially reasonable given manufacturing and shipping constraints, potentially conflicting with obligations to use commercially reasonable efforts. This could violate general contract law principles requiring good faith and reasonableness.",

                "explanation": "Delaying submission for only 3 days is insufficient for preparing and filing patent applications, conflicting with legal requirements and best practices for protecting intellectual property. In most jurisdictions, preparing and filing a patent application takes significantly longer than 3 days.",

Such notice shall be provided *only when deemed necessary* by the notifying party.",
                "explanation": "Delaying or omitting infringement notices could cause the other party to lose rights or remedies, violating duties of good faith and fair dealing, and creating liability under intellectual property law for failure to mitigate damages or address infringement issues promptly.",

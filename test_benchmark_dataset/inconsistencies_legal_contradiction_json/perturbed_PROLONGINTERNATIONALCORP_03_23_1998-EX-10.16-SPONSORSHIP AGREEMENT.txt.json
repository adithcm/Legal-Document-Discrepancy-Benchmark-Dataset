                "original_text": "Sabco shall, within 90 days of the execution of this Agreement, supply Prolong with a copy of such policy of insurance or a certificate thereof, and such policies shall be cancelable only upon 10 days written notice to  Prolong.",
                "changed_text": "Sabco shall, within 180 days of the execution of this Agreement, supply Prolong with a copy of such policy of insurance or a certificate thereof, and such policies shall be cancelable only upon 5 days written notice to Prolong.",
                "explanation": "This change creates two potential inconsistencies with standard insurance practices and North Carolina law. First, extending the period to provide insurance documentation to 180 days may violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, especially if Prolong needs proof of insurance sooner for their own risk management. Second, reducing the cancellation notice to 5 days may violate state regulations that require insurers to provide a minimum of 10 days notice to the insured (Prolong) before cancelling a policy, indirectly affecting Sabco's contractual obligation.",

This sponsorship fee of $ [ * ] shall be paid to Sabco in the following installments:  Year One (1998): $ [ * ] (four  equal installments of  $ [ * ] to be paid on 3/15/98, 6/15/98, 8/15/98 and  10/15/98); Year Two (1999): $ [ * ] (four equal installments of $ [ * ] to be  paid on 3/15/99, 6/15/99, 8/15/99 and 10/15/99); Year Three (year-2000): $ [ * ] (four equal installments of $ [ * ] to be paid on 3/15/2000, 6/15/2000,8/15/2000 and 10/15/2000).",

Should Prolong fail to make payment within the dates specified, Sabco will cease its services without notice.",
                "explanation": "Adding a penalty of ceasing all services without notice for failure to pay within the specified dates could contradict North Carolina's laws regarding contract termination and potential requirements for reasonable notice or opportunity to cure defaults, making the 'without notice' clause potentially unenforceable. Good faith and fair dealing typically necessitate some form of communication before drastic measures like service termination are taken.",

                "explanation": "Extending the usage rights of the drivers' likeness, voice, picture, and signature 'even after the termination of the agreement' could violate right of publicity laws in North Carolina (and generally). Individuals have the right to control the commercial use of their identity. Without explicit consent or additional compensation after the contract ends, this clause could be deemed an unlawful infringement on the drivers' rights to their own image and brand.",

You are expected to observe this rule very strictly since failure to do so will entitle the Company to stop payment in respect of each day you fail to notify the Company.",

You are expected to observe this rule very strictly since failure to do so will entitle the Company to stop payment in respect of each day you fail to notify the Company.",

The modified clause extends this deadline to 4:00 pm. This introduces a contradiction, as employment laws often specify strict notification timelines, and altering this deadline could lead to disputes regarding compliance and potential penalties for late notification under company policy.",

In addition, subject to (i) your (or your authorised representative or estate signing, if the termination is due to your death) signing a settlement agreement and a separation agreement and release (together the \"Settlement Agreements\") in a form and manner satisfactory to the Company, which shall include, without limitation, a general release of claims against the Company and all related persons and entities, a reaffirmation of all of your continuing obligations to the Company, including those set forth in paragraphs 13 - 15, and (in the case of the separation agreement and release) and a seven (7) business day revocation period; and (ii) the separation agreement and release becoming irrevocable, all within 60 days after the Termination Date (or such shorter period as set forth in the Settlement Agreements), the Company shall: (A) pay you (or your authorised representative or estate if the termination is due to your death) an amount equal to nine (9) months of your salary as of the Termination Date (which payment shall not be reduced by either the value of any salary paid to you during your notice period or by any payment in lieu of notice made pursuant to paragraph 11.2); and (B) pay you (or your authorised representative or estate if the termination is due to your death) an amount equal to the cost to the Company of providing you with the contractual benefits under paragraph 5 for nine (9) months or, at the Company's option, continue to provide you with such benefits for nine (9) months.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a seven (7) business day revocation period for the separation agreement and release. The modified text reduces this to three (3) business days. This creates a potential legal issue because, depending on jurisdiction and applicable laws regarding severance agreements and release of claims, a three-day revocation period might be considered insufficient for the employee to make a fully informed decision, making the release potentially unenforceable. Many jurisdictions in the United States, by comparison, afford the employee a minimum of seven days' consideration period for a severance agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows carried-over holiday to be taken until the end of March. The modified clause shortens this period to the end of January. This could conflict with UK Working Time Regulations, which mandate that employers must allow workers to take their statutory holiday entitlement, and unreasonably restricting the carry-over period could be seen as hindering this right. The change introduces a stricter timeline for using the accrued leave, potentially disadvantaging the employee. In many cases leave entitlement has to be at least 28 days, and any forfeiture would have to be reasonable.",

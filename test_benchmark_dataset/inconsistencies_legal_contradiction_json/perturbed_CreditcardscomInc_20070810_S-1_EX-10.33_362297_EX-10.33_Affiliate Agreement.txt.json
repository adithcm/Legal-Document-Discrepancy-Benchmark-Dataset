                "original_text": "Either Affiliate or Chase may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other party written or e-mail notice of termination.",
                "changed_text": "Either Affiliate or Chase may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by providing a 24-hour verbal notice of termination.",
                "explanation": "Many states, particularly in franchise or distribution agreements, require a reasonable written notice period for termination, often 30-90 days. A 24-hour verbal notice contradicts this requirement.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding reasonable notice, and potential violation of state franchise or distribution laws (example: California Franchise Relations Act)",
                "location": "Section 5"

                "changed_text": "Affiliate will receive Commission payments at Chase's sole discretion after termination, regardless of when the Approved Accounts were placed.",
                "explanation": "This gives Chase unchecked authority to withhold earned commissions, which contradicts state wage and payment laws that require employers to pay earned wages/commissions promptly after termination. Some states have specific timeframes (e.g., California Labor Code Section 201).",

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the amount of Commissions, the definition of Approved Accounts, and all other provisions of this Agreement are subject to change without notice other than posting such information on the Chase Website. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO AFFILIATE, THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT. AFFILIATE'S CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM FOLLOWING CHASE'S POSTING OF A NEW AGREEMENT ON ITS WEB SITE WILL CONSTITUTE BINDING ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE.",
                "changed_text": "Chase reserves the right to unilaterally change any terms of this Agreement, including commission rates and account definitions, effective immediately upon posting changes to its Website. Continued participation constitutes acceptance, and no formal notice beyond website posting is required, regardless of the change's impact on Affiliate.",
                "explanation": "This modification allows Chase to make drastic changes without providing reasonable notice or opportunity for the Affiliate to negotiate. This contradicts the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most contracts, and potentially state laws regulating unfair business practices. Furthermore, the lack of adequate notice and negotiation could render certain changes unenforceable, especially if they significantly alter the economics of the agreement for the Affiliate.",

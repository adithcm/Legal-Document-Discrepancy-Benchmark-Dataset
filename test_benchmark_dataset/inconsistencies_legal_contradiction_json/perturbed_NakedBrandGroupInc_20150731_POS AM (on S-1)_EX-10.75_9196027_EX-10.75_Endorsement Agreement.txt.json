                "original_text": "Naked shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Wade in the event Wade fails to perform the Wade Services or breaches any other covenant or agreement set forth herein (including the essence of this Agreement), and fails to cure same (if curable) within seven (7) days of receipt of written notice. Such termination shall relieve Naked of its obligation to provide any further consideration pursuant to this Agreement provided that Wade shall retain all warrants he has received hereunder that have vested as of the date of such termination.",
                "changed_text": "Naked shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately without prior written notice to Wade if Wade fails to perform the Wade Services or breaches any other covenant or agreement set forth herein (including the essence of this Agreement). Such termination shall relieve Naked of its obligation to provide any further consideration pursuant to this Agreement provided that Wade shall retain all warrants he has received hereunder that have vested as of the date of such termination.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement provides a 10-day notice and a 7-day cure period for Wade's failure to perform. The modified version allows Naked to terminate the agreement immediately without any notice or cure period. This change violates standard contract law principles and may contradict laws that mandate a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach before termination, creating an illegal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "Wade shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Naked in the event of the occurrence of any of the following: (i) Naked is adjudicated as insolvent or declares bankruptcy; or (ii) Naked fails to provide consideration due pursuant to this Agreement, within ten (10) days following the date such consideration is due hereunder (or, if Wade elects to receive stock in lieu of the cash consideration, if Naked fails to instruct its transfer agent to issue the appropriate amount of Common Stock to Wade within ten (10) days following the date such consideration is due in the event such consideration is payable in Common Stock); provided that Naked is notified in writing of such non-payment by Wade and such payment by Naked is not made within three (3) days following such notification; or (iii) Naked breaches any covenant or agreement set forth herein and fails to cure same (if curable) within seven (7) days of receipt of written notice.",
                "changed_text": "Wade shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately with no prior written notice to Naked in the event of the occurrence of any of the following: (i) Naked is adjudicated as insolvent or declares bankruptcy; or (ii) Naked fails to provide consideration due pursuant to this Agreement; or (iii) Naked breaches any covenant or agreement set forth herein.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires Wade to provide 10 days notice before terminating, with a 3 day cure period for non-payment by Naked, and a 7-day cure period for breaches of covenant. The modification eliminates the notice requirement and cure period, which could be seen as conflicting with the principles of 'good faith and fair dealing' implied in contract law, and may be deemed unconscionable under certain circumstances.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle amicably any controversy, or claim arising out of the Agreement or any breach thereof through a dispute resolution process involving Wade and members from the senior management of Naked. If the parties do not otherwise agree, either party may present any unresolved dispute for arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the \"Rules\") then in effect. Such arbitration will be held in New York, NY. The arbitration will be by a single arbitrator chosen by the parties, provided that if the parties fail to agree and to appoint a single arbitrator within twenty (20) business days from the date that one of the parties has made a demand for arbitration, then the arbitrator will be chosen in accordance with the Rules. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties and any award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "Any controversy or claim arising out of the Agreement or any breach thereof shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration conducted by an arbitrator selected solely by Naked. Wade waives any right to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding, with no right to appeal, and may be enforced in any court of Naked's choosing.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement specifies a mutual agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts, and mutual selection of an arbitrator with a fallback provision to the AAA rules if the parties cannot agree. The modified version gives Naked complete control over the arbitration process, including the selection of the arbitrator, and eliminates Wade's right to participate, eliminates any appeal process, and gives Naked the choice of forum for enforcing the arbitration award. This change contradicts fundamental principles of fairness and due process in arbitration, potentially rendering the clause unconscionable and unenforceable, violating legal standards for arbitration agreements.",

                "original_text": "3.4 ACCEPTANCE OF MILESTONE DELIVERABLE; CHANGE REQUESTS Client will notify Developer in writing of any failure of a Milestone Deliverable to comply with the Specifications, or of any other objections, corrections, changes or amendments required (a Change Request), within ten (10) days of such Milestone's Acceptance Test Date. Any Change Request shall be sufficient to identify, with clarity, any objection, correction, change or amendment to such Milestone Deliverable. In the absence of a Change Request from Client within the time periods detailed herein, the Milestone Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",
                "changed_text": "3.4 ACCEPTANCE OF MILESTONE DELIVERABLE; CHANGE REQUESTS Client will notify Developer in writing of any failure of a Milestone Deliverable to comply with the Specifications, or of any other objections, corrections, changes or amendments required (a Change Request), within three (3) days of such Milestone's Acceptance Test Date. Any Change Request needs only to state there is a problem and no specific details are needed. In the absence of a Change Request from Client within the time periods detailed herein, the Milestone Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",
                "explanation": "Shortening the time frame for reporting defects to 3 days places an unreasonable burden on the client and can be considered bad faith. States like California may require more reasonable timeframes for acceptance and reporting of issues in contracts.",

Upon Client's receipt of a Milestone Deliverable following Developer's modification pursuant to Change Request (a Modified Deliverable), Client will have five (5) days to inspect, test and reevaluate such Modified Deliverable to determine acceptance. If Client does not notify Developer of any further failures, objections, changes, defects, or bugs in such Modified Deliverable, the Modified Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",

Upon Client's receipt of a Milestone Deliverable following Developer's modification pursuant to Change Request (a Modified Deliverable), Client will have two (2) days to inspect, test and reevaluate such Modified Deliverable to determine acceptance. If Client does not notify Developer of any further failures, objections, changes, defects, or bugs in such Modified Deliverable, the Modified Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",
                "explanation": "By reducing the developer's correction time to 10 days and the client's re-evaluation period to 2 days, the contract imposes an unreasonably short timeframe that may not allow for adequate defect correction and re-testing. This could be viewed as unconscionable or a breach of good faith in some jurisdictions.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach or failure to pay undisputed fees to only three days is an unreasonably short timeframe, potentially violating good faith and fair dealing principles. This is especially true if the breach requires significant effort to resolve. A court may deem this provision unconscionable.",

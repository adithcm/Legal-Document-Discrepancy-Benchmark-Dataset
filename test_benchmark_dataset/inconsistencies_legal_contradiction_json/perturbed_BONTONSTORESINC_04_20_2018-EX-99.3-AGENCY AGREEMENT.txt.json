                "explanation": "Reducing the objection period for lease/contract assignments to 7 days is inconsistent with typical bankruptcy court practices and may violate due process if it doesn't allow sufficient time for counterparties to assess and respond to the proposed changes. Standard practice allows for a more extended period, such as 21 days, to ensure adequate opportunity for review and objection.",

                "explanation": "By shortening the Designation Rights Period, particularly for real estate leases, the amendment increases the potential for rushed decisions and undervalued asset sales. This violates the fiduciary duty to maximize value for creditors and stakeholders in a bankruptcy proceeding. This could be seen as a violation of standards expected in Chapter 11 cases where an orderly sale process is typically required.",

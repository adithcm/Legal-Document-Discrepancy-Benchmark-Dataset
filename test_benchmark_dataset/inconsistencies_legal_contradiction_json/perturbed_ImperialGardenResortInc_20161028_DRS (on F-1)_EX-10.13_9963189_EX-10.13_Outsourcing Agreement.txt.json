                "explanation": "The original text provides a review period of 4-6 months for the development plan, including soil and water conservation and environmental impact assessment reports. Reducing this review period to 1 month may not comply with Taiwanese environmental regulations that mandate sufficient review time for such comprehensive plans. Insufficient time may lead to inadequate assessment and potential environmental damage.",

                "explanation": "The original text allots 2-4 months for changing the land usage zoning and category. Reducing this to one week is insufficient to meet procedural requirements under Taiwanese Land Use Planning Act which mandates a public hearing, review by multiple agencies, and potential appeals which will naturally take more than a week.",

                "explanation": "The original text allocates approximately one month for the application and review of a construction license. Reducing this period to three days fails to realistically accommodate the necessary due diligence and approval processes which include review of documents for compliance with green construction standards and barrier free access. This does not adhere to Taiwanese Building Act.",

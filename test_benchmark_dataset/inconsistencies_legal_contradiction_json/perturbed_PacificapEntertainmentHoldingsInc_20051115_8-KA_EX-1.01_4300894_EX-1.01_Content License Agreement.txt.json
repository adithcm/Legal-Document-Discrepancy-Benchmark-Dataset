                "original_text": "Within 30 days of the end of each quarter during the term of this agreement, PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT shall receive from THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION, a detailed accounting statement showing Net Due and Paid Shared Revenues for that quarter and shall remit to PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT its share of such revenues.",
                "changed_text": "Within 90 days of the end of each quarter during the term of this agreement, PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT shall receive from THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION, a brief accounting statement showing approximate Net Due and Paid Shared Revenues for that quarter and shall remit to PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT its share of such revenues. If PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT does not inquire about more detail within 15 days, the statement stands as is.",
                "explanation": "California law, where both companies are located, generally requires more transparency in financial reporting and a reasonable timeframe for dispute. Lengthening the period to 90 days and adding a stipulation that limits PACIFICAP's inquiry timeframe to 15 days conflicts with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, potentially violating general contract principles related to reasonable business practices.",

After the Initial Term, this Agreement will be automatically renewed for successive additional 3~year periods (\"Extension Terms\"), unless otherwise terminated by either party by giving notice to the other party not less than sixty (60) days prior to the end of a Term.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement will become effective as of the last date of signature (Effective Date) and shall, unless sooner terminated as provided below or as otherwise agreed, remain effective for an initial term of 10 Years following the first date of public availability of the PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT Content within a THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION Property (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, this Agreement will be automatically renewed for successive additional 10-year periods (\"Extension Terms\"), unless otherwise terminated by either party by giving notice to the other party not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the end of a Term.",
                "explanation": "California law favors contract enforceability but can scrutinize automatically renewing contracts, particularly those with extended terms and short cancellation windows. Extending the renewal period to 10 years while shortening the termination notice to 15 days creates a potentially unconscionable term, making it difficult for either party to exit the agreement and violating principles of fair dealing under California contract law.",

THE ARBITRATOR'S DECISION IS FINAL AND NOT SUBJECT TO APPEAL.",
                "explanation": "California law requires arbitration agreements to be neutral and unbiased. Allowing one party (THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION) to unilaterally choose the arbitrator introduces bias and violates the principle of neutrality required in arbitration agreements. Additionally, eliminating the right to appeal may be deemed unconscionable under California law, especially if the arbitrator's decision is based on factual or legal errors.",

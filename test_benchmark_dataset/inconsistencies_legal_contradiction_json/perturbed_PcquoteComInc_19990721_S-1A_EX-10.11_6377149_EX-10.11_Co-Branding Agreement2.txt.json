(hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement. This Amendment shall apply to said PCQ and ABW and all of their subsidiaries and related companies.",

This Amendment shall apply to said PCQ and ABW and all of their subsidiaries and related companies.",
                "explanation": "By using the term 'nunc pro tunc' to retroactively apply the amendment to December 9, 1996, while dating the document in 2024, creates potential conflicts with statutes of limitations and other legal requirements that are dependent on the actual date of the agreement. This can make it difficult to determine which laws and regulations were in effect at the time the agreement was supposedly made.",

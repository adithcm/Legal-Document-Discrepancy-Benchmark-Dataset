                "original_text": "9.3 To remunerate HGF on the basis of thirty percent (30%) of net Company income basis on an annual basis commencing 12 months after the first full 12-month revenue period.",
                "changed_text": "9.3 To remunerate HGF on the basis of thirty percent (30%) of net Company income basis on an annual basis commencing 36 months after the first full 12-month revenue period.",
                "explanation": "This change delays the commencement of profit-sharing payments to HGF to 36 months after the first full 12-month revenue period. Depending on the specific regulations governing joint ventures and profit sharing in either Nevada (NVOS's state) or New Brunswick, Canada (HGF's province), or the jurisdiction where the JV is registered, this delay could be deemed an unreasonably long deferral of payments, potentially violating laws requiring timely and fair compensation or creating breach of fiduciary duty issues.",

                "changed_text": "15.1 The Company will prepare annual statements for review by the Parties, released on the 15th day of the second subsequent year.",
                "explanation": "This changes the frequency of financial reporting from quarterly to annually, delaying the release of these statements to the 15th day of the second subsequent year. Many jurisdictions mandate more frequent financial reporting for businesses, especially joint ventures. Delaying financial reporting for over a year could violate regulations requiring regular and transparent financial disclosures to stakeholders. This change introduces a delay that contradicts standard accounting practices and possibly regulations concerning the frequency of financial reporting.",

                "explanation": "The change reduces the minimum record retention period from five years to two years. Many federal and provincial laws (both in the US and Canada) require businesses to maintain records for longer periods for tax, audit, and compliance purposes. Reducing the retention period could lead to non-compliance with these legal requirements.",

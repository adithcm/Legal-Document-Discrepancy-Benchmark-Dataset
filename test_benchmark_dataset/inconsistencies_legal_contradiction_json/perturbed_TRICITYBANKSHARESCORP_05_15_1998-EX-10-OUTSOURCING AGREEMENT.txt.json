                "original_text": "All other amounts due hereunder shall be invoiced by M&I and shall be payable within thirty (30) days of invoice, unless otherwise provided in the Fee Schedule.  Customer shall also pay any collection fees and Damages incurred by M&I in collecting payment of the charges and any other amounts for which Customer is liable under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "All other amounts due hereunder shall be invoiced by M&I and shall be payable within sixty (60) days of invoice, unless otherwise provided in the Fee Schedule.  Customer shall also pay any collection fees and Damages incurred by M&I in collecting payment of the charges and any other amounts for which Customer is liable under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Many states have prompt payment laws that mandate payment within a shorter timeframe, especially in certain industries or for specific types of invoices. Extending the payment timeframe to 60 days may conflict with these regulations, particularly if the contract doesn't specify an acceptable 'otherwise provided' condition in the Fee Schedule.",

The Termination for Convenience Fee shall apply to any early termination of this Agreement other than pursuant to an Event of Default on the part of Customer or M&I or pursuant to Section 11.3 below.  Fifty percent of the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be paid to M&I within thirty (30) days following the date of Customer's notice and the remaining 50% shall be paid to M&I within thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Date of Termination.  In addition to the foregoing, Customer shall pay to M&I, any unamortized Conversion or other costs, reasonable Expenses in connection with the disposition of equipment, facilities and contracts related to M&I's performance of the Services on behalf of Customer.  The Termination for Convenience Fee shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 13.4.",

                "explanation": "Requiring a full year's notice for termination could be considered an unreasonable constraint of trade, particularly if it prevents the Customer from pursuing more advantageous business opportunities. Courts often scrutinize such lengthy notice periods, especially in service agreements, to determine if they are unduly burdensome.",

                "explanation": "The statute of limitations for breach of contract claims varies by state. Reducing the contractual limitation period to six months may be unenforceable if the applicable state law provides for a longer statutory period (e.g., several years). Parties cannot generally contractually shorten the limitation period to a duration that is considered unreasonably short or against public policy.",

                "changed_text": "All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when placed in the mail.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the requirement for overnight delivery, facsimile with acknowledgment, or registered/certified mail with return receipt. This conflicts with general contract law principles requiring reasonable methods for providing notice and, potentially, specific statutory requirements for certain types of notices (e.g., default notices) that may require proof of delivery to be considered valid. Changing the delivery requirement to ‘when placed in the mail’ could lead to disputes over whether a notice was actually received, especially in critical situations such as default or termination.",

                "original_text": "In the event a dispute, controversy or claim arises hereunder, including any claim whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict product liability or otherwise, the aggrieved Party will promptly provide written notification of the dispute to the other Party within ten (10) days after such dispute arises. Thereafter, a meeting shall be held promptly between the Parties, attended by representatives of the Parties with decision-making authority regarding the dispute, to attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the dispute. If the Parties are not successful in resolving a dispute within twenty-one (21) days, then, subject to the limitations on remedies set forth in Section 4.1 and Article 7, either Party may pursue whatever rights it has available under this Agreement, at law or in equity.",
                "changed_text": "In the event a dispute arises hereunder, the aggrieved Party will provide written notification of the dispute to the other Party within two (2) days after such dispute arises. If the Parties are not successful in resolving a dispute within seven (7) days, then either Party may pursue whatever rights it has available under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the initial notification period for disputes to just two days is problematic. This severely limits the aggrieved party's ability to properly assess the situation, gather evidence, and formulate a well-reasoned claim before having to provide formal notification. Furthermore, reducing the negotiation period to seven days puts unrealistic pressure on both parties and limits any potential for resolution. This abbreviated timeline conflicts with standard dispute resolution practices, potentially leading to premature litigation and increased legal costs. Some jurisdictions mandate reasonable timeframes for dispute resolution, which this violates.",

                "original_text": "At all times during the Term without cost to Owner, Operator shall maintain in force the following insurance, which insurance shall not be subject to cancellation, termination or other material adverse changes unless the insurer delivers to Owner written notice of the cancellation, termination or change at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of the cancellation, termination or material adverse change:\n\n(a) Worker's Compensation Insurance as required by the laws of the state where Operator's facilities are located;\n\n(b) Employer's liability insurance with limits not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000); and\n\n(c) Commercial General Liability Insurance, including bodily injury and property damage liability including premises operations, contractual liability endorsements, products liability and completed operations with limits not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000).\n\nOperator shall cause Owner (and such additional parties as Owner designates in writing) to be named additional insured(s), must be written as primary policy not contributing to or in excess of any policies carried by the Owner, and each contain a waiver of subrogation endorsement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Owner, in favor of the Owner.",

In case of cancellation, termination or other material adverse changes in the insurance, the Operator will notify the Owner as soon as practically possible. The Worker's Compensation Insurance, Employer's liability insurance and Commercial General Liability Insurance and limits are up to the Operator.",
                "explanation": "This modification gives the Operator complete discretion over the insurance coverage, essentially nullifying the original requirements. Removing specific limits and notice requirements contradicts standard risk management practices and legal expectations for liability protection. Giving the Operator discretion over notification conflicts with standard insurance and contract law principles. By eliminating specific limits and notice requirements, the Owner loses critical protection, potentially violating fiduciary responsibilities and creating significant financial risks for the Owner.",

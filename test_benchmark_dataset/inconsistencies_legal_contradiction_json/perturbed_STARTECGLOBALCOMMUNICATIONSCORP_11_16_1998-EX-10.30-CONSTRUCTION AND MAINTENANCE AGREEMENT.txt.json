                "original_text": "In calling the General Committee meetings, the chairperson shall give at least forty-five (45) days' advance notice of each meeting together with a copy of the draft agenda. In cases of emergency, such notice period may be reduced if Parties representing at least one-third (1/3) of the total voting interests as specified in Schedule B, are in agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In calling the General Committee meetings, the chairperson shall give at least ten (10) days' advance notice of each meeting together with a copy of the draft agenda. In cases of emergency, such notice period may be reduced if Parties representing at least one-third (1/3) of the total voting interests as specified in Schedule B, are in agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the advance notice period for General Committee meetings to 10 days could be problematic if it impedes the ability of committee members to prepare for the meetings, attend to other business requirements and arrange travel logistics. A 45-day notice period gives parties enough time to prepare and respond, but 10 days may not be enough time. This is because a standard, legally defensible period is being reduced.",

For the purposes of this Agreement, extended payment charges shall be computed at a rate equal to 150 % of the appropriate financial charges as indicated in Subparagraph 14.3 on the day following the date payment of the bill was due. In the event that applicable law allows the imposition of extended payment interest charges only at a rate less than that established in accordance with this Subparagraph, extended payment charges shall be at the highest rate permitted by such applicable law. In this case, appropriate documents to demonstrate the applicability of such law shall be provided by the concerned Party.",

For the purposes of this Agreement, extended payment charges shall be computed at a rate equal to 300 % of the appropriate financial charges as indicated in Subparagraph 14.3 on the day following the date payment of the bill was due. In the event that applicable law allows the imposition of extended payment interest charges only at a rate less than that established in accordance with this Subparagraph, extended payment charges shall be at the highest rate permitted by such applicable law. In this case, appropriate documents to demonstrate the applicability of such law shall be provided by the concerned Party.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the extended payment charge rate to 300% of the appropriate financial charges may violate usury laws or regulations regarding excessive interest rates, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific financial charges involved. Many jurisdictions have limits on the amount of interest that can be charged, and a 300% rate could exceed those limits.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year after the agreement's termination could conflict with trade secret laws, which often require confidentiality to be maintained for as long as the information remains a trade secret. Five years may be needed to effectively protect certain information, and reducing the period to one year introduces conflict.",

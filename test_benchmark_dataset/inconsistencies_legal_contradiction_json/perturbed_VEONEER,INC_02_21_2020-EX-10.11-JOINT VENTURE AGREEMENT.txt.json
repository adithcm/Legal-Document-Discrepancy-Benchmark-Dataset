                "explanation": "Changing the governing law to North Korea would introduce a legal contradiction, as it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to enforce the agreement under North Korean law due to international sanctions, lack of legal transparency, and fundamentally different legal and business practices. Contracts are generally governed by jurisdictions where parties have connections or where business activity takes place.",

                "explanation": "Changing the clause to release parties from liability for breaches prior to closing introduces a legal contradiction. Generally, parties remain liable for breaches of contract that occurred before the termination or amendment of the agreement. Releasing liability retroactively could conflict with established contract law principles regarding vested rights and obligations.",

The Nissin Parties' obligation to provide indemnification will cease in one (1) week from the VNBZ Closing.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence imposes an unreasonably short period of one week for D&O Indemnity, which typically requires a longer timeframe to address potential liabilities. This conflicts with typical Indemnity clauses in commercial contracts and could lead to unenforceability due to its restrictiveness and lack of commercial reasonableness.",

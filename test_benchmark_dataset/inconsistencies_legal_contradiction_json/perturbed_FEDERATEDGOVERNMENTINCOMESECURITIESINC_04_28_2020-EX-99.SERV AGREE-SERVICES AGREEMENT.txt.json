Duration and Termination.\n\n(a) Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the effective date first above written and shall continue until terminated by mutual agreement of the parties hereto or by either party on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party hereto.",

Duration and Termination.\n\n(a) Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the effective date first above written and shall continue until terminated by mutual agreement of the parties hereto or by either party on not less than 10 days' written notice to the other party hereto.",
                "explanation": "The original contract stipulates a 60-day written notice for termination. Shortening this to 10 days could be problematic under certain state laws or regulations, particularly if those laws mandate a longer notice period for contract termination to ensure fair dealing or to allow sufficient time to find alternative service providers. This creates a potential legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The original contract requires 60 days written notice to the Advisor to terminate the agreement. By removing the written notice clause and the time frame, this creates a potential legal contradiction where regulations might mandate a certain amount of time for the adviser to prepare to be terminated for the accounts.",

                "original_text": "FASC shall give prompt notice to the Adviser of the assertion of any claim or liability which is reasonably likely to result in a claim for indemnification under this Section; provided that the failure to give such notice, or any delay in giving such notice, shall not lessen the obligation of the Adviser to indemnify FASC except to the extent it results in actual prejudice. The Adviser shall have the option, by notice to FASC, to assume the defense of any claim which may be the subject of indemnification hereunder. In the event such notice is given, the Adviser shall assume the defense of the claim, and FASC shall cooperate with the Adviser in such defense, subject to the obligation of the Adviser to reimburse FASC for the expenses resulting therefrom. In the event Adviser gives notice that it will assume the defense of any claim, the Adviser shall not be obligated to indemnify FASC for any further legal or other expenses incurred in investigating or defending such claim, except those incurred at the request of the Adviser or its counsel. FASC shall in no event compromise or settle any claim for which it may seek indemnification hereunder, except with the prior written consent of the Adviser or unless the Adviser fails, within 30 days after notice of the terms of such settlement, to notify FASC that it has assumed the defense of such claim and will indemnify FASC for any liability resulting therefrom.",
                "changed_text": "FASC shall give notice to the Adviser of the assertion of any claim or liability which is reasonably likely to result in a claim for indemnification under this Section when FASC deems necessary. The Adviser shall not have the option to assume the defense of any claim which may be the subject of indemnification hereunder. FASC shall in no event compromise or settle any claim for which it may seek indemnification hereunder, without the prior written consent of the Adviser, regardless of whether the Adviser responds within 30 days.",
                "explanation": "The changes remove the requirement for 'prompt notice,' granting FASC discretion over when to notify the Adviser. It also removes the Adviser's option to assume the defense of a claim and eliminates the 30-day response period for the Adviser to decide on assuming the defense. This is a contradiction because in many jurisdictions a failure of reasonable or prompt notice can severely curtail a party's right to indemnification. By removing the Adviser's right to assume the defense, the indemnification is heavily one-sided. Furthermore, it is assumed that there is no response, the FASC can not compromise or settle any claim for which it may seek indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of the Advisor, meaning they are in control of the defense of the claim.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts legal standards requiring prompt and reasonable notice for indemnification claims and the right to control one's own defense in legal proceedings. It also impacts fairness, as FASC would not be able to make any decision without the Adviser being in agreement first.",

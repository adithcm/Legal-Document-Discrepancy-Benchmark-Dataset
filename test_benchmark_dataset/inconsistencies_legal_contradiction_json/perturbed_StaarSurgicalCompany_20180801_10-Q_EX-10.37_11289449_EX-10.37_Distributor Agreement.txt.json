Late payments shall be subject to an interest charge of 1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts usury laws, which limit the amount of interest that can be charged on a debt. Charging 25% per month far exceeds legal limits in California and most other jurisdictions, making this clause unenforceable.",

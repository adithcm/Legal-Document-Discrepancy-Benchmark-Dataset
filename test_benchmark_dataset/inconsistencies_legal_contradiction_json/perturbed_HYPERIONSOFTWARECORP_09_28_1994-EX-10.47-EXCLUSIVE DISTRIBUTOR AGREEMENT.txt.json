                "original_text": "Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees and expenses payable hereunder for which Developer issues an invoice to Distributor shall be due and payable thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice. A late payment charge of the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest interest rate allowed by applicable law shall be charged upon all unpaid amounts due hereunder for more than thirty (30) days.",
                "changed_text": "Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees and expenses payable hereunder for which Developer issues an invoice to Distributor shall be due and payable sixty (60) days from the date of the invoice. A late payment charge of three percent (3%) per week shall be charged upon all unpaid amounts due hereunder for more than thirty (30) days.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 30-day payment term and a late payment charge of 1.5% per month. The modified text changes the payment term to 60 days and increases the late payment charge to 3% per week. Singapore's law states that late payment interest can only be charged on overdue debt, no more than 8% per annum. This makes the contract unenforceable because the weekly penalty is more than Singapore's laws.",

Distributor shall give written notice to Developer within thirty (30) calendar days of delivery in the event that any Product does not conform with the terms of this Agreement. If Distributor fails to give any such notice, the Products shall be deemed accepted for all purposes of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall inspect all Products immediately upon delivery and shall, within two (2) calendar days, give written notice to the common cartier and Developer of any claim for damages or shortages. Distributor shall give written notice to Developer within fifteen (15) calendar days of delivery in the event that any Product does not conform with the terms of this Agreement. If Distributor fails to give any such notice, the Products shall be deemed accepted for all purposes of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows 7 days to notify the carrier and developer of damages or shortages and 30 days to notify the developer if the product fails to conform to the agreement. The modified version reduces these periods to 2 days and 15 days, respectively. This may be considered unreasonably short under Singapore law and could be deemed to be unconscionable.",

                "explanation": "The original text imposes a two-year non-compete clause. The modified text extends this period to five years and broadens the scope of the prohibited activity. Under Singapore law, restraint of trade clauses are only enforceable if they are reasonable in scope and duration. A five-year non-compete across 'any product' may be considered unreasonable and thus unenforceable, especially given the rapid technological advancements in the computer program industry. This restriction is too broad, as is indicated by the restriction of product in 'any capacity'",

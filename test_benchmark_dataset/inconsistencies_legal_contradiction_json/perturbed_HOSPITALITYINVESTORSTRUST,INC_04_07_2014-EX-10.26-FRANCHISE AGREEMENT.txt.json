You will prepare, on a current basis, (and preserve for no less than the greater of four (4) years or the time period we stated in our record retention requirements), complete and accurate records concerning Gross Rooms Revenue and all financial, operating, marketing and other aspects of the Hotel. You will maintain an accounting system that fully and accurately reflects all financial aspects of the Hotel and its business.",

You will prepare, on a current basis, (and preserve for no less than one (1) year), complete and accurate records concerning Gross Rooms Revenue and all financial, operating, marketing and other aspects of the Hotel. You will maintain an accounting system that fully and accurately reflects all financial aspects of the Hotel and its business.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the record retention period to one year, conflicting with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and IRS guidelines that typically require businesses to keep financial records for at least three years, and sometimes longer, for audit purposes. This creates a non-compliance issue.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for payment defaults to three days may violate state franchise laws or general principles of contract law requiring reasonable opportunity to cure a breach. Many jurisdictions consider such a short cure period unreasonable, potentially making the termination clause unenforceable.",

Notices under this Agreement must be in writing and must be delivered in person, by prepaid overnight commercial delivery service, or by prepaid overnight mail, registered or certified, with return-receipt requested. Notices to us must be sent to 7930 Jones Branch Drive, Suite 1100, McLean, VA 22102, ATTN: General Counsel. We will send notices to your address set forth in the Addendum. If you want to change the name or address for notice to you, you must do so in writing, signed by you or your duly authorized representative, designating a single address for notice, which may not be a P.O. Box, in compliance with this Subsection. Notice will be deemed effective on the earlier of: 1) receipt or first refusal of delivery; 2) one (1) day after posting if sent via overnight commercial delivery service or overnight United States Mail; or 3) three (3) days after placement in the United States mail if overnight delivery is not available to the notice address.",

We will send notices to your address as known publicly. If you want to change the name or address for notice to you, you must yell that out loud and expect that we heard you. Notice will be deemed effective immediately, so long as we acknowledge it.",
                "explanation": "The modification suggests that social media is the source of valid communications. This is problematic and contradicts traditional norms around notice. It is considered unreasonable due to it not being a reliable source of legal or contractual notice.",

                "original_text": "Each Usage Report will cover a calendar\n                   month and will be delivered within fifteen (15) days following\n                   the end of the applicable month.",
                "changed_text": "Each Usage Report will cover a calendar\n                   month and will be delivered within sixty (60) days following\n                   the end of the applicable month.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the deadline for providing usage reports to 60 days, which may conflict with industry standards and potentially breach the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, especially if prompt reporting is crucial for calculating payments or monitoring performance. It makes it unreasonably difficult for Excite to check if they are on the right track.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to 10 days for a material breach may be considered commercially unreasonable, especially for complex contractual relationships, and may conflict with legal principles requiring reasonable opportunity to cure. Ten days is not enough time to fix any issues that come up.",

                "explanation": "Extending the payment deadline after termination or expiration to 90 days may violate state wage laws or other regulations requiring prompt payment of outstanding obligations upon contract termination. This makes it harder for excite to maintain capital and violates standards that want employees paid in a reasonable time frame.",

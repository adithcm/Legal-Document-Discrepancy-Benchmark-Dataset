                "changed_text": "Such invoice must be paid by the customer within 90 days of the date on which the invoice is issued.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts general prompt payment laws and B2B payment standards, which typically require payment within 30-60 days. Extending the payment term to 90 days, without explicit justification may be considered unreasonable, particularly in smaller transactions. In Spain (the governing law), Law 3/2004 establishes measures to combat late payments in commercial transactions, usually setting default payment terms lower than 90 days unless otherwise expressly agreed and justified by the nature of the transaction.",

                "explanation": "This change shortens the confidentiality period from five years to one year. The duration of confidentiality clauses should align with the nature of the confidential information and industry standards. Spain's trade secret laws (Law 1/2019) protect valuable business information indefinitely, as long as it remains a secret. Reducing the contractual confidentiality term to one year undermines this protection, potentially exposing trade secrets and other proprietary information to early disclosure after the agreement ends.",

                "changed_text": "The Agreement rests, for all that, cancellable at any time by any of the parties before the expiry date of the Agreement or any of itsrenewals, upon one month prior written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the prior written notice period required for cancellation from three months to one month. According to Spanish contract law, particularly in ongoing service agreements, a reasonable notice period is expected to allow for a smooth transition. Reducing the notice period to one month may be considered commercially unreasonable, especially given the nature of IT outsourcing services, as it limits the Customer's ability to find a replacement service provider. This can be deemed an abusive practice violating the principle of good faith in contractual relations.",

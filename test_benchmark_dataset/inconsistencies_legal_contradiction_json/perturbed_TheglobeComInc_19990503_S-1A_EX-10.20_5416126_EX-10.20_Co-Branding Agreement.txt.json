                "original_text": "Overdue payments shall accrue interest, at the lesser of 1 1/2% per month or the maximum allowable interest under applicable law, from due date until paid, and the owing party shall pay the owed party's costs of collection (including reasonable attorneys' fees).",
                "changed_text": "Overdue payments shall accrue interest at 25% per month from due date until paid, and the owing party shall pay the owed party's costs of collection (including reasonable attorneys' fees).",
                "explanation": "Usury laws in most states and under federal regulations set limits on the maximum interest rate that can be charged on debts. Charging 25% per month far exceeds these limits and would be considered usurious and therefore an illegal term.",
                "contradicted_law": "State Usury Laws, Federal Lending Regulations",
                "location": "Section 6.1"

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A party obligated to make payments hereunder shall keep for 3 years proper records and books of account relating to the computation of such payments.  Once every 12 months, the party receiving payment or its designee may inspect such records to verify reports.  Any such inspection will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the inspected party's business activities.",
                "changed_text": "A party obligated to make payments hereunder shall keep records related to payment computations for 6 months. Inspections to verify reports can occur at any time with no prior notice.",
                "explanation": "The change reduces the record-keeping duration to 6 months, conflicting with standard accounting practices and potential legal requirements (depending on the jurisdiction and type of agreement) that necessitate longer retention periods for financial records. Eliminating the advance notice requirement for inspections also introduces a conflict as it may violate privacy laws, and could be deemed an unreasonable business practice.",

In addition, by providing written notice, theglobe may immediately terminate this Agreement, or at its option immediately suspend its promotion and other efforts hereunder, in the case of Boxlot's breach of Section 12.1  [Compliance with Laws].",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this agreement without notice if the other party is suspected of being in breach.",
                "explanation": "The modified text allows termination based on suspicion alone, without providing any opportunity to cure the alleged breach. This contradicts basic principles of contract law that require a reasonable opportunity to remedy a breach before termination can occur. Moreover, many state laws mandate specific notice periods for contract termination, regardless of the reason.",

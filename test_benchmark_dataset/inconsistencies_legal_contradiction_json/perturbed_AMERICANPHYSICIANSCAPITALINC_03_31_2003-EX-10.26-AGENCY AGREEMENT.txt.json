                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Commissions on premiums shall be paid to the Agency within 30 business days of the month in which such premiums are received and recorded by MICOA, subject to deduction by MICOA of any return commissions due from the Agency.",
                "changed_text": "Commissions on premiums shall be paid to the Agency within 90 business days of the month in which such premiums are received and recorded by MICOA, subject to deduction by MICOA of any return commissions due from the Agency.",
                "explanation": "Nevada law requires prompt payment of commissions. While a specific timeframe is not explicitly stated, 90 business days could be considered an unreasonable delay and thus violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Nevada contract law.",

                "original_text": "In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason, MICOA agrees to purchase from Agency, and Agency agrees to sell to MICOA Agency's ownership interest in the expirations for the MICOA insurance issued pursuant to this Agreement. The purchase price shall be two times Agency's commissions on business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be completed within 60 calendar days after the termination date. In return for this payment, for a two-year period following the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason, MICOA agrees to purchase from Agency, and Agency agrees to sell to MICOA Agency's ownership interest in the expirations for the MICOA insurance issued pursuant to this Agreement. The purchase price shall be one times Agency's commissions on business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be completed within 180 calendar days after the termination date. In return for this payment, for a five-year period following the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modifications impact several aspects: Lowering the purchase price for expirations devalues the agency's asset. Increasing the purchase completion timeframe to 180 days unduly delays compensation. Lengthening the non-compete period to five years may be considered unreasonable restraint of trade under Nevada law, potentially conflicting with regulations governing non-compete agreements, particularly regarding duration and scope.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Nevada's regulations concerning unreasonable restraints of trade or the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing depending on the specific circumstances and court interpretation.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall terminate, subject to any automatic renewal or extension for one year as required by law, upon either party giving at least one hundred twenty (120) days advance written notice to the other, if not otherwise contrary to applicable law or this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall terminate, subject to any automatic renewal or extension for one year as required by law, upon either party giving at least thirty (30) days advance written notice to the other, if not otherwise contrary to applicable law or this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 30 days may be deemed insufficient and commercially unreasonable, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Nevada law. Although Nevada law doesn't explicitly specify a minimum notice period for contract termination in general, courts may scrutinize such a short period for fairness, especially given the potential disruption it could cause to the agency's business.",

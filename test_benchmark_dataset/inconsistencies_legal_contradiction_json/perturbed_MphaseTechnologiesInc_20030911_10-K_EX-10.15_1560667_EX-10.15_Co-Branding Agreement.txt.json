                "original_text": "11. The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall          continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to          annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual          expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent          shall not be unreasonably withheld. Either party wishing to terminate          the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least          thirty (30) days prior to the desired date of termination.",
                "changed_text": "11. The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Either party wishing to terminate the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least ten (10) days prior to the desired date of termination.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the required notice period for termination to 10 days. This is a legal contradiction because, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances, such a short notice period might be deemed unreasonable, particularly if it involves significant business relationships or reliance. This would violate general contract law principles requiring reasonable notice for termination to prevent undue harm.",

In the event that mPhase's use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, in the          sole judgment of Lucent, may adversely affect Lucent's rights to the          mark shown on Schedule A or the marks and names LUCENT, LUCENT          TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN, Lucent may upon written          notification to mPhase, terminate this Agreement.",

In the event that mPhase's use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, in the sole judgment of Lucent, may adversely affect Lucent's rights to the mark shown on Schedule A or the marks and names LUCENT, LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN, Lucent may terminate this Agreement with no written notification to mPhase.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for written notification before termination contradicts fundamental principles of contract law, which emphasize fairness and due process. Failing to provide notice could be considered a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it deprives mPhase of the opportunity to address Lucent's concerns or mitigate any perceived adverse effects. This could also violate state laws regarding unfair business practices, depending on the circumstances.",

                "changed_text": "14. This Agreement shall not be assigned by mPhase under any circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The modification prohibits mPhase from assigning the contract under any circumstance, even with Lucent's consent. While contracts can restrict assignment, an absolute prohibition, especially if it unreasonably restricts mPhase's ability to conduct its business, could be challenged as an unreasonable restraint on trade. This might violate state antitrust laws or common law principles against unreasonable restrictions on alienability of contract rights.",

                "original_text": "B. Termination. In the event of a material breach by either Party of any term of this Agreement, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the breaching Party if the breaching Party fails to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice thereof.",
                "changed_text": "B. Termination. In the event of a material breach by either Party of any term of this Agreement, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the breaching Party if the breaching Party fails to cure such material breach within ten (10) days of receipt of written notice thereof.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 10 days could be considered unreasonably short under New York law (the governing law of this contract, as indicated in section 13.H) depending on the complexity of the breach and the effort required for remediation. A court might find this provision unconscionable and unenforceable. The original cure period of thirty (30) days is more reasonable and common.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the response time to renew the contract from August 31, 2000 to August 1, 2000 (30 days less) might create an unconscionable deadline. FMM may claim that there was not enough time to review the renewal proposal or to make reasonable inquiry to make an informed decision",

If iVillage does not receive FMM's acceptance or rejection of such within the allotted time, iVillage shall deem FMM's silence as acceptance.",

If iVillage does not receive FMM's acceptance or rejection of such within the allotted time, iVillage shall deem FMM's silence as acceptance.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the review time for the Bridge Site design and content to only one business day may be viewed as unreasonable, particularly if the design is complex or requires significant internal review within FMM. It could be argued that this unfairly pressures FMM into accepting a design without proper evaluation, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under New York law.",

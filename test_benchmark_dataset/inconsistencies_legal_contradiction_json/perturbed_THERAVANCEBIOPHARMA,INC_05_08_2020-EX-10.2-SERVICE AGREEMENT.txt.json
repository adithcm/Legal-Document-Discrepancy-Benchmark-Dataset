                "original_text": "2.1 The Executive's employment with the Company will commence on the Commencement Date and shall continue, subject to the remaining terms of this Agreement, until terminated by either party giving the other the following minimum advance written notice:\n\n2.1.1 6 weeks' notice;\n\n2.1.2 such other longer period as required by law.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period to 1 week contradicts UK employment law, specifically the Employment Rights Act 1996, which stipulates minimum notice periods based on length of service. For employment exceeding two years, the minimum notice is two weeks, and increases by one week for each year of service up to a maximum of 12 weeks. Given that 2.2 states the executive's employment began in 2013, 1 week's notice is a clear violation.",

The Executive's employment will terminate immediately and any PILON due to the Executive in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of this clause 17 will be paid within 28 days. The PILON will be equal to the basic salary (as at the Termination Date) which the Executive would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at clause 2 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period) less deductions required by law.",

                "explanation": "Extending the PILON payment to 90 days following termination directly contradicts the legal requirement for timely wage payments upon termination of employment. While specific laws vary, unreasonably delaying payment beyond a normal pay cycle could violate UK's Employment Rights Act 1996 regarding prompt payment of wages upon termination.",

Post Termination Restrictions During the term of employment and for one (1) year thereafter, the Executive will not directly or indirectly, either themselves or through others, encourage or solicit any employee of the Company to leave the Company for any reason.

Post Termination Restrictions During the term of employment and for five (5) years thereafter, the Executive will not directly or indirectly, either themselves or through others, encourage or solicit any employee of the Company to leave the Company for any reason. This obligation shall not affect any responsibility the Executive has as an employee of the Company with respect to the bona fide hiring and firing of Company personnel.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the non-solicitation period to 5 years is likely unenforceable and unreasonable under UK law. Courts are hesitant to enforce restrictions that unduly restrain an individual's ability to earn a living. A 5-year period is far longer than what is typically considered reasonable for protecting legitimate business interests (e.g., client relationships, trade secrets) and will likely be seen as an unlawful restraint of trade.",

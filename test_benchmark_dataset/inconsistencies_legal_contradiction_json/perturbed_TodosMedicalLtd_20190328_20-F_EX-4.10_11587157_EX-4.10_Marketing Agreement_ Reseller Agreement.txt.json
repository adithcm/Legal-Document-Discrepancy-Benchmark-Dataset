                "original_text": "5.7 Payment for Products. Todos shall invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to the Reseller, and the Reseller shall pay such sums by no later than thirty (30) days from the date of shipment. All payments made to Todos shall be in New Israeli Shekels.",
                "changed_text": "5.7 Payment for Products. Todos shall invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to the Reseller, and the Reseller shall pay such sums by no later than ninety (90) days from the date of shipment. All payments made to Todos shall be in New Israeli Shekels.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment term to 90 days. While seemingly beneficial to the Reseller, this contradicts typical commercial standards in Israel where shorter payment terms (30-60 days) are more common, potentially violating the 'Reasonable Period' regulations if that is deemed the appropriate standard in the jurisdiction, thus making enforcement of the payment clause questionable under Israeli law. Additionally, the original contract stipulated 30 days from the date of shipment for sums to be paid to Products but the modification increases the period to 90 days, contradicting the original text.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates the implied term of 'reasonableness' in contract law within Israel. No specific law is directly violated, but deviating significantly from typical payment terms could render the clause unenforceable.",

Todos shall have the right to have an inspection and audit of all the relevant accounting and sales books and records of Reseller conducted by an independent auditor reasonably acceptable to both parties. Any such audit shall be upon five (5) days prior written notice and shall be conducted during normal business hours.",
                "changed_text": "6.3 Audits. Todos shall have the right to have an inspection and audit of all the relevant accounting and sales books and records of Reseller conducted by an independent auditor of Todos's choosing. Any such audit shall be upon one (1) days prior written notice and shall be conducted at any time deemed suitable by Todos.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires that the auditor should be acceptable by both parties and should give a prior written notice of five days. However, the changed text gives all the power to Todos to choose their own auditor and giving only one day prior written notice to the reseller, which is not a reasonable amount of time in normal business circumstances. This can create a conflicting situation violating the contract law principles of good faith and fairness. The modification reduces the notice period to one day and removes the requirement for the auditor to be reasonably acceptable, contradicting the contract law principles that requires audits to be done in a reasonable manner.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contradicts contract law principles of good faith and fairness in business practices. While no single Israeli law is directly violated, the modification makes the audit clause potentially unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires a material breach and a 30-day cure period. The modified version removes both conditions, allowing immediate termination for any breach, regardless of materiality or opportunity to cure. This could contradict Israeli contract law principles requiring proportionality and good faith in exercising contractual rights, as well as principles of fairness.",

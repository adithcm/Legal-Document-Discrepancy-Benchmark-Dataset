                "changed_text": "Within [***] ([***]) days after Aimmune's sole discretion, Aimmune shall issue to Xencor shares of Aimmune Common Stock (the \"Shares\") in accordance with that certain Stock Issuance Agreement, dated the date hereof, by and among Xencor and Aimmune (the \"Stock Issuance Agreement\"), and pay to Xencor by wire transfer of immediately available funds, into an account designated in writing by Xencor, an amount equal to five million Dollars ($5,000,000) (together with the issuance of the Shares, the \"Upfront Payment\").",
                "explanation": "Payment terms modified to grant Aimmune discretion over payment timing introduces ambiguity and can cause inconsistencies with standard contract principles.

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall promptly notify' to 'may notify' and replacing the payment deadline with 'at Aimmune's discretion' removes the mandatory nature of notification and payment. This contradicts contract law principles requiring clear obligations and timelines, and introduces an unenforceable payment schedule.",

Payment date should be determined solely by Aimmune and may not permit confirmation of the payment's accuracy.",
                "explanation": "Removing the fixed payment deadline and allowing Aimmune to determine payment dates and report details makes the payment terms vague and unenforceable.

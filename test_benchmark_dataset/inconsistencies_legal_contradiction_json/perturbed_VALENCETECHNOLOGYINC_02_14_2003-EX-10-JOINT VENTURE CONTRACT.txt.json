                "original_text": "The Contract Term shall extend for a period of fifty (50) years. The date that the Business License is issued is the Establishment Date of the Joint Venture Company. Upon the agreement of all Parties and the unanimous consent of the Board of Directors, an application to extend the Contract Term may be made to the Examination and Approval Authority no less than six (6) months prior to the expiration of the Contract Term.",
                "changed_text": "The Contract Term shall extend for a period of seventy-five (75) years. The date that the Business License is issued is the Establishment Date of the Joint Venture Company. Upon the agreement of all Parties and the unanimous consent of the Board of Directors, an application to extend the Contract Term may be made to the Examination and Approval Authority no less than one (1) month prior to the expiration of the Contract Term.",
                "explanation": "Under Chinese law, specifically the Equity Joint Venture Law, the typical contract term for a joint venture is generally limited to a maximum of 50 years. Although longer terms are possible, they require special justification and approval, making a standard 75-year term non-compliant without specific legal grounds. Also, changing the application timeline for extension to one month goes against the typical legal requirements to provide ample notice for renewal.",

The liquidation committee shall value and liquidate the Joint Venture Company's assets without strict adherence to Chinese laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "Chinese Company Law mandates a formal liquidation process under government supervision to protect creditor and employee interests. By making the appointment of a liquidation committee discretionary and undermining the adherence to Chinese law, the provision becomes non-compliant. Chinese liquidation laws requires strict adherence to legal processes.",

                "explanation": "Under Chinese Contract Law, Force Majeure typically suspends contractual obligations, and parties are expected to mitigate the impact. Automatically terminating the contract and removing the obligation to provide evidence or mitigate the event contradicts the principle of good faith and the standard interpretation of Force Majeure clauses under Chinese law.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment terms of net 30 days. Changing it to net 60 days without proper justification and documentation may violate prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions (including some U.S. states or countries where either party operates), particularly if these laws mandate shorter payment periods for specific industries or contract types. Many jurisdictions have laws that impose interest penalties, and this could potentially contradict them.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for intellectual property claims to one (1) business day may be considered unreasonably short under applicable law and would potentially impede the customer's ability to adequately prepare a defense or take appropriate action and violates the partyâ€™s right to due process under the law. This change places undue burden and risk on the customer, potentially conflicting with principles of fairness and reasonableness in contract law.",

If the defaulting party fails to cure such default or submit an acceptable written plan to resolve such default within ten (10) days following notice of default, the non-defaulting party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by furnishing the defaulting party with thirty (30) days written notice of termination.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to ten (10) days and the termination notice period to thirty (30) days could be deemed unreasonable depending on the nature of the default and the complexity of the contract. This may violate general principles of contract law that require reasonable opportunity to cure a breach and adequate notice of termination. Shorter periods could be unenforceable in some jurisdictions, particularly if they are seen as unfairly prejudicial to the defaulting party.",

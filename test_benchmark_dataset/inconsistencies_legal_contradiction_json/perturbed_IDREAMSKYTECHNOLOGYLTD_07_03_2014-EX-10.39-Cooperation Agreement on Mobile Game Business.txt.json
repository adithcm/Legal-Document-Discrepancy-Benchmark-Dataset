Party B shall clearly specify and make public the channel and body by which the business consulting, claims and complaints will be accepted. Party B shall be obliged to visit the online complaint handling system every day and respond to the complaints within 24 hours.",

Party B shall clearly specify and make public the channel and body by which the business consulting, claims and complaints will be accepted. Party B is not obligated to respond to complaints in any specific timeframe.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for Party B to respond to complaints within 24 hours, this change contradicts standard consumer protection laws that often mandate timely responses to customer complaints. Many jurisdictions have regulations or guidelines suggesting reasonable response times, and removing this obligation creates potential non-compliance.",

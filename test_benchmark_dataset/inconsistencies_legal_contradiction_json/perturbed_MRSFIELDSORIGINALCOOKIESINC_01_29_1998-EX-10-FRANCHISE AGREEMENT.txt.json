                "original_text": "Franchisee shall commence operation of the Franchise the earlier of: 1) one  hundred  fifty (150) days after the  execution  of this  Agreement;  (2) as specified in the lease for the Site; or (3) as otherwise required or approved in writing by Pretzel Time. Failure to open the Unit within the aforementioned time period shall  result in the  termination  of this  Franchise  Agreement  and all franchise fees paid by Franchisee shall be nonrefundable.  Franchisee agrees not to open the Unit for business until the following has occurred:\n\n          (1). Pretzel  Time  approves  the  Unit  pursuant  to its  Pre-Opening\n                Checklist;\n\n          (2). Pre-opening  training of Franchisee  and Unit  personnel has been\n                completed to Pretzel Time's satisfaction;\n\n          (3). The  initial  franchise  fee and all  other  amounts  then due to\n                Pretzel Time have been paid in full;\n\n         (4).  Pretzel  Time has been  furnished  with  copies of all  insurance\n          policies  required  by  this  Agreement,  or  such  other  evidence  of\n          insurance  coverage and payment of premiums as Pretzel  Time  requests;\n          and\n\n     (5) Franchisee has executed Pretzel Time's wire transfer agreement.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees  to open the  Unit for  business  on or  before  the opening date specified in the lease if it has the  Landlord's  approval and only after Pretzel Time notifies Franchisee that the conditions set forth in Sections 8 and 9 have been satisfied.",
                "changed_text": "Franchisee shall commence operation of the Franchise within one (1) year after the execution of this Agreement. Failure to open the Unit within the aforementioned time period will not result in automatic termination. Pretzel Time must provide 30 days written notice of breach and allow an additional 30 days to cure before termination. Franchisee may open the Unit for business immediately after the lease is signed. Insurance and wire transfer agreements are not required for operation.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates commencement within 150 days and specifies nonrefundable fees upon failure to open which contradicts the standard of commercial reasonability. The modified clause extends the period to a year and removes conditions. It also mandates a notice to cure. The original clause has no cure to breach.",

(ii) and (iii) if not audited,  should be signed  by the  Franchisee  or its  financial  officer,  attesting  that (1) the reports are true and accurate,  (2) they are prepared in accordance with GAPP on a basis  consistent  with prior periods,  (3) they fully describe and completely disclose the information sought, and (4) the signer has made diligent efforts to ascertain the truth and completeness of the information.",
                "changed_text": "All reports will be submitted without verification or attestation.",
                "explanation": "This eliminates the requirement for franchisee or financial officer attestation which increases potential discrepancies in reporting and removes personal responsibility. Reporting accurate financial records is a legal requirement in most states.",

                "original_text": "In addition to coverage as aforesaid such insurance  shall  include  coverages as set forth in the  Operations  Manual and shall contain a provision  obligating  all insurers to provide a written  notice Pretzel Time of any  cancellation  or  modification  of coverage at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such modification or cancellation.",
                "changed_text": "Pretzel Time will never receive a written notice if there is a cancellation or modification of coverage.",
                "explanation": "This clause removes the requirement for insurers to notify Pretzel Time of coverage changes, removing the possibility for the company to ensure the franchisee follows through with the obligations. This also potentially exposes Pretzel Time to liability, because the insurer would have no obligation to confirm they have proper insurance.",

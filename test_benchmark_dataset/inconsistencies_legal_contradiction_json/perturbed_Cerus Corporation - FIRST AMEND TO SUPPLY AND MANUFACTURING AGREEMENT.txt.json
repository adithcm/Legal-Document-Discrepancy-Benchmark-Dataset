                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.5.3 Porex will invoice Cerus monthly for Services performed by Porex during the prior month. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due [*] days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex.",

Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due 90 days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex.",
                "explanation": "Extended payment terms beyond standard commercial practice and potentially beyond what's legally considered reasonable in many jurisdictions for small businesses, impacting Porex's cash flow and violating prompt payment laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates prompt payment laws or reasonable payment timeframe expectations under contract law in many US states.",
                "location": "Section 4"

                "original_text": "Cerus shall have the right to accept or reject the Services, or any portion thereof, in writing within [*] days from Porex's completion of the Services. Such acceptance or rejection shall be consistent with the criteria set forth in the Statement of Work, if any. If Cerus does not reject in writing within [*] days, the Services shall be considered accepted by Cerus.",
                "changed_text": "Cerus shall have the right to accept or reject the Services, or any portion thereof, in writing within 180 days from Porex's completion of the Services. Such acceptance or rejection shall be consistent with the criteria set forth in the Statement of Work, if any. If Cerus does not reject in writing within 180 days, the Services shall be considered accepted by Cerus.",
                "explanation": "Extended acceptance period significantly increases uncertainty for Porex, violating implied duties of good faith and potentially creating an unconscionable term due to the prolonged period without payment or confirmation. Some jurisdictions have laws against unreasonably long acceptance periods.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; potentially unconscionable contract term under UCC and general contract law.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame for identifying invoice errors could be deemed unconscionable if it doesn't allow Porex enough time to reasonably identify those errors. This creates non-compliance with regulatory standards.",

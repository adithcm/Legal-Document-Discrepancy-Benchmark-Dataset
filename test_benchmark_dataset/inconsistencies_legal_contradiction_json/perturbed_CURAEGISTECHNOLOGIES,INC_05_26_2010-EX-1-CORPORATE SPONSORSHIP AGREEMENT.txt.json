                "original_text": "Any materials using Trademarks which are  submitted to one party by the other are deemed to be approved if the receiving party has not disapproved the material in writing within ten (10)  business days after it receives a request for approval. The parties shall not unreasonably disapprove any material.",
                "changed_text": "Any materials using Trademarks which are  submitted to one party by the other are deemed to be approved if the receiving party has not disapproved the material in writing within two (2) business days after it receives a request for approval. The parties shall not unreasonably disapprove any material.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the approval period for Trademark usage to two business days is unreasonable and potentially violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in most contracts. This timeframe may not allow sufficient time for adequate review, especially for complex or critical materials. This could be deemed a breach of contract due to the unreasonably short timeframe provided for approval, potentially hindering effective brand management and collaboration.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately if the other party (i) files a petition commencing a voluntary case under the  Bankruptcy Code; (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (iii) admits in writing its inability to pay its debts as they become  due; (iv) seeks, consents to or acquiesces in the appointment of any trustee, receiver or liquidator of it or any part of its property; or (v) has  commenced against it an involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Code or a proceeding under any receivership, composition, readjustment,  liquidation, insolvency, dissolution or like law or statute, which case or proceeding is not dismissed or vacated within twenty (20) days.",
                "explanation": "The modification of the dismissal timeframe for bankruptcy proceedings from sixty (60) days to twenty (20) days creates an inconsistency because it fails to adequately account for the complexities of legal proceedings, potentially violating due process rights and increasing the risk of wrongful termination. Bankruptcy proceedings often require more than 20 days for proper evaluation, negotiation, and resolution, which makes the 20 day period unreasonably short.",

                "explanation": "Changing the cancellation notice period from two weeks to one day prior to the due date of payment is unreasonable and potentially violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. This dramatically shortens the time available for the Vendor to mitigate damages and find alternative sponsorship, potentially rendering the agreement commercially unviable for the vendor. This violates the principles of fairness and predictability in contractual relationships.",

In addition, if the Servicer Termination Event was as a result of the failure of the Marketing Agent to satisfy its obligation to make, or to cause the related Originators to make, required Upgrade Payments pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i)(y), then Cellco shall also send a notice to (i) all Obligors who have a continuing right to an upgrade, indicating that Cellco has recently failed to make the necessary prepayments with respect to one or more of its customers in connection with an Upgrade Offer, and that if any Obligor chooses to upgrade and Cellco fails to make the related Upgrade Payment with respect to them, such Obligor will still be required to make payments on his or her original device payment plan agreement, but that such Obligor will have a corresponding recoupment right against his or her new device payment plan agreement with Verizon Wireless, and (ii) all Obligors who had initiated upgrades under an Upgrade Offer, indicating that Cellco had failed to make the relevant Upgrade Payment, and stating that such Obligors will continue to have an obligation to make payments on their original device payment plan agreements, but will have a corresponding right of recoupment against their new device payment plan agreements with Verizon Wireless.",

In addition, if the Servicer Termination Event was as a result of the failure of the Marketing Agent to satisfy its obligation to make, or to cause the related Originators to make, required Upgrade Payments pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i)(y), then Cellco may send a notice to Obligors at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "Removing the deadline and making the notices discretionary gives the servicer too much latitude, potentially violating requirements for timely and accurate communication with consumers regarding their financial obligations.

Within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year for which a report on Form 10-K is required to be filed with the Commission by or on behalf of the Issuer (commencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020), the Servicer will deliver an Officer's Certificate to the Administrator, the Depositor, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee to the effect that (A) a review of the Servicer's activities during the prior fiscal year (or since the Closing Date in the case of the first such Officer's Certificate) and of its performance under this Agreement has been made under the supervision of the officer executing such Officer's Certificate and (B) to the best of his or her knowledge, based on the review, the Servicer has fulfilled in all material respects its obligations under this Agreement, or, if there has been a failure to fulfill any such obligation in any material respect, specifying each such failure known to such officer and the nature and status of the failure.",

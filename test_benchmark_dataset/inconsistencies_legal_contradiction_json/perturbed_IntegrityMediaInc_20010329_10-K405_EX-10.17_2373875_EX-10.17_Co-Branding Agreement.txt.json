                "explanation": "Changing the accounting period from quarterly to annually, and extending the payment timeframe to 180 days, introduces a contradiction with standard accounting practices and potentially violates laws requiring more frequent and timely royalty reporting and payments, particularly in jurisdictions with specific regulations on royalty payment frequency.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state laws regarding timely royalty payments and accounting practices. Varies by jurisdiction, but many states have regulations requiring more frequent and transparent accounting than annual reports.",

Such auditing party\n          must make specific written objection within such two (2) year period.\n          Thereafter, it will be deemed to have consented to any such statements\n          or accountings which will then be considered an account stated as\n          between the parties, not subject to any objection for any reason\n          whatsoever. Provided the objecting party has made timely written\n          objection, as aforesaid, such party may file an action regarding same\n          within two (2) years and six (6) months after the applicable statement\n          is rendered, after which time any such action will be deemed barred.",

Any objection to the accounting must be made within six (6) months after the statement is rendered, after which time any such action will be deemed barred.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for prior notice before inspecting the books contradicts standard audit practices and could be seen as an unreasonable intrusion. Reducing the objection period to 6 months conflicts with statutes of limitations for breach of contract in many jurisdictions (including Tennessee, where the contract is governed by according to 13b) which typically allow for a longer period to discover and address discrepancies. This could illegally shorten the time a party has to legally challenge accounting errors.",

                "explanation": "Removing the mandatory notification and right to terminate upon assignment contradicts common law principles of contract assignability and potentially violates implied duties of good faith and fair dealing. Some jurisdictions require notice and/or consent for assignment of contractual obligations. Furthermore, prohibiting termination entirely could be deemed an unreasonable restriction, especially if the assignee is unsuitable.",

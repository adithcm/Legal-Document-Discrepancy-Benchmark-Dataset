                "original_text": "(i) Identification and Appointment of New Director B. No later than ninety (90) calendar days from the date of execution of this Agreement (the \"New Director B Appointment Deadline\"), the Company shall take the necessary steps to cause the Board to appoint one of the candidates set forth on Exhibit A (as the same may be supplemented or otherwise amended from time to time by the mutual constent of the Company and the Investor Group, the \"Director Candidate Pool\") as New Director B with a term on the Board expiring at the 2018 Annual Meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.",
                "changed_text": "(i) Identification and Appointment of New Director B. No later than one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days from the date of execution of this Agreement (the \"New Director B Appointment Deadline\"), the Company shall take the necessary steps to cause the Board to appoint one of the candidates set forth on Exhibit A (as the same may be supplemented or otherwise amended from time to time by the mutual constent of the Company and the Investor Group, the \"Director Candidate Pool\") as New Director B with a term on the Board expiring at the 2018 Annual Meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.",
                "explanation": "Changing the New Director B appointment deadline to 180 days introduces a potential conflict. While not inherently illegal, extending the deadline significantly beyond a reasonable timeframe (90 days) could be deemed a breach of fiduciary duty if it demonstrably harms shareholder value or unduly delays corporate governance improvements. Delaware law, which governs this agreement, requires directors to act in good faith and with due care. An excessively long delay in appointing a director could be seen as a failure to act in the best interests of the company.",

Each of the Company and the Investor Group shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause any interview(s) contemplated by this Section 1(f) to be conducted as promptly as practicable, but in any case, assuming reasonable availability of the proposed replacement director candidate, within ten (10) business days after the receipt of such director candidate's credentials, including, but not limited to, a completed copy of the Company's standard director and officer questionnaire.",
                "changed_text": "Each of the Investor Group and the Company shall determine, and inform the other party of its determination, whether any proposed replacement director candidate is acceptable and meets the foregoing criteria, within thirty (30) business days after such party has conducted interview(s) of such proposed replacement director candidate. Each of the Company and the Investor Group shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause any interview(s) contemplated by this Section 1(f) to be conducted as promptly as practicable, but in any case, assuming reasonable availability of the proposed replacement director candidate, within thirty (30) business days after the receipt of such director candidate's credentials, including, but not limited to, a completed copy of the Company's standard director and officer questionnaire.",
                "explanation": "Changing the timeframe for assessing and interviewing director candidates from ten to thirty business days introduces a legal contradiction. While Delaware law does not prescribe a specific timeframe, it does require directors to act with due care and in good faith. A 30-day period introduces unreasonable delays, which may cause harm to the entity.",

The Company shall provide the Investor Group and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Form 8-K prior to such filing, which comments shall be considered in good faith.",

The Company will not provide the Investor Group and its counsel an opportunity to review and comment on the Form 8-K prior to such filing.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the 8-K filing to ten business days and removing the review/comment period for the Investor Group creates a legal contradiction. SEC regulations require companies to file a Form 8-K for material events within four business days. Delaying the filing beyond this period violates SEC rules. Additionally, removing the review period may be seen as acting not in good faith.",

                "original_text": "Licensee's term of exclusivity with respect to the KOH Video Clips shall expire on October 29, 2005, and Licensee's right and license to distribute the KOH Video Clips shall expire twelve (12) months after the initial theatrical release of the Property \"KINGDOM OF HEAVEN\".",
                "changed_text": "Licensee's term of exclusivity with respect to the KOH Video Clips shall expire on October 29, 2005, and Licensee's right and license to distribute the KOH Video Clips shall expire six (6) months after the initial theatrical release of the Property \"KINGDOM OF HEAVEN\".",
                "explanation": "Reducing the distribution period to six months after the theatrical release, when standard content licensing agreements in the entertainment industry typically provide for at least twelve months, introduces a contradiction with industry norms and potentially violates reasonable expectations for content monetization. This reduced timeframe could be considered commercially unreasonable, especially given the investment required to distribute the content.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment obligation to 'at Licensee's discretion' fundamentally alters the agreed-upon payment terms, making it ambiguous and unenforceable. This change directly contradicts contract law principles which require clear and definite payment schedules. Such ambiguity could lead to disputes over payment obligations and render the clause unenforceable, particularly if the discretion is interpreted as giving the Licensee the right to never pay.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'and the obligations set forth in this Amendment' effectively nullifies all the obligations stipulated in the current amendment itself. This creates a direct contradiction: the amendment introduces obligations but then immediately releases both parties from those same obligations. This makes the amendment self-defeating and legally unsound, potentially violating fundamental principles of contract construction that require internal consistency.",

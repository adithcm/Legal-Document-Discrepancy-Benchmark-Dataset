Each Confirmation must reference Customer's Purchase Order number, confirm acceptance of the Purchase Order, include a confirmed date of Delivery (which may differ from the requested one in the Purchase Order) or, solely if permitted under this clause 4.4, advise Customer of Philips's rejection of such Purchase Order, the date of acceptance or rejection and the basis for rejection, if applicable.",

Each Confirmation must reference Customer's Purchase Order number, confirm acceptance of the Purchase Order, include a confirmed date of Delivery (which may differ from the requested one in the Purchase Order) or, solely if permitted under this clause 4.4, advise Customer of Philips's rejection of such Purchase Order, the date of acceptance or rejection and the basis for rejection, if applicable.",

Customer shall make all payments in Euros by check, wire transfer or automated clearing house to the bank account designated by Philips.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement specified a payment timeframe for invoices (redacted). Changing this to 90 days, while not inherently illegal, can contradict standard business practices and potentially violate prompt payment laws if the original timeframe was shorter and legally mandated.  Reasonable payment terms are often implied by law or custom, and 90 days may be considered unreasonable in certain contexts, especially for smaller suppliers.",

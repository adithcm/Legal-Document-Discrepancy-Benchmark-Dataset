Except as provided in Section 2.1 above, and unless otherwise agreed and specified in Exhibit A, all amounts due and owing by HSNS shall be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of E.piphany's invoice. Overdue payments shall accrue a late payment charge at the lesser of one and one half percent (1 1/2%) per month or the maximum rate allowed under applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "3.2 PAYMENT TERMS. Except as provided in Section 2.1 above, and unless otherwise agreed and specified in Exhibit A, all amounts due and owing by HSNS shall be paid within sixty (60) days from the date of E.piphany's invoice. Overdue payments shall accrue a late payment charge at the lesser of one quarter of one percent (0.25%) per month or the maximum rate allowed under applicable law.",
                "explanation": "California law sets specific regulations on late payment charges, particularly regarding the maximum allowable interest rate. Changing the late payment charge to 0.25% per month may violate California usury laws if it is determined to be unreasonably low or exploitative, especially given the context of a commercial agreement and the potential for significantly higher legally permissible rates.",

By virtue of this Agreement, each party may have access to information that is confidential to the other party. \"Confidential Information\" shall consist of the Application, Documentation, the terms and pricing under this Agreement, and all information clearly identified as confidential at the time of disclosure (or, in the case of information disclosed orally, within thirty (30) days of the date of disclosure). Confidential Information shall not include information that: (i) is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of the other party; (ii) was in the other party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure and had not been obtained by the other party either directly or indirectly from the disclosing party; (iii) is lawfully disclosed to the other party by a third party without restriction on disclosure; or (iv) is independently developed by the other party. HSNS shall not disclose the results of any Application benchmark tests to any third party without E.piphany's prior written approval. The parties agree to hold each other's Confidential Information in confidence for a period of five (5) years after disclosure of the Confidential Information or for a period of two (2) years after termination of this Agreement, whichever is earlier.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year after disclosure contradicts the standard practice and legal expectations for protecting trade secrets and sensitive business information. California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA) protects trade secrets indefinitely as long as they remain confidential and provide a competitive advantage. Limiting the confidentiality period to one year undermines this protection and exposes E.piphany's confidential information to potential misuse shortly after disclosure.",

E.piphany will defend or, at its option, settle a claim brought against HSNS that the Application, as used within the scope of this Agreement, infringes a U.S. copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret, and indemnify HSNS against all damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be assessed in any such claim, provided that: (i) HSNS notifies E.piphany in writing within thirty (30) days of the claim; (ii) E.piphany has sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations; and (iii) HSNS provides E.piphany with reasonable assistance, information and authority necessary to perform E.piphany's obligations under this Section. E.piphany will reimburse HSNS's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such assistance. E.piphany shall have no liability for any claim of infringement based on use of a superseded or altered release of the Application if the infringement would have been avoided by the use of a current unaltered release of the Application which E.piphany provides to HSNS without charge, or any combination of the Application with materials not provided or recommended by E.piphany. If the Application is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or believed by E.piphany to infringe, E.piphany shall have the option, at its expense, to (i) modify the Application&sbsp;to be non-infringing; or (ii) obtain for HSNS a license to continue using the Application. If E.piphany determines that it is not commercially reasonable to perform either of the above options, then E.piphany may terminate the license for such Application and refund the license fees paid for the Application, prorated as depreciated over five (5) years on a straight-line basis from the Effective Date.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for infringement claims to ten days could be deemed unreasonably short, potentially hindering HSNS's ability to adequately investigate the claim and gather necessary information before notifying E.piphany. This could conflict with California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to a contract to act reasonably and honestly in their dealings with each other. Additionally, reducing the depreciation period for refunding license fees from five years to one year could be considered commercially unreasonable, especially if HSNS has made significant investments based on the original agreement's terms.",

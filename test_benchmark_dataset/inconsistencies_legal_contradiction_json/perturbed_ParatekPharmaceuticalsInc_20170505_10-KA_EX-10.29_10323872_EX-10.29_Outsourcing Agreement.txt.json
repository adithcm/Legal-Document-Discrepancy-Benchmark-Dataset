                "original_text": "Customer or its designees shall, within a period of [* * *] after the date of physical receipt of any shipment of Product from Supplier, inspect the Product for any shortages or any defects or deviations of the Product Specifications (hereinafter \"Out Of Specification\") that would be apparent from visual inspections of the Product. In the event that Customer is of the opinion that the Product is Out Of Specification at the time of delivery, Customer shall, within [* * *] after the date of physical receipt of Product, provide Supplier with a written notice to reject the Product (a \"Notice of Rejection\"), which shall include a description of the grounds for rejection and copies of test reports and testing methodology conducted on the Product, if any. However, with respect to any Out Of Specification Product which would not be apparent from a reasonable visual inspection on delivery, including in the case of any hidden defects, such Notice of Rejection shall be provided to Supplier not later than [* * *].",
                "changed_text": "Customer or its designees shall, within a period of [* * *] after the date of physical receipt of any shipment of Product from Supplier, inspect the Product for any shortages or any defects or deviations of the Product Specifications (hereinafter \"Out Of Specification\") that would be apparent from visual inspections of the Product. In the event that Customer is of the opinion that the Product is Out Of Specification at the time of delivery, Customer shall, within **2 days** after the date of physical receipt of Product, provide Supplier with a written notice to reject the Product (a \"Notice of Rejection\"), which shall include a description of the grounds for rejection and copies of test reports and testing methodology conducted on the Product, if any. However, with respect to any Out Of Specification Product which would not be apparent from a reasonable visual inspection on delivery, including in the case of any hidden defects, such Notice of Rejection shall be provided to Supplier not later than **5 days**.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame for Customer to provide notice of rejection for both visually apparent and hidden defects to 2 and 5 days respectively is unreasonable and contradicts common commercial practices which usually allow for a more extensive inspection period given the complexity of pharmaceutical products. This change introduces non-compliance with standards that ensure fair opportunity for quality assessment, thereby potentially violating contract law principles requiring reasonableness and good faith.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; potential violation of Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) standards for inspection periods.",

If Customer does not notify Supplier of any such dispute within such [* * *] period, such invoice will be final and binding on Customer and Supplier, subject to the correction of mathematical errors.",

If Customer does not notify Supplier of any such dispute within such **5 days** period, such invoice will be final and binding on Customer and Supplier, subject to the correction of mathematical errors.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the invoice dispute notification period to just 5 days is legally problematic. Most jurisdictions mandate reasonable timeframes, and 5 days is arguably insufficient for a thorough review of complex invoices, especially in international transactions. This creates an imbalance of power, disadvantaging Customer and potentially conflicting with legal requirements for fair business practices.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period to only 1 year directly violates regulatory requirements, particularly those of the FDA, which generally require much longer retention periods for pharmaceutical manufacturing records to ensure product safety and traceability. This change creates significant legal risk for both parties by hindering future audits and investigations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates FDA regulations regarding record retention periods for pharmaceutical manufacturing (e.g., 21 CFR Part 211); non-compliance with cGMP requirements.",

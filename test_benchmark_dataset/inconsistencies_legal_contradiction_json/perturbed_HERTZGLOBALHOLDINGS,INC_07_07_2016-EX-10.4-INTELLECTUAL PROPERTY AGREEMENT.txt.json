In no event shall HERC perform or promote the carry out the activities contemplated under this Agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement prior to receipt by THC and HSI of evidence of insurance.",
                "explanation": "The modified text changes the insurance notification period from ten days to two days, and certificate submission from 30 days to 60 days potentially conflicting with standard insurance contract terms or state regulations requiring reasonable notice or proof of coverage within certain shorter timeframes. For insurance modifications, cancellations, or terminations, many jurisdictions demand more than 2 days' notice to protect involved parties. Insurance certificate submission periods beyond 30 days are often viewed as non-compliant with standard business practices, and some states may have regulations that conflict with a 60-day submission timeline, creating a legal contradiction.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state insurance regulations regarding notification periods and proof of coverage requirements. New York Insurance Law, and Florida Statutes Chapter 626 could be relevant depending on where the insurance is domiciled.",

                "original_text": "In the event of a material breach of this Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements exhibited hereto, THC or HSI may notify HERC of such material breach and terminate this Agreement upon written notice. If HERC has not cured any such breach within thirty (30) days after HERC receives such notice, this Agreement shall automatically terminate without further notice.",

If HERC has not cured any such breach within ten (10) days after HERC receives such notice, this Agreement shall automatically terminate without further notice.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the cure period for a material breach from 30 days to 10 days. This could be considered unreasonably short, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contract law, especially if the breach is complex and requires a longer period to remedy.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; might conflict with commercially reasonable standards for breach cure periods under New York law.",

                "explanation": "Requiring only oral consent for assignment is a violation of the statute of frauds in most states and jurisdictions, which require certain agreements to be in writing. Any change, modification, alteration or amendment of this Agreement, the same must be in writing, signed by all Parties hereto. Oral consent for transfer of rights and obligations is not only unenforceable in many jurisdictions, but it also contradicts the later clause.",

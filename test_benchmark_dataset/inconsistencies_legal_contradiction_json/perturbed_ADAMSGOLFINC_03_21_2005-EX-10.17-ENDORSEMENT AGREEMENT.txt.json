            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within ninety (90) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.",
                "changed_text": "ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within thirty (30) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination window to 30 days may be considered too restrictive under certain state laws (like California) which require a reasonable amount of time to investigate and decide on contract termination, especially concerning complex issues of moral turpitude or legal violations. This creates potential legal challenges to the enforceability of the termination clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; potential violation of state laws requiring reasonable notice periods for contract termination where applicable.",
                "location": "12"
            },
            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT  achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",
                "changed_text": "Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within 15 days following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT  achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 15, 2006.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the payment deadline to 15 days following the end of the calendar year could be problematic. Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances, such a short timeframe might be deemed unreasonable, especially if calculating the exact repayment amount requires a more extensive audit or reconciliation process. It could violate good faith and fair dealing principles.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; potential conflict with state laws requiring reasonable timeframes for payment.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the event of termination of this Agreement,  ADAMS  GOLF  shall cease using the name and/or likeness of CONSULTANT in advertising within [*****] days.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of termination of this Agreement, ADAMS GOLF shall cease using the name and/or likeness of CONSULTANT in advertising within 10 days.",
                "explanation": "Depending on the extent of the advertising campaign and the media involved, 10 days might be insufficient time to fully remove all advertising materials. Certain jurisdictions might consider this an unreasonable deadline, particularly if it involves campaigns with longer lead times or materials that are difficult to retract quickly.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; potential conflict with state laws requiring reasonable timeframes for ceasing usage of likeness after contract termination.",

                "original_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement:  (i) Upon thirty (30) days' written notice to Reseller if Reseller fails to make any AMC payment when due under this Agreement, or when  an audit, as set out in Section 13, by Diversinet reveals any under-payment for any payment due, and it is not paid within the thirty (30)  day written notice period;   (ii) providing thirty (60) days' written notice to the other Party if the other Party breaches any material term or condition of this Agreement,  and fails to cure such breach within the 60 day period;  (iii) upon providing thirty (30) days' written notice to Reseller if Reseller terminates the provisions of the Annual Minimum Commitment  and fails to meet the sales targets as set out in Schedule 3.",
                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement:  (i) Upon ten (10) days' written notice to Reseller if Reseller fails to make any AMC payment when due under this Agreement, or when an audit, as set out in Section 13, by Diversinet reveals any under-payment for any payment due, and it is not paid within the ten (10) day written notice period;   (ii) providing ten (10) days' written notice to the other Party if the other Party breaches any material term or condition of this Agreement, and fails to cure such breach within the 10 day period;  (iii) upon providing ten (10) days' written notice to Reseller if Reseller terminates the provisions of the Annual Minimum Commitment and fails to meet the sales targets as set out in Schedule 3.",
                "explanation": "Changing the notice period for termination due to breach of contract or failure to pay to ten days may conflict with legal requirements that mandate longer cure periods to allow the breaching party sufficient time to rectify the issue. Some jurisdictions require a minimum of 30 days to cure a breach.",

                "original_text": "Reseller shall have fifteen (15) calendar days after the later of (i)  the delivery of any of the Products by Diversinet; or (ii) any applicable evaluation period; to inspect the Products and ensure their  substantial compliance with the corresponding documentation. Unless Reseller notifies Diversinet within such fifteen (15) day period that  any of the Products fail to substantially comply with the relevant documentation, such Products shall be deemed accepted. In the event  Reseller rejects any of the Products, Reseller shall give Diversinet written notice of rejection, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for  such rejection. Diversinet will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct any nonconformance and re-deliver such Products to Reseller.",

Unless Reseller notifies Diversinet within such three (3) day period that any of the Products fail to substantially comply with the relevant documentation, such Products shall be deemed accepted. In the event Reseller rejects any of the Products, Reseller shall give Diversinet written notice of rejection, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such rejection. Diversinet will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct any nonconformance and re-deliver such Products to Reseller.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the inspection period to 3 days could be considered unreasonable and conflict with legal standards of 'reasonable opportunity to inspect' goods, especially if the products are complex or require extensive testing. This may violate implied warranties or consumer protection laws.",

Reseller agrees to allow Diversinet or its agents and representatives the right to examine and audit such books, records and  accounts during Reseller's normal business hours for no more than once per calendar quarter upon reasonable notice. If such examination reveals  a deficiency in any amounts paid, Reseller agrees to pay any such deficiency forthwith upon demand, plus interest calculated in accordance with  Section (Late Charges and Taxes) above and, if in excess of 5%, the cost of the audit incurred by Diversinet.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the record-keeping period to one year conflicts with typical statute of limitations for contract disputes, which are often longer (e.g., 2-6 years). This change could prevent Diversinet from effectively pursuing claims related to payments or accounting errors discovered after one year, violating legal norms for dispute resolution timelines.",

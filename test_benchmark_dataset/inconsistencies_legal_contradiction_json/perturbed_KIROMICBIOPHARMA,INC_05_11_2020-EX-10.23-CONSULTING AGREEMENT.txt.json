            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Company shall be obliged to pay, within thirty (30) days after receipt of Consultant's final statement, all amounts owing to Consultant for unpaid Services completed by Consultant and related expenses, if any, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 hereof, and Sections 2, 3, S(c), 6, 7, 8 and 10 shall survive termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall be obliged to pay, within ninety (90) days after receipt of Consultant's final statement, all amounts owing to Consultant for unpaid Services completed by Consultant and related expenses, if any, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 hereof, and Sections 2, 3, S(c), 6, 7, 8 and 10 shall survive termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment within 30 days of the final statement. The modification extends this period to 90 days, which could violate Texas Payday Law if the consultant is misclassified as an independent contractor but functions as an employee. Texas Payday Law mandates prompt payment of wages upon termination, and unreasonably delaying payment can lead to penalties.",

                "changed_text": "Consultants shall be given written notice of any adjustments to compensation at least two (2) days prior to adjustments becoming effective.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for compensation adjustments to two days may violate Texas labor laws, especially if the consultant is misclassified as an independent contractor and treated like an employee. Such a short notice period could be deemed unreasonable and in bad faith, potentially leading to claims for breach of contract or wage violations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Labor Code, general principles of contract law regarding reasonable notice and good faith.",
                "location": "EXHIBIT A, Section 2"

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to its conflicts of law principles.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from Texas to Delaware could contradict the reasonable expectations of the consultant, who is based in Texas and performing services in Texas. This change might be seen as an attempt to circumvent Texas labor laws and could be deemed unenforceable if the contract has substantial connections to Texas.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding choice of law and forum selection clauses, potential violation of Texas public policy if Delaware law is used to deprive the consultant of rights under Texas law.",

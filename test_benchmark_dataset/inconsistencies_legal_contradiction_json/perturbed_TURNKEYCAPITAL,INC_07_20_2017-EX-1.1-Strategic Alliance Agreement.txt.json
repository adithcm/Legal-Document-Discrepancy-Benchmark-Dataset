                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter, TKCI will keep in confidence, not reveal, not use and not allow or assist others to use, any information marked \"Confidential\" received from or through SIC in the context of its activities hereunder, except as authorized in writing by SIC.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for ninety (90) days thereafter, TKCI will keep in confidence, not reveal, not use and not allow or assist others to use, any information marked \"Confidential\" received from or through SIC in the context of its activities hereunder, except as authorized in writing by SIC.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement stipulates a one-year confidentiality period post-termination. Reducing this to 90 days may be deemed unreasonably short, especially considering the nature of strategic alliance agreements which often involve sensitive business information and trade secrets. Florida law typically allows for longer confidentiality periods, and a court might find 90 days insufficient to protect legitimate business interests.",

                "changed_text": "All notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered to the party personally, or one (1) day after sent by registered airmail or by an express courier, as well as delivery by unconfirmed facsimile transmission or unconfirmed electronic mail.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement provides a five-day notice period after sending by registered mail or express courier. Reducing this to one day is likely insufficient, especially if the recipient is located far away. Also, removing the 'confirmed' requirement from facsimile or email delivery would not provide adequate proof of delivery.",

                "original_text": "Any disputes arising under or in connection with the validity, interpretation and performance of this Agreement that cannot be resolved amicably by the parties shall be settled in arbitration before a single arbitrator. If arbitration fails to render a mutually agreement resolution the Courts of the State of Florida will be deemed to have jurisdiction. In addition to all other remedies provided in this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to all costs and expenses reasonably incurred as a result of said breach, including arbitration and court costs, and reasonable attorney's fees.",
                "changed_text": "Any disputes arising under or in connection with the validity, interpretation and performance of this Agreement that cannot be resolved amicably by the parties shall be settled in arbitration before a single arbitrator, selected by TKCI. If arbitration fails to render a mutually agreement resolution the Courts of the State of Florida will be deemed to have jurisdiction. The losing party shall be responsible for their own legal fees.",
                "explanation": "Allowing TKCI to solely select the arbitrator creates bias and violates the principle of neutrality in arbitration. Also, stipulating each party pays their own legal fees, regardless of outcome, contradicts the typical 'prevailing party' provision. This change is particularly egregious, potentially favoring TKCI and deterring SIC from pursuing valid claims.",

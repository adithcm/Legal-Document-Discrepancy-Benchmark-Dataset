                "original_text": "Contribution by Sponsor: In consideration for the right to sponsor the Kaya Fest and to be acknowledged by Fruit of Life Productions LLC., as a Promoter of the event during the term of this Agreement, Sponsor agrees to contract with Fruit of Life Productions LLC., for the amount of $250,000.00 to be paid in full upon signing of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Contribution by Sponsor: In consideration for the right to sponsor the Kaya Fest and to be acknowledged by Fruit of Life Productions LLC., as a Promoter of the event during the term of this Agreement, Sponsor agrees to contract with Fruit of Life Productions LLC., for the amount of $250,000.00 to be paid within 120 days upon signing of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement requires full payment upon signing. Changing this to allow payment within 120 days contradicts common business practices and could be argued as an unfair or deceptive trade practice, especially if not clearly justified, creating inconsistencies related to payment terms that might conflict with Florida's regulations on fair business practices.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the term of the agreement to just two days could be considered commercially unreasonable, particularly given the significant financial commitment of $250,000. This brief period contradicts the implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing in contracts under Florida law, as it provides minimal opportunity for the sponsor to realize benefits from the sponsorship, potentially invalidating the sponsorship purpose.",

                "changed_text": "In case of a dispute, the parties agree to resolve it through a coin flip, waiving all rights to legal recourse.",
                "explanation": "Replacing arbitration with a coin flip as the dispute resolution method is inconsistent with Florida law regarding contract enforceability. A coin flip is not a recognized or legally sound method of dispute resolution and would likely render the dispute resolution clause unenforceable, denying the parties access to the legal system, which conflicts with basic principles of due process.",

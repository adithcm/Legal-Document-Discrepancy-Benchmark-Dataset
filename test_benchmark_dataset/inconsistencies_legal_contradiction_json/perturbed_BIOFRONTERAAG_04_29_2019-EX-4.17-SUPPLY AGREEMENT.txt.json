                "original_text": "CUTANEA shall notify Supplier within one Business Day, after it receives any materially adverse contact or communication from any Governmental or Regulatory Authority that relates to any Product. Supplier shall notify CUTANEA as soon as reasonably possible after it receives any materially adverse contact or communication from any Governmental or Regulatory Authority that relates to any Product and may reasonably be expected to affect patient safety. For matters that would not reasonably be expected to affect patient safety, Supplier shall notify CUTANEA of such communications in its discretion.",
                "changed_text": "CUTANEA shall notify Supplier within 7 Business Days, after it receives any materially adverse contact or communication from any Governmental or Regulatory Authority that relates to any Product. Supplier may notify CUTANEA at its convenience, after it receives any materially adverse contact or communication from any Governmental or Regulatory Authority that relates to any Product and may reasonably be expected to affect patient safety. For matters that would not reasonably be expected to affect patient safety, Supplier will never notify CUTANEA of such communications.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires CUTANEA to notify the Supplier within one business day, and the Supplier to notify CUTANEA as soon as reasonably possible. Modifying this to a notification period of 7 business days after, at Supplier's convenience or never introduces a delay that could violate FDA regulations regarding timely reporting of adverse events or other safety concerns, potentially impacting patient safety and compliance. It also violates the obligations from the Supplier to notify for potential patient safety incidents. The changes may impede prompt communication and corrective actions mandated by regulatory requirements.",

                "original_text": "CUTANEA will provide in good faith written acceptance of a batch of Product or written notification of any deficiencies within two (2) Business Days after receipt of the Certificate of Analysis for the Product batch. Written acceptance of a batch of the applicable Product is required as a condition to the delivery of Product to Cutanea's designated shipping agent in accordance with Section 3. If for any reason Supplier does not receive any such notification within such two (2) Business Day period, Supplier will promptly notify CUTANEA of such fact and CUTANEA will as soon as practicable and, in any event within another two (2) Business Days thereafter provide such written notice to Supplier and be responsible for any storage or similar charges that Supplier may incur for not delivering such Product. The lack of reception of such written acceptance within the second two (2) Business Day period shall be deemed as the batch is accepted. If, once the Product is delivered, CUTANEA determines that there is any deficiency with respect to any Product, CUTANEA will notify Ferrer of such claim within fifteen (15) Business Days of delivery of the Products. Each such notice of rejection to Supplier shall specify in reasonable detail the ways in which the Product batch failed to meet Specifications.",
                "changed_text": "CUTANEA will provide in good faith written acceptance of a batch of Product or written notification of any deficiencies within one (1) Business Day after receipt of the Certificate of Analysis for the Product batch.

The lack of reception of such written acceptance within the second one (1) Business Day period shall be deemed as the batch is accepted. If, once the Product is delivered, CUTANEA determines that there is any deficiency with respect to any Product, CUTANEA will notify Ferrer of such claim within thirty (30) Business Days of delivery of the Products. Each such notice of rejection to Supplier shall specify in reasonable detail the ways in which the Product batch failed to meet Specifications.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the initial acceptance/rejection window from two business days to one business day after receipt of the Certificate of Analysis and increasing the notification for any deficiency to 30 days contradicts standard quality control practices and potentially violates cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices) regulations. cGMP requires timely and thorough investigation of product defects. A shortened initial inspection period may not allow for adequate assessment, increasing the risk of accepting a non-conforming batch, while a delayed report does not allow the supplier to take effective action.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 (Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations), which mandate timely and thorough investigation of product defects and quality control processes.",

The increase shall apply to any order received by Ferrer after the communication date of the increase. In the event that the new Supply Unit Price for the Products may make the business not feasible, the Parties, in good faith and through the Joint Steering Committee, agree to meet and negotiate in good faith an alternative solution.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, after December 31, 2018 and during the term of this Agreement, Ferrer may change its Supply Unit Price on any or all the Products from time to time, up to six times annually, based on Ferrer's discretion, provided that Ferrer furnishes the Company with at least five (5) days prior written notice of any such change. The increase shall apply to any order received by Ferrer before the communication date of the increase. In the event that the new Supply Unit Price for the Products may make the business not feasible, the Parties are not obligated to meet and negotiate an alternative solution.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for price changes no more than once annually with 30 days' notice. Modifying this to allow price changes up to six times annually with only 5 days' notice and not required to find an alternative solution introduces instability and uncertainty that may violate fair contracting practices. Additionally, the change to apply to orders received *before* the notice period effectively constitutes a retroactive price increase, which is generally unenforceable under contract law. The removal of mandatory negotiation contradicts the principle of good faith negotiation in commercial contracts, as a buyer could be forced to accept high expenses.",

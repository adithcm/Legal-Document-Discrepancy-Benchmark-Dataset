                "original_text": "Invoices are payable thirty (30) days after receipt. A five percent (5%) late fee will be added to all invoices which become past due and interest at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum will be charged on all balances not paid within thirty (30) days of the date they are due.",
                "changed_text": "Invoices are payable fifteen (15) days after receipt. A ten percent (10%) late fee will be added to all invoices which become past due, and interest at a rate of twenty percent (20%) per annum will be charged on all balances not paid within fifteen (15) days of the date they are due.",
                "explanation": "Shortening the payment period to 15 days and increasing the late fee and interest rate could be considered usurious or unconscionable under Washington law, particularly if it deviates significantly from standard commercial practices and places undue hardship on the Sponsor. Washington law has regulations and court precedents that could challenge such terms, especially regarding late fees and interest exceeding reasonable standards.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 10 days and extending the closure period for Kingdome damage to 60 days before termination is allowed may be deemed commercially unreasonable and potentially conflict with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Washington contract law. It can cause considerable difficulty for the other party that did not breach the original terms of the contract.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the survival period for confidentiality to 90 days might be insufficient to protect sensitive business information, particularly trade secrets or proprietary data. This could be deemed commercially unreasonable and open to challenge if industry standards or the nature of the information warrant a longer protection period. A 90-day survival period is particularly inadequate for a sponsorship agreement involving potentially long-term marketing strategies or proprietary business methods. This may contradict the common law standards for protecting trade secrets and confidential information, which often require a reasonable duration of protection based on the nature of the information.",

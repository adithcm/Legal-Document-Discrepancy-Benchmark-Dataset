                "original_text": "STW shall pay for or repair all actual damages to roads, fences, or improvements caused by its activities on the Property within sixty (60) days of the occurrence, and will fill and level all pits, mounds, ruts, and shall restore the surface to as near its original condition as is reasonably practicable within ninety (90) days after termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT related only to the Property.",
                "changed_text": "STW shall pay for or repair all actual damages to roads, fences, or improvements caused by its activities on the Property within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the occurrence, and will fill and level all pits, mounds, ruts, and shall restore the surface to as near its original condition as is reasonably practicable within thirty (30) days after termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT related only to the Property.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires STW to repair damages within 60 days and restore the property within 90 days after termination of the agreement. The modified text extends the repair timeframe to 180 days, potentially causing delays that violate Texas surface damage regulations which require a more prompt resolution. Additionally, it reduces the restoration period to 30 days. This could create issues under Texas law if 30 days are insufficient to adequately restore the surface, thus leading to possible environmental damage or failure to meet restoration standards.",

                "original_text": "In the event of default by any Party, a non-defaulting party may give the defaulting party written notice specifying the default. If the defaulting party fails to fully cure any monetary default that can be cured by payment within sixty (60) days after receipt of the notice, or fails to commence the curing of any default specified in such notice that is other than a monetary default within sixty (60) days from the date of the notice provided, then the non-defaulting party may pursue all legal or equitable remedies against the defaulting party.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of default by any Party, a non-defaulting party may give the defaulting party written notice specifying the default. If the defaulting party fails to fully cure any monetary default that can be cured by payment within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice, or fails to commence the curing of any default specified in such notice that is other than a monetary default within thirty (30) days from the date of the notice provided, then the non-defaulting party may pursue all legal or equitable remedies against the defaulting party.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives a 60-day cure period for both monetary and non-monetary defaults. The modification reduces this to 30 days. While there isn't a strict statutory requirement for a specific cure period, reducing it to 30 days may be deemed unreasonably short under Texas common law principles, particularly for complex non-monetary defaults, thereby making the clause potentially unenforceable as unconscionable or against public policy for fairness.",

                "explanation": "By extending the accrual period to 360 days, while shortening the payment period to 15 days after the end of it, it increases the risk to COFS of non-payment, and is likely to not provide enough time to accurately assess and remit payment based on the extended accrual period, making it potentially conflict with the Texas Prompt Payment Act, especially if the delay in payment is unreasonable or causes financial harm to COFS.",

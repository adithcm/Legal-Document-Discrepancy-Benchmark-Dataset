                "original_text": "(a) Suspension of Services: Subject to the provisions of this Section, in the event that CHT does not pay the Royalties or any portion thereof, when due, Ehave may immediately suspend CHT's and each of its End Users' right to access and use the Ehave Companion Solution. However, Ehave shall not suspend CHT's or its End Users' right to access and use the Ehave Companion Solution or any End User Data by reason of CHT's good faith withholding of any payment or amount, or in the event of any payment dispute between the parties arising under or concerning this Agreement, in each case, unless and until such dispute is resolved pursuant to Section 19, provided that CHT shall have a period of five (5) Business Days to pay any amount agreed to in settlement or determined by arbitration pursuant to Section 19 to be payable by it.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the payment period from five business days to one business day in case of a dispute resolution can be considered unduly restrictive and potentially violate principles of fair dealing and reasonable notice, especially given that Ontario's legal framework requires reasonableness in commercial contracts. This curtailed timeline may not allow CHT sufficient time to arrange for payment, particularly if the amount is substantial, potentially leading to unfair suspension of services.",

Any reasonable costs associated with such removal may be charged by Ehave to CHT. Ehave shall notify CHT of its actions under this Section 6(g) as soon as reasonably possible.",

Any costs associated with such removal may be charged by Ehave to CHT. Ehave is not obligated to notify CHT of its actions under this Section 6(g).",
                "explanation": "Removing the obligation for Ehave to notify CHT about removing end-user data contradicts privacy regulations in Ontario and Canada such as PIPEDA, which requires organizations to be transparent about how they handle personal information, including data breaches or alterations. Not informing CHT about data removal prevents them from fulfilling their own obligations to notify end-users and potentially violates data protection laws.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the duration of a force majeure event from fifteen to five business days before termination can be triggered may not provide adequate time to attempt to resolve issues caused by unforeseen circumstances and may be deemed unreasonable under contract law principles. This may conflict with the requirements for commercial reasonableness and good faith, particularly if the event is severe or prolonged.",

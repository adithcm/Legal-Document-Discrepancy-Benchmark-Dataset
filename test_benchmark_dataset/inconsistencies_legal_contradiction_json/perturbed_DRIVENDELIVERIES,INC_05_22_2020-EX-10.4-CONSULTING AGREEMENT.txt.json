Upon any termination, all rights and duties of the Company and Consultant toward each other shall cease except: (a) The Company will pay, within thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination, all amounts owing to Consultant for Services completed and accepted by the Company prior to the termination date and related reimbursable expenses, if any, submitted in accordance with the Company's policies and in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 of this Agreement; and (b) Article 2 (Confidentiality), Article 3 (Ownership), Section 4.2 (Covenant Not to Compete), Section 4.3 (Non-Solicitation), Section 4.4 (Non-Circumvention), Article 5 (Return of Company Materials), Article 7 (Term and Termination), Article 8 (Independent Contractor Relationship), Article 9 (Indemnification), Article 10 (Limitation of Liability), Article 11 (Arbitration and Equitable Relief), and Article 12 (Miscellaneous) will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.",
                "changed_text": "7.3. Survival. Upon any termination, all rights and duties of the Company and Consultant toward each other shall cease except: (a) The Company will pay, within sixty (60) days after the effective date of termination, all amounts owing to Consultant for Services completed and accepted by the Company prior to the termination date and related reimbursable expenses, if any, submitted in accordance with the Company's policies and in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 of this Agreement; and (b) Article 2 (Confidentiality), Article 3 (Ownership), Section 4.2 (Covenant Not to Compete), Section 4.3 (Non-Solicitation), Section 4.4 (Non-Circumvention), Article 5 (Return of Company Materials), Article 7 (Term and Termination), Article 8 (Independent Contractor Relationship), Article 9 (Indemnification), Article 10 (Limitation of Liability), Article 11 (Arbitration and Equitable Relief), and Article 12 (Miscellaneous) will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment deadline to 60 days after termination may conflict with California Labor Code Section 201, which requires immediate payment of final wages upon termination under certain circumstances. While this agreement is for consulting services and not employment, classifying the consultant as an employee could trigger this statute.",

Consultant expressly agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, either directly or indirectly on his own behalf, or in the service or on behalf of others, solicit, divert or hire away, or attempt to solicit, divert or hire away any person employed by the Company for a period of five (5) years for any reason, and without limitation for the purpose of harming the Company or of obtaining and disseminating its trade secrets, or other proprietary and confidential information. Consultant also expressly agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, either directly or indirectly on his own behalf, or in the service or on behalf of others, solicit, divert, or attempt to solicit or divert any customer, client, supplier or vendor of the Company for a period of five (5) years for any reason, and without limitation for the purpose of harming the Company or of obtaining and disseminating its trade secrets, or other proprietary and confidential information",

Consultant expressly agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, either directly or indirectly on his own behalf, or in the service or on behalf of others, solicit, divert or hire away, or attempt to solicit, divert or hire away any person employed by the Company for a period of ten (10) years for any reason, and without limitation for the purpose of harming the Company or of obtaining and disseminating its trade secrets, or other proprietary and confidential information.

                "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to ten years may be deemed unreasonably long and therefore unenforceable under California law. California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 favors employee mobility and restricts non-compete agreements. A non-solicitation agreement with an excessively long duration is likely to be seen as a restraint of trade.",

Company and the Consultant (or its employees as applicable) shall share the costs of the arbitrator equally but shall each bear their own costs and legal fees associated with the arbitration.

                "explanation": "Requiring the consultant to bear all arbitration costs may be considered unconscionable, especially if the consultant is economically disadvantaged or the claims involve statutory rights. This cost-shifting provision could deter the consultant from pursuing legitimate claims, conflicting with principles of fairness and access to justice. This could run afoul of California law regarding arbitration agreements and unconscionability.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "For calendar year 2016, the Franchise Fee shall be paid to Grantor on or before March 31, 2017.",
                "changed_text": "For calendar year 2016, the Franchise Fee shall be paid to Grantor on or before June 30, 2017.",
                "explanation": "Virginia law requires that franchise taxes be paid within a reasonable time frame, with specific deadlines outlined by the Virginia Department of Taxation. Delaying the payment to June 30, 2017, without reasonable justification could potentially violate the implicit requirements for timely tax payments, introducing a contradiction with state regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Virginia Tax Code ยง 58.1-2500 et seq. (potentially, depending on specific interpretations and regulations regarding franchise tax payment deadlines).",

For each calendar year during the term of this Franchise, Grantor's percentage share shall be determined pursuant to this Section, and paid to Grantor on or before March 31 of the succeeding calendar year.",
                "changed_text": "(b) For each succeeding calendar year during the term of this Franchise, the total annual Franchise Fee paid by Grantee to the localities shall be the base year total annual Franchise Fee increased by three (3) percent compounded annually over the term of the Franchise. For each calendar year during the term of this Franchise, Grantor's percentage share shall be determined pursuant to this Section, and paid to Grantor on or before December 31 of the succeeding calendar year.",
                "explanation": "By changing the payment deadline to December 31, the contract delays the payment significantly. This may violate the implicit requirement for reasonably timely tax payments, creating a contradiction with general principles of tax law and franchise regulations. It can lead to penalties for late payment, going against established payment norms.",

                "changed_text": "Such office shall be open at least twenty (20) hours per week for the conduct of business between Grantee and its customers.",
                "explanation": "While Virginia law does not explicitly mandate specific business hours for gas franchise offices, reducing the hours to 20 per week could be deemed insufficient to meet the 'adequate service' requirements implied in franchise agreements and public utility regulations. This could be viewed as a breach of the implied duty to provide reasonable service to customers, conflicting with the overall intent of state regulations governing public utilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of adequate service under Virginia public utility regulations (though not a specific statute, it's a general principle).",

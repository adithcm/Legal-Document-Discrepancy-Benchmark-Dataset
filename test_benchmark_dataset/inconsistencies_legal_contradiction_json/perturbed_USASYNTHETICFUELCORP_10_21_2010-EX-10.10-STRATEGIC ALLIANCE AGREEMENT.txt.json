                "original_text": "(v) Any Confidential Information, including all copies of same (including that portion of the Confidential Information that consists of analyses, forecasts, studies or other documents prepared by a Party or its advisors, agents, contractors or lenders), shall be returned to the other Party, or at such Party's option destroyed, within five (5) days of (A) a request by a Party at anytime; or (B) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof. Upon the written request of a Party, the other Party shall certify the destruction of such material by written notice to the requesting Party.",

Upon the written request of a Party, the other Party shall certify the destruction of such material by written notice to the requesting Party.",
                "explanation": "Requiring the return or destruction of confidential information within one day of a request or termination is likely insufficient and unreasonable to comply with, placing an undue burden on the parties, especially considering the volume and complexity of potentially covered information. This timeframe may not be commercially reasonable, potentially contradicting trade secret laws that require reasonable efforts to protect confidential information.",

                "changed_text": "(vi) This covenant shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of one (1) year thereafter.",
                "explanation": "Limiting the confidentiality period to one year may be insufficient to protect certain types of confidential information, particularly trade secrets. Many jurisdictions consider a longer period, such as 3-5 years or even indefinite for trade secrets, to be more reasonable. Setting an unreasonably short confidentiality period could jeopardize the protection of valuable trade secrets under applicable laws. Also, setting an unreasonable expectation for how long trade secrets should be held.",

All notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given upon delivery, if delivered personally or by recognized overnight courier service; if sent by first-class mail, fifteen (15) days after being mailed, return receipt requested and postage prepaid; or if sent by facsimile or e-mail, upon receipt.",
                "explanation": "Extending the deemed delivery time for first-class mail to fifteen (15) days could create issues with deadlines and time-sensitive obligations within the contract. While generally permissible, if specific state laws or regulations require shorter notice periods for certain actions (e.g., termination notices, breach of contract remedies), this longer period could render the contractual notice provision unenforceable or lead to legal disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with state laws or regulations requiring shorter notice periods for specific actions related to the contract.",

                "explanation": "In Ontario, Canada (where both parties are located), payment terms exceeding 60 days may be considered inconsistent with standard business practices, particularly for smaller suppliers. While not strictly illegal, extending the payment term to 90 days without clear justification can potentially create an imbalance of power and could be challenged under commercial law principles related to fair dealing.",

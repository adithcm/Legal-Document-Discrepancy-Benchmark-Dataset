The term of this Agreement shall be five years commencing on the Effective Date and ending at the close of business on the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date.

                "explanation": "The original text requires a six-month notice for non-renewal. Reducing this to one month may not provide sufficient time, especially in complex business relationships, potentially conflicting with general contract law principles requiring reasonable notice.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a breach of contract, particularly regarding payment failures, from five to two business days may be considered unreasonably short, potentially violating principles of fair dealing and adequate opportunity to remedy a default. Similarly, reducing the cure period for any other breach from thirty to fifteen business days may also be seen as unreasonable depending on the nature and complexity of the breach.",

                "explanation": "Extending the notice period to ten business days after mailing through certified mail contradicts the established legal expectation of prompt notice, especially in legally binding contracts. This delay could cause material harm to one or both parties and could lead to the recipient arguing they did not receive proper notice.",

                "original_text": "Upon completion of a transaction, the transaction settlement group works with the broker and the account custodian to ensure timely and accurate exchange of securities and monies.",
                "changed_text": "Upon completion of a transaction, the transaction settlement group will attempt to work with the broker and the account custodian to exchange securities and monies. There is no guarantee for timely and accurate exchange of securities and monies. All transaction settlements must be reconciled within 90 calendar days from the trade date.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies a responsibility for timely and accurate settlement, while the modified text removes this guarantee and extends the reconciliation timeframe to 90 days. FINRA Rule 11220 requires broker-dealers to settle transactions promptly, and industry standards generally expect settlement within T+2 (two business days after the trade date) for most securities. This change introduces a contradiction to those standards.",

                "original_text": "The equity investment analysts provide independent research and analysis of specific companies within a sector. Typically, analysis includes review of published reports, interviews of company management, on-site observation of company operations, and the use of various financial models. In addition, analysts read trade journals, attend industry conferences, and focus on trends within the sector and industry. Based on this proprietary analysis, the analyst makes buy, sell or hold recommendations to the Adviser.",
                "changed_text": "The equity investment analysts may provide research and analysis of specific companies within a sector; this does not have to be independently verified. Analysis may, but is not required to, include review of published reports, interviews of company management, or on-site observation of company operations. Buy, sell, or hold recommendations provided to the Adviser will be generated by AI, and will not require human approval before implementation.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies due diligence and human judgment in research and recommendations. The modified text removes the guarantee of independence and replaces human analysis with AI-driven recommendations without approval, potentially violating fiduciary duties and regulatory standards. The SEC requires investment advisers to have a reasonable basis for their recommendations. This modification could make it difficult to demonstrate a reasonable basis due to a lack of human oversight.",

The models' parameters can be changed by any member of the firm.",
                "explanation": "The original text suggests that quantitative models are designed to enhance performance and assess risk effectively. The modified text eliminates these guarantees and states that the models can be altered by any firm member, regardless of expertise, potentially violating regulatory requirements for model governance. Model risk management regulations require firms to have adequate controls over their models, including change management processes. By permitting any member of the firm to change parameters, the modified text introduces a potential conflict with such regulations.",

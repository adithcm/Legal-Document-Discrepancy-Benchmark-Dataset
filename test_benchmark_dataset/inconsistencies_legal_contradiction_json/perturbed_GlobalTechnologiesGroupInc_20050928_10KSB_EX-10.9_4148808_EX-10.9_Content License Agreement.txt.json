                "original_text": "6.5 Reporting. Distributor will provide IMNTV with a quarterly report or monthly report if available, summarizing the data relevant to the payment obligations herein within five (5) business days from the end of the calendar quarter. The reports will contain sufficient information to permit Provider to verify payments hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "6.5 Reporting. Distributor will provide IMNTV with a quarterly report, summarizing the data relevant to the payment obligations herein within sixty (60) business days from the end of the calendar quarter. The reports will contain only the total revenue figures without detailed breakdown of subscribers or usage data.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires reporting within five business days, which is a reasonable and standard practice. The modified version extends this to 60 business days and restricts the level of details in the report. This creates non-compliance as it unreasonably delays the provision of information and impedes IMNTV's ability to verify payments properly, conflicting with general principles of good faith and fair dealing. This is contradictory to generally accepted accounting principles and business practices which require timely and accurate financial reporting.",

                "changed_text": "7.1 General Termination Rights. Either party may terminate the Agreement at any time in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured after ten (10) days written notice of the breach.",
                "explanation": "By changing the cure period from 30 days to 10 days, the contract violates the standard of 'reasonable time' which is often implied in contracts, especially when dealing with international partners in China. While China's contract law doesn't specify a fixed cure period, courts often consider 30 days as a reasonable period for rectifying a breach, especially in complex business relationships. Therefore, providing only 10 days may be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable.",

The parties acknowledge that Confidential Information is valuable and unique and that disclosure in breach of this confidentiality provision will result in irreparable injury to its owner.

                "explanation": "The initial confidentiality period of two years is a reasonable and commonly accepted duration. By shortening it to six months, the protection afforded to confidential information is substantially weakened. This can lead to conflicts as trade secrets and sensitive business data, especially in the technology and media industries, may still hold considerable value beyond six months. Making the agreement last only six months introduces a risk, given the People's Republic of China's laws regarding trade secrets and confidential information, where a longer period may be expected to provide adequate protection.",

Bank of America reserves the right to pay prior to the expiration of the sixty (60) day period. If Bank of America pays within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice by Bank of America, a discount of two percent (2%) will be subtracted from the total invoice amount for Services.",
                "changed_text": "16.4 Bank of America shall pay Supplier for all services and applicable taxes invoiced In arrears in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, within ninety (90) calendar days of the date of receipt of a valid and correct invoice by Bank of America. Bank of America reserves the right to pay prior to the expiration of the ninety (90) day period. If Bank of America pays within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice by Bank of America, a discount of one percent (1%) will be subtracted from the total invoice amount for Services.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment terms to 90 days and reduces the early payment discount. Delayed payment contradicts standard and fair payment practices, which can affect supplier's cash flow and operations. Also, offering a mere 1% discount for significantly earlier payment is not commercially reasonable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with prompt payment laws depending on the jurisdiction and specific industry standards.",

Recipient shall not use or disclose Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose other than to carry out this Agreement. Recipient shall treat Confidential Information of the other Party with no less care than it employs for its own Confidential Information of a similar nature that it does not wish to disclose, publish or disseminate, but not less than a reasonable level of care.

Supplier shall return to Bank of America all Bank of America Confidential Information in the possession of Supplier or Supplier's Subcontractors.",
                "explanation": "The modified text removes the explicit requirement that confidentiality agreements with subcontractors be 'no less restrictive' than the provisions of the original section. Also, it removes the responsibility of proper destruction (SCHEDULE E requirements) of the data; just needs to 'return' which is not legally binding. This weakens the protection of confidential information, increasing the risk of unauthorized disclosure or use after the agreement ends. The term 'Reasonable level of care' is removed, also",

                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period to three years conflicts with regulatory requirements (potentially seven or more years). Also, removing notification requirement with authorities to examine Bank of America's records impairs the bank's ability to maintain oversight, and it limits Bank of America's representatives to inspect or audit records.",

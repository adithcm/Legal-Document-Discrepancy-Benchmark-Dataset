Royalty: In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox, or such other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n\n(a) From the first unit sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee's Gross Receipts (as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee's sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products. (\"IA2 Audio and Video Royalty\"). For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may not recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",

Royalty: In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox, or such other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n\n(a) From the first unit sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee's Gross Receipts (as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee's sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products. (\"IA2 Audio and Video Royalty\"). Licensee may recoup the entirety of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products, even if doing so reduces the royalty payment to Fox.",
                "explanation": "This change allows Glu Mobile to recoup the Ice Age 2 Guarantee from royalties owed to Fox, potentially reducing the royalty payment to zero. This could violate implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if the recoupment effectively nullifies the royalty payment and deprives Fox of the benefit of their bargain, which is particularly relevant in contracts governed by United States law, where such covenants are generally implied.",

                "explanation": "This change allows Fox to terminate the agreement with only 24 hours' notice, for any reason. This is legally contradictory because, under generally accepted United States contract law, especially for content licenses, such a short notice period and broad termination right would be considered commercially unreasonable and potentially unconscionable, especially given the licensee's potential investment in reliance on the contract. This violates principles of fairness and good faith.",

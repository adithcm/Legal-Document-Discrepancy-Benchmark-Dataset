                "original_text": "If an Audit Report shows that the Audited Party underpaid or failed to pay any amount due to the Auditing Party, then the Audited Party will pay to the Auditing Party the amount of such underpayment or non-payment. Such payment shall be made within [***] ([***]) days after the Audited Party's receipt of the Audit Report.",
                "changed_text": "If an Audit Report shows that the Audited Party underpaid or failed to pay any amount due to the Auditing Party, then the Audited Party will pay to the Auditing Party the amount of such underpayment or non-payment. Such payment shall be made within 120 days after the Audited Party's receipt of the Audit Report.",
                "explanation": "The change extends the payment deadline to 120 days, which is legally contradictory because payment delays beyond standard business practices could violate prompt payment laws or regulations.",

                "changed_text": "Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing, each of Janssen and Company agrees that, during the Term and until the conclusion of the six (6) month period beginning upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, such Party shall: (a) maintain in confidence the Confidential Information of the other Party using not less than the efforts such Party uses to maintain in confidence its own confidential or proprietary information of similar kind and value (but not less than reasonable efforts); (b) not disclose the Confidential Information of the other Party to any Third Party; and (c) not use the Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose other than as provided for in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The change reduces the confidentiality period to six months. This change is legally contradictory because a six-month confidentiality period for sensitive business information may be deemed unreasonably short and insufficient to protect trade secrets or other proprietary information under applicable state and federal laws.",

                "explanation": "The change modifies the reporting deadline for product complaints from 24 hours to 72 hours. This alteration creates a legal contradiction because delaying the reporting of product complaints, especially those involving safety concerns, conflicts with FDA regulations and other regulatory requirements for prompt adverse event reporting. The FDA requires immediate reporting of serious adverse events, and delaying notification could lead to non-compliance and potential legal liabilities.",

                "original_text": "4. The settlement date is the first day of the next month. Deducting the dues of Party A, Party B should pay Party A the energy saving service fee of the last month before the 15t h of each month.",
                "changed_text": "4. The settlement date is the first day of the next month. Deducting the dues of Party A, Party B should pay Party A the energy saving service fee of the last month before the 45th of the subsequent month.",
                "explanation": "This change increases the payment deadline to the 45th of the next month. Many jurisdictions have laws that require payment within a reasonable timeframe, and extending the deadline by so long could be considered unreasonable and violate those laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract and labor regulations regarding timely payment for services rendered.",

                "original_text": "2.2 If the delay is over 60 days, it is regarded that Party B has no ability to perform its payment obligation. Party A can enforce the Performance Guarantee by Party B to take all project assets. Party B shall pay the actual energy saving service fees at once and pay Party A losses.",
                "changed_text": "2.2 If the delay is over 30 days, it is regarded that Party B has no ability to perform its payment obligation. Party A can enforce the Performance Guarantee by Party B to take all project assets. Party B shall pay the actual energy saving service fees at once and pay Party A losses.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the delay period to 30 days before enforcing the performance guarantee could be seen as an unreasonable seizure of assets in many jurisdictions. A court could rule the shortened period unconscionable, especially if the project assets are of significant value.",

                "original_text": "Term Fourteen Force Majeure\n\nIf the project cannot be completed on schedule or supply power normally due to force majeure, such as war, flood, and earthquake, both parties shall be partially or fully exempt from their liabilities based on the effects of force majeure. If any party cannot perform the agreement due to force majeure, the party shall notify the other party immediately, provide the proof within 15 days, and keep the loss to a minimum with reasonable efforts.",
                "changed_text": "Term Fourteen Force Majeure\n\nIf the project cannot be completed on schedule or supply power normally due to force majeure, such as war, flood, and earthquake, both parties shall be partially or fully exempt from their liabilities based on the effects of force majeure. If any party cannot perform the agreement due to force majeure, the party shall notify the other party within 90 days and there is no obligation for proof.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the notification period for force majeure events to 90 days and eliminates the requirement to provide proof. This creates a legal contradiction because standard contract law principles require prompt notification and evidence of force majeure events to justify non-performance. Delaying notification and removing the proof requirement could render the force majeure clause unenforceable, as it would prejudice the other party's ability to mitigate damages or seek alternative solutions promptly. The original text is modified to be less strict, not compliant with general contract law.",

                "original_text": "If you believe that the Company has billed you incorrectly, you must contact Company no later than 60 days after the closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, in order to receive an adjustment or credit.",
                "changed_text": "If you believe that the Company has billed you incorrectly, you must contact Company no later than 15 days after the closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, in order to receive an adjustment or credit.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe to report billing errors to 15 days contradicts standard consumer protection laws in many states, which often provide a longer period (e.g., 30-60 days) for disputing billing errors. This creates an unreasonable burden on the customer to identify and report errors within a short timeframe.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the grace period for late payments to 5 days before applying finance charges and potentially terminating the service is unusually aggressive and may violate state laws regarding reasonable notice and grace periods for payments, particularly for service agreements.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 5 days is commercially unreasonable and likely violates general contract law principles requiring sufficient notice for termination, especially if the agreement involves significant reliance or investment by one party. 30 days is the standard for service agreements, and 5 days is not enough time for Customer to find a replacement service.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a default from 30 days to 10 days may be considered unreasonable and contradict general principles of contract law, potentially violating good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts. Many jurisdictions require a reasonable cure period, and 10 days might be deemed insufficient, especially for complex defaults.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for bankruptcy or insolvency events from seven days to one day may be considered an unreasonably short timeframe, potentially hindering the Servicer's ability to accurately assess and report the situation.

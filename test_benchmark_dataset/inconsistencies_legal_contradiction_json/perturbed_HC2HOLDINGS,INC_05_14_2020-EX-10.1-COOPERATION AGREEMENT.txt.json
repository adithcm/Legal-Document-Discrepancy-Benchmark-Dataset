                "original_text": "(i) the Board will unanimously recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote to elect each member of the 2020 Director Slate as a director of the Company at the 2020 Annual Meeting, (ii) the Company will use its reasonable best efforts (which will include the solicitation of proxies) to obtain the election of the 2020 Director Slate at the 2020 Annual Meeting and (iii) the Company will use its best efforts to resist, discourage and defend against any attempt, solicitation or action by any stockholder of the Company to remove any member of the 2020 Director Slate prior to the 2021 Annual Meeting.",
                "changed_text": "(i) the Board will unanimously recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote to elect each member of the 2020 Director Slate as a director of the Company at the 2020 Annual Meeting, (ii) the Company may, at its sole discretion, solicit proxies to obtain the election of the 2020 Director Slate at the 2020 Annual Meeting and (iii) the Company has no obligation to resist, discourage, or defend against any attempt, solicitation, or action by any stockholder of the Company to remove any member of the 2020 Director Slate prior to the 2021 Annual Meeting.",
                "explanation": "The original clause commits the Company to using its best efforts to solicit proxies and defend against attempts to remove directors. The modified clause removes this commitment and gives the company discretion, thus potentially undermining the board's fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the shareholders.",

The modified clause allows for termination at the Company's sole discretion, without notice or cause, potentially violating principles of good faith, fair dealing, and fiduciary duty, and undermining the MG Capital Parties' rights under the agreement.",

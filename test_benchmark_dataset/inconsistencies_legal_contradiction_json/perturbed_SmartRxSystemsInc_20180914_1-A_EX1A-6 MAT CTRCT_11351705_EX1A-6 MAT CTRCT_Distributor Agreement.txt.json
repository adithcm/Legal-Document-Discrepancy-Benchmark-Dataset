                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The MDO will be payable within ninety (90) days from the date of the transaction (First Month payable by the end of ninety (90) days from the end of the month).",
                "changed_text": "The MDO will be payable within one hundred and eighty (180) days from the date of the transaction (First Month payable by the end of one hundred and eighty (180) days from the end of the month).",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment timeframe to 180 days, which could violate prompt payment laws in Texas (where the distributor is located), especially if such a delay is deemed unreasonable for payment of services rendered. Many states have laws that require payments to be made within a reasonable time frame.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Prompt Payment Act, potentially violating reasonable payment timeframe requirements.",

                "original_text": "Distributor agrees to provide Company, within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter, with a report depicting sales and sales leads, including volume projections. Distributor shall commence providing Company such reports within thirty (30) days following the end of the calendar quarter in which this Agreement is executed.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor agrees to provide Company, within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar quarter, with a report depicting sales and sales leads, including volume projections. Distributor shall commence providing Company such reports within sixty (60) days following the end of the calendar quarter in which this Agreement is executed.",
                "explanation": "This change modifies the reporting timeline, extending it from 30 days to 60 days. This could pose an issue regarding timely information flow in cases where laws or regulations mandate specific reporting deadlines for the company (Smart RX Systems, Inc.) based on sales data. This delay could hinder their ability to comply with regulatory requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state or federal laws requiring timely reporting of sales or financial data, depending on the specific industry regulations.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Notices required under this Agreement shall be deemed given (i) when delivered in writing personally, (ii) when sent by confirmed telex or facsimile, (iii) five (5) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid; or (iv) one (1) day after deposit with a commercial overnight carrier, with written verification of receipt.",
                "changed_text": "Notices required under this Agreement shall be deemed given (i) when delivered in writing personally, (ii) when sent by unconfirmed telex or facsimile, (iii) ten (10) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid; or (iv) five (5) days after deposit with a commercial overnight carrier, with written verification of receipt.",
                "explanation": "The modification of the notice period extends the time frame for considering a notice 'given' when sent by mail or commercial carrier. Also the change from 'confirmed' telex or facsimile to 'unconfirmed' could cause serious problems in states where certain communications, such as those related to contract termination or legal disputes, require proof of delivery within a specific timeframe. Increasing the mail delivery time to 10 days is problematic because such a delivery window is too long in case of any legal challenge. ",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential contradiction with state laws requiring specific notice periods or proof of delivery for certain legal or contractual matters, such as termination notices or legal summons.",

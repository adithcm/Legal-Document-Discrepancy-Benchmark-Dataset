                "original_text": "If the Investment Adviser is required to reimburse the Fund, the Investment Adviser shall make such payment within 30 days  after each month-end in the amount due the Fund as of each month. If the Fund is required to pay the Investment Adviser the Expense  Waiver, the Fund shall make such payment within 30 days after each month-end.",

If the Fund is required to pay the Investment Adviser the Expense Waiver, the Fund shall make such payment within 90 days after each month-end.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment deadlines for both the Investment Adviser and the Fund beyond a reasonable timeframe. While there isn't a strict federal law mandating a specific shorter payment period for such reimbursements *in this specific context*, extending it significantly (to 60 and 90 days) could be challenged under general fiduciary duty principles or state-specific investment regulations requiring timely settlements, introducing potential non-compliance issues, especially if delays harm the fund's performance. Industry standards would suggest quicker reimbursements.",

                "explanation": "This change eliminates the requirement for annual renewal by disinterested trustees, potentially violating Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which mandates that investment advisory contracts be approved annually by a majority of disinterested trustees. Removing this safeguard weakens investor protection and introduces non-compliance with federal regulations.",

If, and to  the extent, the payment by the Fund to the Investment Adviser of the Expense Waiver would cause the Fund's Net Investment Income  to fall below zero, such payment shall be deferred until such date on which the",

The Fund must reimburse the Investment Advisor, irrespective of the Fund's current Net Investment Income.",
                "explanation": "This modification compels the Fund to reimburse the Investment Advisor for the Expense Waiver without considering the Fund's financial health, thus possibly causing a negative Net Investment Income. This change potentially violates the fiduciary duty of the Trust's trustees to act in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders and potentially violates SEC regulations requiring funds to maintain a positive net asset value.",

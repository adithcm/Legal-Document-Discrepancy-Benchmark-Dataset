                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(c) FCC shall invoice Flotek for Terpene Product at the time of shipment. Payment of FCC invoices shall be due within sixty (60) days of the respective invoice date.",
                "changed_text": "(c) FCC shall invoice Flotek for Terpene Product at the time of shipment. Payment of FCC invoices shall be due within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the respective invoice date.",
                "explanation": "Extending the payment term to 120 days without proper justification could be considered an unfair or deceptive trade practice, particularly if it deviates significantly from industry norms or imposes undue financial strain on the supplier (FCC). This may contradict the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which is part of Delaware contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Delaware contract law.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Flotek, may, by written notice given to FCC on or before September 30, 2023, elect for the Term to be extended to December 31, 2024.",
                "changed_text": "Flotek, may, by written notice given to FCC on or before December 15, 2023, elect for the Term to be extended to December 31, 2024.",
                "explanation": "Changing the deadline for Flotek to exercise its option to extend the term from September 30, 2023, to December 15, 2023, creates uncertainty and potential legal issues if FCC has relied on the original deadline for its business planning. Such a change without mutual agreement could violate the principles of promissory estoppel and reasonable reliance, potentially creating a breach of contract claim in Delaware if FCC can prove detrimental reliance on the original term.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "FCC may not assign or delegate its rights or obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon each of the parties upon their execution, and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and assigns. Any assignee whatsoever will be bound by the obligations of the assigning party under this Agreement, and any assignment shall not diminish the liability or obligation of the assignor under the terms of this Agreement unless otherwise agreed.",
                "changed_text": "FCC may freely assign or delegate its rights or obligations pursuant to this Agreement without notice to Flotek. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon each of the parties upon their execution, and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and assigns. Any assignee whatsoever will only be bound by the obligations of the assigning party under this Agreement if they choose to do so, and any assignment shall fully diminish the liability or obligation of the assignor under the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Delaware law generally upholds contractual restrictions on assignment. Allowing FCC to freely assign its obligations without notice and diminishing its liability violates the established legal principle that contract terms are binding and predictable. This change introduces uncertainty and potential breach of contract by undermining the original intentions and mutual obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware contract law regarding the enforceability of anti-assignment clauses.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "ii. Payment  to CSA no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of invoice from CSA. CSA shall submit  invoice to the Company no later than thirty (30) days after Company provides CSA with the list of the sales of Product (containing the Property with such supporting information that may be required or requested to be disclosed).",
                "changed_text": "ii. Payment to CSA no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of invoice from CSA. CSA shall submit invoice to the Company no later than forty-five (45) days after Company provides CSA with the list of the sales of Product (containing the Property with such supporting information that may be required or requested to be disclosed).",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment timeframe to 60 days and the invoice submission to 45 days, potentially conflicting with UK law or best practices, which often require shorter payment terms, especially for services provided by smaller entities like CSA. The extended payment term without proper justification could be considered an unfair practice.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates UK Late Payment of Commercial Debts Regulations 2013 if the original agreement was compliant and the new terms are unreasonable and cause financial hardship.",
                "location": "4.b.ii"
            },

                "original_text": "Talent  shall have seven (7) days following receipt of such Materials or any part thereof displaying  the intended use of the Property to review and for CSA to provide to Company written approval for such use.",
                "changed_text": "Talent shall have two (2) days following receipt of such Materials or any part thereof displaying the intended use of the Property to review and for CSA to provide to Company written approval for such use.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the review period to two days may not provide sufficient time for Talent to properly assess the materials, especially considering potential legal and reputational implications, potentially conflicting with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under UK contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially breaches implied terms of reasonable opportunity for review and approval under UK contract law.",
                "location": "5.c"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Talent agrees that Company shall, for a period of nine (9) months (Sell-Off Period) following the effective date of termination, have the right to continue to sell Product bearing  the Property and/or utilize advertising materials and collateral bearing the Property. Such sales and use shall be made subject to all the provisions of this Agreement and in particular clause 4 hereof.",
                "changed_text": "Talent agrees that Company shall, for a period of eighteen (18) months (Sell-Off Period) following the effective date of termination, have the right to continue to sell Product bearing the Property and/or utilize advertising materials and collateral bearing the Property. Such sales and use shall be made subject to all the provisions of this Agreement and in particular clause 4 hereof.",
                "explanation": "Extending the sell-off period to 18 months after termination could be deemed unreasonable restraint of trade, particularly if Talent is prevented from engaging in similar endorsements during this period, and might conflict with competition laws in the UK. This is especially true if the agreement does not adequately compensate Talent for the extended use of their Property.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates UK competition law and common law principles against unreasonable restraint of trade.",

                "original_text": "Upon reasonable written request of the Company which shall be tendered at least 30 days prior the date requested, the Professional shall make himself available for the purpose of posing for print ads, making commercials and other promotional materials, or attending promotional events organized by the Company once per calendar year.  In the event of such requests by the Company, the company shall be responsible for the payment of all reasonable travel, lodging and meal expenses incurred in connection with the Professional rendering services described in this subsection. Should the services of the Professional be required for longer than one day, the Professional shall be entitled to his daily appearance fee, plus reasonable expenses, for each day in excess of one day.",
                "changed_text": "Upon written request of the Company, the Professional shall make himself available for promotional activities as requested, with no advance notice required. In the event of such requests by the Company, the company shall be responsible for the payment of all reasonable travel, lodging and meal expenses incurred in connection with the Professional rendering services described in this subsection. Should the services of the Professional be required for longer than one day, the Professional shall only be entitled to reasonable expenses.",
                "explanation": "The modification removes the 30-day notice requirement, potentially conflicting with labor laws or professional standards requiring reasonable scheduling and notice for appearances. Furthermore, changing 'daily appearance fee, plus reasonable expenses' to 'reasonable expenses' could violate minimum wage/fair compensation standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violations of state labor laws regarding fair scheduling practices and wage requirements, varying by state.",

                "changed_text": "Additionally, if either part shall fail to observe or perform any of the agreements or obligations undertaken by such party hereunder, the non-defaulting party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately.",
                "explanation": "The modified text removes the 30-day cure period, which could conflict with general contract law principles requiring a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach before termination.",

                "explanation": "The modification grants the Company indefinite usage rights of the Professional's image after termination, potentially violating right of publicity laws, which protect individuals from unauthorized commercial use of their likeness. Some states have strong regulations on this topic and would be a direct contradiction.",

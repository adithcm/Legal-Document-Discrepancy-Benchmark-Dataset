                "original_text": "10.1 Payment. All payments are due within 10 days of receipt of the invoice by ACH or wire transfer, unless the Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory that the financial condition of Shipper or Shipper's guarantor (if any) is or has become impaired or unsatisfactory or Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory it necessary to do so, in which case the payment due date shall be that specified in a written notice to the Shipper. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shipper may withhold payment of amounts it disputes in good faith, provided that if any such amount is later determined to have been due Transporter Section 10.2 below shall apply to such amount.",
                "changed_text": "10.1 Payment. All payments are due within 60 days of receipt of the invoice by ACH or wire transfer, unless the Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory that the financial condition of Shipper or Shipper's guarantor (if any) is or has become impaired or unsatisfactory or Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory it necessary to do so, in which case the payment due date shall be that specified in a written notice to the Shipper. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shipper may withhold payment of amounts it disputes in good faith, provided that if any such amount is later determined to have been due Transporter Section 10.2 below shall apply to such amount.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payments within 10 days, but extending it to 60 days does not align with standard business practices. In Texas, prompt payment laws often dictate shorter payment cycles, especially in industries like oil and gas. Many commercial agreements follow similar norms. This longer period creates an inconsistency.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under Texas contract law, and general industry standards for payment terms.",

                "original_text": "11.4 Claims. As a condition precedent to recovery for losses or delay to shipments, claims must be filed in writing with Transporter within one year and one day after delivery of the Crude Petroleum, or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within one year and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits arising out of such claims shall be instituted against the Transporter only within two years and one day from the date of delivery, or within two years and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted thereon in accordance with the foregoing provisions, Transporter shall not be liable and such claims will not be paid.",
                "changed_text": "11.4 Claims. As a condition precedent to recovery for losses or delay to shipments, claims must be filed in writing with Transporter within 90 days after delivery of the Crude Petroleum, or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within 90 days after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits arising out of such claims shall be instituted against the Transporter only within one year from the date of delivery, or within one year after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted thereon in accordance with the foregoing provisions, Transporter shall not be liable and such claims will not be paid.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that claims be filed within one year and one day after delivery, and suits within two years and one day. Modifying this to require claims within 90 days and suits within one year after delivery significantly reduces the time available for shippers to discover losses and pursue legal action, which can be seen as an unreasonably short timeframe and may conflict with the statute of limitations for breach of contract, creating an inconsistency.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential conflict with Texas statute of limitations for breach of contract claims (typically four years), and principles of reasonable opportunity to discover damages.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that confidentiality obligations survive termination for one year. Extending this to ten years is potentially unreasonable and could be seen as an unenforceable restraint of trade. In Texas, non-compete and confidentiality agreements must be reasonable in duration. A ten-year survival period might be deemed excessive, especially if the information isn't a trade secret.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas law regarding the enforceability of non-compete and confidentiality agreements, particularly the requirement that they be reasonable in duration and scope.",

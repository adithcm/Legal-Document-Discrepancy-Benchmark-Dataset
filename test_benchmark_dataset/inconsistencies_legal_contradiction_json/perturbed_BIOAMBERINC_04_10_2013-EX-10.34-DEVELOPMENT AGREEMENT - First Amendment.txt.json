                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days of the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrating such production levels of succinic acid, Bioamber will  cease any further funding and/or other support for the BRI Project.",
                "changed_text": "Within fifteen (15) days of the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrating such production levels of succinic acid, Bioamber will  cease any further funding and/or other support for the BRI Project.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for Bioamber to cease funding after the demonstration of succinic acid production to 15 days creates a non-compliance issue if such rapid cessation violates pre-existing agreements, labor laws, or other legal obligations related to project termination in France, where BioAmber S.A.S. has its business.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of French labor laws or contractual obligations related to project funding and termination, specifically regarding notice periods and severance requirements.",

                "original_text": "Further Bioamber will require that any unexpended funds received from  Bioamber be utilized for a project other than the BRI Project.",
                "changed_text": "Further Bioamber may, at its sole discretion, reallocate any unexpended funds received from Bioamber for any purpose whatsoever.",
                "explanation": "Allowing Bioamber to reallocate unexpended funds \"for any purpose whatsoever\" creates a conflict if the original funding agreement stipulates specific uses or prohibits certain allocations. This change could violate fiduciary duties or grant restrictions, especially if public funds from the Canadian National Research Council were involved, making it a violation of grant regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of grant regulations and fiduciary duties related to the use of funds from the Canadian National Research Council.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Bioamber shall use best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for the use of the CB1 Strain in all countries where Bioamber and/or a Bioamber  licensee are using any strain other than the CB1 strain for the production of succinic acid and/or salts thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Bioamber is not required to obtain regulatory approvals for the use of the CB1 Strain if such approvals are deemed commercially unreasonable by Bioamber management.",
                "explanation": "Removing the obligation to obtain regulatory approvals and introducing a \"commercially unreasonable\" exception allows Bioamber to bypass necessary regulatory processes. This directly contradicts environmental regulations and health and safety standards in countries where Bioamber operates, potentially leading to violations and liabilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violation of environmental regulations and health and safety standards in relevant jurisdictions (e.g., France, Canada) related to the use of genetically modified organisms in industrial production.",

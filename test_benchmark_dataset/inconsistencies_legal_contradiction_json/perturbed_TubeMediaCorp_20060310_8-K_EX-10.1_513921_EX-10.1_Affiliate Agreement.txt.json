                "original_text": "(b) Renewal Term. If Affiliate fails to notify Network of its desire that this Agreement terminate on its expiration date, at least six (6) months before the expiration date, this Agreement will automatically renew, upon the same terms and conditions, for an additional four (4) -year period (\"Renewal Term\").",
                "changed_text": "(b) Renewal Term. If Affiliate fails to notify Network of its desire that this Agreement terminate on its expiration date, at least one (1) month before the expiration date, this Agreement will automatically renew, upon the same terms and conditions, for an additional ten (10)-year period (\"Renewal Term\").",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a six-month notice period for termination, which is generally acceptable. By reducing the notification period to one month and extending the renewal term to ten years, the contract becomes unfavorable to the Affiliate and potentially unenforceable, especially if state laws favor shorter renewal periods or stricter notification requirements for automatic renewals.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates state laws regarding fair business practices and contract enforceability, particularly in states with specific regulations on automatic renewal clauses.",

                "original_text": "(b) Network shall submit to Affiliate, within forty-five (45) days of the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, a statement reporting for such calendar quarter the following information on a Station-by-Station basis: (i) Network's Advertising Revenue, (ii) the Affiliate Advertising Share, (iii) Network's Transactional Revenue, (iv) the average number of households receiving the Service through each MVPD in each DMA served by a Station, as calculated herein, and (v) the Affiliate Transactional Share. If this Agreement terminates on any date other than at the end of a calendar quarter, Network shall supply such statement as of the date of termination, within forty-five (45) days thereafter, and this obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement until Affiliate receives such statement.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Network shall submit to Affiliate, within one hundred eighty (180) days of the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, a statement reporting for such calendar quarter the following information on a Station-by-Station basis: (i) Network's Advertising Revenue, (ii) the Affiliate Advertising Share, (iii) Network's Transactional Revenue, (iv) the average number of households receiving the Service through each MVPD in each DMA served by a Station, as calculated herein, and (v) the Affiliate Transactional Share. If this Agreement terminates on any date other than at the end of a calendar quarter, Network will at their discretion provide Affiliate with a statement, and this obligation shall not survive the termination of this Agreement .",
                "explanation": "Delaying the reporting deadline to 180 days and removing the survival clause after termination can create financial risks for the Affiliate, as it hinders their ability to promptly audit and reconcile revenue shares. The language 'Network will at their discretion provide Affiliate with a statement' creates uncertainty and contradicts standard contract law principles requiring clearly defined reporting periods.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates state laws regarding timely and accurate financial reporting, and contractual obligations to provide information necessary for calculating payments.",
                "location": "Section 7(b)"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(a) In addition to Network's other rights to terminate this Agreement, Network may, by providing Affiliate with thirty (30) days' prior notice, terminate this Agreement if Affiliate is in material breach of this Agreement, provided that Affiliate shall have thirty (30) days from Network's notice specifying in detail the nature of such breach to cure such breach; provided, however, if such breach is confined to a single breach by a Station or group of Stations during the Term, then Network shall have the right to terminate this Agreement only as to such Station or Stations, but if Affiliate willfully and repeatedly materially breaches any of the material provisions of this Agreement, then Network, at its option, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in its entirety or only as to such breaching Station or Stations.",
                "changed_text": "(a) In addition to Network's other rights to terminate this Agreement, Network may, by providing Affiliate with ten (10) days' prior notice, terminate this Agreement if Network believes Affiliate is in breach of this Agreement and there will be no opportunity to cure such breach; Network shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in its entirety. ",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period to ten days and removing the cure period, combined with subjective criteria ('Network believes'), significantly weakens Affiliate's protection against termination. Removing the option to cure any breach immediately allows Network to terminate the contract with the affiliate at any point.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates state laws related to fair business practices and good faith dealing in contracts, especially regarding termination clauses that are overly one-sided or lack reasonable notice and cure provisions.",

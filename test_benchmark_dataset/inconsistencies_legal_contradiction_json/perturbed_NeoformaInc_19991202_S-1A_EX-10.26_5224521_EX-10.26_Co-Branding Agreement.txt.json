The Receiving Party shall notify the Originating Party of its approval or disapproval of such advertising materials as soon as practicable, but in any event within five business days after Receiving Party's receipt thereof. Any failure of the Receiving Party to respond within such five business day period shall be deemed disapproval of the advertising materials in question.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a five-business-day period for approval or disapproval of advertising materials. Reducing this period to one business day places an unreasonable burden on the Receiving Party to review and respond to the materials, potentially leading to rushed or overlooked evaluations. This creates a conflict with standard business practices that mandate a reasonable time frame for review and approval processes, making the quick turnaround of only one day a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for non-renewal from 30 days to 10 days may conflict with state laws that require reasonable notice periods for contract termination, especially in agreements of this complexity. This short notice could be deemed insufficient time for the other party to adequately prepare for the termination of the agreement and secure alternative arrangements. By shortening the time, it creates a contradiction with state regulations on adequate notice periods for contract renewals.",

                "explanation": "The original text sets a two-year limitation for claims arising from the agreement. By reducing this to one year, it may contradict statutes of limitations in certain states for contract disputes, particularly for claims of fraud or misrepresentation which often have longer statutory periods. This abbreviated limitation could make it difficult for parties to pursue legitimate claims if the full extent of damages or wrongdoing is not discovered within the shortened one-year window.",

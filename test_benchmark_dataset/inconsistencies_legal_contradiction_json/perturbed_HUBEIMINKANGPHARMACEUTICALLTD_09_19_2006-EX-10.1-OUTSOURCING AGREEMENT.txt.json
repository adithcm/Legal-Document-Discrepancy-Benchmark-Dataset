                "original_text": "Dolphin agrees to complete its photo-editing services within 14 days of receiving the original digital photo files. The completed files must meet DGT pre-defined standards for finished products;",
                "changed_text": "Dolphin agrees to complete its photo-editing services within 5 days of receiving the original digital photo files. The completed files must meet DGT pre-defined standards for finished products;",
                "explanation": "The change reduces the completion time to 5 days. This may be an unreasonably short timeframe for completing the photo-editing services, especially considering the volume of photos potentially involved, and could be deemed unconscionable or commercially unreasonable under general contract law principles if it consistently results in substandard work or places undue burden on Dolphin. This could conflict with fair business practice regulations.",

                "changed_text": "No action, whether in contract or tort (including negligence), or otherwise arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, may be brought by Dolphin more than three months after the cause of action has occurred.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states a six-month limitation period for legal actions. Reducing this to three months conflicts with Nevada's statute of limitations for breach of contract, which typically allows for a longer period (e.g., four years for written contracts). This shortened period could unfairly prejudice Dolphin's ability to pursue legitimate claims.",

                "original_text": "DGT shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement if Dolphin fails to meet its requirements and material obligation hereunder and only after DGT have given Dolphin written notice of such failure and only after Dolphin has not rectified such failure within 10 days of the notice. Dolphin shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement only after DGT fails to meet a material obligation hereunder and only after Dolphin has given DGT written notice of such failure and only after the DGT has not rectified such failure within 30 days of the notice.",
                "changed_text": "DGT shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement immediately if Dolphin fails to meet its requirements and material obligation hereunder without notice. Dolphin shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement only after DGT fails to meet a material obligation hereunder and only after Dolphin has given DGT written notice of such failure and only after the DGT has not rectified such failure within 60 days of the notice.",
                "explanation": "The modified text allows DGT to terminate the agreement immediately without any notice to Dolphin, while extending Dolphin's notice period to 60 days. This is an unconscionable provision that heavily favors DGT, creating a significant power imbalance and potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing implied in contract law. Under Nevada law, such a one-sided termination clause could be deemed unenforceable.",

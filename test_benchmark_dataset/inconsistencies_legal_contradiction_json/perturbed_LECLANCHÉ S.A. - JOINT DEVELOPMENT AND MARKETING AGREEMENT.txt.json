                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the absence of a specific payment schedule, all payment terms are 30 days net from date of invoice.",
                "changed_text": "In the absence of a specific payment schedule, all payment terms are 90 days net from date of invoice.",
                "explanation": "The modification of payment terms to 90 days may contradict prompt payment laws in certain jurisdictions (including some US states) that mandate shorter payment periods, especially for specific types of contracts or industries. This could make the contractual term unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Prompt Payment Laws (varies by state)",
                "location": "Section 9.1"

                "changed_text": "Both Parties agree that during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years following the termination, both Parties will not (i) solicit, encourage, or take any other action, which is intended, directly or indirectly, to induce any employee to terminate his or her employment with a Party; or (ii) interfere in any manner with the contractual or employment relationship between the Parties and any their employees.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the non-solicitation period to five years following termination may be deemed unreasonably long and unenforceable under California law, which disfavors overly broad non-compete agreements. California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 makes contracts that restrain someone from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business generally void.",

                "original_text": "Any notice, approval, request, authorization, direction, or other communication under this Agreement shall be given in writing, directed to the addresses of the Parties set forth above, and shall be deemed to have been delivered and given for all purposes: (a) on the delivery date if delivered personally to the Party to whom the same is directed; (b) one (1) business day after deposit with a commercial overnight carrier with written verification of receipt; or (c) five (5) business days after the mailing date whether or not actually received, if sent by registered or recorded delivery post or any other means of rapid mail delivery for which a receipt is available to the Contact at the address of the Party to whom the same is directed.",
                "changed_text": "Any notice, approval, request, authorization, direction, or other communication under this Agreement shall be given in writing, directed to the addresses of the Parties set forth above, and shall be deemed to have been delivered and given for all purposes: (a) on the delivery date if delivered personally to the Party to whom the same is directed; (b) five (5) business days after deposit with a commercial overnight carrier with written verification of receipt; or (c) fifteen (15) business days after the mailing date whether or not actually received, if sent by registered or recorded delivery post or any other means of rapid mail delivery for which a receipt is available to the Contact at the address of the Party to whom the same is directed.",
                "explanation": "Extending the notice periods, particularly for overnight carriers and postal mail, may conflict with legal requirements for timely notice in certain situations, especially those with strict deadlines imposed by law (e.g., exercising options, responding to legal claims). The changed text could render time-sensitive notifications invalid due to the extended delivery timeframe, thus contradicting legal requirements for prompt notification.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies based on applicable law and context of notice (e.g., contract law, civil procedure rules)",

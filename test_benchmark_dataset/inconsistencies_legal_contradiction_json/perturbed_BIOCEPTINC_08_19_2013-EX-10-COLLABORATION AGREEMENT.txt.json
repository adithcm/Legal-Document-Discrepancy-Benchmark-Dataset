            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If Biocept at any time finds that Life Technologies is not in compliance with this Section, then Biocept may notify Life Technologies in writing of such deficiencies, and if Life Technologies fails to correct such deficiencies within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, Biocept may, at its election and in addition to any other remedies, terminate the license granted to Life Technologies with respect to the Biocept Trademarks.",
                "changed_text": "If Biocept at any time finds that Life Technologies is not in compliance with this Section, then Biocept may notify Life Technologies in writing of such deficiencies, and if Life Technologies fails to correct such deficiencies within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, Biocept may, at its election and in addition to any other remedies, terminate the license granted to Life Technologies with respect to the Biocept Trademarks.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives Life Technologies thirty (30) days to correct deficiencies. Decreasing the cure period to ten (10) days is unreasonable and potentially violates California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to act fairly and reasonably in exercising their contractual rights. This can lead to litigation if Life Technologies argues the shorter period was insufficient to remedy the issue.",
                "contradicted_law": "California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; potential breach of contract.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Life Technologies shall pay Biocept within sixty (60) days following the invoice date. The parties shall disclose actual reimbursement for each Test, and shall reconcile or \"true-up\" any differences between the amounts actually received by Life Technologies for each billing item or code and amounts paid to Biocept on a quarterly basis.",
                "changed_text": "Life Technologies shall pay Biocept within ninety (90) days following the invoice date. The parties shall disclose actual reimbursement for each Test, and shall reconcile or \"true-up\" any differences between the amounts actually received by Life Technologies for each billing item or code and amounts paid to Biocept on an annual basis.",
                "explanation": "Changing the reconciliation from quarterly to annually can create inconsistencies with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) which favors more frequent reconciliation for accurate financial reporting. Delaying reconciliations can also violate California laws requiring transparency and accurate record-keeping in business transactions, leading to potential disputes over payments and revenue sharing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), California Business and Professions Code related to accurate record keeping.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement before the end of the Term upon written notice to the other party if such other party is in material breach of this Agreement and has not cured such breach within sixty (60) days (the \"Cure Period\") after notice from the terminating party requesting cure of the breach.",
                "changed_text": "Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement before the end of the Term upon written notice to the other party if such other party is in material breach of this Agreement and has not cured such breach within fifteen (15) days (the \"Cure Period\") after notice from the terminating party requesting cure of the breach.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from sixty (60) to fifteen (15) days could be deemed unreasonable, particularly for complex breaches requiring significant remediation efforts. This may conflict with California law requiring a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach before termination, potentially leading to wrongful termination claims if a party is unable to rectify the breach within the shortened timeframe.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law regarding reasonable opportunity to cure a breach of contract, potential claim for wrongful termination.",

                "original_text": "4.2 The Service Fee of the last quarter shall be paid prior to the seventh business day following the commencement of the next quarter. Such Service Fee shall be paid to the bank account designated by Party B in writing. If Party B intends to change its bank account, it shall send a written notice to Party A seven business days in advance.",
                "changed_text": "4.2 The Service Fee of the last quarter shall be paid prior to the second business day following the commencement of the next quarter. Such Service Fee shall be paid to the bank account designated by Party B in writing. If Party B intends to change its bank account, it shall send a written notice to Party A two business days in advance.",
                "explanation": "Shortening the payment period for the service fee to two business days following the commencement of the next quarter and the notice period for changing bank accounts to two business days may be unreasonably short under PRC law, potentially violating Article 92 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, which requires parties to follow the principle of good faith. The original text provides 7 days which may be considered commercially reasonable, whereas the altered text's 2 days may not be sufficient time for Party A to process payments or update banking information.",

                "original_text": "10. Force Majeure\n\nThe force majeure hereunder shall mean the natural disaster, war, political event, and adjustment of laws, regulations and state policies. If the performance of this Agreement by one Party or the Parties according to provisions agreed hereunder is directly affected by the force majeure event, the affected Party shall immediately notify the other Party or its attorney-in-fact of the situation of the force majeure event, and shall, within fifteen (15) days, provide the detailed information of the force majeure event or the reason for non-performance or partial performance or delay of performance of this Agreement as well as valid evidence thereof (which shall be issued by the notarization authority at the place where the force majeure event occurs). The Parties shall negotiate to decide the performance of this Agreement depending on to what degree the performance of this Agreement is influenced by the force majeure, and decide on whether the affected Party may partially perform or postpone the performance of its obligations hereunder. Except as provided for under Article 6.1.3 hereof, neither Party shall exercise the right to termination this Agreement that it may have under any applicable laws on the ground of occurrence of force majeure event.",
                "changed_text": "10. Force Majeure\n\nThe force majeure hereunder shall mean events deemed such by Party B. If the performance of this Agreement by one Party or the Parties according to provisions agreed hereunder is directly affected, the affected Party shall notify the other Party. Valid evidence is not required. Party B will unilaterally decide the performance of this Agreement. Neither Party shall exercise the right to termination this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Giving Party B unilateral control over defining force majeure events, waiving the requirement for valid evidence, and unilaterally deciding on the performance of the agreement could be deemed unconscionable and violate the principle of fairness under PRC contract law. The removal of the 15-day notification period also puts Party A at a disadvantage. The elimination of the right to terminate the agreement under any circumstances related to force majeure is potentially illegal if the force majeure event fundamentally prevents performance.",

The arbitration award shall be final and binding on each Party.",

The arbitration award shall be final and binding on each Party.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the negotiation period for dispute resolution from thirty days to five days may be considered an unreasonably short period, limiting the parties' ability to engage in meaningful negotiation and potentially violating the principle of good faith under the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China. This abbreviated timeframe could be seen as procedurally unfair.",

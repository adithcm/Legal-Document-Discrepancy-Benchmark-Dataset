                "original_text": "Any payment due pursuant to this Section that is not received by SDBF within fifteen (15) days after such payment is due shall bear interest from the date the payment was due until paid, at a per annum rate of interest equal to the prime rate of interest as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus five (5) percentage points, or if such interest rate is not permitted by applicable law, at the highest non-usurious interest rate permitted by applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "Any payment due pursuant to this Section that is not received by SDBF within five (5) days after such payment is due shall bear interest from the date the payment was due until paid, at a per annum rate of interest equal to the prime rate of interest as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus twenty-five (25) percentage points, or if such interest rate is not permitted by applicable law, at the highest non-usurious interest rate permitted by applicable law.",
                "explanation": "California law requires specific grace periods for payments and regulates late payment interest rates. Reducing the grace period to five days and increasing the interest rate to prime plus 25 percentage points may violate California usury laws and regulations regarding reasonable late payment fees, thus creating a legal contradiction. The legal rate of interest in California is 10% per year. Anything above that might be considered as violating usury laws.",

                "original_text": "In the event of cancellation, non-renewal or material modification SDBF shall receive thirty (30) days written notice thereof. Sponsor shall provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with all insurance provisions noted above prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of cancellation, non-renewal or material modification SDBF shall receive ten (10) days written notice thereof. Sponsor shall provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with all insurance provisions noted above prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and upon request.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for insurance cancellation, non-renewal, or material modification to ten days conflicts with standard insurance contract regulations and California law which often requires insurers to provide at least 30 days' notice for such changes. Additionally, removing the requirement to provide certificates of insurance annually contradicts standard risk management practices and could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this agreement or any document related hereto may be brought in the courts of the state of california, county of san diego or any court of the united states of america for the southern district of california, and, by execution and delivery of this agreement, each party hereby accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of such courts. the parties irrevocably waive any objection, including any objection to the laying of venue or based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, which any of them may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any such action or proceeding in such respective jurisdictions. each party irrevocably consents to the service of process of any of such courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to each of the other parties at its address provided herein, such service to become effective thirty (30) days after such mailing.",
                "changed_text": "Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this agreement or any document related hereto may be brought in the courts of the state of delaware. The parties irrevocably waive any objection, including any objection to the laying of venue or based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, which any of them may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any such action or proceeding in such respective jurisdictions. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process of any of such courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by standard mail, such service to become effective five (5) days after such mailing.",
                "explanation": "Changing the jurisdiction to Delaware and significantly reducing the effective service of process time to five days via standard mail conflicts with California's laws regarding jurisdiction and service of process requirements. California Code of Civil Procedure requires specific methods for proper service, and five days via standard mail is likely insufficient to meet due process requirements, especially when dealing with out-of-state parties. Additionally, removing the reference to California courts undermines the reasonable expectation that disputes arising from a contract performed in California will be adjudicated under California law, potentially conflicting with choice-of-law principles if other parts of the contract specify California law.",

                "original_text": "ETON shall pay to Aucta licensing fees of up to an amount of five million dollars ($5,000,000) based on the following payment schedule: (a) An amount of two million dollars ($2,000,000) within five (5) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "ETON shall pay to Aucta licensing fees of up to an amount of five million dollars ($5,000,000) based on the following payment schedule: (a) An amount of two million dollars ($2,000,000) within one (1) day of the Effective Date of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change requires ETON to make a payment within one day of the agreement's effective date. This is an unreasonably short timeframe that could be deemed unconscionable under contract law, particularly if it places undue burden or pressure on ETON.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding unconscionability and reasonable timeframes for payment.",

                "changed_text": "If either Party shall learn of (a) any claim or assertion that the manufacture, use or marketing of the Product under this Agreement, or any other action taken by either party in performance of its obligations hereunder infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights of any Third Party, or (b) the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or other violation by any Third Party of the intellectual property rights of any party that are the subject of this Agreement (\"Intellectual Rights Suits\"), then the Party becoming so informed shall notify the other Party of such claim or assertion, or actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or other violation only if it deems the claim is potentially valid.",
                "explanation": "By removing the deadline of three business days and adding that the party needs to deem the claim potentially valid, it allows a party to suppress information about potential infringements claims. This would violate the duty of candor and disclosure, especially with respect to intellectual property rights and potential liabilities. This can be seen as a breach of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for termination from 180 days to 30 days is unreasonable as it significantly impacts Aucta's ability to secure a new partnership or handle the return of the product. A sudden termination could lead to considerable financial loss and disrupt Aucta's ongoing business operations due to inadequate notice. This is especially true given the nature of pharmaceutical product transitions which often require significant time.",

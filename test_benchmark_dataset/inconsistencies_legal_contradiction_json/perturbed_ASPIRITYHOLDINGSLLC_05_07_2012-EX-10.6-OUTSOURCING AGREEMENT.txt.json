On the first Business Day of each month, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the Contractor shall provide  the Company with a written invoice for the previous month's fees and expenses that are payable with respect to Notes issued up to the  last day of such month.. Such fees and expenses will be due and payable by the later of the fifteenth (15 ) day of every month or fifteen  (15) days after the date such invoice is received.",

Such fees and expenses will be due and payable by the later of the sixtieth (60 ) day of every month or sixty (60) days after the date such invoice is received.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within 15 days of the invoice date, which is standard. The modified text extends the payment period to 60 days. Many states have prompt payment laws that require businesses to pay invoices within a much shorter timeframe (e.g., 30 days), particularly for services rendered. This delay could violate those prompt payment statutes.",

Unless otherwise requested by the Company, or unless otherwise required by Governmental Rules, the  Contractor shall retain, with respect to each Note, for a period of 24 months from the date the Note is fully paid, all records, files and documents related to each such Note. At the end of such 24-month period, unless otherwise directed by the Company, all such items shall be transferred to the Company, or to a  third party as designated by the Company, at the Company's sole cost and expense.

                "explanation": "The original agreement requires retention of records for 24 months after a note is fully paid. The modified text shortens this period to 6 months. This could conflict with SEC record retention requirements for broker-dealers or investment advisers, which may mandate longer retention periods to allow for audits or investigations. For example, Rule 17a-4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires broker-dealers to preserve certain records for at least three years.",

Also, the modified agreement states that the company can terminate the agreement by giving ten days notice.

                "original_text": "5.1 Within thirty (30) days of the end of each payment quarter IntriCon must provide to Dynamic Hearing a statement of the actual number and value of Base Product Units Sold along with the number and value of DSP features/models sold with those Base Product Units by it or any Related Body Corporate. The statement must also include calculations of the per unit royalty in accordance with clause 4.9. Any royalty due for payment by IntriCon to Dynamic Hearing is payable at the same time the statement is provided.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Within sixty (60) days of the end of each payment quarter IntriCon may provide to Dynamic Hearing a statement of the actual number and value of Base Product Units Sold along with the number and value of DSP features/models sold with those Base Product Units by it or any Related Body Corporate. The statement must also include calculations of the per unit royalty in accordance with clause 4.9. Any royalty due for payment by IntriCon to Dynamic Hearing is payable within 90 days after the end of the payment quarter.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires IntriCon to provide a statement and payment within 30 days of the end of each quarter. The modified text extends the deadline for the statement to 60 days and the payment deadline to 90 days. While there isn't a universally applicable law dictating royalty payment timelines, excessively delaying payments without reasonable justification could be construed as a breach of good faith and fair dealing, potentially conflicting with general contract law principles. The change in 'must' to 'may' introduces ambiguity and could be interpreted to mean that IntriCon is not obligated to provide the report at all, conflicting with accounting standards. Introducing a 90 days payment deadline might contradict laws related to intellectual property and royalty payments, especially if such payments are tied to specific sales periods.",

                "original_text": "6.2 IntriCon must make all such records available for inspection, copying and audit by an independent auditor appointed by Dynamic Hearing (and to which IntriCon has no reasonable objection) during ordinary business hours at any time during the Term and for a period of one year following the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, provided that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 If in any audit, the auditor finds an underpayment or an overpayment of fees due under this Agreement, the party who has received the overpayment or has underpaid will within 7 days repay the excess or pay the shortfall (as the case may be) to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "6.2 IntriCon must make all such records available for inspection, copying and audit by an independent auditor appointed by Dynamic Hearing (and to which IntriCon has no reasonable objection) only every other year during ordinary business hours at any time during the Term and for a period of six months following the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, provided that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 If in any audit, the auditor finds an underpayment or an overpayment of fees due under this Agreement, the party who has received the overpayment or has underpaid will within 30 days repay the excess or pay the shortfall (as the case may be) to the other party.",
                "explanation": "Limiting audits to every other year and reducing the record availability period to six months following termination restricts Dynamic Hearing's ability to ensure accurate royalty payments, potentially conflicting with accounting standards and legal principles of transparency. Extending the repayment period for underpayments or overpayments from 7 days to 30 days could violate legal or accounting standards which expect reconciliation of accounts in a timely manner. Laws concerning financial reporting and auditing expect more frequent and rapid reconciliation of accounts and the original text is more appropriate.",

                "changed_text": "11.5 (a) Subject to the provisions of 11.1, IntriCon may terminate this Agreement upon one (1) months written notice to Dynamic Hearing, such notice stating that IntriCon will cease making payments, either minimum or second component payments or both, and such termination shall not be considered a breach of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)    Subject to the provisions of 11.1, Dynamic Hearing may terminate this Agreement upon six (6) months written notice to IntriCon of such termination.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for IntriCon's termination to one month while extending Dynamic Hearing's to six months creates an imbalance that may conflict with the principle of fair dealing. Short notice periods can prejudice the other party's ability to mitigate damages or find alternative arrangements, potentially contravening laws related to reasonable notice and contract termination. In specific jurisdictions, a gross imbalance in termination clauses is unenforceable.",

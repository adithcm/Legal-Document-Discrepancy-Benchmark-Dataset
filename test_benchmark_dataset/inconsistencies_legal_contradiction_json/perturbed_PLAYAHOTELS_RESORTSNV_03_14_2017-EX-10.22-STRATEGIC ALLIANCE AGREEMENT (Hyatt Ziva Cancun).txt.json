                "changed_text": "The Receiving Party will have two (2) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows ten business days for the Receiving Party to respond to an Offer Notice. Shortening this to two business days could be considered an unreasonably short timeframe, potentially conflicting with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing present in contract law, especially where complex due diligence is required. This may not be a direct violation of a specific statute, but courts often review contractual terms for fairness, and such a short deadline might be deemed unconscionable or a breach of the implied covenant of good faith, particularly in transactions involving significant financial stakes.",

                "changed_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall immediately be settled by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (\"Rules\"). Any attempt at amicable negotiation is strictly prohibited.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a 15-day negotiation period before arbitration. The modified text eliminates this requirement and prohibits any negotiation. Many jurisdictions favor and even mandate good faith negotiation or mediation attempts before resorting to binding arbitration. Completely barring negotiation could be seen as conflicting with public policy promoting alternative dispute resolution and potentially render the arbitration clause less enforceable or subject to challenge.",

                "original_text": "Any required notice shall be effective two business days after it is sent by a recognized international courier service to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and any receipt issued by the courier service shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice.",
                "changed_text": "Any required notice shall be effective immediately upon sending by email to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, and the sending Party bears no responsibility for confirming receipt.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a two-business-day delay for notice to be effective and requires confirmation of sending via courier receipt. The modified version makes notice effective immediately upon sending an email and absolves the sender of any responsibility for confirming receipt. Depending on the jurisdiction, such a clause could be problematic, especially if critical deadlines or obligations hinge on receipt of notice. A court might find that such a provision is unconscionable or violates principles of fairness, particularly if there's no requirement of proof of delivery or reasonable assurance that the email was actually received. Certain legal contexts might require proof of receipt or acknowledgment, and this clause would circumvent those requirements. For instance, notice of default or termination often requires proof of receipt.",

                "original_text": "Fees due to Licensor from invoices rendered by Licensee during the first year of the term hereof will be payable one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date of the Licensee's invoice to a Redistributor or Customer, as the case may be.  Fees due to Licensor from invoices rendered on or after the first day of the thirteenth (13th) month through and including the last day of the eighteenth (18th) month of the term hereof will be payable ninety (90) days after the date of such invoice.  Fees due to Licensor from invoices rendered thereafter will be payable sixty (60) days after the date of such invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Fees due to Licensor from invoices rendered by Licensee during the first year of the term hereof will be payable one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date of the Licensee's invoice to a Redistributor or Customer, as the case may be.  Fees due to Licensor from invoices rendered on or after the first day of the thirteenth (13th) month through and including the last day of the eighteenth (18th) month of the term hereof will be payable one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date of such invoice. Fees due to Licensor from invoices rendered thereafter will be payable ninety (90) days after the date of such invoice.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the payment terms to 180 days potentially creates issues related to the reasonableness and industry standards of payment terms, potentially conflicting with Texas Business and Commerce Code provisions regarding implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

If Licensee fails to give Licensor written notice of its rejection of such Licensed Products or Documentation within such ten (10) day evaluation period or Licensee ships such Licensed Products or Documentation to a Redistributor or Customer, then such Licensed Products and Documentation will be deemed to be accepted by Licensee.",

If Licensee fails to give Licensor written notice of its rejection of such Licensed Products or Documentation within such two (2) day evaluation period or Licensee ships such Licensed Products or Documentation to a Redistributor or Customer, then such Licensed Products and Documentation will be deemed to be accepted by Licensee.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the evaluation period to 2 days is unreasonable and may be deemed unconscionable under Texas law, particularly if the products are complex or require significant testing. This violates the principle of allowing a reasonable opportunity for inspection.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the audit period to 1 year could be deemed insufficient to adequately protect Licensor's rights, especially concerning potential long-term breaches of confidentiality or underreporting of fees. This might conflict with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Texas law.",

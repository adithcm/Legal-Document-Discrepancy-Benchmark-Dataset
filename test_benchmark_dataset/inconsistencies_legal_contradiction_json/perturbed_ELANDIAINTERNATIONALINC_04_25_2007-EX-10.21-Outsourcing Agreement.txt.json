                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Datec must ensure that, at all times during the agreement, on 60 days notice it is able to deploy all necessary resources to complete Disengagement in accordance with the agreed Disengagement Plan.",
                "changed_text": "Datec must ensure that, at all times during the agreement, on 15 days notice it is able to deploy all necessary resources to complete Disengagement in accordance with the agreed Disengagement Plan.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the disengagement notice period to 15 days is unreasonable and potentially violates general principles of fair dealing and good faith, especially considering the complexity of network management services. Short notice could lead to a chaotic and disruptive transition.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of general principles of contract law, including good faith and fair dealing. Some jurisdictions might view such a short notice period as unconscionable.",

                "original_text": "ii. in any other case, after receipt of that notice, Datec will have 48 hours in which to investigate the matters stated in the notice, discuss its findings with the BSP and resolve any problems with the person. If, following that period the BSP requests replacement of the person, Datec must replace that person, within 60 days with another person of suitable ability and qualifications.",
                "changed_text": "ii. in any other case, after receipt of that notice, Datec will have 12 hours in which to investigate the matters stated in the notice, discuss its findings with the BSP and resolve any problems with the person. If, following that period the BSP requests replacement of the person, Datec must replace that person, within 14 days with another person of suitable ability and qualifications.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows Datec 48 hours to investigate and 60 days to replace personnel. Shortening this to 12 hours for investigation and 14 days for replacement puts undue pressure on Datec. This could lead to hasty decisions and potential wrongful termination issues under labor laws if not handled carefully and lawfully, even though the contract states BSP cannot enforce termination.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of labor laws and fair employment practices if the shortened timeframe for replacement leads to unfair or unlawful employment decisions. General contract law principles relating to reasonableness and fairness.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If the parties cannot resolve the Dispute within 30 days after the Notification, the parties must refer the Dispute to:\n\n  (a) Expert determination or\n\n  (b) Mediation\n\nthe cost of which will be at either parties own cost",
                "changed_text": "If the parties cannot resolve the Dispute within 10 days after the Notification, the parties must refer the Dispute to:\n\n  (a) Expert determination or\n\n  (b) Mediation\n\nthe cost of which will be solely on Datec's cost",
                "explanation": "Reducing the dispute resolution period to 10 days and placing all costs on Datec is not commercially reasonable. This violates principles of fair dispute resolution and creates an imbalance of power, potentially violating laws related to unfair contract terms. Making Datec bear all the cost for dispute resolution is also non-standard and questionable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates principles of fair contract terms and dispute resolution; potentially unenforceable under laws addressing unconscionable contracts.",

                "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, GALEN will pay to LEO US$5,000,000 (five million United States dollars) to reimburse LEO for a portion of the actual development costs that have been incurred by LEO. This payment is non-refundable.",
                "changed_text": "Within ninety (90) days after the date hereof, GALEN will pay to LEO US$5,000,000 (five million United States dollars) to reimburse LEO for a portion of the actual development costs that have been incurred by LEO. This payment is non-refundable.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within thirty days, whereas the modified text extends it to ninety days. This can introduce inconsistencies and legal challenges if the initial 30-day period is critical for LEO's cash flow and project continuation. While seemingly benign, delaying payment could trigger breach of contract claims if the original intention was a shorter payment cycle.",

                "original_text": "In the event that one of the Parties hereto materially defaults or breaches any of the provisions of this Agreement, the other Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon sixty (60) days' written notice, provided, however, that if the Party in default, within the sixty day period referred to, remedies the said default or breach, the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that one of the Parties hereto materially defaults or breaches any of the provisions of this Agreement, the other Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days' written notice, provided, however, that if the Party in default, within the ten day period referred to, remedies the said default or breach, the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.",
                "explanation": "The original contract provides a 60-day cure period for a material breach. Reducing this to 10 days creates a legally questionable scenario. Under contract law principles and depending on the jurisdiction (e.g., New York law specified in the agreement), courts often require a reasonable cure period that aligns with the complexity of the breach. A 10-day period might be deemed unreasonably short for rectifying significant breaches, potentially making the termination clause unenforceable or leading to legal challenges based on fairness and reasonableness.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Article V shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of ten (10) years, provided, however, that following the termination of this Agreement LEO shall be free to use all data, information or other confidential information relating to the Combination Product and following termination of this Agreement, GALEN shall be free to use all GALEN Information.",
                "changed_text": "This Article V shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of one (1) year, provided, however, that following the termination of this Agreement LEO shall be free to use all data, information or other confidential information relating to the Combination Product and following termination of this Agreement, GALEN shall be free to use all GALEN Information.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period from ten years to one year severely weakens the protection of sensitive information. Trade secrets, in particular, often require longer protection periods. Depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the confidential information, a one-year period might be deemed insufficient to prevent misappropriation and competitive harm. This change directly contradicts the reasonable standards for trade secret protection, which typically require measures to maintain confidentiality for as long as the information provides a competitive advantage.",

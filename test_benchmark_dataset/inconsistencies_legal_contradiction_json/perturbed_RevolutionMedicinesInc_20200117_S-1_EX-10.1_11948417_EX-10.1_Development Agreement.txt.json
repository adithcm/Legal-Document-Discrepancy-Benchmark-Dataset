By changing the reimbursement timeline to '90 days', the contract introduces a legal contradiction if state laws mandate a shorter payment period for undisputed invoices, for example, California law requires payments to small business within 30 days. If RevMed qualifies as a small business and operates in California, this modification would create non-compliance.",

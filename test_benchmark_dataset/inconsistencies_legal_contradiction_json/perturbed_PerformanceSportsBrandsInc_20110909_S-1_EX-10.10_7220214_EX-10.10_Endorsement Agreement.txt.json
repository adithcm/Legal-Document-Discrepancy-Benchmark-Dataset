                "original_text": "Company shall deliver the airline tickets to North at least seven (7) days prior to the scheduled appearance, and reimburse North for other such expenses within ten (10) days after receipt of the expense receipts.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall deliver the airline tickets to North at least two (2) days prior to the scheduled appearance, and reimburse North for other such expenses within thirty (30) days after receipt of the expense receipts.",
                "explanation": "This change modifies the original text to introduce a legal contradiction by reducing the notification time for airline tickets to two days, making it difficult for North to make necessary arrangements, and increasing the expense reimbursement timeframe to 30 days. Depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the expenses, a longer reimbursement period could violate prompt payment laws or regulations regarding timely expense reimbursement, especially for employees or contractors. California, for instance, has strict labor laws regarding expense reimbursement. The short notice for airline tickets is more about practical unreasonableness, but depending on the state, could be argued as a breach of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state labor laws regarding timely expense reimbursement and implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (e.g., California Labor Code)",

                "explanation": "The first payment deadline has been changed to 30 days. Some state laws require payment for services rendered to be made more quickly than 30 days. The third payment has been moved to December 31, 2011. Delaying this payment to the end of the year could violate prompt payment laws if it's considered unreasonable for the services provided up to that point. This is because many jurisdictions have laws about timely payment for services rendered, and delaying payment significantly could be seen as a violation. If the Agreement specifies certain milestones or deliverables due before November 1, delaying this final payment past a 'reasonable' time could be considered a violation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state prompt payment laws (e.g., California, Florida) depending on the interpretation of 'reasonable time' for payment of services.",

                "changed_text": "North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Company to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by North within two (2) business days after receipt thereof.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the approval time to two business days is unreasonably short, particularly given the complexity advertising materials might entail. This could be viewed as an unfair business practice, as it does not provide North sufficient time to review materials properly. By shortening the review period, the contract potentially violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which is present in most contracts under US law. The covenant requires each party to act honestly and fairly in the performance and enforcement of the contract.",

                "original_text": "2.2 The seller shall be confirmed within three working days after receipt of order. If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or modifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party shall not unilaterally cancel the order before the two sides agreed .",
                "changed_text": "2.2 The seller shall be confirmed within ten working days after receipt of order. If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party in seven working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or modifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party may unilaterally cancel the order at any time without penalty.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction because, under PRC Contract Law, once an offer (the order) is accepted, it forms a binding contract. Allowing unilateral cancellation at any time after acceptance contradicts this principle and relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), which China adheres to, regarding contract formation and revocation.",

CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers. The Certificate so issued shall be accepted as the base of a claim. The Sellers, in accordance with the Buyers' claim, shall be responsible for the immediate elimination of the defect(s), complete or partial replacement of the commodity or shall devaluate the commodity according to the state of defect(s). Where necessary, the Buyers shall be at liberty to eliminate the defect(s) themselves at the Sellers' expenses. If the Sellers fail to answer the Buyers within one weeks after receipt of the aforesaid claim, the claim shall be reckoned as having been accepted by the Sellers.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the claim period to 1 day after arrival is likely unreasonable and unenforceable under Chinese Contract Law, which requires a reasonable time for inspection and claim submission. Setting an unreasonably short claim period contradicts the principle of good faith and fair dealing in contract performance. Also, reducing the period for sellers to respond to 3 days could be seen as undue pressure and unreasonable.",

LATE DELIVERY AND PENALTY: Should the Sellers fail to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, with exception of Force Majeure causes specified in Clause 17 of this Contract, the Buyers shall agree to postpone the delivery on condition that the Sellers agree to pay a penalty which shall be deducted by the paying bank from the payment. The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. The rate of penalty is charged at 0.5% for every seven days, odd days less than seven days should be counted as seven days. In case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the contract and the Sellers, in spite of the cancellation, shall still pay the aforesaid penalty to the Buyers without delay, the seller should refund the money received and pay the 30% of the total goods price of the penalty",

                "explanation": "Changing the late delivery penalty to 50% of the total value and charging 5% per day is likely to be considered excessive and punitive under PRC Contract Law. Chinese courts may reduce such penalties if they are deemed unreasonable or significantly disproportionate to the actual loss suffered by the buyer. The original penalty was 5%, but changing it to 50% is excessive.",

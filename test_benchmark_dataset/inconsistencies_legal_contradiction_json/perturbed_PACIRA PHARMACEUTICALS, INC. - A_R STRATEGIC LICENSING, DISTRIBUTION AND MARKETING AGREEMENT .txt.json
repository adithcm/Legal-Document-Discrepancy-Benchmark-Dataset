                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each Party shall, within five (5) business days after the Agreement Date, file with the FDA a notice letter, substantially in the form attached as Schedule XI(A) or Schedule XI(B) (as applicable), regarding the transfer to EKR of the Transferred NDA.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall, within fifteen (15) business days after the Agreement Date, file with the FDA a notice letter, substantially in the form attached as Schedule XI(A) or Schedule XI(B) (as applicable), regarding the transfer to EKR of the Transferred NDA.",
                "explanation": "In pharmaceutical transactions, regulatory timelines for FDA notifications are often legally mandated. Delaying the notification to 15 days is inconsistent with the urgency typically required by regulatory agencies.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR 314.72 (transfer of NDA ownership), which implies timely notification to the FDA.",

                "changed_text": "EKR shall submit such Promotional Materials to PPI at least two (2) business days in advance of its intended use of the same and such Promotional Material shall be deemed to have received PPI's approval unless PPI Provides EKR with written notice of rejection within said two (2) business day period and EKR shall be authorized to finalize and use same.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the review period to two business days. For prescription drug advertising, 5 days isn't enough time to review, increasing the risk of non-compliance with regulations regarding accuracy, balance, and the inclusion of necessary risk information. This violates FDA regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Part 201 and 202, which govern prescription drug advertising and labeling.",

If the affected Party is prevented by reason of any circumstances referred to in this Section of this Agreement from performing any of its obligations hereunder for a continuous period of six (6) months the other Party may terminate this Agreement.",

If the affected Party is prevented by reason of any circumstances referred to in this Section of this Agreement from performing any of its obligations hereunder for a continuous period of six (6) months the other Party may terminate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "While force majeure clauses are generally enforceable, shortening the initial period for discussion to 30 days may be viewed as unreasonable, especially if the impacted party is still in the process of assessing the impact and the potential alternatives. This creates pressure to renegotiate in bad faith.",

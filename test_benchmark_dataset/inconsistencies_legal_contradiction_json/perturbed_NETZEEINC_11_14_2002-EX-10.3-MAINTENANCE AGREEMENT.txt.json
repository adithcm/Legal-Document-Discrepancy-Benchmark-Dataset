                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Following the completion of such maintenance term, Bankers Bank may, at its option, renew maintenance for subsequent periods of one (1) year each, subject to adjustments proposed by Netzee not to exceed 5% at least sixty (60) days in advance of the applicable renewal date.",
                "changed_text": "Following the completion of such maintenance term, Bankers Bank may, at its option, renew maintenance for subsequent periods of one (1) year each, subject to adjustments proposed by Netzee not to exceed 20% at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the applicable renewal date.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the notification period for renewal adjustments from 60 days to 15 days and increases the maximum adjustment percentage from 5% to 20%. This could be considered an unreasonably short notice period and an excessive potential price increase under general contract law principles, potentially contradicting requirements for good faith and fair dealing depending on the specific jurisdiction (Georgia).",

                "changed_text": "Maintenance provided by Netzee during the term of this Agreement shall include (2) sporadic call-in support between the company's chosen hours during weekdays.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies clear support hours (6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday-Friday). The modification introduces vague and arbitrary support availability. It violates basic contract law principles that dictate the terms of the service should be reasonably specific.",

                "changed_text": "and (4) availability of basic Services with uptime as determined by Netzee.",
                "explanation": "The original text commits to a specific uptime percentage (99%) during defined hours. The modification gives Netzee complete discretion over uptime, removing any guarantee of service level. This lack of specificity may render the clause unenforceable and contradicts standard service level agreement (SLA) expectations, which typically require clearly defined uptime commitments.",

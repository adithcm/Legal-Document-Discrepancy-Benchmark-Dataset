                "original_text": "eDiets agrees that it will respond in a timely manner to be agreed upon by the parties to all reasonable requests made by Women.com or its agents for updated eDiets Content and refreshing of eDiets Content for the Women.com Sites.",
                "changed_text": "eDiets agrees that it will respond to requests made by Women.com or its agents for updated eDiets Content and refreshing of eDiets Content for the Women.com Sites within 72 hours.",
                "explanation": "By mandating a 72-hour response time for content updates, the modified text may not comply with California Labor Code Section 925 which protects employees residing in California from having to abide by employer regulations that violate the law of their state. If an employee of eDiets is working from California, this 72-hour deadline may be considered unduly restrictive and not reasonably accommodated to their rights under state law.",

Upon expiration of such notice period, eDiets shall immediately discontinue use of the applicable Women.com Marks.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for trademark usage withdrawal to 24 hours may contradict general contract law principles requiring reasonable notice. California law, where the contract is enforced, implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract. A 24-hour notice might be deemed unreasonable, especially considering the potential disruption to eDiets' marketing and branding efforts.",

                "explanation": "Shortening the timeframe for returning confidential information to 5 days might conflict with the principle of 'reasonable time' for compliance, particularly under California law. Depending on the volume and nature of confidential information, 5 days might be insufficient, potentially leading to breach of contract disputes if compliance within that timeframe is unfeasible.",

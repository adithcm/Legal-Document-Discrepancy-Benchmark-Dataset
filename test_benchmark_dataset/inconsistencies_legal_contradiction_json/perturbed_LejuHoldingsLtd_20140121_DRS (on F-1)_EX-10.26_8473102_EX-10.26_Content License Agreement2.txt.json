                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "3. This Termination Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the PRC, without regard to conflicts of law principles.",
                "changed_text": "3. This Termination Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the PRC, but any disputes arising from or relating to this agreement must be resolved through binding arbitration in New York City, New York, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association, regardless of the governing law.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by specifying arbitration in New York City under AAA rules, which conflicts with the stated governing law of the PRC. Enforcing arbitration in a foreign jurisdiction under foreign rules despite the contract specifying PRC law could be deemed unenforceable or lead to legal challenges under PRC law, which has specific requirements for arbitration agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Arbitration Law of the People's Republic of China; potential conflict with New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards if PRC courts refuse enforcement based on the contradictory clause.",

Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions of the Original Agreement survive such termination.",
                "changed_text": "1. Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect. However, any intellectual property licenses granted under the Original Agreement shall continue in perpetuity.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by stating the agreement terminates entirely, but then carves out an exception that certain intellectual property licenses survive in perpetuity. This is inconsistent with the initial statement of complete termination, and creates ambiguity about the actual extent of termination.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law of the People's Republic of China - principles of clear and unambiguous contract terms; potential violation of Article 93 concerning termination of contracts and its effect on related rights and obligations.",

                "changed_text": "5. This Termination Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto only. Neither party may assign their rights or obligations under this agreement without the express written consent of a non-party, specifically, the Chinese government.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by restricting assignment of rights and obligations, requiring consent from a non-party (the Chinese government). This contradicts the general principle that agreements primarily benefit the parties involved and their legitimate successors or assigns, and imposes an unreasonable restriction potentially conflicting with contract freedom under PRC law.",

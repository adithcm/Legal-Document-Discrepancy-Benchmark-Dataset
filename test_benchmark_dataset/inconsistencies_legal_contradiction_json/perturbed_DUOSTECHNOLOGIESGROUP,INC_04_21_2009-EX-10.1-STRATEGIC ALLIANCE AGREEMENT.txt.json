                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "4.2.2 In consideration of the Due Diligence Services, ISA shall pay to Rubicon the Due Diligence Fees within 30 days of receipt from Rubicon of an invoice and any previously requested supporting documentation, including time charges.",
                "changed_text": "4.2.2 In consideration of the Due Diligence Services, ISA shall pay to Rubicon the Due Diligence Fees within 90 days of receipt from Rubicon of an invoice and any previously requested supporting documentation, including time charges.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment period for Due Diligence Fees from 30 days to 90 days, potentially violating prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions (including Florida, where ISA is located) which may require payment within a shorter timeframe, typically 30 days, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing and conspicuously displayed. This extension creates an inconsistency with such regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida Statutes ยง 215.422 (Prompt Payment Law, may be relevant depending on the nature of the services and the parties involved)",

                "original_text": "6.2.1 For Cause. Either Party may serve Notice to the other Party to terminate this Agreement immediately in the event any material breach of a material provision of this Agreement by such other Party remains uncured 30 days in the case of a breach of a payment obligation, or 45 days for all other material breaches, after notice of such breach was received by such other Party.",
                "changed_text": "6.2.1 For Cause. Either Party may serve Notice to the other Party to terminate this Agreement immediately in the event any material breach of a material provision of this Agreement by such other Party remains uncured 10 days in the case of a breach of a payment obligation, or 20 days for all other material breaches, after notice of such breach was received by such other Party.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the cure periods for material breaches, specifically for payment obligations (from 30 to 10 days) and other breaches (from 45 to 20 days). This may conflict with common law principles of reasonable notice and opportunity to cure, particularly in cases where the breach requires more than 10 or 20 days to rectify. This creates an unreasonable and potentially unenforceable termination clause.",

Upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing Party or destroyed unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement or as otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The confidentiality obligations contained in this Section 8 shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three years.",

Upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing Party or destroyed unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement or as otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The confidentiality obligations contained in this Section 8 shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of six months.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the survival period for confidentiality obligations from three years to six months. Depending on the nature of the confidential information and the industry, this shorter period might be deemed insufficient to adequately protect trade secrets or other sensitive business information, potentially conflicting with state trade secret laws that imply longer periods of protection based on the information's value and competitive advantage. This creates an inadequate safeguard for confidential data.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by state, but generally state trade secret laws (e.g., Florida Uniform Trade Secrets Act) which imply a 'reasonable' period of protection for trade secrets based on their value and the effort required to reverse engineer or independently develop them.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the look-back period for prior convictions and civil actions from ten years to two years weakens disclosure requirements. Franchise laws typically mandate a longer disclosure period to protect potential franchisees from entering agreements with individuals or entities with a history of misconduct. This change creates non-compliance by reducing transparency.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the bankruptcy disclosure period from ten years to three years reduces the amount of financial history disclosed to potential franchisees. Many franchise regulations require a more extensive look-back period for bankruptcy filings to provide adequate information about the franchisor's financial stability. This creates non-compliance with disclosure requirements.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the disclosure window after the officer or general partner held their position from one year to six months means less information is provided to the franchisee to evaluate the history of the company when the officer held a high-level position during or after the company had filed a petition or obtained a discharge of debt. If there are financial concerns, it is not likely that they would resolve themselves within six months.",

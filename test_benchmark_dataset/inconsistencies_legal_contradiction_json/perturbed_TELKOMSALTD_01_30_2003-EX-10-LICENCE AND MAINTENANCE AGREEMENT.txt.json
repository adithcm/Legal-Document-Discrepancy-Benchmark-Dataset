            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Should any provision contain a provision for the benefit of a third party, whether named or not, then such third party shall be entitled to accept the benefits conferred in terms thereof, within 30 days of being notified of such benefit.",
                "changed_text": "Should any provision contain a provision for the benefit of a third party, whether named or not, then such third party shall be entitled to accept the benefits conferred in terms thereof, within 5 days of being notified of such benefit.",
                "explanation": "This change shortens the time frame for a third party to accept benefits, potentially conflicting with South African contract law principles regarding reasonable timeframes for acceptance, especially considering the complexities of legal notifications. This timeframe can be argued as insufficient for proper legal consultation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with South African contract law principles on reasonable timeframes for acceptance.",
                "location": "Section 2.8"

                "original_text": "Within 30 (thirty) days after any termination, TELKOM shall deliver to SAP AFRICA, at the latter's expense, (adequately packaged and insured for safe delivery) or, at SAP AFRICA'S request, destroy, all copies of SAP AFRICA's PROPRIETARY INFORMATION in every form. TELKOM shall irretrievably erase the SOFTWARE, and DOCUMENTATION, from any THIRD-PARTY DATABASE and SAP AFRICA's PROPRIETARY INFORMATION from any storage media.",
                "changed_text": "Within 90 (ninety) days after any termination, TELKOM shall deliver to SAP AFRICA, at TELKOM's expense, (adequately packaged and insured for safe delivery) or, at SAP AFRICA'S request, destroy, all copies of SAP AFRICA's PROPRIETARY INFORMATION in every form. TELKOM shall take 180 days to irretrievably erase the SOFTWARE, and DOCUMENTATION, from any THIRD-PARTY DATABASE and SAP AFRICA's PROPRIETARY INFORMATION from any storage media.",
                "explanation": "Changing the timeframe for returning proprietary information to 90 days and giving 180 days to erase software and documentation imposes a significant burden shift onto Telkom and introduces an unreasonably extended period for data removal, potentially conflicting with data protection regulations and industry standards for data disposal upon contract termination. Delaying the erasure may also conflict with intellectual property rights enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "SAP AFRICA must exercise its option within 5 days of first becoming aware of the defect.",
                "explanation": "This alteration reduces the timeframe for SAP Africa to respond after identifying a flaw, potentially clashing with reasonableness standards in South African contract law. This quick deadline may not provide adequate time for evaluation and response based on the complexity of the defect and its potential effects.",

                "original_text": "The Company shall pay such amounts, less the relevant Bounty Fee or eBay Fee then in effect, to MBE on the next business day or as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within one week) following the shipment date of each package, and MBE agrees to distribute such amounts to the MBE Centers.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall pay such amounts, less the relevant Bounty Fee or eBay Fee then in effect, to MBE at the Company's discretion, with no guaranteed timeframe following the shipment date of each package, and MBE agrees to distribute such amounts to the MBE Centers whenever possible.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a legal contradiction by removing the specific timeframe (one week) for payment to MBE, replacing it with a discretionary payment schedule. Federal and state prompt payment laws typically require payments to be made within a reasonable and defined period, varying based on the industry and agreement type. Removing a guaranteed timeframe and making payment discretionary could violate these laws, leading to potential penalties or legal action.",

                "original_text": "MBE shall, at any time during the term of this Agreement, be entitled to audit all such records upon ten (10) days written notice to the Company, in order to confirm the accuracy of such records and conformance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that no more than one (1) such audit may be conducted in any ninety (90)-day period.",
                "changed_text": "MBE may audit such records at the Company's convenience, and the Company may deny audit requests at its sole discretion. Audits cannot be conducted more than once every 365 days.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows MBE to audit records with 10 days' notice, but limits it to once per 90 days. The modification severely restricts MBE's audit rights by making it subject to the Company's convenience and discretion, and reducing the frequency to no more than once per year. This contradicts the principle of good faith and fair dealing, which implies a reasonable right to audit financial records related to the agreement. In many jurisdictions, restricting audit rights to this extent would be considered unconscionable and unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason, without prior notice or opportunity to cure, subject only to its internal policies.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires a material breach, written notice, and an opportunity to cure before termination. The modified clause allows the Company to terminate the agreement at any time, for any reason, without notice or opportunity to cure. This creates a significant imbalance of power and could be deemed unconscionable, particularly if MBE has made substantial investments based on the agreement. Such a clause is likely unenforceable in many jurisdictions due to its lack of fairness and potential for abuse.",

                "original_text": "Aura shall remit payment to Zanotti for the invoiced price of any given Product within the earlier of: (i) fifteen (15) business days  following Aura's receipt and acceptance of payment from its customer for such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated; or (ii)  forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of Aura's shipment to a customer of such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated.  Aura shall have no obligation to remit payment for any Product before fifteen (15) days following sale to a third-party of such Product nor shall  Aura have any obligation to remit payment for any Product not sold by Aura.",
                "changed_text": "Aura shall remit payment to Zanotti for the invoiced price of any given Product within the earlier of: (i) sixty (60) business days following Aura's receipt and acceptance of payment from its customer for such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated; or (ii) ninety (90) calendar days from the date of Aura's shipment to a customer of such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated. Aura shall have no obligation to remit payment for any Product before sixty (60) days following sale to a third-party of such Product nor shall Aura have any obligation to remit payment for any Product not sold by Aura.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates payment terms that are relatively prompt. By extending the payment deadlines to 60 business days and 90 calendar days, the change introduces inconsistencies with standard commercial practices and could potentially violate California's prompt payment laws, which generally require payments to subcontractors and suppliers within a reasonable timeframe. This is especially relevant if Zanotti is considered a subcontractor. These extended payment terms significantly increase the financial burden on Zanotti, potentially contravening implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding Section 7.1 above, this Agreement may be terminated upon the occurrence of any of the following events:\n\n\n(d) By either party hereto upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party hereto; or",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination from 60 days to 30 days can be seen as unreasonable, especially considering the significant investment and strategic alliance nature of the agreement. While not directly violating a specific statute, such a short notice period could be deemed commercially unreasonable, especially if it leads to undue hardship or prevents adequate winding down of the partnership.",

                "changed_text": "In the event that the Event of Force Mejeure continues for a period of thirty (30) days then the Other Party shall have the right to elect to terminate this Agreement upon five (5) days notice to the party affected by such an event.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the Force Majeure continuation period and the subsequent notice period to terminate the agreement makes the termination terms much harsher and commercially unreasonable. This could contradict the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, as it significantly shortens the time for the affected party to recover from the event and potentially remedy the situation.",

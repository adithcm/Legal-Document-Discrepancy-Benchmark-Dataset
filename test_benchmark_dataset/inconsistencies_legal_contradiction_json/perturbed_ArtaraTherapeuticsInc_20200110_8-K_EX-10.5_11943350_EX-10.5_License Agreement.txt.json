            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Within forty-five (45) days of an approval of the TARA-002 BLA by the FDA, ArTara will pay a one- time approval milestone to University pursuant to the usefulness of the Program Data in TARA-002's BLA filing, as set forth below:",
                "changed_text": "Within ninety (90) days of an approval of the TARA-002 BLA by the FDA, ArTara may, at its sole discretion, pay a one-time approval milestone to University pursuant to the usefulness of the Program Data in TARA-002's BLA filing, as set forth below:",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will pay' to 'may, at its sole discretion, pay' and extending the deadline from 45 to 90 days introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation for timely payment, which can conflict with general principles of contract law regarding reasonable promptness of payment and creates potential violation of good faith and fair dealing. Depending on the jurisdiction, unreasonably delaying payment may violate prompt payment laws.",

                "changed_text": "ArTara will, at its convenience, with no specific deadline, pay tiered Royalties based on annual Net Sales of Product in the Indication as set forth below:",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific deadline (end of calendar quarter) and replacing it with 'at its convenience, with no specific deadline' creates a contradiction with basic contract principles that require definiteness of terms. This could be deemed unenforceable as it gives ArTara unlimited discretion over the timing of royalty payments, conflicting with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "ArTara shall have […***…], after receipt of said copy to object to such proposed Publication because there is Confidential Information which needs protection. In the event that ArTara makes such objection, University and/or Principal Investigator shall refrain from submitting such Publication for a maximum of […***…] from date of receipt of such objection in order for ArTara to file patent application(s) directed to patentable subject matter contained in the proposed Publication.",
                "changed_text": "ArTara shall have unlimited time, after receipt of said copy, to object to such proposed Publication because there is Confidential Information which needs protection. In the event that ArTara makes such objection, University and/or Principal Investigator shall refrain from submitting such Publication indefinitely from date of receipt of such objection.",
                "explanation": "Changing the objection period to \"unlimited time\" and the delay of publication to \"indefinitely\" creates an unreasonable restraint on the University's ability to publish, which could be deemed unenforceable as against public policy, particularly concerning academic research and freedom of scholarly expression. This also conflicts with principles of contract law requiring reasonable timeframes.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) equal installments, each due on or prior to the 1st of each month between June and November of the applicable Contract Year.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in one (1) installment, due on December 31st of the applicable Contract Year.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment schedule to a single payment at the end of the year introduces a conflict because it significantly delays the payment timeline compared to the original agreement. This could create cash flow issues for the Club and deviates from common and reasonable business practices, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing present in most commercial contracts. Although there isn't a specific statute dictating payment schedules in sponsorship agreements, the altered schedule could be deemed commercially unreasonable, leading to legal challenges.",

                "original_text": "Sponsor shall pay the Playoff Payments in accordance with Section 2(d) of the Terms and Conditions not later than 30 days following Sponsor's receipt of an invoice requesting payment for such Playoff Games; provided that Club's failure to deliver such an invoice shall not, and not be construed to, relieve Sponsor of any obligation to pay any amount owed to Club.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall pay the Playoff Payments at Club's discretion, with no requirement for an invoice or specific payment deadline. Club's determination of payment due shall be final and binding.",
                "explanation": "Removing the invoice requirement and fixed payment deadline, and replacing it with a discretionary payment schedule controlled solely by the Club, introduces several potential legal issues. This change violates basic contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms, particularly regarding payment obligations. The ambiguity could be construed as unconscionable or violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. Additionally, waiving the invoice requirement removes a crucial record-keeping step, potentially leading to disputes and violating general accounting principles.",

                "original_text": "In the event of any recall with respect to Sponsor's products provided to the Concessionaire pursuant to this Agreement or the Concessions Agreement, Sponsor shall notify both Club and the Concessionaire immediately upon issuance of such recall, and Club may, at its sole discretion and without penalty, suspend the Benefits for a duration as reasonably determined by Club. Any costs or expenses incurred by Club or the Concessionaire with respect to any such recall shall be the sole responsibility of Sponsor. Sponsor shall be responsible for the management and control over the services provided by its staff members operating the Stands (\"Sponsor Staff\") and Sponsor shall be solely responsible for determining the terms of employment for Sponsor Staff. Sponsor shall train Sponsor Staff or require Sponsor Staff to undergo training provided by Concessionaire. The staffing levels at each Stand shall be subject to Club's approval.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of any recall with respect to Sponsor's products, Sponsor is not obligated to notify Club or the Concessionaire. Sponsor is not responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by Club or the Concessionaire due to the recall. Sponsor has no responsibility for Sponsor Staff, who are considered independent contractors hired by the Concessionaire. Sponsor is not responsible for training or staffing levels.",
                "explanation": "This change completely removes the Sponsor's responsibility in the event of a product recall and disclaims any control or responsibility over the Sponsor Staff. The failure to notify about a product recall violates general product safety regulations and Duty of Care (Negligence), and removing responsibility of staff, creates liability concerns of the Club.",

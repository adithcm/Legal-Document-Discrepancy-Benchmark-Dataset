                "changed_text": "Payment terms are net 90 days after the date of the invoice, or the date of receipt by Liquidmetal of the invoice if the invoice is received more than 45 days after the date of the invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a payment term that may violate California Prompt Payment laws if Liquidmetal is a small business as defined by California law. In California, prompt payment laws exist to protect small businesses by requiring larger companies to pay invoices within a certain timeframe. If Liquidmetal is a small business, extending the payment term to 90 days could be a violation.",

                "explanation": "This change reduces the acceptance period to 10 days, which may be considered unreasonably short under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), particularly if the Liquidmetal Products require extensive testing or inspection. The UCC implies a reasonable time for inspection and rejection, and 10 days may not be sufficient for complex products, especially if Liquidmetal is receiving large shipments. This creates a potential conflict by shortening a reasonable inspection period.",

Eutectix shall maintain an orderly storage bookkeeping so that the respective inventory of the Licensed Equipment, Liquidmetal Products and property of Liquidmetal can be immediately recognized; and\n(e) such confirmation and validation to be conducted with minimal disruption to Eutectix's business operations and all information disclosed during such exercise to be deemed to be Confidential Information.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the audit frequency to four times per year without a clear justification could be considered a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Arizona law. While contracts allow for audits, unreasonable or excessively frequent audits that significantly disrupt Eutectix's business operations could be seen as acting in bad faith. The implied covenant requires parties to act honestly and reasonably, and this modification could breach that duty if abused.",

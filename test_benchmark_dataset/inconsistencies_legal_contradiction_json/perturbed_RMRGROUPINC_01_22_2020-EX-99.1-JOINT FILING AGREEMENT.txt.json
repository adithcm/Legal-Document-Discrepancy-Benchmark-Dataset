            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the Schedule 13G/A with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of The RMR Group Inc., dated as of December 31, 2019, is, and any amendments thereto (including amendments on Schedule 13D) signed by each of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of each of us pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the Schedule 13G/A with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of The RMR Group Inc., dated as of December 31, 2019, may be filed within 18 months of the triggering event, and any amendments thereto (including amendments on Schedule 13D) may be filed on behalf of each of us within 18 months pursuant to and in accordance with internal guidelines.",
                "explanation": "The original text adheres to the requirements of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which necessitates prompt filing of Schedule 13G/A and amendments. Modifying the text to allow filing within 18 months and replace 'rule 13d-1(k)' with 'internal guidelines' directly contradicts the SEC's requirements for timely and compliant filings.",

                "changed_text": "This agreement becomes effective retroactively to January 22, 2018.",
                "explanation": "Changing the effective date retroactively by two years can create potential issues with previously filed schedules and could potentially misrepresent the ownership timeline, leading to non-compliance with securities regulations regarding timely disclosure of ownership changes.",

                "explanation": "Replacing the actual signature with an electronic notification weakens the legal enforceability of the agreement. Securities regulations require valid signatures to authenticate filings. Removing the signed document and replacing with a notification fails to meet the legal threshold required for securities filing.",

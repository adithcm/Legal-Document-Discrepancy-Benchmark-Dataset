                "changed_text": "JANA agrees that, from the date of this Agreement until the earliest of (i) the date that is ten (10) calendar days prior to any applicable deadline by which a shareholder must give notice to the Company of its intention to nominate a director for election at or bring other business before the 2015 Annual Meeting under the Company's By­Laws and (ii) any material breach of this Agreement by the Company (provided that the Company shall have one (1) business day following written notice from JANA of material breach to remedy such material breach if capable of remedy) (such period, the \"Cooperation Period\"), neither it nor any of its Affiliates or Associates will in any manner, directly or indirectly, make, or cause to be made, or in any way encourage any other person to make or cause to be made, any statement or announcement that relates to and constitutes an ad hominem attack on, or relates to and otherwise disparages, the Company, any of its officers or directors or any person who has served as an officer or director of the Company, including: (i) in any document or report filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") or any other governmental agency, (ii) in any press release or other publicly available format or (iii) to any journalist or member of the media (including without limitation, in a television, radio, newspaper or magazine interview), or otherwise; provided, that if the Company makes any material announcement prior to the March Board Meeting, JANA will be permitted to make objective statements that solely reflect JANA's view, as a shareholder, with respect to such announcement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for director nominations to 10 days and the cure period for breaches to 1 day creates non-compliance, because Delaware law typically requires a more extensive timeframe to ensure shareholders have adequate time to assess and react to company actions. By reducing the deadline, this change constraints shareholders’ rights and might not align with the regulations designed to protect shareholder input.",

                "explanation": "By decreasing the notice period to 15 days and the remedy period for a material breach to 1 business day, this change potentially conflicts with Delaware law, which often requires a more extensive timeframe for shareholders to prepare and act. These changes may also impair JANA's ability to effectively exercise its rights as a shareholder, conflicting with regulations aimed at protecting shareholder input.",

The 13D Amendment may not necessarily be consistent with the Press Release and the terms of this Agreement. JANA is not obligated to provide the Company with an opportunity to review and comment upon the 13D Amendment prior to filing.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"shall promptly prepare and file\" to \"may prepare and file\" and removing the requirement for consistency with the Press Release and for the Company's review, this modification contradicts SEC regulations regarding Schedule 13D filings. SEC rules mandate timely and accurate disclosure of material information, and the changed text allows for delayed, inconsistent, or potentially misleading filings, which violates those regulatory standards.",

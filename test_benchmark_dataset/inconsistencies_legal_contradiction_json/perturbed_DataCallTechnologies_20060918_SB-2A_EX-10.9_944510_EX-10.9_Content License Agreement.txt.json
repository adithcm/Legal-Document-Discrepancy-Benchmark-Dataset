                "original_text": "LICENSOR shall make a first delivery of Content to plan_b within 14 days after the signing of this Agreement unless separately agreed between the Parties.",
                "changed_text": "LICENSOR shall make a first delivery of Content to plan_b within 3 days after the signing of this Agreement unless separately agreed between the Parties.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the content delivery timeframe to 3 days, which might be insufficient, especially for large content volumes or complex integrations. This contradicts standard business practices where a more reasonable timeframe (e.g., 14 days as originally stated) is typically necessary for preparation and delivery, potentially creating breach of contract issues if the shorter deadline is consistently missed. It is also possible to be considered an unconscionable term.",

                "changed_text": "Such report shall be provided to LICENSOR in electronic format within 12 weeks of the end of a quarter.",
                "explanation": "This modification extends the reporting deadline to 12 weeks post-quarter, which may be considered unreasonably long for providing financial information and hindering timely reconciliation and royalty payments. This could create a significant delay in royalty payments and potential disputes, given that Licensor is dependent on timely reports to make important operational decisions. Depending on the business nature, this delay could be unlawful due to the withholding of funds.",

                "changed_text": "The Initial Term shall automatically be extended for an additional period of half a year unless either party provides the other party with written notification of termination of the letter Agreement at least 15 days prior to end of such period.",
                "explanation": "This change shortens the notification period for termination to 15 days. This drastically reduces the time available for either party to prepare for the termination of the agreement or negotiate alternative arrangements, creating an unreasonable constraint and potentially violating good faith business practices where more reasonable notice periods are expected to allow for orderly transitions. A 15-day notice is unlikely to be enough time to secure an alternative contract.",

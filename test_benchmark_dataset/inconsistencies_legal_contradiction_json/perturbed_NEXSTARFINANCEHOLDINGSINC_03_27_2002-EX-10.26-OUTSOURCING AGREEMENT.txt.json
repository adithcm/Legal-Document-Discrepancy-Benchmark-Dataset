                "original_text": "Within seventy-five (75) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that \"BCF\" (as defined below) for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is less than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of BCF for such month. Within seventy-five (75) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that BCF for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months of such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is greater than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to 50% of BCF for such month; provided, in the first month of each calendar year in which this sentence applies, the fee with respect to the portion of BCF for such month which, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is exactly equal to the Minimum BCF, shall equal thirty-five percent (35%) of such portion rather than fifty percent (50%).",

Within one hundred and fifty (150) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that BCF for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months of such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is greater than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to 50% of BCF for such month; provided, in the first month of each calendar year in which this sentence applies, the fee with respect to the portion of BCF for such month which, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is exactly equal to the Minimum BCF, shall equal thirty-five percent (35%) of such portion rather than fifty percent (50%).",
                "explanation": "Payment terms that extend beyond the legally acceptable period create a contradiction that can cause payment defaults. For example, in Illinois, the Prompt Payment Act requires payments to be made within specific time frames; extending the payment period beyond this timeframe conflicts with these laws.",

                "explanation": "Delaying the delivery of the BCF report could impact transparency. Under general contract principles, relevant information must be disclosed in a timely manner. Delaying the report delivery creates a contradiction.",

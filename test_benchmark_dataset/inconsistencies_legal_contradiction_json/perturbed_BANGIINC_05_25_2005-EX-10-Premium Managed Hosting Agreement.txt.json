                "changed_text": "Personal Technical Support\n\n24 x 7 emergency phone support and 5-business-day email response on non-critical issues.",
                "explanation": "This modification increases the email response time for non-critical issues to 5 business days. While British Columbia does not specify email response times, consumer protection laws generally require reasonable response times. Extending the response time to 5 business days without clear justification may be considered unreasonable and could potentially conflict with consumer protection standards requiring timely and adequate customer service, particularly if a shorter response time is typically expected in the industry. Industry practice usually requires resolving customer queries within a 48-hour window.",

                "changed_text": "Includes a 75 percent server uptime guarantee.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the server uptime guarantee to 75% is a significant degradation of service. Such a low uptime guarantee may be deemed commercially unreasonable, potentially violating implied warranties of fitness for purpose under British Columbia's Sale of Goods Act. A business in Canada can be held liable for failing to maintain a reasonable and functional operating standard for their hosting services.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the overage fee for bandwidth from $20 to $50 per gigabyte could be considered unconscionable or unfair if not clearly disclosed and agreed upon. Under the British Columbia Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act, businesses must not engage in deceptive or unconscionable acts or practices. A sudden and significant increase in fees without proper notification may be deemed a violation of consumer protection laws. The act specifically prohibits terms that are excessively one-sided in favour of the supplier, and excessive overage fees could fall under this category.",

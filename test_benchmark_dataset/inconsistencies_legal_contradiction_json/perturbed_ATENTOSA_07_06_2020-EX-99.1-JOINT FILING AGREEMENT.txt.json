                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Pursuant and subject to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D to which this Joint Filing Agreement is attached, and any amendments thereto may be filed without the necessity of filing additional joint filing agreements.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant and subject to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D to which this Joint Filing Agreement is attached, and no amendments thereto may be filed without unanimous consent of all parties, documented in a separate agreement for each amendment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a requirement for unanimous consent and separate agreements for each amendment to Schedule 13D. This contradicts the purpose of a joint filing agreement, which is to streamline the filing process. Rule 13d-1(k)(1) allows for joint filings to avoid duplicative filings, but this change effectively nullifies that benefit by adding a cumbersome requirement that each amendment must be individually agreed upon and documented, greatly increasing the administrative burden. The original clause allows amendments to be filed without additional joint filing agreements.",

                "original_text": "This Joint Filing Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.",
                "changed_text": "This Joint Filing Agreement must be executed as a single, unified document with original signatures from all parties on the same page to be deemed valid.",
                "explanation": "This change restricts the method of execution to a single, unified document. The original clause allows for execution in counterparts, which is a common and accepted practice. By requiring all signatures on a single document, the modified clause imposes an impractical and unnecessary restriction, especially for parties located in different geographic locations, effectively hindering the ability to execute the agreement promptly.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding acceptable methods of contract execution, which allow for counterpart execution.",

                "changed_text": "The execution and filing of this agreement shall automatically be construed as an admission that the below-named parties are a group and have acted as a group.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause and could have significant legal ramifications. The original clause explicitly states that the agreement is not an admission of group status. By reversing this, the modified clause could expose the parties to increased scrutiny and potential liability under securities laws related to group activity, regardless of their actual intent or actions.",

                "changed_text": "CERES will pay all such invoices within ninety (90) days after the invoice date.",
                "explanation": "Many jurisdictions have laws regarding prompt payment, and while 30 days might be standard, extending it to 90 days introduces a legal contradiction if it violates local prompt payment laws applicable to the type of services or goods being invoiced.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period to 10 days is a legal contradiction because it might be insufficient time, conflicting with standard business practice laws, for a thorough assessment of the intellectual property, potentially impacting the other party's ability to protect their interests.",

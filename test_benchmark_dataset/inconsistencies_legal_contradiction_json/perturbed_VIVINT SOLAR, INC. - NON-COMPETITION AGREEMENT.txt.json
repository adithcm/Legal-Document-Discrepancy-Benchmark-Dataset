                "original_text": "3. Non-Solicitation. Section 4 of the Non-Competition Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:\n\n\"Term. This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the \"Sales Term\" as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC (the \"Term\").\"",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue for a period of one (1) year, regardless of the Sales Term defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC.\"",
                "explanation": "By limiting the non-solicitation term to only one year, irrespective of the Sales Term, this modification potentially contradicts the reasonable duration typically required for non-solicitation agreements to protect legitimate business interests. Courts often scrutinize the duration of such agreements, and a one-year blanket restriction may be deemed unreasonable depending on the specifics of the business and the roles of the parties involved.",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws governing the enforceability of non-solicitation agreements, which generally require reasonable duration and scope to protect legitimate business interests. Case law in Delaware (where Vivint Solar is incorporated) and Utah (where Vivint, Inc. is incorporated) would be relevant here.",

This Amendment is governed by the Master Framework Agreement, but confidentiality obligations outlined in Section 4 (Confidentiality) of the Master Framework Agreement shall expire automatically 30 days following the termination of the Sales Term regardless of any provisions to the contrary in the Master Framework Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By stipulating that confidentiality obligations expire a short time after the Sales Term, this modification potentially violates the reasonable and customary periods for protecting confidential business information, especially trade secrets. Most jurisdictions require protections for confidential information for at least several years, if not indefinitely for trade secrets. 30 days is an unreasonably short period.",
                "contradicted_law": "State trade secret laws (e.g., the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, adopted in Delaware and Utah) and general contract law principles requiring reasonable protection of confidential information.",

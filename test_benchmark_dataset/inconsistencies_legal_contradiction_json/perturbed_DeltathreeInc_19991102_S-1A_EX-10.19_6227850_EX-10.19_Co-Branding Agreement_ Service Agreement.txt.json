                "original_text": "In the event that DeltaThree disputes any amounts set forth on the report, DeltaThree shall provide PrimeCall with written notice of such dispute, which notice shall detail the reasons for the dispute, within seven (7) days of its receipt thereof. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputes.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that DeltaThree disputes any amounts set forth on the report, DeltaThree shall provide PrimeCall with written notice of such dispute, which notice shall detail the reasons for the dispute, within two (2) days of its receipt thereof. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputes.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the dispute notification period to two days is unreasonable and could be considered a violation of good faith business practices, especially given the complexity of financial reporting. This unreasonably short timeframe could prevent DeltaThree from adequately reviewing the report and identifying discrepancies, potentially waiving legitimate claims. New York law, which governs the agreement, implies a reasonable time for such notifications, and two days is arguably not reasonable.",

In the event that PrimeCall disputes any amounts set forth on the report, PrimeCall shall provide DeltaThree with written notice of such dispute, which notice shall detail the reasons for the dispute, within seven (7) days of its receipt thereof.",

In the event that PrimeCall disputes any amounts set forth on the report, PrimeCall shall provide DeltaThree with written notice of such dispute, which notice shall detail the reasons for the dispute, within two (2) days of its receipt thereof.",
                "explanation": "Changing the timeline from the tenth day to the twentieth day for DeltaThree to prepare and provide the report can create problems, as it drastically reduces the amount of time that PrimeCall has to review the document, which can be considered to be unreasonable. Additionally, shortening the dispute notice to 2 days could be deemed an unreasonable timeframe to review the detailed documents provided.",

                "explanation": "Extending the payment term to 45 business days might be seen as creating an unreasonable delay that puts undo pressure on the party awaiting payment, in terms of liquidity issues. Courts have considered extended payment terms to be evidence of unfair business practices, especially where there is a power imbalance between the parties.",

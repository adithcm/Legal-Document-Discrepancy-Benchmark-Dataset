                "original_text": "With respect to any royalty           payments due hereunder from Licensee to Licensor in excess of the           amount of Royalty Advances made by Licensee from time to time           hereunder, such payments shall be payable on the later of (i) sixty           (60) days after the date of the applicable invoice to a Redistributor           or Customer, as the case may be, or (ii) five (5) business days           following Licensee's receipt of payment from a Redistributor or           Customer, as the case may be.",
                "changed_text": "With respect to any royalty           payments due hereunder from Licensee to Licensor in excess of the           amount of Royalty Advances made by Licensee from time to time           hereunder, such payments shall be payable on the later of (i) one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date of the applicable invoice to a Redistributor           or Customer, as the case may be, or (ii) fifteen (15) business days           following Licensee's receipt of payment from a Redistributor or           Customer, as the case may be.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment terms to 120 days after the invoice date and 15 business days after payment receipt.  These extended payment terms could potentially violate prompt payment laws in various states if the contract is performed in states that mandate shorter payment periods, particularly for smaller businesses or specific industries. This imposes unreasonable delay.",

                "original_text": "Any royalty payment that is not paid           when due will bear interest from the date such amount is due until the           date payment is made at a rate equal to ten percent (10%) per annum.",
                "changed_text": "Any royalty payment that is not paid           when due will bear interest from the date such amount is due until the           date payment is made at a rate equal to twenty-five percent (25%) per annum.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the interest rate to 25% per annum could be considered usurious under state laws, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific type of transaction. Usury laws set limits on the maximum interest rate that can be charged on a loan or debt.  Exceeding this rate makes the agreement potentially illegal and unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "Upon the expiration           of such term, this Agreement will renew automatically for           successive terms of one (1) year each unless either party to this Agreement delivers written notice of termination to the           other party to this Agreement at least sixty (60) days prior           to the end of the original or any renewal term.",
                "changed_text": "Upon the expiration           of such term, this Agreement will renew automatically for           successive terms of one (1) year each unless either party to this Agreement delivers written notice of termination to the           other party to this Agreement at least fifteen (15) days prior           to the end of the original or any renewal term.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 15 days may be problematic, particularly if the agreement involves substantial ongoing obligations or investments. Many jurisdictions require a more reasonable notice period to allow parties to wind down operations or find alternative arrangements. The short notice period introduces a potential conflict of laws regarding fairness and reasonable business practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; potential violation of state laws requiring reasonable notice for contract termination.",

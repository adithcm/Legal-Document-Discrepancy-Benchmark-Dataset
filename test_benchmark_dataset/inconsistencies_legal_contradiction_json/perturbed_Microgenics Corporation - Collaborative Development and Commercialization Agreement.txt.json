Upon the completion of each event as described in Section 7.1, Microgenics will invoice Achaogen within [***] ([***]) business days. Microgenics agrees to submit invoices to Achaogen (on a timely basis) for all payments due hereunder. Invoices shall reference Achaogen's contract number and the purchase order number.

                "explanation": "This change extends the period for Microgenics to invoice Achaogen and for Achaogen to make payments. California law requires prompt payment of invoices, and unduly extending these timelines could be construed as a violation, particularly if it causes financial hardship. Prompt payment laws vary, but setting timelines significantly beyond standard business practices can create a legal risk.",

                "explanation": "This modification reduces the confidentiality period to one year. This is a legal contradiction because trade secrets, under both federal (Defend Trade Secrets Act) and state laws (California Uniform Trade Secrets Act), require reasonable measures to maintain confidentiality. A one-year protection period might be deemed insufficient for certain types of confidential information, especially technical or scientific data, potentially weakening trade secret protection.",

In the event of a dispute with respect to (a) the validity, interpretation or construction of this Agreement, (b) compliance with this Agreement or (c) a breach of this Agreement (a \"Dispute\"), a Party may provide the other Party with written notice of the Dispute, and the Parties agree to exercise reasonable efforts to resolve the Dispute in good faith by promptly engaging in discussions with duly authorized representatives of the Parties. If the Dispute cannot be resolved by such authorized representatives of the Parties within [***] ([***]) business days, the authorized representatives shall refer the Dispute to a meeting between a senior executive representing each Party (currently the [***] for Achaogen, and the [***] for Microgenics), which such senior executives shall participate in at least one in person meeting as soon as practicable, but in no event later than [***] ([***]) days after the date of the relevant referral. If the senior executives for Achaogen and Microgenics cannot resolve such Dispute in a mutually acceptable manner within [***] ([***]) business days after such meeting, then the Dispute shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in accordance with Section 13.8.2.",

If the Dispute cannot be resolved by such authorized representatives of the Parties, the Parties shall proceed directly to binding arbitration, waiving any executive resolution or meeting requirements.",
                "explanation": "This modification eliminates the executive resolution phase before arbitration. While parties can agree to arbitration, California law (and general contract law principles) favor good faith attempts at pre-litigation dispute resolution. Removing all pre-arbitration steps, especially for complex commercial disputes, might be viewed unfavorably by courts and could potentially lead to challenges regarding the enforceability of the arbitration clause, arguing a lack of good faith effort to resolve the dispute amicably.",

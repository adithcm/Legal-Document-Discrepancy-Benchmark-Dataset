The Required Capital Contributions shall be made within forty-five (45) days following the last day of each Fiscal Quarter, unless the last day of such Fiscal Quarter is the same as the fiscal year end, and in such case, ninety (90) days following such fiscal year end.",
                "changed_text": "3. Timing of Required Capital Contributions. The Required Capital Contributions shall be made within one hundred and eighty (180) days following the last day of each Fiscal Quarter, regardless if the last day of such Fiscal Quarter is the same as the fiscal year end or not.",
                "explanation": "This modification extends the deadline for required capital contributions to 180 days after the end of each fiscal quarter, which creates a non-compliance with regulatory standards by potentially affecting the company's liquidity and financial stability monitoring as dictated by banking regulations and standard accounting practices. This may also violate generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and other financial oversight guidelines that emphasize timely reporting and contribution.",

                "explanation": "The change in the governing law from Minnesota to Delaware and including conflict of laws principles, combined with the clause allowing enforcement in 'any court the Agent chooses in any country,' could create enforcement difficulties. This potentially violates principles of due process and established international law regarding jurisdiction. A court's jurisdiction must be proper and reasonable based on the parties' connections to the forum, the subject matter of the dispute, and principles of fairness, which is contradicted here.",

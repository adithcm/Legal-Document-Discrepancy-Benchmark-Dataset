                "original_text": "b. Distributor shall pay half (1/2) of the purchase price prior to shipment and the remaining balance 30 days after shipment of the Products. Payments received after the 30 day calendar period will be subject to a late fee of 1.5% of the invoice amount.",
                "changed_text": "b. Distributor shall pay the full purchase price 60 days after shipment of the Products. Payments received after the 60 day calendar period will be subject to a late fee of 5% of the invoice amount.",
                "explanation": "This change increases the payment period from 30 days to 60 days and the late fee from 1.5% to 5%. Increasing the late fee to 5% of the invoice amount could be considered usurious under California law, depending on the overall context of the agreement and the actual interest rate this translates to annually. California usury laws generally limit interest rates on loans.",

                "original_text": "b. Either party may terminate this Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party, provided the breaching party is first given reasonably detailed, written notice of the breach. If the breach is not cured within ten days of such notice, the Agreement will terminate immediately.",
                "changed_text": "b. Either party may terminate this Agreement in the event of any breach by the other party, provided the breaching party is first given reasonably detailed, written notice of the breach. If the breach is not cured within five days of such notice, the Agreement will terminate immediately.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a breach of contract from ten days to five days may be deemed unreasonable and unconscionable under California law, especially for complex breaches that require more time to remedy. This could be considered a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

All notices and communications required under this Agreement will be in writing and will be delivered in person, faxed or mailed, postage prepaid, by overnight express carrier, to the address of the parties listed at the beginning of this Agreement, or to any other address as such party designates in a written notice to the other party. All notices sent pursuant to the terms of this section will be deemed received on the date of delivery if personally delivered or faxed, or if sent by overnight express carrier, on the next business day immediately following the day sent",

All notices and communications required under this Agreement will be in writing and will be delivered via carrier pigeon to the address of the parties listed at the beginning of this Agreement, or to any other address as such party designates in a written notice to the other party. All notices sent pursuant to the terms of this section will be deemed received three months after delivery.",
                "explanation": "Replacing standard notice methods (mail, fax, overnight carrier) with carrier pigeons is commercially unreasonable. Moreover, stipulating that notices are deemed received three months after delivery is also commercially unreasonable. Under contract law principles, notice provisions must be reasonably designed to ensure actual notice and to specify a reasonable time frame for when notice is considered effective.",

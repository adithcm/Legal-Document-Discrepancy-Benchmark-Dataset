                "original_text": "5.1 Payment for Services. EHN will pay Dr. Murray $8,333 per month at the end of each month during the first twelve months that this agreement is in effect.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Payment for Services. EHN will pay Dr. Murray $8,333 per month 90 days after the end of each month during the first twelve months that this agreement is in effect.",
                "explanation": "This modification violates wage payment laws, which typically require employees or contractors to be paid in a timely manner, often within a few days or weeks of the end of the pay period. Delaying payment by 90 days contradicts these regulations, making the payment term legally suspect.",
                "contradicted_law": "State and federal wage payment laws (e.g., Arizona Revised Statutes ยง 23-353)",

                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for termination to 10 days may be considered unreasonably short, especially in consulting agreements involving complex services. This may violate implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, depending on the jurisdiction and specific facts, and may be deemed unconscionable, especially if Dr. Murray cannot reasonably find other work in that time frame, therefore, making this contract open for legal issues.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; potential violation of unconscionability standards under contract law.",

                "original_text": "(6) Disputes: The parties shall first attempt to resolve any dispute related to this Agreement in an amicable manner by mediation conducted in Phoenix, Arizona. The mediation shall take place no more than sixty (60) days after written notice from the party requesting such mediation. Any disputes remaining unresolved after mediation shall be settled by binding arbitration conducted in Phoenix, Arizona under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).",
                "changed_text": "(6) Disputes: The parties agree that any dispute related to this Agreement will be resolved through a coin flip conducted by the CEO of EHS. The decision of the CEO will be final and binding. Dr. Murray waives all rights to mediation, arbitration, or legal action.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces standard dispute resolution methods (mediation and arbitration) with a coin flip by one party's CEO, removing Dr. Murray's access to fair legal recourse. This is likely unenforceable due to unconscionability and violation of fundamental fairness principles. Courts generally disfavor clauses that completely eliminate a party's legal rights and create extreme power imbalances.",
                "contradicted_law": "Unconscionability doctrine, violation of fundamental fairness principles in contract law, potential violation of due process.",

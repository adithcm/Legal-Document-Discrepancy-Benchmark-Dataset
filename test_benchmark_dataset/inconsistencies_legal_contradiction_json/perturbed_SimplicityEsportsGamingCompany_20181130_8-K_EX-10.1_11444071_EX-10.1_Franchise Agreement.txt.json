                "original_text": "8.2 Termination by Franchisor with Notice. Franchisor may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to Franchisee upon the occurrence of any of the following: (a) Franchisee fails to make any payment required under or in connection with this Agreement; (b) Franchisee ceases to operate or otherwise abandon the Smaaash Centres without the consent of Franchisor, or otherwise forfeit the right to do or transact business in the Territory; (c) Franchisee fails to use its best efforts to market and promote Smaaash Centres and the services and products offered by Smaaash Centres within the Territory and such failure is not cured within thirty (30) days of Franchisor's notification to Franchisee of such failure.",
                "changed_text": "8.2 Termination by Franchisor with Notice. Franchisor may terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days written notice to Franchisee upon the occurrence of any of the following: (a) Franchisee fails to make any payment required under or in connection with this Agreement; (b) Franchisee ceases to operate or otherwise abandon the Smaaash Centres without the consent of Franchisor, or otherwise forfeit the right to do or transact business in the Territory; (c) Franchisee fails to use its best efforts to market and promote Smaaash Centres and the services and products offered by Smaaash Centres within the Territory and such failure is not cured within ten (10) days of Franchisor's notification to Franchisee of such failure.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 10 days may conflict with laws requiring reasonable notice or a longer cure period in franchise agreements, depending on the specific circumstances and jurisdiction. This creates non-compliance by potentially depriving the franchisee of adequate time to rectify the issues or find alternatives.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates state franchise laws that require reasonable notice periods before termination, such as the California Franchise Relations Act or similar laws in other states.",

During the Term, Franchisor shall have the right to conduct audits of Franchisee with respect to the Smaaash Centres, and inspect the Smaaash Centres, after providing a written notice of 5 (five) days. Franchisee shall be under an obligation to provide any information as may be requested by Franchisor with respect to the Smaaash Centres, including the books of accounts and other relevant documents or records maintained in relation to the Smaaash Centres.",
                "changed_text": "10.2 Right to inspect and request information. During the Term, Franchisor shall have the right to conduct audits of Franchisee with respect to the Smaaash Centres, and inspect the Smaaash Centres, after providing a written notice of 24 hours. Franchisee shall be under an obligation to immediately provide any information as may be requested by Franchisor with respect to the Smaaash Centres, including the books of accounts and other relevant documents or records maintained in relation to the Smaaash Centres.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for audits to 24 hours and mandating immediate provision of information may be considered unreasonable and violate implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing. This could also conflict with privacy laws or regulations regarding the handling of sensitive business information, as it doesn't provide the franchisee sufficient time to ensure compliance before disclosing documents.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the number of required Smaaash Centres to 20 within the first contract year may be considered commercially unreasonable and could potentially be viewed as a form of economic duress, especially if the market conditions or financial resources of the franchisee do not support such rapid expansion. This can create a scenario where fulfilling the obligation is practically impossible, potentially leading to breach of contract and related legal disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates principles of contract law related to unconscionability or economic duress if the obligation is deemed excessively burdensome and exploitative given the circumstances.",

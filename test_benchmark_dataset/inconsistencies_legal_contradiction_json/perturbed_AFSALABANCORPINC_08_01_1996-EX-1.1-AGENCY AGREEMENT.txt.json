                "explanation": "This change extends the timeframe for transmitting subscription funds to five business days. This contradicts SEC Rule 15c2-4, which requires prompt transmission of funds, typically interpreted as the next business day.",

                "changed_text": "The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but no earnings statement is required.",
                "explanation": "This removes the requirement for the company to provide earnings statements. This contradicts the requirements for publicly traded companies to periodically report on the operations and financial standing of the entity.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the company will send out reports for the registration period, or for three years. The modified text mandates that the company will send out reports for the registration period, or for one year. This change of duration creates non-compliance with regulatory standards, as some laws and regulations for annual reports require 3 years. Additionally, the removal of 'certified by independent public accountants and prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X under the 1934 Act' further weakens required reporting standards.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Fees shall be payable within thirty (30) days of invoice which shall be exclusive of any applicable local, state,          federal, use, excise, value added, GST or other taxes imposed on the          fees payable for the Product Maintenance and Support Services which          shall be the responsibility of Licensee.",
                "changed_text": "Fees shall be payable within ninety (90) days of invoice which shall be exclusive of any applicable local, state,          federal, use, excise, value added, GST or other taxes imposed on the          fees payable for the Product Maintenance and Support Services which          shall be the responsibility of Licensee.",
                "explanation": "Extending the payment period to 90 days without the explicit agreement of XACCT introduces a contradiction. Standard business practice and implied duties of good faith and fair dealing often expect payments within a shorter timeframe (e.g., 30 days). Extending this period unilaterally could be seen as an attempt to gain more favorable credit terms retroactively, conflicting with established payment expectations. Changing the payment terms without approval and without adequately allowing the Vendor to adjust its internal procedures would be contradictory to existing business practices.",

                "original_text": "XACCT may also terminate Support          Services if Licensee breaches any provision of this Agreement or the          License Agreement and such breach is not remedied within thirty (30)          days after Licensee receives written notice of the breach.",
                "changed_text": "XACCT may also terminate Support          Services if Licensee breaches any provision of this Agreement or the          License Agreement and such breach is not remedied within ten (10)          days after Licensee receives written notice of the breach.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to 10 days for a breach of contract may be deemed unreasonably short, especially for complex issues. Many jurisdictions consider 30 days a standard and reasonable cure period. A shorter period could be seen as oppressive and contradict the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, potentially making the termination clause unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "The Agreement will be automatically          renewed for additional one (1) year terms (subject to applicable fee          adjustments) unless thirty (30) days prior to the anniversary of the          Effective Date Licensee gives written notice to XACCT of its intention          not to renew.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the non-renewal notification period to 10 days may be deemed insufficient and unreasonable, potentially violating state laws regarding automatic renewal clauses, particularly in states with stricter consumer protection laws. A shorter notice period could make it difficult for the Licensee to properly evaluate and act, conflicting with regulatory expectations for fair and transparent contract terms.",

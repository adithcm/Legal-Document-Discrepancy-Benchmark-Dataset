                "original_text": "Payments shall be made 15 days from the end of each quarter. Smith's net payment after any such charges or deductions shall equal the amount set forth above. Past due payments hereunder shall bear interest at the rate of (i) one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month, or (ii) the maximum interest rate permissible under law, whichever is less.",
                "changed_text": "Payments shall be made 90 days from the end of each quarter. Smith's net payment after any such charges or deductions shall equal the amount set forth above. Past due payments hereunder shall bear interest at the rate of (i) zero percent (0%) per month, or (ii) the minimum interest rate permissible under law, whichever is less.",
                "explanation": "Delaying payments to 90 days after the end of the quarter and setting the interest rate for past due payments to 0% can be seen as unconscionable and could violate state wage and payment laws, potentially conflicting with regulations requiring timely payment for services rendered and reasonable interest on late payments. Arizona law requires prompt payment of wages and salaries.",

                "original_text": "Smith agrees that any material, advertising or otherwise, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by TDA to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved in writing within fourteen (14) days after receipt thereof. Smith agrees that any material submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that TDA will be advised of",
                "changed_text": "Smith agrees that any material, advertising or otherwise, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by TDA to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved in writing within two (2) days after receipt thereof. Smith agrees that any material submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that TDA will be advised of",
                "explanation": "Reducing the approval period for advertising materials to 2 days may be considered an unreasonably short timeframe, especially given the complexity of some advertising materials. This could lead to rushed decisions or constructive approval due to lack of sufficient review time, potentially infringing on Smith's publicity rights. This timeframe is so short that it is very likely it can violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing that all contracts are subject to. It creates a high risk of constructive approval simply due to time constraints, essentially diminishing Smith's approval rights.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period to 6 months contradicts standard business practices and potential legal/audit requirements. Tax authorities (both federal and state) often require businesses to retain financial records for several years (e.g., IRS typically requires 3-6 years). Shortening the retention period to six months could violate regulatory compliance and hinder Smith's ability to audit royalty payments or pursue legal claims within the statute of limitations for contract disputes.",

Should Converge find one or more material deficiencies in any Maintenance Update, Converge shall promptly identify such deficiencies to VNE in reasonable detail.",

Should Converge find one or more material deficiencies in any Maintenance Update, Converge may identify such deficiencies to VNE at their convenience.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the allowed installation time for Maintenance Updates to 180 days, which could be an unreasonably long period depending on the nature of the software and the urgency of the updates, potentially conflicting with industry standards or implied warranties of timely support. Additionally, modifying 'promptly identify' to 'identify at their convenience' significantly weakens the obligation to report issues, impacting support effectiveness.",

Increasing the reporting timeframe to 300 days may be deemed unreasonable, while changing the correction timeframe to '180 days' weakens the 'promptly' language, potentially conflicting with consumer protection laws or reasonable expectations of timely service remediation.",

Company acknowledges that this Agreement shall not be terminated for MA's failure to follow an operating plan, standard procedure, training manual, or substantial equivalent published in Paragraph 3 (k) of this Agreement, except that Company does reserve the right to terminate this Agreement for MA's failure to follow required procedures relating to the processing of sales contracts, invoices and billing related to Technology sold under this Agreement.",

Company acknowledges that this Agreement shall not be terminated for MA's failure to follow an operating plan, standard procedure, training manual, or substantial equivalent published in Paragraph 3 (k) of this Agreement, except that Company does reserve the right to terminate this Agreement for MA's failure to follow required procedures relating to the processing of sales contracts, invoices and billing related to Technology sold under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to ten days may conflict with state laws that require longer notice periods for contract termination, especially if the agreement implies an ongoing business relationship or investment.",

                "explanation": "Changing the report from written to verbal may allow information to be misinterpreted, and is less traceable. Also the company only requests the reports, but does not specify how often these reports are requested, giving the company the ability to use this to their advantage and request this information on an extremely short, periodic basis. This may be a violation of work hour laws.",

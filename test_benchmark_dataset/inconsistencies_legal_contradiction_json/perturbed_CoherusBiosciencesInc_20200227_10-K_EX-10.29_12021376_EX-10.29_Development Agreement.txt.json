Within [***] ([***]) [***] following the Effective Date, Bioeq shall make available to Licensee the complete draft of the Biologics License Application that Bioeq has prepared and intends to file for the first Licensed Product with the FDA. Licensee shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to review such draft without delay and to notify Bioeq in writing of any concerns it may identify in relation to such draft within [***] ([***]) days of such draft being made available to Licensee by Bioeq. Subsequently, Licensee may notify Bioeq in writing of any concerns that it identifies in relation to such draft promptly after such identification. For clarity, nothing in this Section 4.1.1 shall restrict Bioeq's right to file the first Biologics License Application for a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory at its sole discretion.",

Within [***] ([***]) [***] following the Effective Date, Bioeq shall make available to Licensee the complete draft of the Biologics License Application that Bioeq has prepared and intends to file for the first Licensed Product with the FDA. Licensee will have 24 hours to review such draft and notify Bioeq in writing of any concerns. Bioeq retains the right to immediately file the Biologics License Application, irrespective of Licensee's feedback.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a reasonable timeframe for Licensee to review and comment on the BLA draft. The modified text drastically reduces the review period to 24 hours, which may be insufficient for a thorough review, especially given the complexity of such applications. Also, the phrase 'irrespective of Licensee's feedback' further invalidates the review period for possible concerns. This creates a legal contradiction because it undermines the collaborative intent and potentially violates regulatory expectations for thorough review processes.",

As of the First Commercial Sale of any Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory, within [***] ([***]) days after the end of each calendar quarter, Licensee shall deliver to Bioeq a written report setting forth in reasonable detail, on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, the calculation of (a) the aggregate Net Sales achieved for such Licensed Product in such calendar quarter (including a detailed description of invoiced gross sales prices and all deductions made pursuant to Section 1.49), (b) the aggregate Gross Margins achieved for such Licensed Product in such calendar quarter (including a detailed description of all deductions and calculations made pursuant to Section 7.3.3 in arriving at such Gross Margin calculation), and (c) the calculation of the royalties owing by Licensee to Bioeq pursuant to Section 7.3 for such calendar quarter. Notwithstanding the Parties' confidentiality obligations pursuant to Section 11, Bioeq shall have the right to report Licensee's Net Sales reporting to its licensors on a confidential basis to the extent required under the relevant agreements with such licensors.",

As of the First Commercial Sale of any Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory, within 90 days after the end of each calendar year, Licensee shall deliver to Bioeq a written report providing only the aggregate Net Sales and total royalties owing. No detailed breakdowns or calculations are required. Bioeq may disclose all details to its licensors without restriction.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires quarterly reports with detailed breakdowns. The modification changes this to annual reports with minimal information. This introduces a legal contradiction because it potentially violates accounting standards and transparency requirements, especially if Bioeq's licensors require more frequent or detailed reports. Moreover, allowing Bioeq to disclose 'all details to its licensors without restriction' could violate confidentiality agreements or trade secret laws, if the information includes sensitive data beyond what is necessary for royalty reporting.",

Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon material breach of any obligation under this Agreement by the other Party provided that such breach (if curable) is not cured within thirty (30) days following the receipt of written notice thereof by the non-breaching Party. If there is a dispute between the Parties as to whether a material breach has occurred or whether such breach was curable or has been cured by the other Party within the above cure period, notice of termination may only be given after the terminating Party has escalated the issue to the relevant senior executives pursuant to Section 16.3.1 and the senior executives have not been able to solve such dispute within thirty (30) days of such escalation.",
                "changed_text": "15.2.1 Termination for Breach. Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon any breach, regardless of materiality, with no opportunity to cure. Termination is effective immediately upon written notice. No dispute resolution is required.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows for termination only upon *material* breach and provides a 30-day cure period. The modified clause allows termination for *any* breach, eliminates the cure period, and removes the dispute resolution requirement. This creates a legal contradiction because standard contract law generally requires breaches to be material to justify termination and often includes provisions for notice and cure. Eliminating these protections could be deemed unconscionable or a violation of good faith and fair dealing, rendering the clause unenforceable, especially in jurisdictions with strong protections against arbitrary contract terminations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates standard contract law principles requiring materiality for breach and providing notice and cure periods; potentially violates good faith and fair dealing requirements.",

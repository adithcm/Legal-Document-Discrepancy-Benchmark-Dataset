                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon sixty (60) days prior written notice to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon ten (10) days prior written notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 10 days may be considered an unreasonably short notice period, particularly given the potential impact on the other party's business operations. Many jurisdictions consider such short notice periods to be unconscionable or in violation of good faith business practices, potentially leading to legal challenges.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of good faith and fair dealing implied in contract law; potential unconscionability under UCC Article 2 in some jurisdictions.",

                "changed_text": "Each party agrees that for a period of six (6) months following the disclosure of Confidential Information, it (a) will not use, directly or indirectly, or reproduce the Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose except in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, (b) will not disclose the Confidential Information of the other party to any third parties except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, and (c) will take all reasonable security measures to maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information of the other party in its possession or control, which will in no event be less than the measures it uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own information of similar importance.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period from three years to six months for trade secrets can be problematic. Trade secrets are often protected for much longer periods, potentially indefinitely, as long as they remain secret and provide a competitive advantage. A six-month period may be deemed unreasonably short to protect legitimately valuable trade secrets, conflicting with trade secret law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of trade secret laws (e.g., Uniform Trade Secrets Act) if the six-month period is deemed insufficient to protect legitimately maintained trade secrets.",

                "original_text": "Reseller may elect a new distributor annually by notifying McDATA thirty (30) days prior to renewal of the Agreement. If McDATA does not receive notice of a new distributor election and the Agreement is renewed, Reseller agrees that it will continue to purchase Products through the currently designated distributor.",
                "changed_text": "Reseller may elect a new distributor annually by notifying McDATA five (5) days prior to renewal of the Agreement. If McDATA does not receive notice of a new distributor election and the Agreement is renewed, Reseller agrees that it will continue to purchase Products through the currently designated distributor.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for changing distributors to five days prior to renewal is problematic because the Reseller might need more time to find the correct distributor that has the right materials, pricing, etc. This extremely short notice could be deemed unreasonable and a violation of fair dealing, especially given the potential disruption to the Reseller's supply chain and business operations. A court might find this provision unenforceable due to its unreasonableness.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; possible unconscionability under UCC Article 2.",

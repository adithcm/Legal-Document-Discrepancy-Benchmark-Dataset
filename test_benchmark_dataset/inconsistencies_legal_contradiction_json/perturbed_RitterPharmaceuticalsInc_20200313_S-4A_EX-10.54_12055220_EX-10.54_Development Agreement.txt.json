                "explanation": "The original contract mandates payment within 30 days of invoice receipt. Modifying this to 90 days may violate California Prompt Payment laws (if Sekisui is located in California), which generally require faster payment terms, especially for smaller businesses.",

Each Party shall advise the other Party promptly (but in any event within no more than 48 hours) of any warning (including any FDA Form 483), citation, indictment, claim, lawsuit, or proceeding issued or instituted by any federal, state or local governmental entity or agency against the Party, or of any revocation of any license or permit if, and only to the extent that, the manufacture, storage, or handling of the Product, or the marketing, selling, promotion or distribution of the Product, is affected.",
                "changed_text": "12.4. Governmental Warnings. Each Party shall advise the other Party only if practical, and at their earliest convenience, of any warning (including any FDA Form 483), citation, indictment, claim, lawsuit, or proceeding issued or instituted by any federal, state or local governmental entity or agency against the Party, or of any revocation of any license or permit if, and only to the extent that, the manufacture, storage, or handling of the Product, or the marketing, selling, promotion or distribution of the Product, is affected.",
                "explanation": "Changing the notification requirement from 'promptly (but no more than 48 hours)' to 'only if practical, and at their earliest convenience' weakens the obligation to report governmental warnings.  This contradicts regulatory requirements for timely reporting of adverse events or safety issues to relevant agencies (e.g., FDA) which often have strict deadlines.  Failure to report within legally mandated timeframes can result in penalties.",

Qualigen shall have responsibility to determine whether any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections information must be reported to the FDA (under United States law) or any other Regulatory Authorities and Qualigen shall have responsibility to prepare and submit notification of Adverse Events, Recalls and/or Field Corrections to respective Regulatory Authorities for the Products. Qualigen shall provide prompt notice to Sekisui of any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections, which notice shall in any event be delivered within no more than 3 business days from Qualigen learning of such occurrence.",

Qualigen shall have sole discretion to determine whether any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections information will be reported to the FDA (under United States law) or any other Regulatory Authorities, and Qualigen is solely responsible for preparing and submitting notification of Adverse Events, Recalls and/or Field Corrections to respective Regulatory Authorities for the Products. Qualigen will notify Sekisui of any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections if Qualigen deems necessary.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 'prompt notice' requirement and granting Qualigen 'sole discretion' over notifying Sekisui about adverse events, recalls, or field corrections is a legal contradiction. This conflicts with requirements that manufacturers and distributors cooperate in addressing and reporting safety issues, especially in regulated industries. It could also violate Sekisui's independent obligations to report such events under applicable laws, such as FDA regulations, because they might be unaware of any events at all.",

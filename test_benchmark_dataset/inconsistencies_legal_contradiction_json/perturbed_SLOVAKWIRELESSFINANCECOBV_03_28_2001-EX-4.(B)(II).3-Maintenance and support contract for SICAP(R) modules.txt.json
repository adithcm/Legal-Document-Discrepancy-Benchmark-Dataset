                "changed_text": "Prices are subject to yearly adjustments at Sicap Ltd's discretion. Sicap Ltd may send a new offer. The offer shall be sent one week prior to the beginning of the dedicated next year.",
                "explanation": "The original contract stated that price adjustment offers should be sent two months before the new year. The modified version shortens this period to one week, potentially violating contract law principles that require reasonable notice for significant changes like price adjustments.",

                "explanation": "The payment period has been extended to 60 days. This conflicts with standard business practices. While not explicitly illegal, excessively long payment terms without justification can create financial strain and potentially be challenged under unfair business practice laws.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'written notification' to 'verbal notification' and the reduction of the notice period from six weeks to one week introduces significant legal issues. Verbal notifications are difficult to prove, creating enforceability problems. The shortened notice period may be deemed unreasonable, potentially conflicting with contract law principles.",

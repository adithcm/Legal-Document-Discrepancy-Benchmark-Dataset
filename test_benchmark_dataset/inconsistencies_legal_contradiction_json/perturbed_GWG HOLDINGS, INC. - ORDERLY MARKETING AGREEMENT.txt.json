                "original_text": "1.2 It is the goal of the Seller Trusts to have all of the Shares sold, on a pro-rata basis, in three or more tranches (each a \"Tranche\") commencing not earlier than six (6) months after the Effective Date with the resale of all of the shares of Stock completed as soon as practicable after the Effective Date.",
                "changed_text": "1.2 It is the goal of the Seller Trusts to have all of the Shares sold, on a pro-rata basis, in three or more tranches (each a \"Tranche\") commencing not earlier than twelve (12) months after the Effective Date with the resale of all of the shares of Stock completed within one (1) month after the Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "This change mandates a resale completion timeframe that might be too short to reasonably comply with securities regulations. Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, for example, has holding period requirements that could easily be longer than one month.",

                "changed_text": "(b) The Engagement Letter shall provide that the Bank may terminate its engagement at any time upon not less than 10 days' prior written notice to the other Parties.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 10 days is a legal contradiction, because it does not allow time for GWG and the Trust Advisors to find a replacement investment bank to serve as the lead joint-book-running manager for the sale of the Shares. A 45 day period is more reasonable.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law to California could create inconsistencies because California has specific securities laws and regulations (e.g., the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968) that might conflict with actions contemplated under the OMA if those actions were designed to comply with New York law. The OMA was originally drafted under New York law; changing the governing law may affect its validity.",

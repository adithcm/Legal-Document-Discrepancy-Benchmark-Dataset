                "original_text": "(b) This Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party, effective immediately upon written notice, if the other party: (i) becomes insolvent; (ii) files a petition in bankruptcy; or (iii) makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after the date that it receives written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party.",
                "changed_text": "(b) This Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party, effective immediately upon written notice, if the other party: (i) becomes insolvent; (ii) files a petition in bankruptcy; or (iii) makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within ten (10) days after the date that it receives written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from 30 days to 10 days is unfavorable and could be considered a violation of good faith and fair dealing, particularly in New York, where the contract is governed. A shorter cure period may not provide sufficient time for the breaching party to remedy complex issues, potentially leading to unjust termination. This contradicts the principle of providing a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach, as generally expected under contract law.",

Should Licensee agree to be the vendor for an Additional Title, Licensor and Licensee will negotiate in good faith to mutually agree upon the pricing and terms for each Additional Title in an amendment to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor will promptly provide written notice to Licensee in which Licensor lists each Additional Title. Licensor is not required to negotiate pricing and terms in good faith, and can set any arbitrary amount for the Licensee to agree.",
                "explanation": "Removing the obligation to negotiate in good faith is a legal contradiction because the duty of good faith is implied in every contract. Failing to negotiate in good faith could be seen as a breach of contract and a violation of New York contract law.",

                "explanation": "The original contract specifies a two-year confidentiality period. Reducing it to six months is unfavorable and potentially unreasonable, especially considering the nature of the content being licensed. This contradiction can be unfavorable to the confidential information protection and can be considered a violation of fair dealing.",

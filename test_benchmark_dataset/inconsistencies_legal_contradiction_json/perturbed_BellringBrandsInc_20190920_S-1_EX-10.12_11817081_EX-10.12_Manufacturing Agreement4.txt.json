                "original_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the \"Third Amendment\"), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (\"Heritage\") Premier Nutrition Corporation (\"Premier\") is effective as of July 3, 2019 (\"Third Amendment Effective Date\") and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (\"Agreement\").",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies an effective date of July 3, 2019. Changing it to 'effective immediately' could create issues if actions were taken based on the original agreement's effective date. Contract law generally requires a reasonable period for parties to adjust to new terms, especially if the amendment significantly alters obligations. This immediate change conflicts with that implied reasonable notice and adjustment period, potentially leading to disputes over compliance with the amended terms, particularly if actions required immediate execution.",

                "explanation": "Changing the title from 'President' to 'Employee' introduces uncertainty about the signing authority. If these individuals lack the authority to bind the company, the amendment could be challenged as invalid. Corporate law requires individuals signing on behalf of a company to have the appropriate authority, and a general 'Employee' title is insufficient to establish that authority. This could conflict with corporate governance laws requiring proper authorization for contractual agreements.",

                "explanation": "By stating that confidential information is determined solely at Premier's discretion, it creates an imbalanced agreement heavily favoring Premier. This lack of mutuality could be seen as unconscionable. The change could be challenged as creating an illusory promise where Premier has no real obligation and could conflict with contract law principles requiring good faith and fair dealing.",

Once every twelve (12) months, 2TheMart through a CPA may inspect and audit such records to verify reports. Any such inspection will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with i-Escrow's business activities and with no less than fifteen (15) days notice. i-Escrow shall within two (2) weeks make any overdue payments disclosed by the audit. Such inspection shall be at 2TheMart's expense; however, if the audit reveals overdue payments in excess of ten percent (10%) of the payments owed to date, i-Escrow shall immediately pay all cost of such audit.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the audit frequency and notice period. It decreases the notice period for audits and increases the audit waiting period, which would be considered unreasonable and could potentially conflict with generally accepted accounting principles regarding reasonable access to financial records. The threshold for i-Escrow paying the audit cost is also decreased. This introduces an imbalance of power as 2TheMart would need to pay more for audits.",

A party's \"Confidential Information\" is defined as any confidential or proprietary information of a party which is disclosed to the other party in a writing marked confidential or, if disclosed orally, is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and is subsequently reduced to a writing marked confidential and delivered to the other party within ten (10) days of disclosure.  Each party shall hold the other party's Confidential Information in confidence and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to third parties nor use the other party's Confidential Information for any purpose other than as required to perform under this Agreement. Such restrictions shall not apply to Confidential Information which (a) is already known by the recipient, (b) becomes, through no act or fault of the recipient, publicly known, (c) is received by recipient from a third party without a restriction on disclosure or use, or (d) is independently developed by recipient without reference to the Confidential Information.  The restriction on disclosure shall not apply to Confidential Information which is required to be disclosed by a court or government agency. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, within fourteen (14) days of the other party's request, each party will return all Confidential Information and other deliverables to the requesting party.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for oral disclosures to be documented in writing and delivered within ten days to be considered confidential, and by adding \"unless required to disclose such Confidential Information to third parties,\" the clause significantly weakens the protection of confidential information. Additionally, changing the return obligation from a mandatory \"shall return\" to a discretionary \"will determine whether to return\" creates ambiguity and reduces enforceability. Removing protection for oral disclosures directly contradicts standard practices in protecting trade secrets, potentially violating California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA). The clause now allows for third-party disclosure.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto with verbal notification. No written notice is required for revocation.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires written notice for revocation of the agreement, which is standard practice to ensure clarity and prevent disputes. The modified text allows for verbal revocation, contradicting the Statute of Frauds which, in many states including Delaware (where Galera Therapeutics, Inc. is incorporated), requires certain agreements, including those that cannot be performed within one year, to be in writing to be enforceable. Allowing verbal revocation introduces ambiguity and makes enforcement difficult, potentially conflicting with Delaware contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware Statute of Frauds (6 Del. C. ยง 2714) and general contract law principles requiring written agreements for certain types of contracts.",

                "changed_text": "Each party is solely responsible for their own filings, regardless of any inaccuracies known about other parties' information. No party has any duty to verify the accuracy of filings by other parties, even if they have concrete evidence of misinformation.",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes a 'reason to believe' standard, imposing a duty to ensure accuracy if a party has reason to suspect inaccuracies in another party's filings. The modified text eliminates this duty entirely, stating that no party is responsible even with concrete evidence of misinformation. This conflicts with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC regulations, which emphasize the importance of accurate and truthful disclosures to protect investors. Ignoring known inaccuracies could be construed as aiding and abetting a violation of securities laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC regulations (e.g., Rule 10b-5) regarding accurate and truthful disclosures.",

                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \"Exchange Act\") the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of Clarus IV-A, L.P., Clarus IV-B, L.P., Clarus IV-C, L.P., Clarus IV-D, L.P., Clarus IV GP, L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.L.C., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings I/II GP L.L.C., The Blackstone Group Inc., Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. and Stephen A. Schwarzman, on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned agree to a general coordination of filings related to Galera Therapeutics, Inc. filings as deemed appropriate. There is no requirement to adhere strictly to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or related regulations for these filings.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and its regulations. The modified text removes this explicit compliance requirement, stating that filings are coordinated 'as deemed appropriate' and that there is no strict adherence to the Act. This directly contradicts federal securities law, which mandates compliance with specific regulations for filings related to publicly traded companies like Galera Therapeutics, Inc. Disregarding these regulations would expose the parties to potential legal penalties and liabilities.",

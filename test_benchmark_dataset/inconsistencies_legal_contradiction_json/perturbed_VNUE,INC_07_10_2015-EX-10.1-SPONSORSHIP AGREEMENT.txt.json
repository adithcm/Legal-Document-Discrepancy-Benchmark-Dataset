                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Fee Due Dates\n\n$75,000 - Sponsorship Fee $50,000 due upon receipt of this term sheet   $25,000 final balance payment due upon announcement date of July 15, 2015.",
                "changed_text": "Fee Due Dates\n\n$75,000 - Sponsorship Fee $50,000 due upon receipt of this term sheet   $25,000 final balance payment due 180 days after the announcement date of July 15, 2015.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the final payment by 180 days contradicts standard commercial practices and potentially violates implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, which generally require timely payment for services rendered. While not a specific statute, unreasonably delaying payment without justification can be construed as a breach of contract under California law, where the contract is governed.",

                "original_text": "Addresses for notice may be changed from time to time by written notice to the other party. Any communication or payment given by mail will be effective upon the earlier of (a) five business days following deposit in a post office or other official depository under the care and custody of the United States Postal Service; or (b) actual receipt, as indicated by the return receipt. If notice or payment is given by personal delivery or by overnight air courier, the notice or payment will be effective when delivered to the appropriate address set forth above.",
                "changed_text": "Addresses for notice may be changed from time to time by verbal notice to the other party. Any communication or payment given by mail will be effective 30 days following deposit in a post office or other official depository under the care and custody of the United States Postal Service. If notice or payment is given by personal delivery, the notice or payment will only be effective after 1 year delivered to the appropriate address set forth above.",
                "explanation": "Requiring only verbal notice for address changes is problematic, as it contradicts the Statute of Frauds (depending on the contract's duration and subject matter) and general principles of contract law that require material modifications to be in writing. The delay of 30 days for mail and 1 year for in-person delivery is commercially unreasonable, effectively undermining the notice provisions and potentially leading to breaches due to delayed communication.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Before April 1, 2016 ANTHEMIC will not discuss in any manner with any person or entity (other than the Sponsor) to be a sponsor of the Event in the Video App category. If ANTHEMIC produces the Event in 2016 and seeks a sponsor in the category, ANTHEMIC will first contact the Sponsor and provide the Sponsor with written notice (the \"Notice) of the terms under which the Sponsor can be the category sponsor for the 2016 Event. The Sponsor will have 15 days from receipt of the Notice to accept the terms to be the category sponsor of the 2014 Event. If the Sponsor decides not to be the category sponsor of the 2016 Event or fails to timely respond to the Notice, then ANTHEMIC may approach other parties to be the category sponsor.",
                "changed_text": "ANTHEMIC reserves the right to discuss sponsorship opportunities with any person or entity at any time. If ANTHEMIC produces the Event in 2016 and seeks a sponsor in the category, ANTHEMIC is not obligated to contact the Sponsor. ANTHEMIC may approach other parties to be the category sponsor immediately.",
                "explanation": "The changed text removes the original text's clause of exclusivity and the obligation to contact the original sponsor first, which could be interpreted as a violation of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing if the original sponsor invested significantly in the 2015 event based on an expectation of future opportunities. Eliminating the written notice and response period further undermines the original sponsor's opportunity to negotiate for the 2016 event.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; potentially misrepresentation if VNUE made investments based on future opportunities.",

                "original_text": "Definitive minutes of all committee meetings shall be finalized no later than thirty (30) days after the meeting to which the minutes pertain as follows:\n\n3.3.1 Distribution of Minutes. Within ten (10) days after a committee meeting, the secretary of such committee shall prepare and distribute to all members of such committee draft minutes of the meeting. Such minutes shall provide a list of any issues yet to be resolved, either within such committee or through the relevant resolution process.\n\n3.3.2 Review of Minutes. The Party members of each committee shall have ten (10) days after receiving such draft minutes to collect comments thereon and provide them to the secretary of such committee.\n\n3.3.3 Discussion of Comments. Upon the expiration of such second ten (10) day period, the Parties shall have an additional ten (10) days to discuss each other's comments and finalize the minutes. The secretary and chairperson(s) of such committee shall each sign and date",

Within twenty (20) days after a committee meeting, the secretary of such committee shall prepare and distribute to all members of such committee draft minutes of the meeting. Such minutes shall provide a list of any issues yet to be resolved, either within such committee or through the relevant resolution process.\n\n3.3.2 Review of Minutes. The Party members of each committee shall have fifteen (15) days after receiving such draft minutes to collect comments thereon and provide them to the secretary of such committee.\n\n3.3.3 Discussion of Comments.

The secretary and chairperson(s) of such committee shall each sign and date",
                "explanation": "This change delays the finalization of the committee meetings to sixty (60) days. Also, it extends the distribution of minutes to twenty (20) days and review of minutes to fifteen (15) days. This introduces ambiguity and can create legal challenges in ensuring transparent and timely governance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Typical corporate governance best practices emphasize timely and accurate record-keeping and dissemination of information.",

                "original_text": "The Parties will replace an invalid provision or fill any gap with valid provisions which most closely approximate the purpose and economic effect of the invalid provision or, in case of a gap, the Parties' presumed intentions. In the event that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are materially altered as a result of the preceding sentences, the Parties shall renegotiate the terms and conditions of this Agreement in order to resolve any inequities. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted so as to require either Party to violate any applicable laws, rules or regulations.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties will replace an invalid provision or fill any gap with valid provisions that favor the party that did not draft the original clause. In the event that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are materially altered as a result of the preceding sentences, the Parties may, at their discretion, renegotiate the terms and conditions of this Agreement in order to resolve any inequities. This Agreement may be interpreted to require either Party to violate applicable laws, rules or regulations if deemed beneficial to the collaboration.",
                "explanation": "This edit alters the severability clause to introduce potential illegality and bias. It suggests favoring one party in replacement provisions and allows for potential violations of regulations if deemed beneficial. This directly contradicts legal principles requiring fair and lawful contractual terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law requires clauses to be interpreted and applied in a manner that is fair, reasonable, and lawful. The modification introduces bias and the potential for illegal actions.",

                "changed_text": "All demands, notices, consents, approvals, reports, requests and other communications hereunder will be deemed sufficient if communicated verbally. A written record is optional. Notifications regarding breaches, terminations, or other critical issues may be communicated through a social media platform. Addresses for official notice are not required.",
                "explanation": "The modified section removes requirements for written notices and the addresses to send them. This conflicts with the principle of providing clear, documented communication in legal agreements. Also, communicating breaches through social media is not appropriate for a legal document.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law emphasizes the importance of clear, written communication, especially for critical notices such as breaches and terminations. Notifying parties via social media is not a legally sound communication approach.",

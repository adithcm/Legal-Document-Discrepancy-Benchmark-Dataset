                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "At least seven (7) days before the Commencement  Date,  the Franchisee  shall pay to BKC the initial  franchise fee described   in  SCHEDULE  1,  which  sum  shall  be  fully  earned  by  BKC  and non-refundable upon execution of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Franchisee shall pay to BKC the initial franchise fee described in SCHEDULE 1 no later than one (1) day before the Commencement Date, which sum shall be fully earned by BKC and non-refundable upon execution of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Shortening the payment timeframe to 'one (1) day before' creates a legal contradiction. This does not provide adequate time for franchisees to secure funds, potentially conflicting with regulations concerning fair franchising practices and reasonable opportunity to perform contractual obligations. Many jurisdictions require a more substantial period to ensure franchisees are not under undue pressure.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state franchising laws and general contract law principles regarding reasonable time for performance.",

                "original_text": "If the position of Director of Operations  becomes  vacant for any reason,  the vacancy  shall be filled within ninety (90) days by a new Director of Operations approved by BKC.",
                "changed_text": "If the position of Director of Operations becomes vacant for any reason, the vacancy shall be filled within one hundred eighty (180) days by a new Director of Operations approved by BKC.",
                "explanation": "Extending the timeframe to fill the Director of Operations position to 180 days introduces a legal contradiction. Some states may have regulations requiring key management positions to be filled within a shorter timeframe to ensure proper business operation and compliance with franchise standards. This delay could violate those regulations, affecting operational standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state laws regarding franchise operations and management requirements.",

                "original_text": "Franchisee agrees to carry at its expense  during  the  Term of this  Agreement  Comprehensive  General  Liability insurance, including Products Liability and Broad Form Contractual Liability, in an  amount  which is at all  times  the  local  equivalent  of not less than One Million U.S. Dollars (U.S.  $1,000,000.00)  per occurrence for bodily injury and Five Hundred  Thousand  U.S.  Dollars  (U.S.  $500,000.00)  per  occurrence  for property damage, or in such increased amounts as BKC may reasonably request from time to time during the Term of this  Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Franchisee agrees to carry at its expense during the Term of this Agreement Comprehensive General Liability insurance, including Products Liability and Broad Form Contractual Liability, in an amount which is at all times the local equivalent of not less than Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars (U.S. $50,000.00) per occurrence for bodily injury and Twenty Five Thousand U.S. Dollars (U.S. $25,000.00) per occurrence for property damage, unless BKC requests a lower amount.",
                "explanation": "Decreasing the minimum insurance coverage amounts for bodily injury and property damage to $50,000 and $25,000, respectively, creates a potential contradiction. This coverage may not meet minimum liability insurance requirements mandated by state law or local regulations for restaurants or businesses operating within specific jurisdictions. Also the part 'unless BKC requests a lower amount.' will contradict other parts in the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state and local regulations regarding minimum insurance coverage for businesses.",

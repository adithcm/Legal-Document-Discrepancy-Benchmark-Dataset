                "explanation": "This change increases the time frame for delivery and alters the form of mail. Increasing the time it takes to send legal communication, as well as not obtaining a return receipt, can affect a party's due process rights because critical notices might not be received or acknowledged promptly. This is not legally compliant and will likely be seen as a breach of contract.",

                "original_text": "In the event that a party materially breaches any representation or covenant herein, the other party may give written notice of the breach requiring the same to be remedied within 30 days of receipt of such notice. If the breaching party fails to remedy the material breach in such time period, the non-breaching party may terminate this Agreement by delivery of a written termination notice to the breaching party. Any such termination shall not relieve the breaching party from any obligation or liability arising prior to such termination.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that a party materially breaches any representation or covenant herein, the other party may give verbal notice of the breach requiring the same to be remedied within 10 days of such notice. If the breaching party fails to remedy the material breach in such time period, the non-breaching party may terminate this Agreement by immediate verbal notice to the breaching party. Any such termination shall relieve the breaching party from any obligation or liability arising prior to such termination.",
                "explanation": "Changing the notice from 'written' to 'verbal' and reducing the cure period from 30 days to 10 days creates non-compliance with standard contract law practices. Verbal notices are difficult to prove, and a 10-day cure period might be unreasonably short for rectifying substantial breaches. Moreover, the immediate release of obligation and liability arising from a material breach upon termination is against general contract law because it is often not enforced and would need to be evaluated by the court.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces the 'giving full effect' to its principles of conflicts of laws, which can lead to unpredictable outcomes regarding which state's laws actually apply. This is because conflicts of law principles determine which jurisdiction's laws govern when there are inconsistencies between the laws of different states. Changing this aspect introduces potential conflicts and ambiguities that could render the agreement unenforceable in certain situations. By adhering to the conflict of laws, it could create an even further contradiction in what law applies to the case, considering this is a New Jersey corporation.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for a proposed transfer of shares to 12 hours may be insufficient to allow the company to assess the situation. SEC regulations typically require a more extensive notification period to protect investors and ensure market stability. This contradiction can cause regulatory non-compliance.",

The closing of the purchase of such ROFR Shares by the Company and/or any such designee shall take place no later than the later of (i) the purchase date set forth in the ROFR Sale Documentation and (ii) five (5) business days after delivery of the ROFR Purchase Notice, with payment for such ROFR Shares being made concurrently with such purchase to the Farids Group's account designated in the ROFR Sale Notice.

                "explanation": "Decreasing the time for the company to decide whether to purchase shares and shortening the closing timeline (from 3 business days to 1, and from 5 to 2) could potentially contravene regulations aimed at ensuring fair opportunity for corporate decision-making and due diligence, potentially disadvantaging the Company and its shareholders.

                "explanation": "By changing the 'shall effect such registration' to 'may delay any form of registration until the company pleases to do so', and 'as expeditiously as reasonably possible' to 'as slowly as reasonably possible' creates a conflict. The company can now potentially not comply with the SEC requirements to register the sales of shares.

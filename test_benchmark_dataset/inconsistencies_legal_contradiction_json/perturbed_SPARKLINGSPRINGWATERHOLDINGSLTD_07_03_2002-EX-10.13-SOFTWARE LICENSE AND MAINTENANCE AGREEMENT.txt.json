            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Sparkling shall notify Garman in writing of any such claim within ten calendar days of a responsible officer of Sparkling becoming aware of such claim.",
                "changed_text": "Sparkling shall notify Garman in writing of any such claim within two calendar days of a responsible officer of Sparkling becoming aware of such claim.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for intellectual property indemnity claims to two days is unreasonable and could be deemed insufficient under general legal principles, particularly if complex investigations are required. Most jurisdictions would expect a more reasonable timeframe to allow for due diligence.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding reasonable notice periods and due diligence requirements.",
                "location": "Section 13"

                "original_text": "Sparkling may terminate this Agreement at any time upon ninety (90) calendar days written notice to Garman. If Sparkling terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 17(b), Sparkling shall cease using the Software at the end of the ninety (90) day notice period, and shall certify to Garman within thirty (30) calendar days of termination that Sparkling has destroyed or has returned to Garman all Software, Documentation and Codes.",
                "changed_text": "Sparkling may terminate this Agreement at any time upon thirty (30) calendar days written notice to Garman. If Sparkling terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 17(b), Sparkling shall cease using the Software at the end of the thirty (30) day notice period, and shall certify to Garman within five (5) calendar days of termination that Sparkling has destroyed or has returned to Garman all Software, Documentation and Codes.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice for termination to 30 days and the certification period to 5 days can create legal challenges. Generally, termination clauses are scrutinized for fairness, and a shorter notice period may be deemed commercially unreasonable, especially given the potential business disruption. Moreover, requiring certification of destruction/return of software within just five days may not be feasible for larger organizations, conflicting with reasonable business practices.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one year thereafter, both parties agree not to hire or allow its respective affiliates to hire any employee of the other party, or any person who was an employee of the other party during the previous six months and who was directly involved in the provision of services under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of five years thereafter, both parties agree not to hire or allow its respective affiliates to hire any employee of the other party, or any person who was an employee of the other party during the previous twelve months.",
                "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to five years and removing the qualification that the employee had to be directly involved in the provision of services renders the clause overly broad and potentially unenforceable. Such a lengthy period and lack of specific connection to the agreement's services could be seen as an unreasonable restraint of trade, violating principles of freedom of employment and potentially conflicting with laws prohibiting overly restrictive non-compete agreements. Many jurisdictions limit the duration and scope of non-solicitation agreements to protect employee mobility and fair competition.",
                "contradicted_law": "Common law principles against unreasonable restraints of trade. State laws regulating non-compete and non-solicitation agreements.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "C. MKOS will have 30-days from receipt of information to determine if they wish to go forward with the technology license. UTEK, after 30 days, shall have the right to present the technology to other clients.",
                "changed_text": "C. MKOS will have 10-days from receipt of information to determine if they wish to go forward with the technology license. UTEK, after 10 days, shall have the right to present the technology to other clients.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the decision period for MKOS to 10 days could be considered an unreasonably short timeframe, potentially violating fair dealing standards, particularly if the technology requires substantial evaluation. This contradicts general principles of contract law that require reasonable timeframes for decision-making.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "B. In consideration for the services to be provided herein, MKOS agrees that it will remit the agreed upon stock certificate or cash payment within five (5) days of both parties executing this Agreement. If no consideration is received in the timeline, UTEK has the unilateral option to terminate this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "B. In consideration for the services to be provided herein, MKOS agrees that it will remit the agreed upon stock certificate or cash payment within one (1) day of both parties executing this Agreement. If no consideration is received in the timeline, UTEK has the unilateral option to terminate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Shortening the payment remittance timeframe to one day places an unreasonable burden on MKOS, especially considering the complexities of stock transfers or large cash payments. This could violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it sets an unrealistic deadline that could easily lead to breach. Additionally, demanding immediate payment could create liquidity problems and financial challenges that run counter to standard business practices.",

                "location": "IV. B."

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time with 30 days written notice.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time with 1 days written notice.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for termination to 1 day is an unreasonably short timeframe that could be seen as a breach of good faith, particularly given the potential impact on either party. This creates non-compliance with standard contract law principles requiring reasonable notice for termination, as it causes financial risks and damages for both parties.",

                "original_text": "(a) Service Provider shall prepare and maintain all reports and other information relating to the SEF maintenance (the \"SEF O&M Reports\") and  make such SEF O&M Reports available to Owner (i) within ten (10) business days following performance of any Services under this Agreement  and (ii) upon reasonable request at any time\nby Owner, within ten (10) business days following such request. Service Provider shall make the SEF O&M Reports available to Owner in hard  copy and electronic formats.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Service Provider shall prepare and maintain all reports and other information relating to the SEF maintenance (the \"SEF O&M Reports\") and make such SEF O&M Reports available to Owner (i) within thirty (30) business days following performance of any Services under this Agreement and (ii) upon reasonable request at any time by Owner, within sixty (60) business days following such request. Service Provider shall make the SEF O&M Reports available to Owner solely in hard copy format.",
                "explanation": "California law requires employers to provide access to records within a reasonable timeframe. Increasing the timeframe to 30 and 60 days and limiting access to hard copies only unreasonably restricts access and contradicts the spirit of California labor laws regarding employee record access.",

Within five (5) days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, and upon Owner's payment in full  of the amounts due Service Provider under the Agreement, Service Provider shall deliver to Owner all of the SEF O&M Reports, SEF books,  records and property in its possession or under its control, and all materials, supplies, consumables, manuals and any other items furnished to  Service Provider by Owner.",

Within thirty (30) days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, and upon Owner's payment in full of the amounts due Service Provider under the Agreement, Service Provider shall deliver to Owner all of the SEF O&M Reports, SEF books, records and property in its possession or under its control, and all materials, supplies, consumables, manuals and any other items furnished to Service Provider by Owner.",
                "explanation": "Under California law, employers must provide final paychecks immediately upon termination. This extends the deadline of 5 days to deliver obligations following termination to 30 days. This is a contradiction to the California Labor code.  While this section concerns the delivery of records and equipment, delaying the fulfillment of these obligations can also delay the final wage calculation and payment.",

                "explanation": "California Prompt Payment Act generally requires payment within 30 days. Increasing this to 90 days constitutes a legal contradiction. Additionally, charging interest less than 1% could be a violation of usury laws depending on circumstances and could be flagged by regulatory agencies.",

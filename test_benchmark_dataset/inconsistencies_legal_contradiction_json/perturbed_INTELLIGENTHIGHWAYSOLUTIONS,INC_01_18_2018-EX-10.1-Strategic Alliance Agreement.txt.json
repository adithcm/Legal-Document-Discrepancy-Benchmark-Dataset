                "original_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with Fazync via email to IHSI's CEO, Devon Jones, and delivered through Bravatek or a Fazync -designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by Fazync at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at Fazync bank account.",
                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with Fazync via email to IHSI's CEO, Devon Jones, and delivered through Bravatek or a Fazync -designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by Fazync at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 90 days after each client payment on delivered products received at Fazync bank account.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment terms from NET 30 to NET 90 could create issues. While not universally illegal, such extended payment terms can be problematic under certain interpretations of prompt payment laws, particularly if they are significantly longer than industry standards or create undue hardship for the smaller party (Bravatek).",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state-specific prompt payment laws or fair business practices regulations depending on context and industry standards in Texas.",

Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof, and will be automatically renewed for one (1) additional twelve month period unless either party shall notify the other in writing of its intention not to renew. Such notice must be given thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the original term.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the non-renewal notification period from 90 days to 30 days may be deemed unreasonable in some jurisdictions. A shorter notice period could be challenged as insufficient, especially given the strategic alliance nature of the agreement, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Texas contract law. The reasonableness of the notice period is a factual determination that a court might find unreasonable.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period from five years to one year might be insufficient to protect trade secrets or other highly sensitive information, thus violating trade secret laws if the one-year period does not provide adequate protection against misappropriation. If the confidential information qualifies as trade secrets, the shorter period may not provide adequate protection.",

                "original_text": "Antares or its Subcontractor shall conduct a visual inspection of all Prefilled Syringes received at the Manufacturing Site not later than [***] after the date of receipt in accordance with the mutually agreed upon procedures. Antares or its Subcontractor shall promptly (and in any event within [***] following completion of applicable inspection) notify AMAG in writing of any visual inspection failure of the Prefilled Syringes.",
                "changed_text": "Antares or its Subcontractor shall conduct a visual inspection of all Prefilled Syringes received at the Manufacturing Site not later than 1 hour after the date of receipt in accordance with the mutually agreed upon procedures. Antares or its Subcontractor shall notify AMAG in writing of any visual inspection failure of the Prefilled Syringes within 72 hours following completion of applicable inspection.",
                "explanation": "The original text has the inspection time as [***], and notification time is also [***]. Shortening the inspection time to '1 hour' creates an unreasonable and potentially unachievable deadline, conflicting with cGMP requirements for thorough inspection. Increasing the notification time to '72 hours' is not prompt and may lead to delays in addressing quality issues.",

                "explanation": "The original text has a notification timeline of [***], which is 'prompt'. Changing the notification timeframe to '30 days' for potential safety issues related to the product is not prompt and conflicts with the requirement to report potential risks promptly.",

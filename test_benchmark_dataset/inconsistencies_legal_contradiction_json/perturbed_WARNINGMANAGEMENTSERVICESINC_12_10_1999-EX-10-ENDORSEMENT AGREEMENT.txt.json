                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days following the conclusion of each Contract Year Quarter, Company shall deliver to Pey Dirt an itemized statement setting forth the total shipments of Endorsed Products during said Contract Year Quarter and, at the same time, shall pay to Pey Dirt a royalty with respect to such shipments as hereinafter provided.",
                "changed_text": "Within ninety (90) days following the conclusion of each Contract Year Quarter, Company may deliver to Pey Dirt an itemized statement setting forth the total shipments of Endorsed Products during said Contract Year Quarter, and the payment of royalties will be scheduled at the company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within 30 days of the end of each quarter. The modified text extends the deadline to 90 days and makes royalty payment scheduling discretionary, potentially conflicting with prompt payment laws that many states, including Tennessee, have established. Delaying payment beyond a reasonable timeframe and making it discretionary introduces non-compliance.",

                "original_text": "Pey Dirt, or its representatives, shall, upon two weeks' written notice, have the right at all reasonable times (prior to the expiration of two (2) years after the termination of the Contract Period) to inspect and make copies of the books and records of Company insofar as they shall relate to the computation of royalties to be paid to Pey Dirt hereunder and the shipment of Endorsed Products pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Pey Dirt, or its representatives, shall, upon one week's written notice, have the right at all times Pey Dirt deems reasonable with no limitation to the Contract Period to inspect and make copies of the books and records of Company insofar as they shall relate to the computation of royalties to be paid to Pey Dirt hereunder and the shipment of Endorsed Products pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires two weeks' notice for inspection and limits the inspection period to two years after the contract terminates. The change reduces the notice period to one week and removes the limitation on the inspection period, which creates the right for perpetual inspection and copying of company records, irrespective of the termination of the agreement. This potentially violates business privacy laws and can be considered an unreasonable burden on the company, contradicting standard contract law principles.",

                "original_text": "Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, general liability insurance and product liability insurance with limits no less than $3,000,000 and within thirty (30) days from the date hereof, Company will submit to Pey Dirt a fully paid policy or certificate of insurance naming Pey Dirt, Pey Dirt's agent and Manning as additional insured parties, requiring that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such without written notice to Pey Dirt at least twenty (20) days in advance thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, general liability insurance and product liability insurance with limits no less than $500,000 and within ninety (90) days from the date hereof, Company will submit to Pey Dirt a certificate of insurance. Insurer shall provide a five (5) days' notice for termination of insurance to Pey Dirt.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires $3,000,000 in insurance coverage, submission of the policy within 30 days, and 20 days' notice for termination. The modified version reduces the insurance limit to $500,000, extends the submission deadline to 90 days, and drastically reduces the termination notice to only 5 days. This may violate standard industry practices or legal requirements for adequate insurance coverage in endorsement agreements, particularly concerning product liability. Also, reducing the insurance level will not protect the endorsed party.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Aduro shall pay Consultant any amounts due that are not reasonably disputed by Aduro, by check or direct bank deposit, within thirty days after receiving the invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Aduro shall pay Consultant any amounts due that are not reasonably disputed by Aduro, by check or direct bank deposit, within sixty days after receiving the invoice.",
                "explanation": "California law mandates that employers (and by extension, companies engaging consultants) pay undisputed amounts in a timely manner. While there's no explicit law specifying '30 days' for consultants, extending this to '60 days' creates a potential conflict, as it could be argued that this timeframe is unreasonably long, especially if it causes financial hardship for the consultant.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Labor Code Section 201 et seq. (regarding timely payment of wages) and general principles of contract law requiring good faith and fair dealing",
                "location": "Section 2"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "From the Effective Date and for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "From the Effective Date and for twenty-four (24) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates.",
                "explanation": "California law generally disfavors non-solicitation agreements that unduly restrict an individual's ability to work. While non-solicitation clauses are more readily enforced than non-compete clauses, extending the restricted period to twenty-four months makes the restriction overly broad and potentially unenforceable under California law, especially without a clear justification tied to the protection of trade secrets or confidential information.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600",
                "location": "Section 7"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "On Aduro's request, or upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, Consultant shall immediately: (i) stop using Confidential Information; (ii) return all materials provided by Aduro to Consultant that contain Confidential Information, except for one copy that may be retained by Consultant's legal counsel to confirm compliance with the obligations under this Agreement; (iii) destroy all copies of Confidential Information in any form including Confidential Information contained in computer memory or data storage apparatus or materials prepared by or for Consultant; and (iv) provide a written warranty to Aduro that Consultant has taken all the actions described in the foregoing Subparagraphs 4(c)(i-iii).",
                "changed_text": "Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, Consultant shall have 90 days to: (i) stop using Confidential Information; (ii) return all materials provided by Aduro to Consultant that contain Confidential Information; (iii) destroy all copies of Confidential Information in any form; and (iv) provide a written warranty to Aduro that Consultant has taken all the actions described in the foregoing Subparagraphs 4(c)(i-iii).",
                "explanation": "Delaying the return/destruction of confidential information for 90 days after termination creates risk and uncertainty that contradicts reasonable security protocols for intellectual property protection, especially regarding digital data. Making it 'have 90 days' instead of 'immediately' introduces a window where the consultant can exploit that information, potentially damaging Aduro.",
                "contradicted_law": "Likely violates standard business practices for trade secret protection and potentially increases Aduro's liability regarding maintaining the confidentiality of its data. California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA) may be impacted if information is leaked during the 90 day window.",

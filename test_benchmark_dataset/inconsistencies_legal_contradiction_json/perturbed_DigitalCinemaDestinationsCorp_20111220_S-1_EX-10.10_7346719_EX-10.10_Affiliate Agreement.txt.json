Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all amounts due by one Party to the other under this Agreement, less any permitted deductions, shall be paid in full within sixty (60) days after the fiscal month in which such amounts were received by the paying Party, or the receipt by the paying Party of an invoice therefore, as applicable.",

Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all amounts due by one Party to the other under this Agreement, less any permitted deductions, shall be paid in full within ninety (90) days after the fiscal month in which such amounts were received by the paying Party, or the receipt by the paying Party of an invoice therefore, as applicable.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within 60 days, however, making it 90 days introduces a delay in payment that may contradict prompt payment laws in some states or specific industry regulations that mandate shorter payment periods.",

If no agreement is reached during that 10-day period, then neither party shall have any obligation to extend this Agreement beyond the Initial Term.",

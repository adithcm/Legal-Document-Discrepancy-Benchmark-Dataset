                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "$10,000 Within ten (10) days of the parties execution of this Agreement\n$15,000 Within 60 days of the parties execution of this agreement\n$25,000* Ten (10) days prior to the Production Session",
                "changed_text": "$10,000 Within thirty (30) days of the parties execution of this Agreement\n$15,000 Within 120 days of the parties execution of this agreement\n$25,000* One (1) day prior to the Production Session",
                "explanation": "The payment schedule is modified to potentially create cash flow issues for the celebrity, especially pushing the second payment to 120 days. Moreover, requiring the final payment only one day before the production session creates undue pressure and risk for the celebrity, especially if Georgia law mandates certain payment deadlines to avoid penalties. Some jurisdictions demand quicker final payments, and altering this could be seen as exploitative.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of prompt payment laws or fair business practices, varying by jurisdiction but applicable to payment timelines.",

                "changed_text": "Said\nwritten approval must be given within one (1) business day of CSE's receipt or said usage shall be deemed\nunapproved.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the approval time to one business day puts undue pressure on the celebrity and their agent to review and approve materials quickly. This is an unreasonably short period and is a legal contradiction, potentially infringing on the celebrity's right to careful consideration and approval as it might not provide sufficient time for adequate legal or professional review. This could be considered bad faith or unconscionable behavior depending on the jurisdiction.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of good faith and fair dealing principles, or state laws requiring reasonable review periods in contracts.",
                "location": "9"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "HDS shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Celebrity in\nthe event Celebrity fails to perform the duties set forth in Paragraph 4 hereof or breaches any other\ncovenant or agreement set forth herein and fails to cure same (if curable) within seven (7) days of receipt of\nwritten notice.",
                "changed_text": "HDS shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon one (1) days prior written notice to Celebrity in\nthe event Celebrity fails to perform the duties set forth in Paragraph 4 hereof or breaches any other\ncovenant or agreement set forth herein and fails to cure same (if curable) within two (2) days of receipt of\nwritten notice.",
                "explanation": "Reducing both the notice period for termination to one day and the cure period to two days is unreasonably short. Many states require more reasonable notice and cure periods to protect parties from abrupt contract terminations. This shortened period infringes on the celebrity's ability to rectify any issues and creates an imbalance in power, potentially rendering the clause unenforceable due to its oppressive nature.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates state laws regarding reasonable notice and cure periods for contract termination, and could be seen as an unconscionable contract clause.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows 120 days for acceptance testing and 15 days for defect correction, which is a common and reasonable timeframe. Changing it to 30 days for acceptance testing and 75 days for defect correction can be seen as unreasonable or insufficient under certain software licensing laws or general commercial practices, especially if defects are significant, creating potential legal challenges regarding breach of contract or failure of essential purpose.",

                "changed_text": "Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for subsequent one\n          (1) year periods unless either party provides the other party with\n          written notification at least five (5) days prior to the expiration\n          of the initial five (5) year term or any one (1) year renewal thereof\n          of its intention to terminate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 30 days' notice for termination, which is a common timeframe. Reducing this to 5 days creates a contradiction, as it does not provide enough time to find a replacement. The time for notification can be seen as unreasonable under contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding 'reasonable notice' for termination, potential violations of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "Within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date,\n          Changepoint agrees to execute an escrow agreement by and among Corio,\n          Changepoint and a mutually acceptable escrow agent (the \"ESCROW\n          AGENT\").",

                "explanation": "Changing the timeframe for executing the escrow agreement from 60 to 180 days introduces a delay that could significantly impact Corio's rights, especially if Changepoint were to face financial difficulties. Such a delay in setting up source code escrow contradicts typical software licensing and escrow standards, potentially jeopardizing Corio's ability to support its customers. Making the number higher than the original may create a contradiction because this clause can be seen as unreasonable, and not in the best interest of the client.",

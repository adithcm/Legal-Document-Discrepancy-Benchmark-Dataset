                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Any late payments under this Agreement will be assessed a service fee of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, to the extent allowed by law.",
                "changed_text": "Any late payments under this Agreement will be assessed a service fee of ten percent (10%) per month, regardless of any legal limitations.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a potential conflict with state usury laws, which often cap the maximum interest rate or late fee that can be charged on debts. By stating 'regardless of any legal limitations,' the contract attempts to override such legal protections, potentially making the clause unenforceable or illegal.",
                "contradicted_law": "State usury laws (e.g., California usury law)",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in full force and effect until one (1) year subsequent to the Effective Date, provided however, that Tickets may terminate this Agreement for any reason without notice to MP3.com at any time.",
                "explanation": "This modification allows Tickets.com to terminate the agreement at any time without any notice period. This contradicts the general principles of contract law, which require reasonable notice for termination, especially if the agreement has a defined term. Eliminating the notice period could be considered a breach of contract and may violate implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "Any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement must be brought exclusively in the courts of MP3.com's choosing, regardless of jurisdiction or fairness.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly alters the forum selection clause. Removing the specified location (San Diego County, California) and granting MP3.com unilateral control over court selection, 'regardless of jurisdiction or fairness,' could be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable, particularly if it forces Tickets.com to litigate in an inconvenient or biased forum. This also conflicts with principles of fair and reasonable dispute resolution.",

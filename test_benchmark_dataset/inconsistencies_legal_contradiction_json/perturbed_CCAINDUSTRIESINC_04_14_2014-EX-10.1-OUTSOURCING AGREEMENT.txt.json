            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Service Fees shall be paid to Contractor within five (5) days after the end of each month.",
                "changed_text": "Service Fees shall be paid to Contractor within sixty (60) days after the end of each month.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that service fees will be paid within five days. This modification extends the deadline to sixty days, which could violate state laws regarding prompt payment, particularly in states like California, where payment is mandated within shorter timeframes.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Labor Code Sections 201, 202 and 203 regarding timely payment of wages.",

                "original_text": "Contractor shall use its best efforts to deposit the foregoing amounts within five (5) business days, following the receipt thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Contractor shall deposit the foregoing amounts within thirty (30) business days, following the receipt thereof.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates deposit of funds within five business days, but the modified text extends it to thirty business days. This delay in depositing funds belonging to the Company may violate state regulations concerning holding and remitting funds promptly, potentially leading to issues of commingling or unauthorized use of funds.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of agency law and fiduciary duty requiring prompt remittance of funds held on behalf of another party; specific state laws regulating holding of funds.",

                "original_text": "During the Term of this agreement, and for a period of twenty four (24)months after Termination (the \"Withholding Period\"), Contractor may retain monies (collections in Accounts Receivable) against any reasonable anticipated deductions for product recalls, unsalables, rebates, allowances or any audits or other adjustments it deems necessary.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this agreement, Contractor may retain monies (collections in Accounts Receivable) indefinitely against any deductions for product recalls, unsalables, rebates, allowances or any audits or other adjustments it deems necessary.",
                "explanation": "The original text limits the withholding period to 24 months post-termination. The modified text removes this limitation, allowing the Contractor to withhold monies indefinitely. This indefinite withholding is likely unenforceable as an unreasonable restraint and could violate state laws requiring timely settlement of accounts upon contract termination, violating principles of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws regarding good faith and fair dealing in contracts; principles of contract law regarding reasonable time limits.",

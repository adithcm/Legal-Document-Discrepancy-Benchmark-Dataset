                "changed_text": "Either party (\"the Terminating Party\") may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice to the other party (the \"Defaulting Party\") upon the occurrence of any of the following conditions:\n\n              (i) In the event that such party materially breaches this   Agreement or materially defaults in the performance of any obligation hereunder and fails to cure said breach within 10 days of written notice to the Defaulting Party by the Terminating Party;",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from 30 days to 10 days may be considered unreasonable and could conflict with general contract law principles regarding adequate opportunity to cure a breach, potentially making the termination clause unenforceable. This creates an unreasonable burden on the defaulting party.",

Such policies shall provide for at least five (5) days' written notice to Logan's of the cancellation or substantial modification thereof.",
                "explanation": "Changing the written notice period for cancellation or modification of the insurance policy from 15 days to 5 days creates a legal contradiction. Most insurance regulations and standard business practices require a minimum of 10-30 days' notice for policy changes to allow the beneficiary adequate time to secure alternative coverage, violating standard insurance notification practices.",

In consideration of the services provided, SRP shall  be entitled to a base fee of Eighty Thousand Dollars and No/100's (580,000.00) payable as follows:\n\n         (i) $40,000.00 payable upon execution of this contract; and\n\n         (ii) the balance of $40,000.00 payable in eight equal monthly   installments of $5,000 each, due the first day of March, April, May, June, July, August, September and October, 1998.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment terms from a schedule of specific dates to the company's discretion creates a legal contradiction. Most jurisdictions require a clear payment schedule to prevent disputes. Paying the balance at the company's discretion introduces ambiguity and an environment where the payment can be delayed indefinitely, violating the legal requirement that payment terms should be definite and can be enforced.",

                "original_text": "5.4Acceptance, Rejection, and Claims. APOLLO may inspect any or all shipments of Product to insure all specifications are met including proper labeling, packaging and count within thirty (30) business days of APOLLO's receipt of each shipment; however, any such inspection shall not relieve ESTABLISHMENT of any obligations or warranties under this Agreement. APOLLO has the right to reject, via written notification to ESTABLISHMENT within this thirty (30) day period, any or all of a shipment of Product that fails to satisfy any warranty in this Agreement and may reject all of a given Lot of Product if a statistical sample does not meet the Specifications. Upon confirmation of defective condition by ESTABLISHMENT and issuance of a return material authorization (\"RMA\") number, APOLLO shall be entitled to the immediate return and replacement, free of charge, of any Product supplied by ESTABLISHMENT in breach of any warranty under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "5.4Acceptance, Rejection, and Claims. APOLLO may inspect any or all shipments of Product to insure all specifications are met including proper labeling, packaging and count within ten (10) business days of APOLLO's receipt of each shipment; however, any such inspection shall not relieve ESTABLISHMENT of any obligations or warranties under this Agreement.

This alteration could prejudice APOLLO's rights to discover latent defects.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for indemnification claims from 30 days to 5 days is unreasonably short.

                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period from five years to one year for manufacturing and quality control records contradicts FDA requirements (21 CFR Part 820) for medical device manufacturers, which mandate longer retention periods to ensure traceability and compliance.

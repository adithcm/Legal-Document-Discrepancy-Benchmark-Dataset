The Party rendering an invoice shall furnish such further details of such invoice as the other Parties may reasonably require. On the basis of such invoices, the CBP shall pay such amounts as may be owed sixty (60) days from the 10th calendar day of the month in which the invoice was rendered or on the following working day if day sixty (60) is not a working day in the CBP's Country.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the CBP shall pay the amounts owed sixty (60) days from the 10th calendar day of the month in which the invoice was rendered. The modified text extends this payment deadline to ninety (90) days. This introduces non-compliance with standard business practice and accounting principles, which generally require payment within 30-60 days to maintain healthy cash flow and supplier relationships.",

For the purpose of this Agreement, extended payment charges shall be computed at three hundred percent (300%) of the rate described in Subparagraph 7.8 on the day following the date payment on the bill was due. In the event that applicable law does not allow the imposition of extended payment charges at the rate established in accordance with this Subparagraph 7.9, extended payment charges shall be at the highest rate permitted by applicable law, which in no event shall be higher than the rate computed in accordance with this Subparagraph 7.9. For purposes of this Agreement, \"paid\" shall mean that the funds are immediately available for use by the recipient.",

If the due date is not a business day, the due date shall be postponed to the next business day.

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that extended payment charges will be computed at three hundred percent (300%) of the agreed rate. The modified text increases this to five hundred percent (500%).

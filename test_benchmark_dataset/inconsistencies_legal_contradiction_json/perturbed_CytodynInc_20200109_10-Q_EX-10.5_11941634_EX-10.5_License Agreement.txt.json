                "original_text": "Within forty-five (45) days following the end of each Calendar Quarter after the First Commercial Sale of each Licensed Product in the Territory, Vyera shall provide CytoDyn with a report in a form reasonably acceptable to CytoDyn containing the following information for the applicable Calendar Quarter for such Licensed Product: (a) the amount of gross sales of the Licensed Product in the Territory; (b) an itemized calculation of Net Sales in the Territory showing reasonably detailed deductions; provided for in the definition of \"Net Sales\"; (c) a reasonably detailed calculation of the royalty payment due on such sales; (d) an accounting of the number of units of the Licensed Product sold; and (e) the application of the reduction, if any, made in accordance with the terms of Section 8.7. Vyera shall pay all amounts due to CytoDyn with respect to Net Sales by Vyera or its Affiliates for such Calendar Quarter at the time of the submission of such quarterly report.",
                "changed_text": "Within 90 days following the end of each Calendar Year after the First Commercial Sale of each Licensed Product in the Territory, Vyera shall provide CytoDyn with a report in a form reasonably acceptable to VytoDyn containing the following information for the applicable Calendar Year for such Licensed Product: (a) the amount of gross sales of the Licensed Product in the Territory; (b) an itemized calculation of Net Sales in the Territory showing reasonably detailed deductions; provided for in the definition of \"Net Sales\"; (c) a reasonably detailed calculation of the royalty payment due on such sales; (d) an accounting of the number of units of the Licensed Product sold; and (e) the application of the reduction, if any, made in accordance with the terms of Section 8.7. Vyera shall pay all amounts due to CytoDyn with respect to Net Sales by Vyera or its Affiliates for such Calendar Year at the time of the submission of such yearly report.",
                "explanation": "The original text specified royalty reports and payments on a quarterly basis. The modification changes this to an annual basis, potentially delaying payments to CytoDyn. Publicly traded companies must file quarterly and annual reports. Delaying royalty payments annually can cause issues with finance, reporting, and taxes.",

                "explanation": "By removing the seven-day deadline for the equity investment, this change makes the timeline for investment ambigious and at Vyera's discretion. This contradicts financial regulations that require clear and prompt payment terms, particularly in agreements of this nature. Delayed or indefinite payment conflicts with generally accepted accounting principles and could violate securities regulations related to timely disclosures of material financial transactions.",

CytoDyn shall conduct the activities under the Development Plan, and shall ensure that its Affiliates and contractors conduct their activities under the Development Plan, in a good scientific manner and in material compliance with Applicable Law, including cGLP, cGCP, cGMP and applicable national and international guidelines. For clarity, the Development Plan will only include activities related to indications in the Field.",
                "changed_text": "CytoDyn will conduct activities under the Development Plan at its convenience and in a manner it deems appropriate. CytoDyn will conduct the activities under the Development Plan, and will not need to ensure that its Affiliates and contractors conduct their activities under the Development Plan, in a good scientific manner and in material compliance with Applicable Law, including cGLP, cGCP, cGMP and applicable national and international guidelines. For clarity, the Development Plan will only include activities related to indications in the Field.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires CytoDyn to use 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' and to maintain material compliance with 'Applicable Law,' including cGLP, cGCP, and cGMP. The change removes the 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' standard and suggests that the activities will be conducted at CytoDyn's convenience. It also indicates they don't have to ensure their affiliates comply with the law. It also removes the need for CytoDyn and its affiliates to comply with Applicable Law. This could allow for practices that violate federal regulations for drug development and testing, as well as ethical standards.",

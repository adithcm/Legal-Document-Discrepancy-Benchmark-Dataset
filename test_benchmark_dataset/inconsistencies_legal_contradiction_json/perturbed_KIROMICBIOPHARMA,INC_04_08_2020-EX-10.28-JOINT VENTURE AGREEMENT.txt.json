            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Steering Committee shall appoint, within 30 days of the signature of this JV, a Technical Committee composed of one representative of each of the Parties in relation to each specific -3- clinical trial program, which shall have the function of coordinating the technical and administrative activities to be undertaken in the framework of this JV.",
                "changed_text": "The Steering Committee shall appoint, within 90 days of the signature of this JV, a Technical Committee composed of one representative of each of the Parties in relation to each specific -3- clinical trial program, which shall have the function of coordinating the technical and administrative activities to be undertaken in the framework of this JV.",
                "explanation": "Changing the deadline for appointing the Technical Committee to 90 days could contradict standard business practice requiring timely project commencement, especially in research settings where momentum is key. This delay can obstruct the project's prompt progress, potentially conflicting with regulations emphasizing prompt commencement of research activities.",

                "explanation": "Extending the notification period for intellectual property rights achievement to 90 days creates non-compliance with best practices for IP protection. Quick notification is vital for securing IP rights; a 90-day delay could lead to losing priority in patent applications, violating the duty to protect and maximize the joint venture's IP assets.",

                "changed_text": "The consent of Kiromic will be tacitly granted after 5 days from receipt of the request for authorization of disclosure.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the consent period for publication approval to 5 days places unreasonable constraints on the reviewing party. It potentially infringes on their ability to conduct thorough due diligence, ensure accuracy, and safeguard proprietary information. This abbreviated timeline introduces compliance issues with contractual fairness.",

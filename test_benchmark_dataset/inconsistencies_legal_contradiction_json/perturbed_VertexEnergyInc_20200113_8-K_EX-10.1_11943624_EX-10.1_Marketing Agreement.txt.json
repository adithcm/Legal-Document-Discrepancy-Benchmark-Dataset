                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Payment by Bunker One for the Product, as defined in clause 2.1, will be made by wire transfer within three (3) Business Days after the date Vertex invoices Bunker One, to an account desig- nated from time to time by Vertex.",
                "changed_text": "Payment by Bunker One for the Product, as defined in clause 2.1, will be made at the discretion of Bunker One, no later than 60 Business Days after the date Vertex invoices Bunker One, to an account desig- nated from time to time by Vertex.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires payment within three business days, while the modification extends this to 60 business days and makes it discretionary, contradicting prompt payment laws that mandate timely payment for goods and services. This introduces non-compliance, as many jurisdictions have laws ensuring invoices are paid within a reasonable timeframe (typically much shorter than 60 days) to protect suppliers.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows for a three-business-day cure period for payment failures. This modification reduces the cure period to one business day, which may conflict with standard commercial practices and legal requirements for providing a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach of contract. A one-day cure period could be deemed unreasonably short, especially for larger payment amounts that may require more time to arrange.",

                "explanation": "By making the confidentiality cease immediately upon termination, this contradicts standard business practices and legal precedents regarding the protection of trade secrets and confidential information. Many jurisdictions recognize the need for ongoing protection of confidential information even after a contract ends, particularly for trade secrets and proprietary data.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a clause requiring disputes to be filed within 30 days. This contradicts typical statutes of limitations for contract disputes, which are significantly longer (often several years, depending on the jurisdiction and the type of contract).",

                "explanation": "This change stipulates that the agreement can be terminated with only 24 hours' written notice. This is an unreasonably short notice period, especially considering the complex nature of joint filing agreements involving international entities. It would likely be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable in many jurisdictions, potentially conflicting with good faith and fair dealing principles implied in contract law.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a condition that the agreement is only valid if signed within 7 days of the stated date. While agreements typically become binding upon signature, this introduces a hyper-strict and potentially unreasonable timeline. If any party signed slightly later, the agreement could be contested, which is contradictory to general standards of contract law that focus on good faith execution and intent of parties involved.",

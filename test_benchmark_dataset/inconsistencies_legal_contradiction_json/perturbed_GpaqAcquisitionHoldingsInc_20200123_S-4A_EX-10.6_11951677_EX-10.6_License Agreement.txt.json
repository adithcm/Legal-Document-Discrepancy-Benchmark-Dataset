                "original_text": "The Advisory Board shall, within fourteen (14) days of its receipt of the Notice, make a recommendation to PFHOF to either approve or reject such proposal as set forth in the Notice. PFHOF shall, within fourteen (14) days of its receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, either approve or reject the proposal as set forth in the Notice. If PFHOF does not approve the proposal as set forth in the Notice within fourteen (14) days of PFHOF's receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, such proposal shall be deemed rejected by PFHOF.",

PFHOF shall, within seventy-two (72) hours of its receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, either approve or reject the proposal as set forth in the Notice. If PFHOF does not approve the proposal as set forth in the Notice within seventy-two (72) hours of PFHOF's receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, such proposal shall be deemed rejected by PFHOF.",
                "explanation": "This modification reduces the review period for both the Advisory Board and PFHOF to 72 hours (3 days). This creates an unreasonably short timeframe for reviewing complex proposals, potentially conflicting with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, especially if extensive due diligence or legal review is required. Such short deadlines could be deemed commercially unreasonable under Ohio law, which governs the contract.",

                "original_text": "After good faith consultation with the Advisory Board, either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time for an uncured material breach by the other Party, including the non-payment of the Annual Guarantee, license fees and staffing fees, provided that the non-breaching Party provides prior written notice to the breaching Party, specifying the alleged material breach, and further provided that the breaching Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to cure the material breach, to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party; provided, further, that if such breach (other than a breach for non-payment) cannot be cured during such 30-day period, but the allegedly breaching Party has commenced and is continuing good faith efforts to cure such breach within such 30-day period, then the cure period shall be extended until the allegedly breaching Party has stopped making good faith efforts to cure such breach, such extension not to exceed ninety (90) days.",
                "changed_text": "After consultation with the Advisory Board, either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time for any breach by the other Party, provided that the non-breaching Party provides prior written notice to the breaching Party, specifying the alleged breach, and further provided that the breaching Party shall have five (5) days after receipt of such notice to cure the breach, to the satisfaction of the non-breaching Party.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly reduces the cure period for any breach (including material breaches) from 30 days (with a potential extension to 90 days) to a mere 5 days. This is an unreasonably short cure period, especially for complex breaches that require significant investigation or remediation. In addition, the text change also gives the right to terminate the agreement for 'any breach', not 'material breach', which might contradict Ohio law. Under Ohio contract law, a cure period of 5 days may be deemed commercially unreasonable, especially if it concerns complex financial or operational breaches.",

                "explanation": "By removing the qualifying phrases 'as of the date of disclosure', 'or its Affiliates', 'without access to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information', 'through no fault of the Receiving Party', and 'free from any obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party', the definition of what is *not* considered Confidential Information is broadened excessively. This weakening of confidentiality protections could be deemed commercially unreasonable. Also, the phrase 'as shown by written documentation' has been removed from the initial definition of confidential information, which contradicts most standards of confidentiality in Ohio.",

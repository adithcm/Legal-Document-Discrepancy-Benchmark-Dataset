                "changed_text": "As a result of its planned move to BISYS,  United  National will be  liquidating  its interest  in United  Financial  Services no later than 90 days after it goes live with BISYS.",
                "explanation": "This modification imposes a deadline of 'no later than 90 days' for the liquidation of United National's interest in United Financial Services. This could create legal inconsistencies. Liquidation processes, especially those involving financial institutions, are subject to regulatory oversight and may require specific timelines mandated by state or federal laws (e.g., securities regulations, banking laws). If the legally required timeline for such a liquidation is longer (or shorter under some circumstances) than 90 days, this clause would be in direct conflict with those regulations.",

                "explanation": "This modification adds a clause stating 'United National is not required to disclose the specifics or details of this evaluation to shareholders.'

This agreement will be automatically extended indefinitely after the initial term, unless United National provides a written notice of termination 15 days prior to contract end.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'This agreement will be automatically extended indefinitely after the initial term, unless United National provides a written notice of termination 15 days prior to contract end' creates a potential legal contradiction. Many states have laws regarding automatic renewal clauses in contracts, particularly those involving services. Requiring only 15 days' notice to prevent automatic renewal might be deemed unconscionable or violate state-specific regulations requiring longer notice periods (e.g., 30 or 60 days) for automatic renewal clauses to be enforceable. Additionally, automatic renewals may not be enforceable if the contract does not meet certain disclosure requirements at the beginning of the agreement.",

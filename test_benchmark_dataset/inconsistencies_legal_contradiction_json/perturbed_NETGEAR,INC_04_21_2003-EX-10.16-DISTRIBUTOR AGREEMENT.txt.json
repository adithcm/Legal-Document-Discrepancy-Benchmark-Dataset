                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "E.       PAYMENT. Except as may be specifically authorized in writing by NETGEAR, and subject to NETGEAR's continuing approval of Distributor's credit status and financial condition, Distributor will pay NETGEAR for all Products ordered by Distributor within [*] of the date the corresponding invoice is issued by NETGEAR. The foregoing notwithstanding, the parties agree that payment for the initial order placed by Distributor under this Agreement shall be due and payable within [*] of the date the corresponding invoice is issued by NETGEAR. NETGEAR, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to specify, and to change from time to time, Distributor's credit line and payment terms.",
                "changed_text": "E.       PAYMENT. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, Distributor will pay NETGEAR for all Products ordered at NETGEAR's sole discretion, without any specific timeframe. NETGEAR reserves the right to modify the payment terms as they see fit, without any written notice to the Distributor. The Distributor shall adhere to any payment changes regardless of their financial condition or status.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction because it removes the set timeframe for payment, giving NETGEAR the right to demand payment at any time without notice. This contradicts standard commercial practices and potentially violates laws requiring reasonable payment terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Unconscionability in Contract Law, potentially Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) regarding sales contracts.",

                "changed_text": "B.       CANCELLATION AND RESCHEDULING. Distributor has no right to cancel or reschedule any order once it has been placed with NETGEAR. All orders are final and binding upon submission.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the distributor's right to cancel or reschedule orders, conflicting with standard business practices and potentially violating UCC provisions on buyer's rights. It's an unreasonable restriction on the distributor.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Unconscionability in Contract Law, potentially Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) regarding sales contracts.",

                "original_text": "B.       TERMINATION. This Agreement may be canceled at any time without cause, by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice to the other party. Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately if (i) the other party becomes insolvent, files or has filed against it a petition in bankruptcy, or ceases doing business; or (ii) the other party fails to cure a material breach of the Agreement within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of such breach from the party not in default. Upon termination of the Agreement by NETGEAR for Distributor's breach, NETGEAR may cancel all of Distributor's unfulfilled orders without further obligation. This Agreement may be terminated at any time without cause by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "B.       TERMINATION. NETGEAR may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason, without prior notice. Distributor may only terminate this agreement if NETGEAR consents in writing. Upon termination by NETGEAR, all of Distributor's unfulfilled orders are automatically canceled, and NETGEAR retains the right to fulfill or cancel them at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This creates a highly unbalanced termination clause, allowing NETGEAR to terminate at will without notice, while severely restricting the Distributor's termination rights. This could be considered unconscionable and violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

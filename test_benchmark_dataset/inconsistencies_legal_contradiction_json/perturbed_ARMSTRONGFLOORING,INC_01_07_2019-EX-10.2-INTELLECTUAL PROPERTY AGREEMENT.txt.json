                "changed_text": "Each of AWP and the Company shall change its respective corporate name and trade name and cause its organizational documents to be amended to remove any reference to \"Armstrong\" at their earliest convenience.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 30-day deadline for changing the corporate name and trade name, removing any reference to \"Armstrong\". The modified text replaces this with 'at their earliest convenience', which eliminates a fixed deadline. This creates a legal contradiction, as many states require businesses to operate under their legally registered name and any deviation or assumed name (DBA) must be properly registered within a specific timeframe, typically shorter than 'earliest convenience' might imply. Failure to comply with state assumed name or corporate registration laws can lead to fines, penalties, and legal complications.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows a 24-month phase-out period for certain trademarks. The modified text replaces this with 'phase out use at their discretion', removing any concrete obligation or deadline. This change introduces legal issues related to trademark infringement and unfair competition. If the Company continues to use trademarks that they do not own or have the right to use, even during a supposed 'phase-out,' they could be subject to legal action for trademark infringement. Federal trademark law and state unfair competition laws do not typically allow companies to indefinitely use another's trademarks at their discretion.",

                "explanation": "The original text grants the Company or Buyer the right to institute proceedings against infringers if Arizona declines to do so within 45 days. The modified text adds 'subject to Arizona's approval,' essentially negating the previous right and placing sole discretion with Arizona. This conflicts with antitrust laws which prevent monopolistic practices. By requiring Arizona's approval, Arizona could potentially stifle competition by preventing legal action against infringers, giving them an unfair market advantage.",

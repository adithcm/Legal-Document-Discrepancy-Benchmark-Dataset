            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All revenue sharing will be reconciled monthly and funds distributed by the 20th of each month by wire transfer for all net collected revenues for the previous month (net of returns and refunds, if any).",
                "changed_text": "All revenue sharing will be reconciled quarterly and funds distributed 90 days after the end of each quarter by wire transfer for all net collected revenues for the previous quarter (net of returns and refunds, if any).",
                "explanation": "Delaying the revenue sharing reconciliation and distribution to a quarterly basis with a 90-day delay after each quarter's end introduces a potential conflict with standard business practices and could be seen as an unreasonably long delay, potentially violating state laws related to timely payments or breach of contract principles if it causes undue hardship.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state laws related to timely payments and breach of contract principles.",
                "location": "Section 1"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Thereafter, this Agreement shall be renewed automatically on a five (5) year basis, unless one party notifies the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement at least sixty 90 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or then current renewal term, as applicable, or unless a new Agreement is signed between the USA MCO and IMedicor which will then invalidate this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Thereafter, this Agreement shall be renewed automatically on a five (5) year basis, unless one party notifies the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or then current renewal term, as applicable, or unless a new Agreement is signed between the USA MCO and IMedicor which will then invalidate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for termination from 90 days to 30 days may conflict with standard contract law principles requiring reasonable notice for termination, especially given the long-term nature of the agreement. Some states may require a longer notice period for agreements of this nature.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state contract law regarding reasonable notice for termination.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the event that USA MCO fails to promptly indemnify and defend such claims and/or pay expenses as provided above, IMedicor shall have the right to defend itself and USA MCO shall reimburse IMedicor for all of its reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and damages incurred in settling or defending such claims within sixty (60) days of IMedicor' request for same.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that USA MCO fails to promptly indemnify and defend such claims and/or pay expenses as provided above, IMedicor shall have the right to defend itself and USA MCO shall reimburse IMedicor for all of its reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and damages incurred in settling or defending such claims within 180 days of IMedicor' request for same.",
                "explanation": "Changing the reimbursement timeframe from 60 days to 180 days might be viewed as excessively long and could conflict with general legal principles that obligate parties to promptly mitigate damages. Extended delays in reimbursement can result in greater financial harm, which raises legal issues about fair business conduct and unjust enrichment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of legal principles regarding prompt mitigation of damages and unjust enrichment.",

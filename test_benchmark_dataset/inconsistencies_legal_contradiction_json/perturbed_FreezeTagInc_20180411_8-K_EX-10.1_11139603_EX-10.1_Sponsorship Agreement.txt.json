Insurance: During the term of this Agreement, and before any sponsorship or promotional activities are conducted under this Agreement, Company shall obtain and maintain at its expense, Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage with an insurance carrier with a Best's rating of B-. The insurance shall be in an amount of: $500,000 per occurrence and $500,000 aggregate with a $500,000 aggregate for products and completed operations.

Such insurance shall be primary and non-contributory.",
                "explanation": "The original text required a Best's rating of A+ for the insurance carrier and provided a 30-day cancellation notice and 10-day non-payment notice. The modified text reduces the required rating to B-, significantly lowers the insurance coverage amounts, and shortens the cancellation and non-payment notice periods to 5 and 2 days respectively. This can be problematic as adequate insurance coverage is essential to protect against potential liabilities, and these changes can be deemed insufficient, violating the standard of care expected in business agreements. The notice period change is a violation of standard practice, as it doesn't give adequate time to find alternative insurance.",

                "explanation": "The modified text significantly reduces the cure period for a breach of contract from ten business days to two business days, which may be unreasonably short depending on the nature of the breach, this could contradict standard business law regarding reasonable cure periods. Additionally, it changes the notice requirement for insolvency-related termination from 'written notice' to 'verbal notice' and reduces the dismissal period from 90 to 15 days. Verbal notice could be legally insufficient and difficult to prove, and the shortened dismissal period is less than is considered reasonable by courts, potentially conflicting with bankruptcy laws and creditor's rights.",

The modified text replaces all those accepted and legal methods for 'telepathy'. This is an absurd and legally unsound change, as telepathy is not a recognized or legally enforceable method for delivering official notices.

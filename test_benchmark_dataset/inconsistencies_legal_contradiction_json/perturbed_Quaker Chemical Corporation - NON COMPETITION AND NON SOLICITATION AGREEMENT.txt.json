                "original_text": "(b) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the \"Non- Compete Period\"), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, not more than five (5%) percent collectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged; (ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in such Seller's business as conducted on the Effective Date and reasonable extensions thereof, which may include routine, day-to-day transactions with any entity, and (iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller acquires control after the Effective Date provided that the acquired business did not receive more than $25,000,000 of its aggregate net sales (as measured during the 12 full calendar months prior to such acquisition) from product lines included within the definition of Company Business. Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending ten years after the Closing Date (the \"Non- Compete Period\"), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, including India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, not more than one (1%) percent collectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged; (ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in such Seller's business as conducted on the Effective Date with no extensions thereof, which may not include any transactions with any entity, and (iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller acquires control after the Effective Date provided that the acquired business did receive more than $25,000 of its aggregate net sales (as measured during the 12 full calendar months prior to such acquisition) from product lines included within the definition of Company Business. Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope.",
                "explanation": "The change from two years to ten years for the non-compete period is likely to be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable in many jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, as it places an undue burden on the Seller's ability to earn a living. Moreover, the inclusion of India contradicts the original exclusion. Reducing the passive investor ownership percentage and limiting extensions of business further restrict the seller, increasing the likelihood of unenforceability. Allowing acquired businesses with sales over $25,000 to fall under restrictions also broadens the scope unreasonably.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pennsylvania law on non-compete agreements requires reasonable restrictions in time and scope. Longer durations are generally disfavored.",

                "original_text": "(d) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the \"Non-Solicit Period\"), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former",
                "changed_text": "(d) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and lasting forever (the \"Non-Solicit Period\"), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least one day prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of no solicitation through any medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former",
                "explanation": "Changing the non-solicit period to \"forever\" is almost certainly an unreasonable restraint on trade and is likely unenforceable. Reducing the waiting period for soliciting former employees to \"one day\" from six months, while simultaneously prohibiting any form of solicitation for current employees removes any reasonable allowance. This overreach makes the clause likely to be struck down by a court.",

                "explanation": "The agreement is changed to be governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands, which have weaker labor protections and different standards for non-compete agreements than Pennsylvania. This undermines the fairness of the agreement, especially if key performance and employment are centered in Pennsylvania. This could be viewed as an attempt to circumvent Pennsylvania employment laws.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Astellas shall make quarterly reports to FG within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar quarter (April 1 though June 30, July 1 through September 30, October 1 though December 31, January 1 through March 31), which reports shall include, (a) the Net Sales, unit shipments and other distributions, including samples, by Astellas, and its Affiliates and Sublicensees, in such calendar quarter and (b) such other information as may be reasonably requested by FG to ensure either proper payment by Astellas of amounts required under this Agreement or to calculate payments with respect to FG's Third Party Agreements. Concurrently with making such report, Astellas shall remit payment to FG for any payments due under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Astellas shall make quarterly reports to FG within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each calendar quarter (April 1 through June 30, July 1 through September 30, October 1 through December 31, January 1 through March 31), which reports shall include, (a) the Net Sales, unit shipments and other distributions, including samples, by Astellas, and its Affiliates and Sublicensees, in such calendar quarter and (b) such other information as may be reasonably requested by FG to ensure either proper payment by Astellas of amounts required under this Agreement or to calculate payments with respect to FG's Third Party Agreements. Concurrently with making such report, Astellas shall remit payment to FG for any payments due under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the reporting deadline to 120 days contradicts standard accounting practices, which typically require quarterly reports to be completed within 60 days to provide accurate financial performance insights. This extended deadline creates non-compliance with regulatory and auditing standards, potentially affecting the reliability of financial reporting.",
                "contradicted_law": "Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)",
                "location": "ARTICLE 10"

                "original_text": "Such books and records shall be kept for at least [ * ] following the end of the calendar quarter to which they pertain. FG shall keep, and require its Sublicensee(s) to keep, complete, true and accurate books of accounts and records for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of the [ * ] Percentage and Fully Burdened Costs.",
                "changed_text": "Such books and records shall be kept for at least two (2) years following the end of the calendar quarter to which they pertain. FG shall keep, and require its Sublicensee(s) to keep, complete, true and accurate books of accounts and records for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of the [ * ] Percentage and Fully Burdened Costs.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the record-keeping period to two years violates the standard legal and regulatory requirement to retain financial records for a longer duration, typically five to seven years. This creates inconsistencies with legal obligations and hinders proper auditing and financial oversight.",

                "original_text": "If laws or regulations require that taxes be withheld, the paying party will (i) timely pay the taxes to the proper taxing authority, and (ii) send proof of payment to the other party within [ * ] following that payment.",
                "changed_text": "If laws or regulations require that taxes be withheld, the paying party will (i) timely pay the taxes to the proper taxing authority, and (ii) send proof of payment to the other party within one hundred eighty (180) days following that payment.",
                "explanation": "Extending the deadline for providing proof of tax payments to 180 days contradicts standard tax compliance requirements, which necessitate prompt and accurate documentation of tax-related transactions. This delay hampers financial reconciliation and creates inconsistencies with regulatory obligations for tax reporting and auditing.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Client will have a 30 day right to cure before a cancelation can occur.",
                "changed_text": "Client will have a 5 day right to cure before a cancelation can occur.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to 5 days contradicts standard contract law principles, which often require a reasonable cure period. While reasonableness is subjective, 5 days is arguably insufficient, especially for complex issues, and may be considered unconscionable, particularly in Florida where the contract is governed.",

                "location": "Section 4(a)(2)"

                "changed_text": "All intellectual property developed pursuant to this Agreement before the Termination Date shall be delivered to the Client within thirty days of the Termination Date.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a one-day deadline for delivering intellectual property post-termination. Extending it to thirty days after the termination date contradicts the prompt delivery expectation inherent in protecting intellectual property rights. Immediate return is crucial to prevent misuse. A delay of thirty days, especially in the technology sector, exposes the Client to significant risk of IP infringement.",

                "changed_text": "Within fifteen (15) days of the termination of this Agreement, whether by expiration or otherwise, the Developer agrees to return to the Client all Client products, samples, models, or other property and all documents, retaining no copies or notes, relating to the Client's business including, but not limited to, reports, abstracts, lists, correspondence, information, computer files, computer disks, and all other materials and all copies of such material obtained by the Developer during and in connection with its representation of the Client.",
                "explanation": "Extending the deadline for returning Client property to fifteen days after termination contradicts the duty to protect confidential information and trade secrets. The original three-day requirement ensures a faster retrieval of sensitive data, minimizing the risk of misuse or disclosure. The delay increases the opportunity for misappropriation of trade secrets, which violates common law and state-specific trade secret protection laws.",

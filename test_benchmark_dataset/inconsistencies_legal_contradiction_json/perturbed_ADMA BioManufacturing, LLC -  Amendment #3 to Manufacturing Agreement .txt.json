            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All claims by Sanofi Pasteur for breach or default under this Agreement shall be brought within [***] year after the cause of action comes into existence or otherwise shall be waived.",
                "changed_text": "All claims by Sanofi Pasteur for breach or default under this Agreement shall be brought within 90 days after the cause of action comes into existence or otherwise shall be waived.",
                "explanation": "This modification reduces the time frame for filing breach of contract claims to 90 days.  Under Florida law (where ADMA is located), the statute of limitations for breach of a written contract is five years. This contractual provision attempts to shorten the legally allowed time, making it likely unenforceable and creating a legal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "Such payments shall be made in accordance with Section 3.4 of the Agreement; provided, however, that the initial payment described in Section 5(a) above shall be due no later than December 31,2017.",
                "changed_text": "Such payments shall be made in accordance with Section 3.4 of the Agreement; provided, however, that the initial payment described in Section 5(a) above shall be due no later than January 31, 2017.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states that the initial payment shall be made no later than December 31, 2017. The change modifies this date to January 31, 2017, making the deadline retroactive. Since the effective date of the amendment is December 21, 2017, requiring payment prior to the agreement's existence creates a contradiction and potential breach of contract claim due to impossibility of performance. It sets an impossible deadline.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties shall use best efforts to complete such amendment to the Quality Agreement within 15 days after the Amendment Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "This modification shortens the time frame for completing the amendment to the Quality Agreement from 60 days to 15 days. While 'best efforts' is subjective, significantly reducing the timeline for complex agreements may be deemed commercially unreasonable. This change introduces an inconsistency with typical business practices, especially considering the complexity of quality agreements in the bio-manufacturing field. If 15 days is not enough time to complete the amendment under regulatory guidelines, it creates a legal issue.",

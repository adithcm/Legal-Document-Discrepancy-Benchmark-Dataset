                "original_text": "5.1 This Agreement can be terminated at any time prior to the expiry of the Term, as follows: (a) by the Consultant electing to give the Company not less than 3 months prior notice of such termination;",
                "changed_text": "5.1 This Agreement can be terminated at any time prior to the expiry of the Term, as follows: (a) by the Consultant electing to give the Company not less than 1 month prior notice of such termination;",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination by the consultant to 1 month could potentially violate employment standards legislation in some jurisdictions (including British Columbia, where this contract is based) that requires longer notice periods for termination, depending on the length of service and other factors. This creates a conflict by setting a contractual term that provides less protection to the company than what may be legally required.",
                "contradicted_law": "Employment Standards Act of British Columbia, Canada, could be contradicted depending on the specific circumstances of termination.",

                "original_text": "7.1 The Consultant covenants, undertakes and agrees with the Company that during the Term and for a period of one year from the date of expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, it shall not, on its own behalf or on behalf of any person, whether directly or indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever, offer employment to or solicit the employment of or otherwise entice away from the employment of the Company or any of the Affiliated Companies, any individual who is employed or engaged by the Company or any of the Affiliated Companies at the date of expiration or termination of this Agreement or who was employed or engaged by the Company or any of the Affiliated Companies, within the one year period immediately preceding the date of expiration or termination of this Agreement, as applicable.",
                "changed_text": "7.1 The Consultant covenants, undertakes and agrees with the Company that during the Term and for a period of two years from the date of expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, it shall not, on its own behalf or on behalf of any person, whether directly or indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever, offer employment to or solicit the employment of or otherwise entice away from the employment of the Company or any of the Affiliated Companies, any individual who is employed or engaged by the Company or any of the Affiliated Companies at the date of expiration or termination of this Agreement or who was employed or engaged by the Company or any of the Affiliated Companies, within the one year period immediately preceding the date of expiration or termination of this Agreement, as applicable.",
                "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to two years might be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable under the laws of British Columbia as it places undue restrictions on the consultant's ability to conduct business post-contract termination, potentially contravening competition laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Competition Act (Canada) and common law principles regarding reasonable restraint of trade.",

In addition, the Company will pay to the Consultant all reasonable expenses of the Consultant as agreed to from time to time which are incurred by the Consultant in delivery of the Services, based on monthly invoices submitted to the Company, including copies of all paid receipts; plus harmonized sales taxes or goods and services taxes, as the case may be, in addition to the Consulting Fees, which taxes will be remitted by the Consultant to the Canada Revenue Agency.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 The Company will pay the Consultant basic remuneration for its services in the sum of $10,000 per month (the \"Consulting Fee\") commencing on the 1st day of February, 2020, and payable quarterly at the discretion of the board, together with any such increments thereto as the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company may from time to time determine.

                "explanation": "Changing the payment frequency from monthly to quarterly and adding 'at the discretion of the board' without a clear payment schedule or justification, creates ambiguity and potential violation of prompt payment laws or regulations. Removing 'copies of all paid receipts' when reimbursing expenses also causes a violation of bookkeeping standards and proper tracking for tax purposes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts principles of contract law requiring certainty of terms, and also conflicts with generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations.",

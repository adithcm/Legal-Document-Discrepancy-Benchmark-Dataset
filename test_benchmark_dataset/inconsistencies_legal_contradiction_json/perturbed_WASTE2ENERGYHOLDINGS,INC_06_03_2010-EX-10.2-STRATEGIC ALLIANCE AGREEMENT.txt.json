                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each Party agrees to negotiate in good faith the terms of the Manufacturing Agreement and to use its reasonable endeavours to enter into said agreement within 1 DAY DN 20/5/2010 of the Commencement Date.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees to negotiate in good faith the terms of the Manufacturing Agreement and to use its reasonable endeavours to enter into said agreement within 4 HOURS of the Commencement Date.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a deadline of '1 DAY' which could be construed as reasonable. The modified text shortens this to '4 HOURS,' which is an unreasonably short timeframe for negotiating and entering into a complex Manufacturing Agreement. This creates a contradiction with standard contract law principles requiring reasonable timeframes for fulfilling obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees that during the Term of this Agreement it shall not, without the prior written consent of the other Party, either on its own account or through its employees or agents or otherwise or on behalf of any other person, firm, company or other organisation and other than by general advertising, solicit, interfere with, procure or entice away (or, in each case, attempt so to do), either directly or indirectly, any employee or contractor of the other Party. This clause is null and void at the termination of this contract.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a non-solicitation clause that extends for 'six (6) months' after the agreement's termination. The modified text eliminates this post-termination restriction, thus contradicting the common law principle and enforceability of reasonable non-solicitation clauses.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows 'ten (10) Working Days' for initial dispute resolution. Reducing this to 'one (1) Working Day' is likely insufficient for meaningful discussion and resolution, potentially conflicting with the legal requirement for good faith negotiation and reasonable attempts at dispute resolution before resorting to more formal processes like mediation. Impedes on the likelihood of resolving disputes effectively, creating grounds to challenge the clause on fairness and reasonableness.",

                "original_text": "Such fee will be computed daily and payable monthly by Nationwide within thirty (30) days of receipt from you of a valid invoice (in excel format) that identifies, for each CUSIP of each Fund, the number of sub-accounts, participants or beneficial shareholders serviced by you and such other information as may be necessary to validate the fee payable.",
                "changed_text": "Such fee will be computed daily and payable quarterly by Nationwide within sixty (60) days of receipt from you of a valid invoice (in excel format) that identifies, for each CUSIP of each Fund, the number of sub-accounts, participants or beneficial shareholders serviced by you and such other information as may be necessary to validate the fee payable.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment frequency from monthly to quarterly and extending the payment deadline from 30 days to 60 days can cause cash flow issues and goes against standard business and legal practices favoring more frequent payments. This could create legal issues regarding timely payment and potential breach of contract.",

                "changed_text": "You agree to transmit the requested information that is on your books and records to the Fund or its designee at your earliest convenience, estimated to be no later than fifteen (15) business days after receipt of a request.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the response time for providing shareholder information from five business days to fifteen business days conflicts with SEC Rule 22c-2, which requires prompt cooperation in providing information to address market timing and excessive trading. This delay could hinder the Fund's ability to monitor and prevent abusive trading practices effectively.",

                "changed_text": "You agree to execute instructions when able to but not later than fifteen business days after your receipt of the instructions.",
                "explanation": "Extending the execution timeline for instructions related to market timing or excessive trading strategies from five business days to fifteen business days directly contradicts the requirement for prompt action under Rule 22c-2. A longer delay makes it more difficult for the Fund to control market timing activities, potentially harming other shareholders.",

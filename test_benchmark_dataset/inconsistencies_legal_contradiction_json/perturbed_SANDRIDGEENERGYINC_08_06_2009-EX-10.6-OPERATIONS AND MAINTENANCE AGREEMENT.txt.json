                "original_text": "Owner shall pay all such amounts prior to the later of (a) 50 days after the end of the month in which the expenses were incurred or (b) 10 days after the date of receipt of each invoice. Invoices received after 1:00 pm local time will be deemed received on the next Business Day.",
                "changed_text": "Owner shall pay all such amounts within 90 days after the end of the month in which the expenses were incurred. Invoices received at any time will be deemed received the same Business Day.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within a defined timeframe. The modified text extends the payment period to 90 days, and removes the deadline for invoices, which could be problematic under prompt payment laws in many states like Texas (where the contract is governed), which often mandate payment within 30 days of invoice receipt unless otherwise agreed in writing and commercially reasonable. This introduces a conflict with standard business practices and potentially state regulations.",

                "original_text": "Owner shall have up until two years after the close of a Calendar Year in which to make an audit of Operator's records for such Calendar Year. Except for any bill or statement with respect to which an Adjustment Claim is made within the two-year audit period, the bills and statements rendered for the Calendar Year prior to such two-year audit period shall be conclusively established as correct.",
                "changed_text": "Owner shall have up until six months after the close of a Calendar Year in which to make an audit of Operator's records for such Calendar Year. Except for any bill or statement with respect to which an Adjustment Claim is made within the six-month audit period, the bills and statements rendered for the Calendar Year prior to such six-month audit period shall be conclusively established as correct.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement allows Owner two years to audit Operator's records. By reducing this period to six months, the modified text creates a significantly shorter window for Owner to identify and address potential financial discrepancies. This abbreviated timeframe is unreasonable and could be considered to contradict standard auditing practices. A shorter audit period significantly limits the ability to detect financial irregularities, potentially conflicting with fiduciary responsibilities. This conflicts with the reasonable audit windows and standards that would be expected of prudent businesses.",

                "explanation": "The original contract requires the Operator to inform the Owner of any liability claims within 10 days of receiving the notification. The modification requires the Operator to notify the Owner of any liability claims within 30 days. This change would be problematic as most insurance policies require notification to the insured company for claims immediately (within 24-48 hours) or as soon as is reasonably possible. It also imposes that the insurance company would be notified in a short time frame, especially for liability claims. Therefore, requiring to notify the owner in 30 days would be in conflict with standard practice for insurance claims.",

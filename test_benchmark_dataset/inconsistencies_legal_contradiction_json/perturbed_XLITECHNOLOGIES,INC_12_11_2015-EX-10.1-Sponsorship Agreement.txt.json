                "original_text": "2.2 Termination upon Breach. This Agreement may be terminated upon written notice by either party in the event of a default by the other party in the performance of any term or condition of this Agreement. Any termination allowed by this Agreement will take place only after written notice of default has been given to the defaulting party, providing such party with thirty (30) days in which to cure the default.",
                "changed_text": "2.2 Termination upon Breach. This Agreement may be terminated immediately upon written notice by either party in the event of a default by the other party in the performance of any term or condition of this Agreement. Any termination allowed by this Agreement will take place after written notice of default has been given to the defaulting party, providing such party with ten (10) days in which to cure the default.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives a 30-day cure period which is fairly standard. Reducing this to 10 days could be considered unreasonably short depending on the nature of the breach, potentially violating good faith and fair dealing principles implied in contract law. This could especially be problematic in jurisdictions where such short cure periods are disfavored, effectively making the termination clause unconscionable or unenforceable under certain circumstances.",

Notices by U.S. Mail or facsimile transmission shall contain an acknowledgement of receipt. A party receiving a notice by facsimile or Email shall acknowledge receipt by return facsimile or reply email within two (2) business days of receipt.

A party receiving a notice delivered personally shall sign a receipt therefore. There is no obligation to acknowledge receipt of notices sent by any other means.",
                "explanation": "By limiting the acceptable method of notice to 'delivered personally' and removing the requirement to acknowledge receipt for U.S. Mail, facsimile or email, the contract introduces ambiguity and potential for disputes regarding whether notice was properly given. This contradicts the standard legal practices and requirements for effective notification, especially in California, which may require reasonable methods of notice depending on the situation. This change increases the risk that important communications (e.g., notice of breach, termination) will be deemed ineffective, potentially violating due process or contractual requirements for proper notice.",

Insurance coverage shall cease immediately upon the agreement's termination.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires insurance to be maintained for one year after the agreement ends, which is common for ongoing liability coverage. Removing this requirement and specifying that insurance ceases immediately upon termination directly contradicts responsible risk management and potentially violates implied duties of care. This also contradicts common business practices where insurance coverage is required even after termination for potential liabilities arising during the contract term. Such abrupt cessation may create significant legal exposure for both parties, particularly in scenarios where claims might arise after the agreement terminates but relate to actions during the agreement's effective period. This is contrary to general liability principles and is not a prudent business practice",

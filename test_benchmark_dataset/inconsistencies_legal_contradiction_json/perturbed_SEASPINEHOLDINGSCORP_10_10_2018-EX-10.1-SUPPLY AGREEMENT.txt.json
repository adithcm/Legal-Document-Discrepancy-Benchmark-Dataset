Such acceptance shall be issued in the form of Attachment C by Integra within ten (10) business days of receipt by Integra or its Affiliates of product (and related quality and testing documentation) meeting specifications mutually agreed upon by Integra and PcoMed.",

Such acceptance shall be issued in the form of Attachment C by Integra within seventy-five (75) business days of receipt by Integra or its Affiliates of product (and related quality and testing documentation) meeting specifications mutually agreed upon by Integra and PcoMed.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the period for Integra to issue the acceptance notice from 10 business days to 75 business days, which could potentially contradict regulations that require timely acceptance or rejection of goods to facilitate efficient business operations and prompt payment. Unreasonably delaying acceptance can be seen as an unfair trade practice and could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under contract law.",

Payments due under Section 2.2 shall be payable to PcoMed by Integra on a quarterly basis within 45 days following the end of each calendar quarter. Each such payment shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the number and type of Treated Integra Product and Partially Treated Integra Product sold and the Net Sales applicable thereto, (ii) a breakdown of all the components of Net Sales for the determination of payments due under Sections 2.2 (the numbers may be and type of products may be stated in the aggregate and not by customer and are not required to be detailed by geographic area unless Fee rates are different in different geographic areas). Treated Integra Product and/or Partially Treated Integra Product shall be considered as being sold for the purpose of the calculation of payments due under Sections 2.2 when the payments for the Treated Integra Product and/or Partially Treated Integra Product are received by Integra or its Affiliates from a Third Party. All payments to be made under this Agreement shall be paid in United States dollars. Net Sales of Treated Integra Product and/or Partially Treated Integra Product and fees in currencies other than United States dollars shall be first determined in the currency of the country in which they are earned and shall be converted (for the purpose of calculation only) in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for financial reporting in the United States.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the payment timeframe to 120 days may violate prompt payment laws in some states. Many states have laws requiring businesses to pay their suppliers or contractors within a reasonable timeframe, often shorter than 120 days. This delay could subject Integra to penalties and interest charges.",

Said accountant shall enter into a confidentiality agreement with Integra and shall not disclose to PcoMed any information except that which is necessary to determine whether PcoMed has received all amounts due to it from Integra. Such inspections shall be made no more than once each calendar year during ordinary business hours and on reasonable prior notice and shall be at PcoMed's sole cost and expense. PcoMed shall report the results of any such audit to Integra within 60 days of completion and provide a copy of such audit to Integra. The results of any such audit shall be the Confidential Information of Integra. To the extent that such audit reveals any underpayments by Integra, Integra shall pay to PcoMed the amount of shortfall within 60 days from the date on which the parties actually agreed on the amount of the shortfall, or, in the event the parties do not reach agreement on the shortfall, the date a court issues a judgment finally resolving the matter.",

                "explanation": "Extending the timeframe for both audit reporting and shortfall payment to 180 days could conflict with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Equifax and Certegy shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all Required Consents with regard to Transferred Third Party Agreements and Third Party Use Rights within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.",
                "changed_text": "Equifax and Certegy shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all Required Consents with regard to Transferred Third Party Agreements and Third Party Use Rights within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows 180 days to obtain required consents, which may be reasonable. Shortening it to 30 days introduces a legal contradiction because securing all necessary consents for transferring agreements could take longer, and forcing compliance within 30 days is not commercially reasonable or legally sound, potentially violating general contract law principles of 'reasonable time' for fulfillment of obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - 'Reasonable Time' for fulfilling contractual obligations.",

Certegy shall be responsible for paying any and all additional software license fees, service fees, fees related to hardware, or other similar fees incurred to establish the new LPAR(s) and to migrate from the existing to the new LPAR(s). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if the deadline for LPAR separation is not met by Certegy prior to March 31, 2002, any costs or fees, including all fees, costs or expenses incurred as a result of increased capacity or speed requirements or otherwise, incurred by either party due to the non-separation shall be borne by Certegy.",
                "changed_text": "Certegy agrees that it shall, no later than January 1, 2002, establish, or cause to be established, one or more new and separate LPAR(s) and that Certegy shall no longer share any LPAR with Equifax. Certegy shall be responsible for paying any and all additional software license fees, service fees, fees related to hardware, or other similar fees incurred to establish the new LPAR(s) and to migrate from the existing to the new LPAR(s).

                "explanation": "Changing the deadline from March 31, 2002, to January 1, 2002, may create an unachievable or unreasonable expectation, potentially conflicting with legal principles requiring commercially reasonable deadlines. This could make the clause unenforceable due to impossibility or impracticability of performance within such a short timeframe. It is assumed that doing so requires third-party cooperation.",

                "changed_text": "Certegy will terminate the use of such Equifax Marks at the company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a deadline of twelve months. Removing any deadline and stating 'at the company's discretion' creates a contradiction because trademark law requires that a licensee's use of a licensed mark be controlled by the licensor (Equifax) to maintain the mark's validity. Allowing Certegy complete discretion undermines this control, potentially leading to a claim of abandonment or genericide of the trademark, violating Equifax's trademark rights and relevant laws.",

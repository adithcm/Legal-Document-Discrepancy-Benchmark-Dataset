                "original_text": "During the Term, and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, the receiving party will not disclose to others or use for any purpose of its own, other than in performance of this Agreement, any Confidential Information of the other party. Each party shall take, at a minimum, measures consistent with those taken to protect its own similar types of Confidential Information (and in any event, at least reasonable measures) to protect the other's Confidential Information against disclosures prohibited by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, the receiving party will not disclose to others or use for any purpose of its own, other than in performance of this Agreement, any Confidential Information of the other party. Each party shall take commercially reasonable measures to protect the other's Confidential Information against disclosures prohibited by this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 5-year confidentiality period which is a reasonable timeframe. The modified text reduces the confidentiality period to 1 year, which may be insufficient to protect sensitive trade secrets or proprietary information, potentially conflicting with trade secret laws that could provide longer protection depending on the nature of the information and efforts to maintain its secrecy under California law. Additionally, changing 'at a minimum, measures consistent with those taken to protect its own similar types of Confidential Information (and in any event, at least reasonable measures)' to 'commercially reasonable measures' weakens the standard of care required, potentially leading to inadequate protection of confidential information and conflict with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

In addition, either party may terminate the Term immediately upon written notice in the event that the other party shall fail to do business in the normal course or become subject to any bankruptcy, assignment for creditors, corporate dissolution or similar proceeding.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate the Term upon not less than fifteen (15) days prior written notice to the other party of any breach hereof by such other party. In addition, either party may terminate the Term immediately upon email notice in the event that the other party shall fail to do business in the normal course or become subject to any bankruptcy, assignment for creditors, corporate dissolution or similar proceeding.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 60 days' written notice for termination due to breach. The modification reduces this to 15 days, which may be insufficient time for the breaching party to cure the breach, potentially conflicting with California law that implies a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach before termination is allowed. Furthermore, the modified text allows for termination immediately upon email notice in the event of bankruptcy/dissolution. While the original text stipulates a written notice in the original form.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies California law and San Francisco courts for jurisdiction. The modification changes the governing law to Delaware, while moving jurisdiction and venue to the courts of the British Virgin Islands. Given the initial parties have their principal places of business in California and Illinois respectively, enforcing jurisdiction in the British Virgin Islands could be deemed unreasonable, conflicting with principles of due process and fairness in jurisdictional selection. This is especially pertinent if one party has considerably fewer resources to litigate abroad than the other.",

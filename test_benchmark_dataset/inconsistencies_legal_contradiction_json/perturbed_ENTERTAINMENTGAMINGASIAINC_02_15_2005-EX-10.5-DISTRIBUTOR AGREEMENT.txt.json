                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Distributor shall provide to Vendor: (1) monthly sales figures no later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the end of the relevant monthly period that provides information with respect to sales for each Product; and (2) a non binding three (3) month forecast on a quarterly basis;",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall provide to Vendor: (1) monthly sales figures no later than sixty (60) calendar days after the end of the relevant monthly period that provides information with respect to sales for each Product; and (2) a non binding three (3) month forecast on a quarterly basis;",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires monthly sales figures within fifteen days. Extending this deadline to sixty days may violate standard business practices and reporting norms, potentially creating a contradiction with expected compliance standards in the gaming industry. This affects the Vendor's ability to monitor sales performance promptly.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of general implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, potentially affecting reasonable expectations of performance.",
                "location": "3.8"
            },
            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "For any price change to take effect ninety (90) days notice must be given in order for the price change to apply; provided, however, the proposed price change must also apply to the Products for sale by Vendor outside the Territory. In the event that there is a price change required by Vendor that does not fall within the ninety (90) day notice period, both parties agree to discuss the nature of the increase in order to reach a mutually acceptable understanding. All the aforementioned price changes will not exceed, on a percentage term basis, any increase in the US retail selling price.",
                "changed_text": "For any price change to take effect thirty (30) days notice must be given in order for the price change to apply; provided, however, the proposed price change must also apply to the Products for sale by Vendor outside the Territory. In the event that there is a price change required by Vendor that does not fall within the thirty (30) day notice period, both parties agree to discuss the nature of the increase in order to reach a mutually acceptable understanding. All the aforementioned price changes will not exceed, on a percentage term basis, any increase in the US retail selling price.",
                "explanation": "The original contract mandates a 90-day notice for price changes. Shortening this to 30 days may not provide sufficient time for the Distributor to adjust its pricing and notify its customers, violating reasonable commercial standards and potentially leading to legal challenges based on insufficient notice. The change creates a risk of unfair business practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, and potential breach of reasonable notification standards.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the shipment, Distributor shall notify Vendor of any damage or shortage. As soon as commercially practical after receipt of notice, Vendor shall make complete any shipment in short supply. Any Products damaged in shipment shall be returned to Vendor along with documentation of the damage within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt by Distributor, and Vendor will reimburse Distributor for the costs of freight reasonably incurred by Distributor in returning the Products to Vendor. If Vendor finds any Products returned for damage to not be damaged, Distributor shall be subject to a restocking fee equal to fifteen percent (15%) original purchase price of the non-damaged Products.",
                "changed_text": "Within two (2) calendar days of receipt of the shipment, Distributor shall notify Vendor of any damage or shortage. As soon as commercially practical after receipt of notice, Vendor shall make complete any shipment in short supply. Any Products damaged in shipment shall be returned to Vendor along with documentation of the damage within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt by Distributor, and Vendor will reimburse Distributor for the costs of freight reasonably incurred by Distributor in returning the Products to Vendor. If Vendor finds any Products returned for damage to not be damaged, Distributor shall be subject to a restocking fee equal to fifteen percent (15%) original purchase price of the non-damaged Products.",
                "explanation": "Requiring notification of damage within just two days may be unreasonably short, particularly for large shipments requiring thorough inspection. The modified text creates a contradiction with standard inspection timelines and commercial norms, potentially leading to disputes and unfair denial of valid damage claims. Also, setting 60 days to return damaged products to Vendor, creates a violation to the original contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "Unreasonable limitation of inspection period potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

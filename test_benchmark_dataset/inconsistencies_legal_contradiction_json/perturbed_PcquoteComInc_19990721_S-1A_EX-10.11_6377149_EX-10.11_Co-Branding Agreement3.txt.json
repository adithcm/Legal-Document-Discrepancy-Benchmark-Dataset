Watley, Inc., with its principal place of business at 33 West 17th Street, New York, New York 10011 (\"ABW\").",

Watley, Inc., with its principal place of business at 33 West 17th Street, New York, New York 10011 (\"ABW\"). Any claims arising from or related to this agreement must be submitted within 10 days of the event giving rise to the claim.",
                "explanation": "This amendment introduces a clause requiring all claims to be submitted within 10 days. This contradicts typical statutes of limitations which allow for longer periods for filing claims, creating a legal contradiction. The original text does not include any claim submission deadlines.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by state, but generally statutes of limitations for contract claims are much longer than 10 days (e.g., 4-6 years for written contracts).",

                "explanation": "This change adds a termination clause allowing PCQ to terminate the agreement with only five days' notice, regardless of the reason. This could contradict state laws regarding reasonable notice periods for contract termination, especially if ABW has made significant investments based on the agreement. The original agreement's termination clause is unknown, but this modification could create a conflict.",
                "contradicted_law": "Common law principles of reasonable notice for contract termination; potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "This modification states that PCQ's obligation to pay ABW is at PCQ's 'sole discretion.' This directly contradicts fundamental contract law principles that require payment for services rendered according to the agreement's terms. It introduces a legal contradiction because it makes PCQ's payment obligation unenforceable, potentially violating state wage and contract laws. The original text confirms all parts of the agreement that were previously agreed on.",

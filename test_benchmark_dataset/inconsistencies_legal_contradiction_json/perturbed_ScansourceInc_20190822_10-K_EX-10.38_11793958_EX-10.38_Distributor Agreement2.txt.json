                "explanation": "The original contract provides a 30-day return window. Shortening the return window to 10 days contradicts consumer protection laws in many states (including California, where the contract is governed) that provide consumers with more extensive rights to return goods, especially software, for a refund. Many states require a minimum of 30 days for software returns.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the warranty period from 90 days to 30 days creates a legal contradiction. Many states have implied warranty laws that may require a more extended warranty period, especially for software. A shorter warranty period may be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable, particularly if the software is complex or critical to business operations. The implied warranty of merchantability under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) usually extends beyond 30 days.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 'during Customer's normal business hours' limitation and adding 'at any time, with or without prior notice' creates a legal contradiction. Laws regarding privacy and reasonable business practices generally require some level of notice and respect for a business's operational hours. Unannounced, unrestricted access to a customer's financial records could be seen as an unreasonable intrusion and a violation of privacy laws and fair business practice regulations.

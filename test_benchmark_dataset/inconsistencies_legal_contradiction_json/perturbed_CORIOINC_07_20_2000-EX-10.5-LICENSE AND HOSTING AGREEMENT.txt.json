                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days of delivery of the Software, but in no event later than December 1, 1999, Corio shall test the Software for conformance with the Documentation (\"Acceptance Test\"). If the Software performs in substantial accordance with the Documentation, then Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing of its acceptance of the Software.",
                "changed_text": "Within ten (10) days of delivery of the Software, but in no event later than November 15, 1999, Corio shall test the Software for conformance with the Documentation (\"Acceptance Test\"). If the Software performs in substantial accordance with the Documentation, then Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing of its acceptance of the Software.",
                "explanation": "This modification shortens the acceptance testing period from 30 days to 10 days. This could be considered unreasonable or insufficient time, especially for complex software, potentially violating implied warranties or reasonable expectations under contract law. This is particularly pertinent as the original agreement explicitly sets a 30-day period, suggesting a mutually agreed-upon timeframe based on the software's complexity.",

                "original_text": "Corio shall keep true and accurate books of accounts and records for determining the amounts payable to Commerce One under this Agreement. Such books and records shall be kept for at least three (3) years following the end of the calendar month to which they pertain, and shall be open for inspection by an independent certified public accountant reasonably acceptable to Corio for the purpose of verifying the amounts payable to Commerce One under this Agreement. Such inspections may be made no more than once each calendar year, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice.",
                "changed_text": "Corio shall keep true and accurate books of accounts and records for determining the amounts payable to Commerce One under this Agreement. Such books and records shall be kept for at least one (1) year following the end of the calendar month to which they pertain, and shall be open for inspection by an accountant chosen by Commerce One for the purpose of verifying the amounts payable to Commerce One under this Agreement. Such inspections may be made up to three times each calendar year, without prior notice.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the record-keeping period from three years to one year and allows for inspections up to three times a year without notice. Depending on the jurisdiction, statutory requirements might mandate longer retention periods for financial records, especially those related to revenue and tax obligations. Additionally, allowing inspections without notice and by an accountant solely chosen by Commerce One infringes on Corio's rights to reasonable business practices and audit standards.",

                "original_text": "Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for subsequent one (1) year periods unless either party provides the other party with written notification at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the initial five (5) year term or any one (1) year renewal thereof of its intention to terminate this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for termination from 30 days to 5 days could be deemed unconscionable or commercially unreasonable. A short notice period may not provide sufficient time for the other party to make necessary arrangements, potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing implied in contract law. This is especially important considering the complex relationship between the two parties, which could lead to large losses if cut abruptly.",

                "explanation": "While the original contract states confidentiality obligations will survive for a period of five years, reducing this to one year could be considered unreasonably short, particularly considering the nature of the information involved (business methods, marketing strategies, pricing, competitor information, product development strategies, and financial results). This could contradict established legal precedent or industry norms in India regarding the protection of trade secrets and confidential business information, especially concerning the competitive disadvantage the disclosing party might face. The one year period doesn't allow reasonable time to take legal actions in case there is an infraction of confidentiality, thus being non-compliant.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Within 30 days after the end of each month during the Term, CNET will provide a report to the Company indicating the number of Retail Promotions displayed on the CNET Sites during such month and the number of times that a User clicked on a Retail Promotion during such month. CNET will also provide standard reporting for banner advertisements and television Promotions.",
                "changed_text": "Within 60 days after the end of each quarter during the Term, CNET will provide a report to the Company indicating the total number of Retail Promotions displayed on the CNET Sites during such quarter. No specific data regarding user clicks will be provided, only aggregated totals.",
                "explanation": "This change alters the reporting frequency and detail. Requiring reports quarterly instead of monthly reduces transparency and potentially violates generally accepted advertising practices which often necessitate more frequent performance metrics. By limiting the reporting to only aggregated totals, the company is not able to see which advertisements work best for them.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of advertising standards related to transparency and reporting frequency; also affects the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "location": "Section 2.6"

                "original_text": "Within 30 days after the end of each month during the Term, the Company will provide a report to CNET indicating the aggregate number of referrals from the CNET Sites to the Company Site during such month, the resulting number of buyers, the aggregate behavior (including orders and sales volume) of those buyers, and the total revenue attributable to the Online Promotions minus applicable sales tax, shipping costs, returns and cancellations (the \"CNET Sales\").",
                "changed_text": "Within 90 days after the end of the Term, the Company will provide a single report to CNET indicating only the total revenue attributable to the Online Promotions, without specifying the source of the referral or the customer behavior. The company reserves the right to exclude data it deems confidential.",
                "explanation": "By changing the reporting frequency to a single report after the entire term, and reducing the report's scope by excluding referral data and customer behavior, it is much harder to see how effective CNET's marketing was. This makes it hard to fairly calculate the revenue generated by CNET and directly violates generally accepted advertising practices which often necessitate more frequent performance metrics.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of advertising standards related to transparency and reporting frequency; also affects the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "For each month during the Term, the Company will pay CNET a minimum of [XXXX] in cash, plus [XXX] of CNET Sales. Payments under this paragraph will be based on the reports prepared by the Company under Section 3.2 (although CNET may challenge such reports as contemplated by Section 9.5) and will be due within 30 days after the end of each month of the Term.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will pay CNET a lump sum of [XXXX] within 180 days after the end of the Term. This payment is entirely discretionary and not tied to CNET Sales or any other performance metrics.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment terms from monthly payments based on performance to a discretionary lump sum paid six months after the term is over introduces ambiguity. This contradicts standard business practice requiring timely payment for services rendered and affects the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; may also create issues under contract law related to consideration and enforceability.",

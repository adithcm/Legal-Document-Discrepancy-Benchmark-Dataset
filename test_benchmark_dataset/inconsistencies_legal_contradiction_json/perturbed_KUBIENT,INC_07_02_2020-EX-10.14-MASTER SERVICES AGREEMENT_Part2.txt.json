                "original_text": "The Parties agree to reconcile revenue numbers and the revenue share calculations no later than 10 days following the end of each calendar month during which the Services were rendered. Subject to the doctrine of sequential liability, payment shall be made to the appropriate Party net 30 days from the end of the calendar month.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties agree to reconcile revenue numbers and the revenue share calculations no later than 30 days following the end of each calendar month during which the Services were rendered. Subject to the doctrine of sequential liability, payment shall be made to the appropriate Party net 90 days from the end of the calendar month.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment terms to net 90 days. While there isn't a single federal law mandating specific payment terms between businesses, such extended terms could be deemed unconscionable or violate state-level prompt payment laws, particularly if one party has significantly less bargaining power. Many states have prompt payment laws that require payment within a shorter timeframe, typically 30-45 days, especially for certain industries or government contracts. This change makes the payment term potentially inconsistent with industry standards and potentially violating state prompt payment laws depending on the state where the contract is enforced and the nature of the services provided.",

                "original_text": "During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year following the expiration or earlier termination thereof, Customer agrees not to work with, directly or indirectly, any Third-Party that Customer comes to know through disclosure by Kubient as part of the Services, without the express written consent of Kubient and compensation to Kubient under the applicable exhibit and/or schedule. Provided however, this provision shall not apply in the event Customer can establish, in writing, that it had a preexisting working relationship with such Third-Party prior to the Agreement and without Kubient's assistance.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, and for a period of five (5) years following the expiration or earlier termination thereof, Customer agrees not to work with, directly or indirectly, any Third-Party that Customer comes to know through disclosure by Kubient as part of the Services, without the express written consent of Kubient and compensation to Kubient under the applicable exhibit and/or schedule. Provided however, this provision shall not apply in the event Customer can establish, in writing, that it had a preexisting working relationship with such Third-Party prior to the Agreement and without Kubient's assistance.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the non-circumvention period to five years following the contract's termination makes it potentially unenforceable as an unreasonable restraint of trade, violating antitrust laws or common law principles against overly broad non-compete agreements. Courts often scrutinize such clauses to ensure they are reasonably limited in time and scope to protect legitimate business interests without unduly restricting competition.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year following the expiration or earlier termination thereof, Customer shall not, without Kubient's prior written consent, directly or indirectly (i) solicit or encourage any person to leave the employment or other service of Kubient; or (ii) hire, on behalf of Customer or any other person or entity, any person who has left the employment of Kubient within the one (1) year period following the termination or end of that person's employment.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, and in perpetuity following the expiration or earlier termination thereof, Customer shall not, without Kubient's prior written consent, directly or indirectly (i) solicit or encourage any person to leave the employment or other service of Kubient; or (ii) hire, on behalf of Customer or any other person or entity, any person who has left the employment of Kubient within the one (1) year period following the termination or end of that person's employment.",
                "explanation": "Changing the non-solicitation period to 'in perpetuity' after the contract's termination makes it unreasonably restrictive and likely unenforceable. Non-solicitation agreements, like non-competes, must be reasonably limited in time and scope to protect legitimate business interests. A perpetual ban on soliciting or hiring former employees is almost certainly an undue restraint on trade and individual freedom of employment, conflicting with public policy and labor laws.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment term to 60 business days contradicts standard prompt payment laws and industry norms, which typically require payment within 30 days, and therefore would make compliance and enforceability questionable.",

About shall provide ebix with at least thirty (30) days' prior notice of an audit and such audit shall be conducted at ebix's offices for a maximum period of two business days, during regular business hours, subject to ebix's cooperation. If the audit reveals that ebix has paid About less than the sum to which About is entitled, ebix agrees to pay About.com the additional sums due. If such sums exceed five percent (5%) of the total monies owed in connection with such audited amount to About ,ebix will pay for all costs reasonably incurred by About in connection with the audit.",
                "changed_text": "5.4   About shall have the right to examine, or to have examined by a representative of About, ebix's books and records to verify the accuracy of payments made to About at any given time. About shall provide ebix with at least five (5) days' prior notice of an audit and such audit shall be conducted at ebix's offices for a maximum period of five business days, during regular business hours, subject to ebix's cooperation.

                "explanation": "This modification affects audit rights and cost responsibilities. Firstly, eliminating the look-back period ('maximum period of last 6 months') allows for audits of records at any point, which could be overly burdensome and unreasonable. Secondly, reducing the notice period to 5 days may violate reasonable notice expectations. Finally, lowering the threshold for cost-shifting to 1% (from 5%) may be considered an unfair penalty.",

About's decision is conclusive and non-appealable",
                "explanation": "Modifying 'About's reasonable opinion' to 'About's sole opinion' removes objectivity and fairness standards, giving About unchecked authority to demand changes. Reducing the modification period to five days is inadequate, potentially breaching implied contract laws by placing undue burden on ebix. Stating that About's decision is 'conclusive and non-appealable' infringes on due process principles and the right to legal recourse.",

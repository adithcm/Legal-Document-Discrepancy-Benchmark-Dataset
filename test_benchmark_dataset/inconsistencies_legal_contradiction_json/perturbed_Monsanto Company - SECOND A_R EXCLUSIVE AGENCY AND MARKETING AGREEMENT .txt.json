                "original_text": "Within fifteen (15) days following the end of each Program Year, the Agent shall deliver to Monsanto a Commission Statement which shall contain the final determination of the Commission due at the expiry of the Program Year and shall set forth any eventual adjustments, to the amounts paid up to the Agent under Section 3.6(b) during the preceding Program Year. If within fifteen (15) days following the receipt of such Commission Statement by the Agent, Monsanto does not provide the Agent written notice of objection to the Commission Statement, the amount of the Commission for such Program Year shall be as provided thereon. If within such fifteen (15) days following receipt of such Commission Statement by Monsanto, Monsanto does provide the Agent written notice of objection to the Commission Statement, the parties shall resolve such dispute in the manner set forth in Section 3.4 hereof.",
                "changed_text": "Within ninety (90) days following the end of each Program Year, the Agent shall deliver to Monsanto a Commission Statement which shall contain the final determination of the Commission due at the expiry of the Program Year and shall set forth any eventual adjustments, to the amounts paid up to the Agent under Section 3.6(b) during the preceding Program Year. If within five (5) days following the receipt of such Commission Statement by the Agent, Monsanto does not provide the Agent written notice of objection to the Commission Statement, the amount of the Commission for such Program Year shall be as provided thereon. If within five (5) days following receipt of such Commission Statement by Monsanto, Monsanto does provide the Agent written notice of objection to the Commission Statement, the parties shall resolve such dispute in the manner set forth in Section 3.4 hereof.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows Monsanto 15 days to object to the commission statement. Reducing this to 5 days places an unreasonable burden on Monsanto to review complex financial documents, potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing implied in Delaware contract law. Moreover, extending the time to 90 days for the agent side is not following good faith practice of the company.",

The failure on the part of the Breaching Party to timely respond to the notice, and/or to timely appoint its arbitrator, shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of the arbitrator designated by the Claimant as the 'sole arbitrator.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the response time to 5 days could be viewed as procedurally unconscionable, especially given the complexity of assessing claims of material breach, fraud, or willful misconduct.  This could conflict with principles of fairness in arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the exclusive negotiation period to 15 days for a potential Roundup Sale could be deemed commercially unreasonable, as it severely limits the Agent's ability to conduct thorough due diligence, secure financing, and formulate a competitive offer.

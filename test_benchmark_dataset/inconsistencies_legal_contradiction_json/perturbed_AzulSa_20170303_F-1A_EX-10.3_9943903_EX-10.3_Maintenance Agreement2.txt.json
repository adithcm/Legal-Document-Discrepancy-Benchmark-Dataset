                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year may be deemed unreasonable and inadequate to protect trade secrets or sensitive business information under New York law, especially considering the nature of the maintenance agreement and the information likely exchanged. Under New York law, the determination of a reasonable duration for confidentiality clauses often depends on factors such as the nature of the protected information, the industry standards, and the competitive advantage gained through the confidential information. A one-year period could be challenged as insufficient.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe to appoint an arbitrator to 1 day is highly unreasonable and impractical, potentially rendering the arbitration clause unenforceable under New York law. New York courts require arbitration agreements to be fair and reasonable. The extremely short timeframe places an undue burden on the parties and could be seen as procedurally unconscionable.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from New York to Brazil when one of the parties is not based there, and the contract is negotiated and executed in English, creates legal uncertainty and potential conflict. While parties generally have the freedom to choose the governing law, a choice lacking a reasonable relationship to the contract or the parties could be challenged as a violation of public policy or as an attempt to evade mandatory provisions of the law of the jurisdiction with the most significant relationship to the matter. If the contract's performance or significant portions thereof occur in New York, changing the governing law to Brazil could be seen as an attempt to avoid New York's legal protections. New York Courts would very likely refuse to enforce that provision, given that Brazil has very little connection to the subject matter of the agreement.",

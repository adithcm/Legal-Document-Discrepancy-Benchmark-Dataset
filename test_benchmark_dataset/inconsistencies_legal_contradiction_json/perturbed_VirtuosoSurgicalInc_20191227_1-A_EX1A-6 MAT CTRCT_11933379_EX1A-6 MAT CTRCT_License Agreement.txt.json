                "original_text": "4.1 License Fee: As consideration for JHU's grant of a License to Company under this Agreement, Company shall pay to JHU a license fee, cash and equity, as set forth in Exhibit A within thirty (30) days of the EFFECTIVE DATE. The license fee is nonrefundable and shall not be credited against royalties or other fees.",

The license fee is nonrefundable and shall not be credited against royalties or other fees.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment deadline from 30 to 60 days could potentially violate generally accepted accounting principles, which promote timely and accurate financial reporting. While not a direct statutory violation, unreasonably delaying payments could raise concerns about the company's financial stability and adherence to standard business practices, potentially leading to legal disputes regarding breach of contract or good faith.",

Such books and records shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied. The Company shall permit the inspection and copying of such records, files and books of account by JHU or its agents during regular business hours upon ten (10) business days' written notice to the Company. Such inspection shall not be made more than once each calendar year. All costs of such inspection and copying shall be paid by JHU, provided that if any such inspection shall reveal that an error has been made in the amount equal to five percent (5%) or more of such payment, such costs shall be borne by the Company.",
                "changed_text": "4.6 Records: The Company shall make and retain, for a period of one (1) year following the period of each report required by Paragraph 4.4, true and accurate records, files and books of account containing all the data reasonably required for the full computation and verification of sales and other information required in Paragraph 4.4. Such books and records shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied. The Company shall permit the inspection and copying of such records, files and books of account by JHU or its agents during regular business hours upon thirty (30) business days' written notice to the Company.

                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period to one year may violate state and federal statutes of limitations for breach of contract claims, which can extend beyond one year. Similarly, increasing the frequency of inspections to five times per year without reasonable cause could be viewed as harassment or an unreasonable burden, conflicting with principles of fair business practices and potentially constituting a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The change also affects the threshold of error detection for cost allocation, and this also violates general accounting principles.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for termination to 15 days may be deemed unreasonable and conflict with industry standards for licensing agreements. This change can also constitute a breach of implied covenant of good faith, as it significantly reduces the time for JHU to find an alternative party.",

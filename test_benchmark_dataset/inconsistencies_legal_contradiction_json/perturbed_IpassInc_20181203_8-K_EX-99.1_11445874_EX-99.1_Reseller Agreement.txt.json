                "original_text": "3.2 Payment. All payments hereunder will be in US Dollars and are due and payable within thirty (30) days after the date of invoice. iPass may terminate or modify these payment terms with reasonable notice, when, in its reasonable discretion, iPass believes that its payments may be at risk. All rights of Channel Partner are expressly made conditional upon timely payment, without the right of set off, of all amounts due by Channel Partner under the Agreement. Without limiting iPass' other available rights and remedies, iPass reserves the right to suspend or to terminate any Services ten (10) days after sending written notice of a payment that is thirty (30) or more days past due. iPass may include on an invoice, and Channel Partner agrees to pay for: (i) any Services used within one hundred eighty (180) days before the date of the invoice; and (ii) any corrections to amounts invoiced within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the original invoice. If Channel Partner reasonably disputes an invoiced amount, Channel Partner may: (a) withhold such amount from Channel Partner's payment, provided that Channel Partner gives iPass written notice of the dispute and the reason for such dispute within thirty (30) days after the date of invoice, and pays all invoiced amounts not subject to such dispute by the due date; or (b) in the event that the invoiced amount has already been paid in full, submit a claim to iPass within sixty (60) days following the date of the original invoice. The parties will cause their authorized representatives to meet within fifteen (15) days after Channel Partner's notice of dispute to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. If such representatives have not resolved the dispute within fifteen (15) days after their first meeting, the parties will either decide mutually to continue negotiations or, if either party does not desire to continue negotiations, each party may exercise its available remedies with respect to the disputed amounts. To the extent a dispute resolution requires payment of disputed amounts, Channel Partner shall pay such disputed amounts promptly after the dispute is resolved.",

                "explanation": "The payment due date has been changed from 30 to 60 days, which is generally permissible, but the period to suspend or terminate services was reduced from 10 days after 30 days past due to 5 days after 15 days past due, conflicting with typical grace periods and potentially violating good faith business practices. The invoicing period changed from 180 to 360 days and the notification period for disputes changed from 30 to 10 days and also representatives meeting period was extended from 15 days to 30, while dispute period resolution was reduced from 15 to 5 days.",

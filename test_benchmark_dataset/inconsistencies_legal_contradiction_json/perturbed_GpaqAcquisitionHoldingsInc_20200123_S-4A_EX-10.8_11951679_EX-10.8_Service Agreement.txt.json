Payment with respect to such invoice will be due thirty (30) days following receipt by Constellation of such invoice. Constellation shall be solely responsible for the initial cost of installation of all advertising signs covered by this Agreement, and Constellation shall be responsible for the cost of installation of each advertising sign which is changed as a result of a change in the artwork desired by Constellation during the Term subsequent to its initial installation except in the case of temporary signs planned for eventual replacement with permanent signs. Constellation shall be invoiced by the HOF Entities for any installation costs incurred as a result of such advertising signage change at the retail cost charged to the HOF Entities (or either of them) by the installer, without additional markup. Payment with respect to such invoice will be due thirty (30) days following receipt.",

Payment with respect to such invoice will be due sixty (60) days following receipt by Constellation of such invoice. Constellation shall be solely responsible for the initial cost of installation of all advertising signs covered by this Agreement, and Constellation shall be responsible for the cost of installation of each advertising sign which is changed as a result of a change in the artwork desired by Constellation during the Term subsequent to its initial installation except in the case of temporary signs planned for eventual replacement with permanent signs.

Payment with respect to such invoice will be due sixty (60) days following receipt.",
                "explanation": "The original contract specifies payment is due 30 days following receipt of invoice. Changing the payment term to 60 days introduces a legal contradiction because Ohio's Prompt Payment Act generally requires payments to subcontractors within 30 days of receiving an invoice. This change imposes an obligation on Constellation that is inconsistent with state law.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period from 60 days to 20 days for a material breach may contradict legal standards of reasonable notice and opportunity to cure, especially in complex commercial agreements. Courts often imply a 'reasonable' time for cure, and 20 days may be deemed insufficient for certain breaches, potentially violating principles of fair dealing and good faith under Ohio law.",

                "explanation": "Specifying an interest rate of 25% per month significantly exceeds the legal usury rate in Ohio. Ohio Revised Code Section 1343.01 limits the interest rate that can be charged on contracts, and a rate of 25% per month (300% annually) would be considered usurious and unenforceable, potentially leading to penalties.",

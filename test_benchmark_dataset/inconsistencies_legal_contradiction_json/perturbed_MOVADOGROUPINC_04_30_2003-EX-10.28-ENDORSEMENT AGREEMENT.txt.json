                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the event of a \"Company Default\" (as defined below), the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to cure the Company Default by notifying the Company in writing within sixty (60) days after its receipt of notice of a Company Default, or if later, within thirty (30) days after a Trustee becomes aware of the Company Default. If the Company fails to cure the Company Default within sixty (60) days after being notified by the Trust of the Company Default, the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to transfer its interest in the Policy to the Trust. The Trust may exercise this right by notifying the Company, in writing, within sixty (60) days after the Company Default occurs. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall immediately transfer ownership of the Policy to the Trust and the Company shall thereafter have no rights with respect to the Policy.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of a \"Company Default\" (as defined below), the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to cure the Company Default by notifying the Company in writing within fifteen (15) days after its receipt of notice of a Company Default, or if later, within ten (10) days after a Trustee becomes aware of the Company Default. If the Company fails to cure the Company Default within fifteen (15) days after being notified by the Trust of the Company Default, the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to transfer its interest in the Policy to the Trust. The Trust may exercise this right by notifying the Company, in writing, within fifteen (15) days after the Company Default occurs. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall immediately transfer ownership of the Policy to the Trust and the Company shall thereafter have no rights with respect to the Policy.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 60-day cure period for a Company Default, and a 60-day window for the Trust to exercise its right to require the Company to transfer its interest in the policy. Reducing these timelines to 15 days contradicts standard business practice and could be deemed unreasonably short, potentially conflicting with principles of fairness and good faith implied in contract law, particularly under New York law which governs the contract. It also reduces the time a trustee has to become aware of a company default.",

                "changed_text": "The Company shall notify the Trustees of the Trust within fifteen (15) business days of any event which constitutes a Company Default.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the notification period for a Company Default from five (5) business days to fifteen (15) business days undermines the Trust's ability to promptly address and mitigate potential damages resulting from the default. This could be viewed as a breach of fiduciary duty or good faith, particularly if the delay results in financial harm to the Trust. This is pertinent since the contract is governed by New York Law.",

                "original_text": "A claimant who has been completely or partially denied a benefit shall be entitled to appeal this denial of his or her claim by filing a written statement of his or her position with the Plan Administrator no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of the written notification of such denial. The Plan Administrator shall schedule an opportunity for a full and fair review of the issue within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal. The decision on review shall set forth specific reasons for the decision, and shall cite specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Agreement on which the decision is based.",

The decision on review shall set forth specific reasons for the decision, and shall cite specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Agreement on which the decision is based.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the appeal period for denied benefits from sixty (60) days to fifteen (15) days, and the review scheduling period from thirty (30) days to ten (10) days, may be deemed unreasonable and may conflict with ERISA regulations or principles of fairness in claim administration. Claimants need an adequate amount of time to prepare for an appeal, therefore 15 days is too restrictive.",

If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of Customer's rights under this Agreement. If any payment required to be made under this Agreement is not made within twenty (20) days of the applicable date when such payment is due (the \"Late Payment Date\"), interest shall accrue on such past due amount from the Late Payment Date until the date payment is actually made at a quarterly rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Three-Month U.S. dollar LIBOR (Reuters Page LIBOR01) on the Late Payment Date (or the next Business Day if such Late Payment Date is not a Business Day), and (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law.

                "explanation": "Changing the payment term to 120 days contradicts standard commercial practices and possibly prompt payment laws, which often mandate shorter payment periods, especially for businesses. This delay also affects cash flow, which is essential for the manufacturer to maintain operation. Some state laws mandate that payment terms cannot exceed a specific period.",

Notwithstanding the limits set forth in the foregoing sentence, Customer may more frequently conduct \"for cause\" physical inspections or audits of a Facility with five (5) days' advance written notice to Manufacturer if Customer has reasonable cause to believe that an inspection or audit of such Facility is warranted because Manufacturer's activities with respect to such Facility are in breach of this Agreement, applicable Laws, the Quality Agreement or the applicable Facility Addendum. Any such inspection or audit shall include access to relevant Records (subject to the terms of Section 15.2) and Personnel and being present during, as applicable, start-up manufacturing operations, validation, cleaning, sampling, laboratory testing, warehouse receiving and storage, pack out and shipping. Manufacturer shall provide technical assistance and direction to Customer and its representatives at the Facility. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Customer may conduct, at its own expense, periodic quality audits, to ensure Manufacturer's compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Manufacturer shall cooperate with Customer's representatives for all of these purposes, and shall promptly correct any deficiencies noted during the audits. Any Records or information accessed or otherwise obtained by Customer or its representatives during any such inspection or audit or any visit at any Facility shall be deemed Manufacturer's confidential and proprietary Information and each representative of Customer will be subject to non-use and other confidentiality obligations substantially comparable to those set forth herein for Customer.",

This lack of audit access could result in the introduction of unsafe products into the market and contravenes regulatory standards. The inability of the customer to audit for the purposes of checking compliance is a crucial and heavily monitored area.",

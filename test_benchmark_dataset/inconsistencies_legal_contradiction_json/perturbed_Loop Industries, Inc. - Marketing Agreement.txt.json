All Eligible Contracts shall be deemed accepted by the Joint Venture Company and become a Transferred Contract on the date Loop delivers the Proposed Contract Notice for such Eligible Contract to the Joint Venture Company. In the event that the Proposed Contract Notice is a Considered Contract, the Joint Venture Company will have the right to review and determine whether to accept or reject the Considered Contract within ten (10) days following Joint Venture Company's receipt of the Proposed Contract Notice (the \"Review Period\"). Joint Venture Company shall provide Loop with a written acceptance or rejection of each Considered Contract (\"Acceptance Notice\" or \"Rejection Notice,\" as applicable) within the Review Period, which acceptance or rejection shall be in Joint Venture Company's sole discretion. If Joint Venture Company does not provide an Acceptance Notice or Rejection Notice to Loop within the Review Period, the Considered Contract will be deemed rejected by Joint Venture Company. Loop shall be entitled to present any rejected Considered Contract (whether deemed rejected or by receipt of a Rejection Notice) to an Alternate Producer on the same terms and conditions as those presented to Joint Venture Company. If Joint Venture Company provides an Acceptance Notice to Loop with respect to a Considered Contract during the Review Period, that Considered Contract shall become a Transferred Contract on the date Joint Venture Company provides that Acceptance Notice.",

                "explanation": "The Review Period has been changed to 2 days. Making the review period only two days could create a conflict if state laws regulating contracts imply a \"reasonable\" review period, which would almost always exceed 2 days for complex commercial agreements. Furthermore, altering the default outcome of silence from rejection to acceptance puts undue pressure on the Joint Venture Company and may not be considered commercially reasonable.",

                "explanation": "Increase the time period for reducing oral information to written form to ninety (90) days. Delaying the formal documentation of oral confidential disclosures up to 90 days could be considered commercially unreasonable. This extended period increases the risk of memory lapses, disputes about the content of the disclosure, and potential unauthorized use or disclosure of the information before it's formally documented.

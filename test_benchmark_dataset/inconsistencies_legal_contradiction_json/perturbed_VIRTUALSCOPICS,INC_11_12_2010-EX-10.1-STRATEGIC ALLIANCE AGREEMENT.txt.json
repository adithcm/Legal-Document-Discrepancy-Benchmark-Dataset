                "original_text": "VS shall submit monthly invoices to PPD detailing its activities and fees in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, invoices must be submitted to PPD within thirty (30) days of performing the Service or incurring the expense. PPD shall have no obligation to issue payment to VS for Services performed or expenses incurred which were not invoiced to PPD in accordance with this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "VS shall submit monthly invoices to PPD detailing its activities and fees in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, invoices must be submitted to PPD within ninety (90) days of performing the Service or incurring the expense. PPD shall have no obligation to issue payment to VS for Services performed or expenses incurred which were not invoiced to PPD in accordance with this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires invoices to be submitted within 30 days of service. The modified text expands this timeframe to 90 days. In some jurisdictions, prompt payment laws or industry standards may consider a 30-day invoicing period reasonable, and extending it to 90 days could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, potentially contradicting standards for timely payment expectations.",

In furtherance thereof, PPD shall ensure that Sponsor is invoiced no later than ten (10) days following PPD's receipt of VS's invoice, assuming such invoice was provided to PPD by VS in accordance herewith and provided that Sponsor's invoice requirements do not preclude the same.",
                "changed_text": "PPD shall use all reasonable diligence to obtain timely payment from Sponsor in order to make payment to VS within 90 days following the date of invoice receipt. In furtherance thereof, PPD shall ensure that Sponsor is invoiced no later than twenty (20) days following PPD's receipt of VS's invoice, assuming such invoice was provided to PPD by VS in accordance herewith and provided that Sponsor's invoice requirements do not preclude the same.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires PPD to pay VS within 45 days of invoice receipt and invoice Sponsor within 10 days of receiving VS's invoice. The modified text extends these deadlines to 90 days and 20 days, respectively. This delay in payment could be considered unreasonable and violate prompt payment laws or industry standards, particularly in states with stricter payment timelines for services rendered.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement requires 90 days' notice for termination without cause. The modified version reduces this to 30 days. While generally permissible, depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the services provided (e.g., healthcare, research impacting public safety), a 30-day notice period might be deemed unreasonably short and could violate legal or regulatory requirements for ensuring continuity of essential services. In situations where longer notice periods are mandated by law or regulation to safeguard patient welfare or research integrity, this modification would create a legal contradiction.",

                "changed_text": "The Fee shall be payable to Charity Tunes in one installment of $117,605.60 (plus applicable taxes) due to Charity Tunes 120 days after receipt of invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment term to 120 days, which is a significant delay that could be deemed an unfair business practice, depending on industry standards and applicable Canadian provincial prompt payment legislation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of provincial prompt payment legislation in Canada, or general principles of good faith and fair dealing in commercial contracts.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an unreasonably broad and perpetual exclusivity clause. It restricts Charity Tunes from working with any other company in Canada for any product category for the life of the company, which is likely to be deemed an unenforceable restraint of trade under Canadian competition law.",

                "explanation": "This eliminates the requirement for written notice and allows for oral notice, contradicting basic contract law principles that require certain notices (especially those with legal consequences) to be in writing to ensure clarity and proof of delivery. This also conflicts with typical requirements for proper legal notification.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring clear and provable notice, as well as standard legal practices for formal notification.",

                "original_text": "XENCOR shall diligently examine all Product delivered under this Agreement as soon as practicable after receipt. Notice of all claims arising out of or relating to Obvious Defects shall be given in writing to BII within [...***...] after the date of XENCOR's receipt of Product, otherwise, such Product shall be considered free of any Obvious Defects as between BII and XENCOR. XENCOR shall make a damaged Product available for inspection and shall comply with the requirements of any insurance policy covering the Product, and BII shall offer XENCOR all reasonable assistance, at the cost and expense of XENCOR, in pursuing any claims arising out of the transportation of the Product.",
                "changed_text": "XENCOR shall examine all Product delivered under this Agreement at its convenience. Notice of all claims arising out of or relating to Obvious Defects shall be given in writing to BII within one (1) day after the date of XENCOR's receipt of Product, otherwise, such Product shall be considered free of any Obvious Defects as between BII and XENCOR. XENCOR is not obligated to make a damaged Product available for inspection unless it deems such inspection necessary, and BII is not required to offer any assistance related to claims arising out of the transportation of the Product.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'diligent examination' and a reasonable timeframe for claims, protecting the receiving party. The modified text shortens the claim period to one day, and removes the requirement to make the product available, and limits assistance, creating an unreasonable burden on XENCOR and potentially violating implied warranties or fair dealing principles.",

                "explanation": "The confidentiality clause is modified to remove the post-agreement confidentiality period.

                "explanation": "The change removes the breaching party's opportunity to cure a material breach. Many jurisdictions legally imply a right to cure a breach before termination, especially for complex contracts. Eliminating this conflicts with common law principles and could lead to wrongful termination claims if enforced.",

                "explanation": "In contract law, the obligation to deliver materials within 30 days is a standard practice that ensures efficiency and predictability. Extending this timeline to 60 days introduces an inconsistency because delays in escrow deposit could potentially affect the licensee's ability to access critical software components in a timely manner if a release event occurs.",

                "original_text": "6.1.3 the Owner assigns copyright in the Material and the assignee fails within 60 days of such assignment to offer the Licensee substantially similar protection to that provided by this Agreement without significantly increasing the cost to the Licensee; or",
                "changed_text": "6.1.3 the Owner assigns copyright in the Material and the assignee fails within 15 days of such assignment to offer the Licensee substantially similar protection to that provided by this Agreement without significantly increasing the cost to the Licensee; or",
                "explanation": "Decreasing the timeframe from 60 days to 15 days for the assignee to offer similar protection could be deemed unreasonably short. This potentially violates the principle of providing sufficient time for involved parties to ensure legal and contractual obligations are met post-assignment. It is particularly problematic if the assignee needs more time to evaluate the existing agreement and establish equivalent safeguards. Such modifications introduce an inconsistency as industry practices and legal standards generally expect a more extended period for such transitions.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles emphasizing reasonable timeframes for fulfilling obligations post-assignment.",

                "changed_text": "6.3.2 unless within 3 days after the date of delivery the Owner delivers to NCC a counter-notice signed by a duly authorised officer of the Owner stating that no such failure has occurred or that any such failure has been rectified",
                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for the Owner to deliver a counter-notice from 14 days to 3 days creates an unreasonable burden on the Owner. This violates general principles of fairness and adequate notice in contract law. An insufficient timeframe may prevent the Owner from properly investigating the alleged failure and preparing an adequate response. This introduces an inconsistency because standard legal practices usually allow a more reasonable period for such critical communications.",

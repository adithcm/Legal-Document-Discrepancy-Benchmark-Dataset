                "original_text": "(d) Accounting Statement: Royalty statements (which statements shall be on the form attached hereto as Exhibit O and incorporated herein by this reference or such other form as the receiving party may designate in its discretion) shall be due and payments made within thirty (30) days after the close of each calendar quarter in which the paying party received any applicable revenue. Each party shall keep a record of all sales and shall submit, together with the royalty statements, a quarterly summary report of such sales. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to Paragraphs 7(b) (2) and 7(b)(3), Fox shall make all payments of revenue remitted directly by VGSL or any other CSP with whom the parties prospectively agree Fox will receive revenue directly, within thirty (30) days of receipt of such revenue.",
                "changed_text": "(d) Accounting Statement: Royalty statements shall be due and payments made within ninety (90) days after the close of each calendar quarter in which the paying party received any applicable revenue. Each party shall keep a record of all sales and shall submit, together with the royalty statements, a quarterly summary report of such sales. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to Paragraphs 7(b) (2) and 7(b)(3), Fox shall make all payments of revenue remitted directly by VGSL or any other CSP with whom the parties prospectively agree Fox will receive revenue directly, within ninety (90) days of receipt of such revenue.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires royalty payments within 30 days of the end of each quarter, creating a legal contradiction because California law mandates that royalty statements and payments must be provided more frequently, typically within 45 days after the end of the royalty period, so the modified text of 90 days introduces this non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "California law generally provides a longer statute of limitations for contract disputes (typically four years for written contracts). Shortening this period to 6 months is an attempt to unlawfully limit the licensee's legal recourse.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year after the term may be deemed unreasonably short, particularly for trade secrets or other proprietary information with a longer lifespan of economic value. This could be challenged as an unfair restriction, particularly under California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act, which protects trade secrets as long as they remain confidential and provide a competitive advantage.",

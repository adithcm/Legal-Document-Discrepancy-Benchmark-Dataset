                "original_text": "You will contribute to the Buffalo Wild Wings Advertising and Development Fund (\"Fund\") (which may be one of several regional Funds, if we elect to establish separate Funds to serve various regions in which multiple franchisees are located) an amount equal to three percent (3%) of your Gross Sales, as defined in Paragraph X.  Your required payments to the Fund will be made on or before the fifteenth day of the month for the preceding month.  These contributions may be withdrawn from your bank account as provided in Paragraph X.",
                "changed_text": "You will contribute to the Buffalo Wild Wings Advertising and Development Fund (\"Fund\") an amount equal to three percent (3%) of your Gross Sales, as defined in Paragraph X. Your required payments to the Fund will be made on or before the last day of the month following the month for which the sales were recorded. These contributions may be withdrawn from your bank account at any time.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates payment by the 15th of each month, while the changed text extends this to the end of the following month. This conflicts with standard franchise agreements which often require more prompt payments for advertising funds to ensure consistent marketing efforts and immediate access to capital. Many states also have laws that govern the collection and usage of advertising fees.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the non-renewal notice period to one month may violate state franchise laws, which often require franchisors to provide significantly longer notice periods to allow franchisees adequate time to prepare for the termination of their business. This reduction could be deemed an unfair or deceptive practice.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires retention of records for three years. The changed text reduces this period to one year. This can create legal issues since the IRS requires businesses to keep employment tax records for at least four years. Additionally, document retention policies generally recommends 7 years for key accounting records.",
                "contradicted_law": "IRS guidelines on employment tax record retention (at least four years), potentially conflicting with state business laws regarding record-keeping duration.",

                "explanation": "The original contract states a strict deadline of three business days, this introduces uncertainty and possible delays, potentially harming Excite@Home. This delay in removing competitor ads can lead to a breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, as Excite@Home's competitive interests are being actively harmed during this extended period. Courts generally consider adherence to explicitly agreed-upon deadlines as part of fulfilling the duty of good faith.",

                "explanation": "The original contract states a strict deadline of three business days for Application Provider to remove ads of Excite@Home's competitors. By changing the language to 'commercially reasonable efforts,' the contract introduces ambiguity and weakens Application Provider's obligation. 'Commercially reasonable efforts' is a vague standard that can be interpreted in many ways, potentially allowing Application Provider to delay or avoid removing competitor ads altogether.",

Application Provider may continue to direct Program Members to http://www.e-centives.com or its subsequent replacement.",

Application Provider may continue to direct Program Members to http://www.e-centives.com or its subsequent replacement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates specific actions, while the changed clause introduces ambiguity and discretion. This change introduces uncertainty and weakens the protection for Excite@Home's brand and service, potentially harming its reputation and customer relationships. By making compliance discretionary, the changes undermine the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in performing their contractual obligations.",

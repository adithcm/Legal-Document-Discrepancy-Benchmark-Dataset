                "original_text": "You agree to establish the Franchised Business and have it open and in operation within six (6) months after the Effective Date of this Agreement. Time is of the essence.",
                "changed_text": "You agree to establish the Franchised Business and have it open and in operation within two (2) months after the Effective Date of this Agreement. Time is of the essence.",
                "explanation": "This modification reduces the allowable time for establishing the franchise from six months to two months, potentially conflicting with state laws that require franchisors to provide franchisees with a reasonable time to establish their business. Shorter timeframes can be deemed unreasonable, especially considering the complexities involved in site selection, permitting, and construction.",

                "explanation": "This change reduces the required notice period for renewal from six months to two months, potentially violating state franchise laws that mandate a reasonable notice period. A shorter timeframe may not provide the franchisee adequate time to assess their business performance, negotiate renewal terms, or seek legal counsel, especially for significant investments or personal circumstances.",

                "changed_text": "Before starting any activities or operations under this Agreement, you agree to procure and maintain in full force and effect for thirty days (30) at your expense, insurance policies in connection with the Franchised Business or other facilities on premises, or by reason of the construction, operation, or occupancy of the Franchised Business or other facilities on premises.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly reduces the required insurance coverage period from the entire term of the agreement to a mere 30 days.  This conflicts with standard business practices and legal requirements that mandate ongoing insurance coverage for liability, property damage, and other potential risks associated with operating a business. This brief coverage period introduces significant legal and financial vulnerability for both the franchisee and potentially the franchisor.",

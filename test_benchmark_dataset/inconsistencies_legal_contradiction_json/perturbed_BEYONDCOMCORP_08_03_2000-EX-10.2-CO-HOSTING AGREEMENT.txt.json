                "original_text": "Payments from Co-Host to NAI shall be due thirty (30) days from the date of invoice. All payments will be made in United States dollars, free of any taxes then currently applicable, at the address designated above by NAI. Late payments shall bear interest at the lesser of: (i) the maximum rate permitted by law, and (ii) the rate of 1.5% per month from the due date until paid.",
                "changed_text": "Payments from Co-Host to NAI shall be due sixty (60) days from the date of invoice. All payments will be made in United States dollars, free of any taxes then currently applicable, at the address designated above by NAI. Late payments shall bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.5% per month from the due date until paid, irrespective of any legal limits.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for late payment interest at the 'maximum rate permitted by law'. The modified text sets a fixed rate of 2.5% per month, overriding any state usury laws that may set a lower maximum interest rate, thus creating a legal contradiction. California law (where the contract applies) limits the interest rate for late payments.",

                "original_text": "NAI may inspect the records described in Sections 4(c) upon demand from time to time. In addition, Co-Host agrees to allow NAI's independent auditors to audit and analyze appropriate accounting records of Co-Host from time to time (but not more than one every six (6) months) to ensure compliance with all terms of this Agreement. Any such audit shall be permitted by Co-Host within fifteen (15) days of Co-Host's receipt of NAI's written request to audit, during normal business hours. The cost of such an audit will be borne by NAI unless a material discrepancy indicating inadequate record keeping or that additional fees due to NAI are discovered, in which case the cost of the audit shall be borne by Co-Host. A discrepancy shall be deemed material if it involves payment or adjustment of more than five percent of the amount reported in favor of NAI. Audits and inspections shall not interfere unreasonably with Co-Host's business activities.]",
                "changed_text": "NAI may inspect the records described in Sections 4(c) at any time, without prior notice. In addition, Co-Host agrees to allow NAI's independent auditors to audit and analyze appropriate accounting records of Co-Host at any frequency deemed necessary by NAI to ensure compliance with all terms of this Agreement. Any such audit shall be permitted by Co-Host immediately upon NAI's request, regardless of the impact on Co-Host's operations. The cost of all audits will always be borne by Co-Host, irrespective of findings. Audits and inspections can occur whenever NAI deems it necessary, even if it interferes with Co-Host's business activities.]",
                "explanation": "The original text provided some limitations on the audit rights of NAI, protecting Co-Host from unreasonable interference and costs. The modified text removes these protections, allowing NAI to conduct audits at any time, without notice, and at Co-Host's expense, regardless of the outcome or impact on Co-Host's business. This might contradict California law regarding reasonable business practices and potentially introduce an unconscionable clause.",

                "original_text": "If NAI decreases its suggested retail price for any Product (a product upgrade with a different part number will not be the same Product), the decrease will apply to all units of such Product in Co-Host's inventory and orders in transit to Co-Host from NAI that are in an unopened, salable condition as of the effective date of the decrease, provided that such Products had been shipped to Co-Host no more than ninety (90) days prior to such effective date. To be eligible for such price protection, Co-Host must deliver to NAI written evidence, signed by Co-Host, of an inventory of such Products showing the number and location of each unit of Product for which Co-Host claims price protection eligibility hereunder within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of such price decreases. Such reduction will constitute a credit on Co-Host's account for future orders from NAI under this Agreement (unless the Agreement has terminated or expired in which case such reduction will be refunded to the extent that Co-Host does not owe NAI money) in an amount equal to the difference between the net invoice price at which each such unit in inventory was provided to Co-Host and the current price then applicable for shipments of such Product to Co-Host hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "If NAI decreases its suggested retail price for any Product, the decrease will only apply at NAI's discretion, to a limited number of products in Co-Host's inventory that are in an unopened, salable condition. To be eligible for such price protection, Co-Host must deliver to NAI written evidence, signed by Co-Host, of an inventory of such Products showing the number and location of each unit of Product. All requests for price adjustment must be submitted within 5 days of the new price, after this time, the price is final. Any price reduction will be determined by NAI and provided in the form of store credit.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the terms to restrict the applicability of price decreases creates an inconsistency. By limiting price decreases to be only applied at NAI's discretion and setting such a short deadline (5 days to submit all requests) could be deemed unconscionable under California law, because the large inventory could be very difficult to count in such a short period of time. Also, a store credit limit is not clear enough and can be deemed problematic.",

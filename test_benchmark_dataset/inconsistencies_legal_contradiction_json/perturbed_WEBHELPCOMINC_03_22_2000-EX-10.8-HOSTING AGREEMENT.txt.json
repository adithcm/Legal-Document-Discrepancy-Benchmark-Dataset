                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "CUSTOMER AGREES TO PAY FOR HOSTING SERVICES ON OR BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH IN WHICH THE HOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED, except that, with respect to Additional Fees (as defined in Exhibit A), eGain will invoice Customer for such Fees in the month after the month in which such fees accrue as provided in Exhibit A. All amounts payable hereunder are exclusive of any and all taxes, and Customer is responsible for payment of such taxes (excluding taxes based on eGain's net income). All prices are stated, and Customer shall pay, in United States dollars. Payment received by eGain after the due date shall be subject to a late fee equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or, if less, the maximum amount allowed by applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "CUSTOMER AGREES TO PAY FOR HOSTING SERVICES WITHIN 90 DAYS OF RECEIPT OF EGain's INVOICE, except that, with respect to Additional Fees (as defined in Exhibit A), eGain will invoice Customer for such Fees six months after the month in which such fees accrue as provided in Exhibit A. All amounts payable hereunder are exclusive of any and all taxes, and Customer is responsible for payment of such taxes (excluding taxes based on eGain's net income). All prices are stated, and Customer shall pay, in United States dollars. Payment received by eGain after the due date shall be subject to a late fee equal to ten percent (10%) per month.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that payment is due on or before the first day of the month in which the services are provided, which is a common and legally sound practice. By extending the payment terms to 90 days after the invoice and additional fees for 6 months, it creates payment terms that could be considered unreasonable or potentially conflict with California's prompt payment laws, especially if the delay significantly harms the service provider. Also, a 10% late fee is usurious.",

                "original_text": "At the end of the initial one-year term of this Agreement and any subsequent one-year terms, eGain may adjust the monthly fee payable under this Agreement by providing Customer written notice of such adjustment at least sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of the new term.",
                "changed_text": "At the end of the initial one-year term of this Agreement and any subsequent one-year terms, eGain may adjust the monthly fee payable under this Agreement by providing Customer written notice of such adjustment at least fifteen (15) days prior to the beginning of the new term.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for fee adjustments to 15 days may be considered an unreasonably short period under contract law principles, especially for significant price increases. This could be deemed a breach of good faith and fair dealing, as it doesn't provide the customer with sufficient time to assess the new fees and make informed decisions about renewing the contract. Courts in California may view this as an attempt to unfairly leverage the contract renewal process.",

                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving to the other party written notice of such termination upon the other party's material breach of any material term (subject to the other party's right to cure within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice), the other party's insolvency, or the institution of any bankruptcy or similar proceedings by or against the other party.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving to the other party written notice of such termination upon the other party's material breach of any material term (subject to the other party's right to cure within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice), the other party's insolvency, or the institution of any bankruptcy or similar proceedings by or against the other party.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from 30 days to 10 days could be viewed as unreasonable and may violate principles of fairness and good faith, particularly in complex commercial agreements. This shortened period might not allow the breaching party sufficient time to rectify the issue, potentially leading to unjust termination, which could be challenged under California law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under California contract law related to reasonable opportunity to cure breaches.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires 'reasonable grounds to believe' and confirmation that each person is an Accredited Investor. The modified text weakens this requirement by using terms like 'operate under the assumption' and 'likely an Accredited Investor,' which does not ensure compliance with SEC regulations regarding verifying Accredited Investor status.",
                "contradicted_law": "SEC Rule 506(b) of Regulation D, which requires reasonable steps to verify accredited investor status.",

                "explanation": "The original text contains a firm representation and warranty that no disqualification events exist, except those disclosed in writing. The modified text weakens this by changing the standard to 'best efforts to ensure' and allowing oral disclosure instead of written disclosure. This creates potential non-compliance with Rule 506(b) which requires due diligence and written disclosure.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'in accordance' with 'substantially in accordance', the clause introduces ambiguity and allows for potential deviations from the Agency Agreement's terms. This could violate securities laws if the deviations are material and affect the legality of the offering.",

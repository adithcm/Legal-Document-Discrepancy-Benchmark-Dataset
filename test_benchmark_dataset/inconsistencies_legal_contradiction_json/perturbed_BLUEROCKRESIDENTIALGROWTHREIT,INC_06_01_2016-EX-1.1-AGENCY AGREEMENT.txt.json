                "original_text": "The Company will deliver the Offered Shares to or as directed by the Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Agent at or before 11:30 A.M., New York time, on May 26, 2016, or at such other time not later than seven (7) full business days thereafter as the Agent and the Company mutually determine, in the sole discretion of each, such time being herein referred to as the \"Settlement Date\". Immediately and only upon receipt of funds equal to the gross offering price of the Offered Shares, the Agent will then facilitate payment of the proceeds net of the Agent's fees specified herein, to the Company in Federal (same day) funds by wire transfer to an account at a bank acceptable to the Agent drawn to the order of the Company at the office of Bass, Berry & Sims PLC (\"BBS\"), no later than 5:30 P.M., New York time, on May 26, 2016.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will deliver the Offered Shares to or as directed by the Agent at their discretion, but no later than thirty (30) full business days thereafter as the Agent and the Company mutually determine, in the sole discretion of each, such time being herein referred to as the \"Settlement Date\". Immediately and only upon receipt of funds equal to the gross offering price of the Offered Shares, the Agent will then facilitate payment of the proceeds net of the Agent's fees specified herein, to the Company at their discretion, but no later than 5:30 P.M., New York time, on the 10th day after the delivery of the shares.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement specified a specific and relatively short timeframe for the delivery of shares and payment of proceeds. The modified version extends this timeframe to thirty business days, which is an unreasonably long period, potentially conflicting with regulations or industry standards requiring prompt settlement and creates ambiguity around payment terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, potential violation of securities regulations requiring prompt settlement.",
                "location": "Section 3"

                "original_text": "The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Offered Shares for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Agent designate and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution but in no event longer than one year.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Offered Shares for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Agent designate, and will continue such qualifications for a period of one (1) month, after which the Agent assumes responsibility for continued compliance.",
                "explanation": "The original text commits the company to maintain blue sky qualifications for at least one year. Many blue sky laws require continuous compliance during the entire distribution period. Transferring this responsibility to the agent after one month could cause the agent to sell unqualified securities and may cause the underwriter to violate state securities laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "State blue sky laws regarding continuous compliance during the distribution period.",

                "changed_text": "If the Offered Shares are not sold by May 26, 2017, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of the Company and the Agent, except as provided in Section 10 hereof.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a specific termination date for the agreement. The modified version extends the agreement by a year, which is unreasonable given that the agreement mentions in previous sections that this is a continuous offering. If it is a continuous offering, the shares should be sold as soon as possible.",

SFJ will have primary responsibility for conducting the Phase 3 Trial in the Designated Asian Countries and sole responsibility for conducting the other Clinical Trials in the Designated Asian Countries (provided that SFJ may elect not to conduct Clinical Trials in Hong Kong). If SFJ elects to conduct any PK Study in Japanese Subjects in the US or Chinese Subjects in the US, PB shall, with SFJ's assistance and cooperation, file an appropriate amendment to the US IND for the Product with the protocol for such PK Study, and SFJ may conduct such PK Study in the applicable Subjects in the US in accordance with such protocol. In connection with any Japanese or Chinese PK Study during the Development Term, (i) SFJ will have sole responsibility for interactions with Regulatory Authorities in Japan and China, with PB to have Participation Rights, and (ii) PB, as the sponsor of the US IND for the Product, will have primary formal responsibility for interactions with the FDA regarding any PK Study conducted in Japanese Subjects or Chinese Subjects (as applicable) in the US, with SFJ to have Participation Rights, but, as between PB and SFJ (but not vis-à-vis the FDA), SFJ shall, in consultation with PB, determine the strategy for such interactions, and, except to the extent contrary to Applicable Law or in violation of PB's duties as the sponsor of such US IND, PB's interactions with the FDA shall at all times be consistent with SFJ's strategy. Thereafter, if the Phase 3 Trial meets the Phase 3 Trial Success Criteria and the necessary endpoints are met in the other Clinical Trials in the SFJ Territory, SFJ will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to perform all activities associated with submitting BLAs and seeking Regulatory Approval for the Indication in Japan and China, and PB will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to perform all activities associated with seeking Approval for the Indication in the Designated European Countries. Upon approval of a BLA for the Product for the Indication by NMPA in China or PMDA in Japan, SFJ, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall, and hereby does, assign to PB all of SFJ's and its Affiliates' right, title and interest in and to all INDs, BLAs and Regulatory Approvals (including all amendments and supplements to any of the foregoing) and other filings with, and formal submissions to, NMPA or PMDA, respectively, and other applicable Regulatory Authorities in such country, in each case, with respect to the Product in such country (collectively, \"Product Filings\"). Within [***] after assignment of such Product Filings in the applicable country, SFJ shall deliver to PB: (a) true, correct and complete copies of all Product Filings in such country (in each case, whether held in the name of SFJ or any of its Affiliates), and disclose to PB in writing all previously-undisclosed Research Results within the Trial Data Package; (b) formally transfer or assign, or cause to be formally transferred or assigned, into the name of PB or its designee all Product Filings in such country (in each case, whether held in the name of SFJ or any of its Affiliates); and (c) take such other actions and execute such other instruments, assignments and documents as may be necessary to effect, evidence, register and record the transfer, assignment or other conveyance of such rights to PB or its designee.",

                "original_text": "The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after  the completion of the Subscription Offering (the \"End Date\"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in  next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date. In the event the Offering is extended beyond the End  Date, the Company and the Agent may agree to renew this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.",
                "changed_text": "The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 15 days after the completion of the Subscription Offering (the \"End Date\"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date. In the event the Offering is extended beyond the End Date, the Company and the Agent may agree to renew this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.",
                "explanation": "Shortening the deadline for the termination of the Agent's obligations to 15 days after the completion of the Subscription Offering may conflict with regulations requiring a reasonable period for winding down activities related to securities offerings and ensuring compliance with post-offering requirements. It may not provide enough time for reconciliation and other closing actions.",

                "original_text": "The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the close of the period  covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 of the 1933 Act Regulations) covering a twelve-month  period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the effective date (as defined in such Rule 158) of the  Registration Statement.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but not later than 120 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 of the 1933 Act Regulations) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the effective date (as defined in such Rule 158) of the Registration Statement.",
                "explanation": "Extending the deadline for providing earnings statements to 120 days after the close of the period could potentially violate SEC regulations that mandate timely financial reporting and disclosure to investors. Rule 158 does not specify the period to publish an earning statement. However, other rules around periodic filings (10-K) require earlier publication.",

                "explanation": "Delaying the release of earnings statements to 180 days post-period end extends the reporting timeline beyond what is generally acceptable under SEC guidelines. This creates non-compliance with expected financial disclosure standards and could be viewed negatively by investors.",

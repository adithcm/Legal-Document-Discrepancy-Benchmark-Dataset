                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that monthly payments are due by the 10th of each month. Changing this to the 60th of each month creates a contradiction, as months do not have 60 days. This creates an ambiguous and potentially unenforceable payment term, violating standard contract law principles regarding clarity and definiteness in payment schedules.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the audit notice period from seven (7) days to one (1) day is unreasonable and potentially violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which is part of contract law in California, where HCI is located.

In other instances, MediaLinx shall be entitled to use or publicly disclose the data collected subject to privacy guidelines noted above.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the restriction period on using user data from six months to one month is a legal contradiction because it unreasonably shortens the time frame for protecting user privacy. This action is problematic because, under Canadian and US laws (where the entities operate), data use is regulated, and one month may be deemed insufficient to protect users from targeted advertising or competitive practices based on their data, conflicting with consumer protection laws.",

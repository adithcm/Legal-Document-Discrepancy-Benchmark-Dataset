                "original_text": "(c) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than two business days following the execution of this Agreement, the Nominating Committee and the Board shall take all necessary action to (i) increase the size of the Board from eight to nine directors, with such new Board seat to be in Class III, (ii) appoint the New Director as a Class III director on the Board and (iii) appoint the New Director to the Nominating Committee.",
                "changed_text": "(c) The Nominating Committee and the Board shall take action to (i) increase the size of the Board from eight to nine directors, with such new Board seat to be in Class III, (ii) appoint the New Director as a Class III director on the Board and (iii) appoint the New Director to the Nominating Committee at their convenience.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a deadline of 'no event later than two business days' for appointing the new director. By changing this to 'at their convenience,' the contract provides no definite timeline for the action. Delaware law requires corporate actions to be taken within a reasonable time frame, and this change introduces ambiguity and potential for unreasonable delay, conflicting with those requirements.",

                "original_text": "The Marathon Parties shall provide written evidence of such vote to the Company no later than ten (10) business days prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting.",
                "changed_text": "The Marathon Parties shall provide written evidence of such vote to the Company at their convenience.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that the Marathon Parties must provide written evidence of their vote no later than ten business days before the 2020 Annual Meeting. The modified text, 'at their convenience,' removes the defined deadline. This contradicts the standard requirement for clear and enforceable deadlines in contracts, making it difficult for the company to ensure compliance with the agreement's voting provisions before the meeting. It undermines the enforceability of the agreement and creates a situation where the company lacks proper notice, which is a basic element of fair dealing in contracts.",

Any notices, consents, determinations, waivers or other communications required or permitted to be given under the terms of this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been delivered: (i) upon receipt, when delivered personally; (ii) upon receipt, when sent by e-mail to the e-mail address for a Party set forth below; and (iii) one (1) business day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, in each case properly addressed to the Party to receive the same.",
                "changed_text": "(l) Notices. Any notices, consents, determinations, waivers or other communications required or permitted to be given under the terms of this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been delivered: (i) two weeks after the date of mailing when delivered personally; (ii) upon acknowledgement by the recipient, when sent by e-mail to the e-mail address for a Party set forth below; and (iii) 30 business days after deposit with the US Postal Service, in each case properly addressed to the Party to receive the same.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes specific and relatively prompt timeframes for deemed delivery of notices (upon receipt for personal and email, one business day for overnight). The modified text introduces delays that could severely impact the ability to enforce time-sensitive provisions of the agreement.  For example, requiring two weeks for personal delivery and 30 days after deposit with USPS significantly delays the effective date of any notice, potentially causing breaches or missed deadlines. This is especially problematic in corporate governance matters, where timely notice is critical for shareholder rights and corporate actions.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring reasonableness in notice provisions to ensure fairness and enforceability. California law also mandates certain notice periods for specific corporate actions, and these delays could violate those regulations.",

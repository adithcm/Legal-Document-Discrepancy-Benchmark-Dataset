                "original_text": "The Offeree shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice from the Selling Party (the \"Option Period\") to elect either (i) to purchase the Selling Party's interest in the Operating Company or (ii) to sell the Offeree's interest in the Operating Company to the Selling Party, in either case on the same terms and conditions as those contained in the Offer. If the Offeree makes one of such elections, the applicable purchase and sale shall take place within sixty (60) days after the date of the Offeree's election in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer or such other terms and conditions as the Selling Party and the Offeree shall mutually agree.",
                "changed_text": "The Offeree shall have ten (10) days after receipt of the notice from the Selling Party (the \"Option Period\") to elect either (i) to purchase the Selling Party's interest in the Operating Company or (ii) to sell the Offeree's interest in the Operating Company to the Selling Party, in either case on the same terms and conditions as those contained in the Offer. If the Offeree makes one of such elections, the applicable purchase and sale shall take place within ninety (90) days after the date of the Offeree's election in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer or such other terms and conditions as the Selling Party and the Offeree shall mutually agree.",
                "explanation": "By reducing the option period to 10 days, it may not provide sufficient time for the offeree to secure financing or conduct due diligence which can be viewed as commercially unreasonable. Simultaneously, extending the purchase and sale timeframe to 90 days after the election when 60 days is more customary without a valid rationale can also introduce uncertainty.",

On the closing date specified in the response notice, the Parties shall consummate the transaction selected in the response notice unless both Parties expressly agree otherwise.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the election period from 21 days to 7 days may be considered too short a timeframe for a party to adequately assess the offer, secure necessary financing, and make an informed decision about selling or purchasing the other party's interest.",

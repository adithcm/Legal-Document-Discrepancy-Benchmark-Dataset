                "original_text": "Within [***] after execution thereof, Distributor shall provide Zogenix with a full and complete copy of each Sub- distributor agreement (provided that Distributor may redact any confidential information contained therein that is not relevant to compliance with this Agreement).",
                "changed_text": "Within [***] after execution thereof, Distributor shall provide Zogenix with a summary of each Sub- distributor agreement (provided that Distributor may redact any confidential information contained therein that is not relevant to compliance with this Agreement).",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the transparency of the sub-distributor agreements by limiting the information provided to Zogenix to a summary, rather than a full copy. This could potentially hinder Zogenix's ability to adequately assess compliance with applicable laws, including the FCPA, since full copies of the agreements would allow Zogenix to see the complete terms and conditions. Lack of transparency could violate compliance requirements under the FCPA, which necessitates that companies have controls in place to prevent bribery and corruption, including oversight of third-party relationships. Some laws requires to retain full documents, not summaries.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the notification requirement for MHLW audits. The added phrase 'unless the audit is deemed routine' gives the notifying party discretion to withhold information about audits, which could impede the other party's ability to monitor compliance and risk. Regulatory laws typically mandate the sharing of all audit-related information in a timely manner. By adding an exception for 'routine' audits without clear definition, the revised clause contradicts standard practice and legal requirements.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to '1 year' could be problematic if trade secrets or proprietary information require longer protection under applicable intellectual property laws. Some trade secret laws provide for indefinite protection as long as the information remains confidential and provides a competitive advantage. By setting a fixed, short-term limit, the agreement fails to provide adequate protection and could conflict with legal standards for protecting trade secrets.",

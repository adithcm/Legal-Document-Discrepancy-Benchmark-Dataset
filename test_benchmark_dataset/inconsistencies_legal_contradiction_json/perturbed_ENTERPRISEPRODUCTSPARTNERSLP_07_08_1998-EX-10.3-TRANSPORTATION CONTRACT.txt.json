                "original_text": "(b) Minimum filing requirements. A claim must be filed with Carrier within thirty (30) days from the date the shipment in question was delivered, and (i) contain facts sufficient to identify the shipment (or shipments) involved (ii) assert the grounds for Carrier's liability for alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay, and (iii) request payment of a specified or determinable amount of money.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Minimum filing requirements. A claim must be filed with Carrier within ten (10) days from the date the shipment in question was delivered, and (i) contain facts sufficient to identify the shipment (or shipments) involved (ii) assert the grounds for Carrier's liability for alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay, and (iii) request payment of a specified or determinable amount of money.",
                "explanation": "The modification shortens the claim filing period to 10 days. This contradicts the Carmack Amendment, which, while not directly applicable to all motor carriers, sets a benchmark of a reasonable time for filing claims. Many courts interpret this to be at least nine months for cargo damage or loss claims. Reducing it to 10 days introduces non-compliance, as it's an unreasonably short timeframe.",

                "original_text": "(a) Carrier shall pay, decline, or make a firm compromise settlement offer in writing to the claimant within 120 days after receipt of the claim by Carrier. Provided, however, that, if the claim cannot be processed and disposed of within 120 days after receipt thereof, Carrier shall at that time and at the expiration of each succeeding 60 day period while the claim remains pending, advise the claimant in writing of the status of the claim and the reason for the delay in making final disposition thereof.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Carrier shall pay, decline, or make a firm compromise settlement offer in writing to the claimant within 300 days after receipt of the claim by Carrier. Provided, however, that, if the claim cannot be processed and disposed of within 300 days after receipt thereof, Carrier is not obligated to communicate about the status of claim.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the time to settle a cargo claim to 300 days and removes obligation to communicate the status of the claim. This contradicts the Carmack Amendment principles regarding reasonable dispatch in claim settlement and the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, as it makes an unreasonably long timeframe and removes status updates, potentially harming the claimant.",

                "explanation": "The modification drastically reduces the timeframe for filing claims related to overcharges, duplicate payments, or overcollections from nine months to thirty days. This is an unreasonably short timeframe and introduces non-compliance with industry standards and potential legal challenges, violating federal or state laws regarding fair business practices.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Services are deemed to be accepted if MMI does not receive a notification within 60 days after delivery to Dragon Systems or its customers.",
                "changed_text": "The Services are deemed to be accepted if MMI does not receive a notification within 10 days after delivery to Dragon Systems or its customers.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the acceptance notification period to 10 days may be considered an unreasonably short timeframe, potentially conflicting with the buyer's rights to inspect and reject goods, especially if defects are not immediately apparent. This could violate implied warranty laws or the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) which, while not explicitly defining a timeframe, requires a reasonable opportunity for inspection and rejection.",

                "changed_text": "Payments will be due in US dollars within 90 days after delivery, or 120 days from the receipt of invoice by Dragon Systems, whichever is later.",
                "explanation": "Extending the payment term to 90 days after delivery or 120 days after invoice receipt may violate prompt payment laws if such laws mandate shorter payment periods for goods or services, especially in specific industries or for government contracts. Many jurisdictions have prompt payment laws that require payments within 30-45 days to facilitate cash flow for vendors.",

                "original_text": "Should MMI not supply the Services as agreed or should the Services become defective within 6 months from their delivery to Dragon Systems, Dragon Systems may at its option require MMI to complete or re-perform the Services within a reasonable period of time, rescind the contract or refuse payment of the compensation in part or in total, notwithstanding any damage claims.",
                "changed_text": "Should MMI not supply the Services as agreed or should the Services become defective within 1 month from their delivery to Dragon Systems, Dragon Systems may at its option require MMI to complete or re-perform the Services within a reasonable period of time, rescind the contract or refuse payment of the compensation in part or in total, notwithstanding any damage claims.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the warranty period to 1 month from delivery could be deemed unconscionable and contradict implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose under the UCC, especially for complex products where defects might not manifest within such a short timeframe. This could also violate consumer protection laws providing for longer implied warranty periods.",

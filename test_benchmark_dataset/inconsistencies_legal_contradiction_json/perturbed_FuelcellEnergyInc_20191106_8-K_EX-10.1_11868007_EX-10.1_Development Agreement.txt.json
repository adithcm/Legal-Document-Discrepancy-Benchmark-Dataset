                "explanation": "This change extends the invoicing period to 45 days, potentially conflicting with standard business practices and prompt payment laws that favor shorter invoicing cycles. Many jurisdictions imply a 'reasonable time' for invoicing, and 45 days could be considered unreasonable, especially if it deviates significantly from industry norms or prior dealings between the parties.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if ExxonMobil has a good faith dispute regarding any amounts invoiced by FCE, ExxonMobil may withhold payment for the disputed amount, provided that ExxonMobil pays the undisputed amount and notifies FCE in writing of the specific amount and nature of the dispute promptly upon receipt of FCE's invoice in which case the Parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith. The Parties shall endeavor to resolve such dispute within fifteen (15) days of notice of the dispute, and ExxonMobil shall remit payment to FCE within fifteen (15) days of resolution of such dispute.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if ExxonMobil has a good faith dispute regarding any amounts invoiced by FCE, ExxonMobil may withhold payment for the disputed amount, provided that ExxonMobil pays the undisputed amount and notifies FCE in writing of the specific amount and nature of the dispute promptly upon receipt of FCE's invoice in which case the Parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith.

                "explanation": "This change extends the payment period to 90 days and dispute resolution to 45 days which may contradict state laws that mandate shorter payment terms, especially for small businesses. Such extended periods might be deemed unreasonable and could violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, particularly if the industry standard or prior dealings suggest a shorter timeframe.",

                "original_text": "12.2 Any portions of this Agreement necessary to resolve or cash out imbalances under this Agreement as required by the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's Tariff shall survive the other parts of this Agreement until such time as such balancing has been accomplished; provided, however, that Transporter notifies Shipper of such imbalance not later than twelve months after the termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "12.2 Any portions of this Agreement necessary to resolve or cash out imbalances under this Agreement as required by the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's Tariff shall survive the other parts of this Agreement until such time as such balancing has been accomplished; provided, however, that Transporter notifies Shipper of such imbalance not later than six months after the termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for imbalances to six months after termination may be considered unreasonably short under certain state laws or FERC regulations, potentially hindering the shipper's ability to verify and reconcile imbalances, thus creating a legal contradiction. Statutes of limitations may require longer periods for resolving such financial matters.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state statutes of limitations for resolving contractual imbalances, potentially conflicting with FERC regulations.",

                "changed_text": "Shipper must notify Transporter on or before October 31, 2006 of its intent to terminate the attached service agreement. Such termination shall become effective as of December 1, 2006.",
                "explanation": "Changing the effective termination date to December 1, 2006, significantly shortens the notice period required for termination. This could contradict general contract law principles regarding reasonable notice for termination, particularly for agreements of this nature and duration, and could be seen as unfair to the Transporter, potentially being unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement will terminate automatically upon verbal notice from Transporter in the event Shipper fails to pay all of the amount of any bill for service rendered by Transporter hereunder in accord with the terms and conditions of Article VI of the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff.",
                "explanation": "Changing the required notice from 'written' to 'verbal' for termination due to non-payment is problematic. Verbal notice is difficult to prove and could contradict standard business practices and legal requirements in Kentucky, which generally require written notice for significant contractual actions to ensure clarity and documentation. Some states may require documented or written proof of notifications. Changing it to 'verbal' notice makes it contradictory.",

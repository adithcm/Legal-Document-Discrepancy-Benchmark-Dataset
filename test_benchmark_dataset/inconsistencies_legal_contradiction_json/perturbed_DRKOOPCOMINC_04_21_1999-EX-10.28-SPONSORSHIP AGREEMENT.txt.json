                "original_text": "All notices, statements and reports required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and deemed to have been effectively given and received: (i) five (5) business days after the date of mailing if sent by registered or certified U.S. mail, postage prepaid, with return receipt requested; (ii) when transmitted if sent by facsimile, provided a confirmation of transmission is produced by the sending machine and a copy of such facsimile is promptly sent by another means specified in this section; or (iii) when delivered if delivered personally or sent by express courier service.",
                "changed_text": "All notices, statements and reports required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and deemed to have been effectively given and received: (i) fifteen (15) business days after the date of mailing if sent by regular U.S. mail, postage prepaid, with no return receipt requested; (ii) when transmitted if sent by facsimile, provided a confirmation of transmission is produced by the sending machine; or (iii) when delivered if delivered personally or sent by standard courier service.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces several contradictions to standard legal practices and could violate requirements for providing adequate and timely notice. Extending the mailing time to 15 business days and removing the requirement for registered or certified mail with return receipt increases the risk that the notice may not be received promptly or at all, which could be considered unreasonable notice. Similarly, removing the need to send a copy of the facsimile by another means could affect confirmation of notice. Changing 'express' to 'standard' courier service can also cause delays.",

                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' written notice of a breach by the other party, provided such breach is not cured within such thirty-day period.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days' verbal notice of a breach by the other party, provided such breach is not cured within such ten-day period.",
                "explanation": "The modified text reduces the notice period for termination due to breach from 30 days to 10 days and changes the notice from written to verbal. This creates a legal contradiction because in many jurisdictions, a shorter notice period may be deemed unreasonable, especially for complex commercial agreements. Additionally, requiring only verbal notice makes it difficult to prove that notice was given and received, contradicting standard legal practices that require written documentation for significant contractual actions.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring reasonable notice and the Statute of Frauds, which may require certain agreements to be in writing.",

Each party shall have no longer than three (3) days to present its position.",
                "changed_text": "Any and all disputes, controversies and claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or concerning the respective rights or obligations of the parties hereto shall be settled and determined by arbitration in a forum chosen solely by the initiating party before an arbitrator selected by the initiating party. Each party shall have no longer than one (1) day to present its position.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces contradictions related to fairness and due process in arbitration. Allowing the initiating party to choose the arbitration forum and the arbitrator introduces bias and contradicts the principle of neutral arbitration. Reducing the time for each party to present its position to one day unreasonably restricts their ability to prepare and present their case adequately. These modifications conflict with standard arbitration practices and legal requirements for fair dispute resolution.",

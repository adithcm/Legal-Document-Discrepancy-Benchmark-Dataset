                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Purchase Orders not received by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time are considered to be received on the following business day. Supplier will confirm or reject Purchase Orders within [***] of receipt of the Purchase Order. Orders not rejected in writing within such time will be deemed confirmed and accepted by Supplier.",
                "changed_text": "Purchase Orders not received by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time are considered to be received on the following business day. Supplier will confirm or reject Purchase Orders within 48 hours of receipt of the Purchase Order. Orders not rejected within such time will be deemed confirmed and accepted by Supplier.",
                "explanation": "This change shortens the confirmation timeframe for purchase orders. While a specific federal law doesn't dictate this, many states have 'Uniform Commercial Code' (UCC) provisions requiring a 'reasonable time' for acceptance or rejection, which is highly context-dependent. Setting a fixed, short timeframe of 48 hours could be deemed unreasonable depending on the complexity/volume of the order, conflicting with UCC principles of reasonableness in contract law and potentially disadvantaging the supplier. State laws governing contracts generally expect 'reasonable' time for responding to offers.",

                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement for cause if the other Party fails to perform any material provision of this Agreement or commits a material breach of this Agreement which is not corrected within 10 days after receiving written notice of the failure or breach. except that if the default is by Supplier that creates an immediate public food safety risk, PNC may terminate this Agreement immediately without regard to any period for correction.",
                "explanation": "This modification shortens the cure period for a material breach to 10 days. Depending on the nature of the breach and the governing state's contract law, a 10-day cure period may be considered unreasonably short, particularly for complex issues, thus making this provision potentially unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Many states require insurance companies to provide at least 10 to 30 days' notice of cancellation or material change in coverage to named insureds or additional insureds, depending on the type of insurance. Reducing the notice period to five days could violate state insurance regulations, making the contract provision non-compliant and potentially unenforceable.",

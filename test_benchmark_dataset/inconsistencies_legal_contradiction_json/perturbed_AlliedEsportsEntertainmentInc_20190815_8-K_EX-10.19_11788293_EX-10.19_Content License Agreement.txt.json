                "original_text": "ii. Licensor will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide approval and/or feedback within five (5) business days after its receipt of a creative submission, or re-submission, with respect to the Licensed Property or marketing materials; provided that: (a) if Licensor declines to approve any submission or re-submission, then it shall provide reasonably detailed feedback in order to enable Licensee to modify the Licensed Property or marketing material accordingly in order to address Licensor's concerns and obtain Licensor's approval, and (b) if Licensor fails to (1) approve or (2) disapprove and provide feedback within such timeframe, then such submission or re-submission is deemed to have been approved. No approval may be unreasonably withdrawn by Licensor once delivered.",
                "changed_text": "ii. Licensor will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide approval and/or feedback within ten (10) business days after its receipt of a creative submission, or re-submission, with respect to the Licensed Property or marketing materials; provided that: (a) if Licensor declines to approve any submission or re-submission, then it shall provide feedback as the Licensor deems necessary, and (b) if Licensor fails to (1) approve or (2) disapprove and provide feedback within such timeframe, then such submission or re-submission is deemed to have been rejected. No approval may be withdrawn by Licensor once delivered.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the approval process of advertising materials. The original text states that if the licensor fails to approve or disapprove within five business days, the submission is deemed approved. This has been changed to ten business days, and the submission is deemed rejected if no response is given.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles related to timely communication and implied consent; reasonable timeframes for response are often implied, and changing 'deemed approved' to 'deemed rejected' can be argued as bad faith.",

                "original_text": "d. Reporting. Zynga will, within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the first full calendar quarter following the Effective Date, furnish WPT with complete statements containing the following information with respect to all Net Revenue from the use of the WPT-brand on the Zynga platform, during the preceding period covered by such statement: the Territory; the amount due WPT (or the remaining unrecouped Annual Minimum Guarantee balance as applicable); Net Revenue; Royalties rate; the distribution channels or portals, the platform, the territory(ies), and itemized Allowable Deductions (\"Royalty Statement(s)\"). The amount shown to be payable to WPT shall be paid simultaneously with the rendition of the respective Royalty Statement.",
                "changed_text": "d. Reporting. Zynga will, within ninety (90) days of the end of each calendar year, furnish WPT with statements containing only the amount due WPT from the use of the WPT-brand on the Zynga platform. Payment will be made at Zynga's discretion, within 180 days after the statement is provided.",
                "explanation": "The original contract specifies quarterly reports and simultaneous payment. This has been modified to annual reports with payment at Zynga's discretion within 180 days. This contradicts standard accounting practices for royalty payments and could be viewed as an attempt to delay payment unlawfully.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract, violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and potential violations of accounting standards requiring timely and accurate financial reporting.",

                "original_text": "f. Force Majeure. In the event that either party is prevented from engaging in the marketing and promotional activities in Exhibit A manufacturing, distributing or selling the Licensed Property because of any act of God; unavoidable accident; fire, epidemic; strike, lockout, or other labor dispute; war, riot or civil commotion; act of public enemy; enactment of any rule, law, order or act of government or governmental instrumentality (whether federal, state, local or foreign); or other cause beyond such party's control, and such condition continues for a period of two (2) months or more, either party hereto shall have the right to terminate this Agreement effective at any time during the continuation of such condition by giving the other party at least thirty (30) days' notice to such effect. In such event, all payments made shall become immediately due and payable and this Agreement shall be automatically terminated.",
                "changed_text": "f. Force Majeure. In the event that either party is prevented from engaging in the marketing and promotional activities in Exhibit A because of any minor inconvenience, such as a traffic delay or a change in employee availability, and such condition continues for a period of one (1) week or more, either party hereto shall have the right to terminate this Agreement effective immediately without notice. In such event, all future payments are waived.",
                "explanation": "The modification significantly broadens the definition of 'Force Majeure' to include minor inconveniences and shortens the required continuation period. This creates a substantial imbalance in contractual obligations, allowing termination for insignificant reasons, and eliminates the notice period, which is likely unenforceable and unconscionable under contract law. It also waives future payments, which may not be permissible.",
                "contradicted_law": "Unconscionability in contract law, breach of contract due to bad faith termination, and potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Force majeure clauses typically require significant, unforeseen events, not minor inconveniences.",

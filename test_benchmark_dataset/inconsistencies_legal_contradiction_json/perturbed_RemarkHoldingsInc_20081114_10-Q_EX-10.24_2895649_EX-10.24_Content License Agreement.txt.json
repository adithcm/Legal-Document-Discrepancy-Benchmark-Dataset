                "explanation": "This change introduces a potential violation of accounting and contract law principles by setting an unusually long payment period for excess royalties (150 days). Simultaneously, it imposes a short deadline (10 days) for disputing royalty statements. While there's no specific US federal law universally mandating royalty payment timelines, such an imbalance could be deemed unconscionable or to violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, particularly if industry standards or state-specific laws suggest more reasonable timeframes. Contractual clauses that significantly disadvantage one party can be challenged.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from 60 days to 10 days could be deemed unreasonable and conflict with principles of contract law. Courts often consider the reasonableness of cure periods, especially for complex contracts. A cure period that is too short might be considered a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, as it doesn't allow a sufficient opportunity to rectify the breach.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year may be insufficient to protect sensitive business information, particularly trade secrets which, under applicable state and federal laws (like the Defend Trade Secrets Act), are meant to be protected as long as they remain trade secrets. Setting a one-year limit, even with the trade secret exception, creates ambiguity and could undermine the protection afforded to non-trade secret confidential information, conflicting with the intent to protect valuable intellectual property inherent in trade secret law. This is especially true in industries where the value of confidential information extends beyond a single year.",

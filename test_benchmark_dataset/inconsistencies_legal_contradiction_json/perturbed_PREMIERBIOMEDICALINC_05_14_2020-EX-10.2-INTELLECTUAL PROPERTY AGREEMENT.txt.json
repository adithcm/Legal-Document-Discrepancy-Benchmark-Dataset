                "original_text": "2. The total sum of non-paid invoices (estimated to be approximately $80,000) payable to Marv Enterprises, LLC, previously owed by Premier to Marv up until the effective date of this Agreement, payable in total by no later than July 20, 2020.",
                "changed_text": "2. The total sum of non-paid invoices (estimated to be approximately $80,000) payable to Marv Enterprises, LLC, previously owed by Premier to Marv up until the effective date of this Agreement, payable in total by no later than 180 days after Premier receives funding.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a specific date (July 20, 2020) for payment of outstanding invoices. The modified text makes the payment due 180 days after Premier receives funding, which introduces uncertainty and potentially violates Pennsylvania's prompt payment laws if 'funding' is not clearly defined and could unreasonably delay payment beyond typical commercial standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pennsylvania's prompt payment laws (though these primarily apply to construction contracts, the principle of timely payment is relevant to all contracts and can be subject to legal challenges if unreasonably delayed).",

                "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarterly period ending on March 31st, June 30th, September 30th, or December 31st, commencing with the one-year anniversary of the effective date of this Agreement, THI shall furnish to Marv a statement certified by a responsible official of the Licensee showing in a manner acceptable to Marv",
                "changed_text": "Within ninety (90) days after the end of each quarterly period ending on March 31st, June 30th, September 30th, or December 31st, commencing with the one-year anniversary of the effective date of this Agreement, THI shall furnish to Marv a statement certified by a responsible official of the Licensee showing in a manner acceptable to THI",
                "explanation": "Modifying the reporting deadline from 30 to 90 days significantly extends the reporting period. It also changes what party decides if the report is acceptable. This could potentially violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing if it unreasonably prejudices Marv's ability to monitor royalty payments and enforce the contract terms, especially if similar licensing agreements have much smaller timelines. Delayed reporting could lead to delayed royalty payments, which could be seen as a breach depending on typical industry standards.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows THI 14 days to affirm a payment. Reducing this to 5 days introduces a very short timeframe for affirmation, especially considering potential mail delays or internal review processes at THI. This could be considered unreasonable and a breach of good faith, potentially leading to THI losing rights to intellectual property in specific countries due to a forced denial of payment, and may be seen as an unfair business practice.",

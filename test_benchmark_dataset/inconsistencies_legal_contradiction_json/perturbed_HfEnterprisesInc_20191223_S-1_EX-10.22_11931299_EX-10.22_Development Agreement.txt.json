                "original_text": "The Initial Term shall automatically renew for one-month periods thereafter unless either party provides 30- days advance notice of termination, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof.",
                "changed_text": "The Initial Term shall automatically renew for one-month periods thereafter unless either party provides 5- days advance notice of termination, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the advance notice for termination to 5 days could be problematic. While contract law generally allows parties to agree on termination notice periods, unreasonably short periods might be challenged, especially if one party is significantly disadvantaged. Some jurisdictions may have implied requirements for 'reasonable' notice, especially in situations involving ongoing service agreements or potential reliance damages. Also, some franchise agreements require more than 5 days, violating franchise laws.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year may be inadequate to protect trade secrets or other sensitive information, conflicting with established legal precedents for reasonable protection periods, especially in industries where information has a longer useful life. Some states' trade secret laws require companies to take reasonable measures to protect trade secrets, including ensuring that confidentiality agreements are in place for a sufficient duration.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of trade secret laws if the duration is deemed insufficient to protect sensitive information; may not meet the requirement for 'reasonable measures' to protect trade secrets",

                "changed_text": "All notices sent under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon dispatch, regardless of receipt or method.",
                "explanation": "Stating that notice is effective upon dispatch, 'regardless of receipt or method,' is problematic. This conflicts with the legal requirement that notice must be reasonably calculated to reach the other party. If a notice is sent to a wrong address or via an unreliable method (e.g., regular mail without confirmation) and the other party does not receive it, a court might not recognize that notice as valid, particularly if important rights or obligations are dependent on the notice. This could lead to disputes and unenforceability of contract terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contradicts the legal principle that notice must be reasonably calculated to reach the other party; could lead to unenforceability of contract terms due to inadequate notice.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Royalty payments shall be paid quarterly within thirty (45) days following the close of the calendar quarter.",
                "changed_text": "Royalty payments shall be paid annually within one hundred and eighty (180) days following the close of the calendar year.",
                "explanation": "Delaying royalty payments to an annual basis and extending the payment window to 180 days contradicts standard business practices and could violate laws in some jurisdictions that require more frequent and timely payments, such as labor laws if royalties are tied to employee compensation or tax regulations related to revenue reporting.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of labor laws or tax regulations requiring timely payments and revenue reporting.",
                "location": "Article 3.3"

                "changed_text": "Such records shall be retained by the Licensee for two (2) years following a given reporting period.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period to two years may conflict with pharmaceutical regulatory requirements (e.g., FDA guidelines) or legal statutes in Brazil or other Latin American countries, which often mandate longer retention periods (e.g., 5-10 years) for documentation related to drug development, manufacturing, and sales to ensure compliance and traceability.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe to one day to respond to a potential infringement might not be sufficient, depending on Brazil's and other Latin American countries' requirements, and may weaken the legal defense against intellectual property infringements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Requirements for intellectual property infringement response timelines in Brazil or other Latin American countries.",

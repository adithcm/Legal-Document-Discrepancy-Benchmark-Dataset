                "original_text": "(v) During the Term and during the sell-off period, MusclePharm shall make royalty payments in U.S. dollars for the respective quarters ending on the last day of September, December, March and June (each, a \"Royalty Period\") within thirty (30) days from the end of each quarterly period. Each such royalty payment shall include an itemized statement showing the nature and source of such royalties, including (i) the number of units of Licensed Products sold (by country and customer); (ii) the total number of units returned for which credit was given and the total dollar amount of such credits, and (iii) the total gross sales and the total royalties due with respect to such gross sales, and each itemized statement shall be certified by a duly authorized officer of MusclePharm. Such statements shall be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit \"B\" and furnished to Lender whether or not any Licensed Products were sold during the Royalty Period.",
                "changed_text": "(v) During the Term and during the sell-off period, MusclePharm shall make royalty payments in U.S. dollars for the respective quarters ending on the last day of September, December, March and June (each, a \"Royalty Period\") within ninety (90) days from the end of each quarterly period. Each such royalty payment shall include an itemized statement showing the nature and source of such royalties, including (i) the number of units of Licensed Products sold (by country and customer); (ii) the total number of units returned for which credit was given and the total dollar amount of such credits, and (iii) the total gross sales and the total royalties due with respect to such gross sales, and each itemized statement shall be certified by a duly authorized officer of MusclePharm.

                "explanation": "The original text mandates royalty payments within 30 days of the end of each quarter. The modified version extends this to 90 days, which may violate California law (since the contract is governed by California law per section 21) if such an extended payment period is deemed unreasonable or exploits the endorsement provider. California Prompt Payment laws, although often applied to specific industries, reflect a general expectation of timely payments for services rendered.",

                "original_text": "(b) MusclePharm and Lender agree that, for purposes of determining the taxable income of Lender and the tax expense, deduction or other corresponding charge of MusclePharm, in each case in connection with the issuance of the Compensation Shares in accordance with this Section 8, the fair market value of the Compensation Shares shall be the amount set forth in any third-party valuation report delivered by Lender to MusclePharm within forty-five (45) days following the Issuance Date. MusclePharm will promptly provide all information reasonably requested by Lender and/or its valuation firm in connection with the preparation and delivery of such report. MusclePharm shall not take any position for tax purposes inconsistent with such fair market value as so determined without the consent of Lender; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude MusclePharm from utilizing a different method of calculating the fair market value of the Compensation Shares for financial accounting purposes if MusclePharm's Chief Financial Officer, audit committee and independent auditors shall determine in good faith that such alternative calculation of the fair market value of the Compensation Shares is required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.",
                "changed_text": "(b) MusclePharm and Lender agree that, for purposes of determining the taxable income of Lender and the tax expense, deduction or other corresponding charge of MusclePharm, in each case in connection with the issuance of the Compensation Shares in accordance with this Section 8, the fair market value of the Compensation Shares shall be determined by MusclePharm at its sole discretion. Lender agrees to accept MusclePharm's valuation for all tax purposes. MusclePharm is not obligated to provide Lender with any valuation report.",
                "explanation": "This modification allows MusclePharm to unilaterally determine the fair market value of compensation shares, potentially disadvantaging the Lender in terms of tax liability. This could be seen as a violation of California's requirements for fair dealing and good faith in contractual relationships. It also potentially violates IRS regulations if the valuation is artificially deflated to reduce MusclePharm's tax burden, as the IRS has rules against undervaluing compensation.",

                "explanation": "This change reduces the confidentiality period from three years to one year, and removes exception clauses from that confidentiality. For trade secrets under California law (governed by California per section 21), one year may not be a reasonable period to protect the information. Under the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA), trade secret misappropriation can result in legal action, but a one-year confidentiality period may be insufficient to prevent harm, thus weakening trade secret protection.",

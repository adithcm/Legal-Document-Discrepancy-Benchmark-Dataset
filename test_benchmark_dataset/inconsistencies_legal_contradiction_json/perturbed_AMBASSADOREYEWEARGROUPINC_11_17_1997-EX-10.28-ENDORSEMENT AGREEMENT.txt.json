                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days after the initial shipment of the products covered by this Agreement, and promptly on the 15th of each calendar month thereafter, Diplomat shall furnish to KI, Inc. complete and accurate statements certified to be accurate by Diplomat showing the number, description and gross sales price, itemized deductions from gross sales price, and net sales price of the products covered by this Agreement distributed and/or sold by Diplomat during the preceding calendar month, together with any returns made during the preceding calendar month. Such statements shall be furnished to KI, Inc. whether or not any of the products have been sold during the preceding calendar month.",
                "changed_text": "Within sixty (60) days after the initial shipment of the products covered by this Agreement, and promptly on the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter, Diplomat shall furnish to KI, Inc. statements certified by Diplomat showing the gross sales price of the products covered by this Agreement distributed and/or sold by Diplomat during the preceding calendar quarter. Such statements shall be furnished to KI, Inc. only if the products have been sold during the preceding calendar quarter.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires monthly statements within 30 days of initial shipment, ensuring frequent royalty tracking. The modified version shifts to quarterly statements due on the last day of the quarter, only if sales occurred, reducing transparency and potentially delaying royalty payments. This contradicts standard accounting practices that prioritize consistent, timely financial reporting. Some states have laws about requirements for timely payment in business agreements.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Royalties in excess of the minimum royalty shall be due on the 25th day of the month following the calendar month in which they are earned, and payment shall accompany the statements furnished pursuant to subparagraph (c), above. The receipt or acceptance by KI, Inc. of any of the statements furnished pursuant to this Agreement, or of any royalties paid hereunder, or the cashing of any royalty checks paid hereunder, shall not preclude KI, Inc. from questioning the correctness of such statements or payments, provided all such questions are raised with Diplomat within two years of the date of KI Inc's receipt of the statement or payment in question. In the event any inconsistencies or mistakes are discovered in such statements or payments, they shall immediately be rectified and the appropriate payments made by Diplomat.",
                "changed_text": "Royalties in excess of the minimum royalty shall be due at the sole discretion of Diplomat, and payment shall accompany the statements furnished pursuant to subparagraph (c), above. The receipt or acceptance by KI, Inc. of any of the statements furnished pursuant to this Agreement, or of any royalties paid hereunder, or the cashing of any royalty checks paid hereunder, shall act as a full waiver of any right by KI, Inc. to question the correctness of such statements or payments. In the event any inconsistencies or mistakes are discovered in such statements or payments, Diplomat holds no obligation to rectify.",
                "explanation": "The original requires royalties to be paid on the 25th of the following month, with a two-year window to question payments. The modified version gives Diplomat sole discretion over payment timing, waives KI, Inc.'s right to question statements upon receipt, and removes Diplomat's obligation to rectify errors. This is a potential breach of contract and contradicts typical business and accounting standards.",

                "changed_text": "In the event books of account and records shall be destroyed immediately after the termination of this license.",
                "explanation": "The original requires Diplomat to retain financial records for at least two years post-termination, allowing for audits and dispute resolution. The modified version mandates immediate destruction of records, preventing KI, Inc. from verifying past royalties or pursuing claims, potentially violating legal and accounting requirements for record retention, especially as it pertains to financial auditing.",

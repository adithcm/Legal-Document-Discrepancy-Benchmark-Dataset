                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, Imprimis shall deliver to Surgical a report setting forth for such calendar quarter the calculation of the applicable Sales Commission due under this Agreement for the sale of the Product (as defined in the SOW). Imprimis shall remit the total Sales Commission payments due for the sale of Product during such calendar quarter at the time such report is made.",
                "changed_text": "Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, Imprimis shall deliver to Surgical a report setting forth for such calendar quarter the calculation of the applicable Sales Commission due under this Agreement for the sale of the Product (as defined in the SOW). Imprimis shall remit the total Sales Commission payments due for the sale of Product during such calendar quarter at the time such report is made.",
                "explanation": "Extending the payment timeframe to 120 days after the quarter's end could create issues under California law regarding timely payment of wages/commissions, potentially violating labor regulations if it's deemed unreasonably delayed. California Labor Code Section 204 mandates that commissions be paid within a reasonable time, and 120 days may be considered unreasonable, especially if the calculation and reporting process could be completed more quickly.",

                "original_text": "Surgical agrees that promptly upon termination of this Agreement, Surgical shall deliver to Imprimis all Work Product, either completed or uncompleted, and any documents, reports and other materials which are in Surgical's possession in connection with the performance of Services under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Surgical agrees that Surgical shall deliver to Imprimis all Work Product, either completed or uncompleted, and any documents, reports and other materials which are in Surgical's possession in connection with the performance of Services under this Agreement within 90 days upon termination.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the return of work product to 90 days after termination introduces conflict because California law implies an immediate return of company property upon termination of employment or contract. This delay could be seen as hindering the company's operations and infringing on their intellectual property rights.",

                "changed_text": "Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason, with two (2) weeks notice. Expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not limit any obligations of a party that were incurred prior to such expiration or termination.",
                "explanation": "The amendment sets the notice period for termination to two (2) weeks, which could be non-compliant with state labor laws, specifically California, should the agreement be construed to cover employees as independent contractors. California may require a longer notice period or immediate final wage payment and benefits continuation under certain circumstances.",

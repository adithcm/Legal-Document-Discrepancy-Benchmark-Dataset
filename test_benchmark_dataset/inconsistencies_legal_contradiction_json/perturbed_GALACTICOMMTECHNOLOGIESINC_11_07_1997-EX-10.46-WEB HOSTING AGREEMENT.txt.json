                "original_text": "Horst Entertainment agrees to pay Galactcomm $0.01 (one cent) per access up to 400,000 accesses thereafter payment shall be $0.005 (one-half cent) per access. Horst Entertainment shall send this amount to Galacticomm by no later than Wednesday for accesses used from the previuos week (Monday thru Sunday).",
                "changed_text": "Horst Entertainment agrees to pay Galactcomm $0.01 (one cent) per access up to 400,000 accesses thereafter payment shall be $0.005 (one-half cent) per access. Horst Entertainment shall send this amount to Galacticomm by no later than 30 days after the end of the usage week (Monday thru Sunday).",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment by Wednesday for the previous week's accesses. The modified text changes this to within 30 days, which could violate prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions (including Florida, where disputes are to be settled according to the agreement). Many states require more frequent payment schedules, particularly for services rendered.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida Statutes regarding prompt payment for services rendered (potentially violates frequency requirements).",

                "original_text": "Galacticomm must provide a person(s) to correct any technical problems (Server being down or inaccessible) 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. This person(s) must be available by beeper or telephone. Horst Entertainment shall provide this same 24 hour service at the broadcast location.",
                "changed_text": "Galacticomm will endeavor to correct technical problems (Server being down or inaccessible). While Galacticomm will try to provide support 24/7, its actual availability may vary. Horst Entertainment shall provide support based on the availability of staff.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 24/7 support. The modified text significantly weakens this obligation by stating Galacticomm will 'endeavor' to provide support and that its actual availability may vary. This could contradict implied warranties of service or reasonable care, particularly if downtime results in substantial damages for Horst Entertainment. By not having continuous service, it could also break Service Level Agreements that might be common.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied warranties of service or reasonable care under Florida law or the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as potential breach of Service Level Agreement.",

                "changed_text": "In the event Galacticomm, Inc. chooses to terminate this agreement, Horst Entertainment Inc. may be offered the opportunity to purchase a license copy of the software at Galacticomm's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a right for Horst Entertainment to purchase a software license upon termination. The modification removes this right, making it discretionary for Galacticomm. This could be considered an unconscionable clause if the termination significantly impacts Horst Entertainment's business, potentially violating good faith and fair dealing principles that are implied into contracts. It also removes the pre-determined purchase price.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Florida contract law.",

The Invoice specifically will      identify the Equipment, Software, or other items shipped, and the Contract      Price of such items.  Any Installation Services or other services provided      by Airspan will be invoiced separately following completion of such      services.  The Invoice also shall state the total due to Airspan from      Distributor (the \"Invoice Total\"), which shall include the Contract Price,      and any applicable taxes, duties, and other fees due pursuant to Section 6      of this Agreement. Payment of the Invoice Total is due (without any right      of set-off) Net forty-five (45) days after the date of invoice.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment term to 'Net ninety (90) days' is against standard practices for small business. Most contracts would require at least Net 30 or Net 60, this forces undue financial burden onto Airspan, making the contract itself predatory.",

Accordingly, during the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Distributor will not offer services to third parties which compete with the services provided by Airspan under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Airspan in order to compete with Airspan or its customers.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Distributor is not precluded from any activities which concern product sectors or industries other than those that concern products or services similar to those offered by Airspan in connection with this Agreement.  Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prevent Distributor from providing service to existing customers of Distributor which would result in their interruption of service to the public.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the non-compete clause to twelve (12) months after termination may be considered an unreasonably long period in some states, particularly in states that disfavor non-compete agreements, making it potentially unenforceable under state law. California is one such state, and while the agreement doesn't specify jurisdiction, the default is US law, and this clause could be challenged.",

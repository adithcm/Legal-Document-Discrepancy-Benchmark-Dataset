                "original_text": "(6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly insofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not the case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100 EUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the Affiliate's participation in the Program.",
                "changed_text": "(6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur quarterly, 90 days after the end of the quarter, regardless of the sum due. If the sum due does not exceed a value of 500 EUR / 500 USD, the amount can be retained indefinitely, even after termination of the Affiliate's participation in the Program.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a delay in payment that may violate prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions. By changing the payment frequency to quarterly and adding a 90-day delay, element 5 effectively withholds earned compensation for an extended period, contradicting the original intent of more frequent payments. Holding funds indefinitely under 500 EUR/USD also creates a potential conflict.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of prompt payment laws (e.g., various state laws in the U.S. and EU regulations on timely payments).",

IF NO OBJECTION IS RECEIVED DURING THIS TIME, THE PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHANGES AND THEY WILL BECOME PART OF THE EXISTING RELATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT.",
                "changed_text": "AFFILIATE AND SOFTWARE PUBLISHER ARE DEEMED TO HAVE AUTOMATICALLY ACCEPTED ANY CHANGES TO THESE TERMS. Changes will become part of the existing relations under the agreement immediately upon announcement, without need for consent or notification.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the affiliate and software publisher's right to object to changes in the agreement, which may violate legal principles related to contract modification and consent. Under contract law, significant changes usually require agreement from all parties. By stating that changes are automatic and without need for consent, it creates a contractual imposition.",

                "explanation": "This modification eliminates the affiliate's right to dispute invoices, potentially leading to incorrect payments and legal disputes. By forcing automatic approval, the company disregards any potential errors or disagreements, thus violating fair business practices and potential accounting laws.",

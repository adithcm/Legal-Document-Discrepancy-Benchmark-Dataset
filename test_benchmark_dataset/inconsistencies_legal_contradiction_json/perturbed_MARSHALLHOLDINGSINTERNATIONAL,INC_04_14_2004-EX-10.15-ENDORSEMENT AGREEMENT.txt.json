The CELEBRITY can designate the party placed in the      distributorship direct to the Company. This distributorship will be      independent of the endorsement terms of the agreement and will remain on      going as long as the CELEBRITY maintains the annual membership fee.",
                "changed_text": "The CELEBRITY will assist in getting a distributorship started through his contacts and fan mail. The CELEBRITY can designate the party placed in the distributorship direct to the Company. This distributorship will be independent of the endorsement terms of the agreement and will be immediately terminated without notice should the CELEBRITY fail to generate a minimum of 100 new leads per week.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a clause allowing immediate termination of the distributorship based on a performance metric (100 new leads/week) without any cure period. This contradicts general principles of contract law that often require a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach before termination, especially if there's an annual fee involved that has already been paid. Nevada contract law generally follows these principles.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the allowed period for CELEBRITY's inability to provide services from 30 days to 10 days before the COMPANY can terminate the agreement may be considered unconscionable or a breach of good faith, depending on the specific circumstances and industry standards. This could be seen as unduly harsh, especially considering the investment the CELEBRITY may have made. Nevada law, like most states, implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts.",

The party to whom such compliance is owed may waive any           ------           failure of any party to this Agreement to comply with any of its           obligations, agreements, or conditions hereunder in writing. The           failure of any party to this Agreement to enforce at any time any of           the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a           waiver of any such provision or a waiver of the right of such party           thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any           breach of or noncompliance with this Agreement shall be held to be a           waiver of any other or subsequent breach or noncompliance.",
                "changed_text": "     (iv) Waiver. Any failure of any party to this Agreement to comply with any of its obligations, agreements, or conditions hereunder shall be automatically waived if not explicitly addressed within 24 hours of the known occurrence. Any such waiver shall be deemed a complete and permanent waiver of the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision, even in future instances.",
                "explanation": "This drastically reduces the timeframe for waiving a breach of contract and makes it automatic if not addressed within 24 hours, which can contradict Nevada contract law. This is because such a short timeframe may be considered unconscionable and not provide reasonable opportunity to assess and act upon the breach, which is required for it to be considered a valid waiver. It also makes any waiver permanent, which eliminates the possibility of temporary waivers for similar breaches, affecting potential remedies.",

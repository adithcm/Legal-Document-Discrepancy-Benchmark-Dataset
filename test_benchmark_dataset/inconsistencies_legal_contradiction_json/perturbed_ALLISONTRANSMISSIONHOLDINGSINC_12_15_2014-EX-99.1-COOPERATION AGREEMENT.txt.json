                "original_text": "(a) Subject to the satisfactory completion of the Company's customary background check, the Board shall appoint the ValueAct Designee to serve as a director beginning within ten (10) calendar days following receipt of the ValueAct Group's written request to the Company to have the ValueAct Designee appointed to the Board; provided that, at such time, the Board does not conclude in good faith and based on the written opinion of outside legal counsel that such appointment would constitute a breach of the directors' fiduciary duties.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Subject to the satisfactory completion of the Company's customary background check, the Board shall appoint the ValueAct Designee to serve as a director beginning within one (1) calendar day following receipt of the ValueAct Group's written request to the Company to have the ValueAct Designee appointed to the Board; provided that, at such time, the Board does not conclude in good faith and based on the written opinion of outside legal counsel that such appointment would constitute a breach of the directors' fiduciary duties.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the time frame for appointing the ValueAct Designee to one calendar day, which is an unreasonably short time period that may not allow for due diligence, especially considering the background check requirement. This timeframe could be deemed commercially unreasonable, potentially conflicting with director appointment regulations or best practices for corporate governance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates general corporate governance best practices and could conflict with regulations requiring reasonable due diligence in director appointments.",

                "original_text": "(f) The Company's obligations hereunder shall terminate immediately, and the ValueAct Designee shall promptly offer to resign from the Board, and any committee of the Board on which he then sits (and, if requested by the Company, promptly deliver his written resignation to the Board (which shall provide for his immediate resignation) it being understood that it shall be in the Board's sole discretion whether to accept or reject such resignation) if: (i) members of the ValueAct Group, collectively, cease to beneficially own at least 7.5% of the Company's outstanding Common Stock; (ii) the ValueAct Designee ceases to satisfy the conditions set forth in clauses (c)-(d) above; (iii) a member of the ValueAct Group, including the ValueAct Designee, otherwise ceases to comply or breaches any of the terms of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement; or (iv) the employment of the ValueAct Designee with the ValueAct Group is terminated for any reason. The ValueAct Group agrees to cause the ValueAct Designee to resign from the Board if the ValueAct Designee fails to resign if and when requested pursuant to this Section 1(f). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of the occurrence of an event set forth in subsection (ii) or (iv) above, the provisions of Section 1(e) must be complied with before the Company's obligations hereunder may terminate.",
                "changed_text": "(f) The Company's obligations hereunder shall terminate immediately, and the ValueAct Designee shall have the option to resign from the Board, and any committee of the Board on which he then sits if: (i) members of the ValueAct Group, collectively, cease to beneficially own at least 7.5% of the Company's outstanding Common Stock; (ii) the ValueAct Designee ceases to satisfy the conditions set forth in clauses (c)-(d) above; (iii) a member of the ValueAct Group, including the ValueAct Designee, otherwise ceases to comply or breaches any of the terms of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement; or (iv) the employment of the ValueAct Designee with the ValueAct Group is terminated for any reason. The ValueAct Group agrees to request the ValueAct Designee to consider resigning from the Board if the ValueAct Designee fails to resign if and when requested pursuant to this Section 1(f).",
                "explanation": "The original text compels the ValueAct Designee to resign immediately under certain conditions, to the detriment of the business and the shareholders. By changing the phrase 'shall promptly offer to resign' to 'shall have the option to resign,' the legal obligation is reduced to an option, potentially violating fiduciary duties and corporate governance standards that require directors to act in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. It introduces uncertainty and potential conflicts in the board's composition and decision-making processes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates fiduciary duties of directors under Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) and general principles of corporate governance.",

                "explanation": "By forcing the parties to adhere to a 10 year agreement with no exits, creates a condition that could result in a breach of fiduciary duties and be considered a non-compete agreement that is overly burdensome.",

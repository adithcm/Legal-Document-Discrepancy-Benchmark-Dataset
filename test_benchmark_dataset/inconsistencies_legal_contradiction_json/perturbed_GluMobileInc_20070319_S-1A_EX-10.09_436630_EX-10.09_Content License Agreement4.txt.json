                "original_text": "TERM: The rights granted hereunder shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2006 (the \"Term\"); provided, however, that with respect to each Property, including Robots, Kingdom of Heaven, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, In Her Shoes, Idiocracy (Oww My Balls) and Ice Age II, all right and licenses granted herein will continue in full force and effect until March 31, 2008.",
                "changed_text": "TERM: The rights granted hereunder shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2006 (the \"Term\"); provided, however, that with respect to each Property, including Robots, Kingdom of Heaven, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, In Her Shoes, Idiocracy (Oww My Balls) and Ice Age II, all right and licenses granted herein will terminate 30 days after the execution of this Amendment, regardless of the original term or any extended term. Any continued use of the content after this 30-day period is at the Licensee's sole risk and liability.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction by significantly shortening the license term for the specified properties (Robots, Kingdom of Heaven, etc.). The original agreement extends the term to March 31, 2008, but the modified text terminates it just 30 days after the amendment's execution. This could potentially contradict implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose if the licensee made investments relying on the original term. It can also contradict reasonable expectations of the parties.",

                "changed_text": "NOTICE PROVISION: The notice information for Licensee in Section 17(a) of the Agreement shall be amended such that \"Paul Zuzelo\" is deleted and replaced with \"General Counsel\", and such that the email address for Paul Zuzelo is deleted. All notices will only be valid if sent exclusively by carrier pigeon and received within 24 hours of the event necessitating the notification.",
                "explanation": "By stipulating that all notices must be sent via carrier pigeon and received within 24 hours, this change makes the notification provision practically impossible to comply with, which can be a breach of contract and duty of good faith dealing. This can be viewed as a clear attempt to circumvent reasonable notification procedures.",

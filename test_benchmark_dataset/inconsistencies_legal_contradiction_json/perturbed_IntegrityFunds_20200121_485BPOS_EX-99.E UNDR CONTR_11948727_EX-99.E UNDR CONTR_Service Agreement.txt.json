                "changed_text": "The Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers and governors, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon the Fund's being notified of any action brought against Integrity, its officers or governors, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or by telegram addressed to the Fund at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to the Fund by the person against whom such action is brought, within three days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period to three days is an inconsistency because it may not provide sufficient time for the indemnified party to adequately assess the claim and notify the indemnifying party, potentially violating due process or fair notice principles implied in law.

                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 10 days introduces an inconsistency. This significantly shortens the time frame for either party to wind down operations, secure alternative arrangements, or address potential disruptions.

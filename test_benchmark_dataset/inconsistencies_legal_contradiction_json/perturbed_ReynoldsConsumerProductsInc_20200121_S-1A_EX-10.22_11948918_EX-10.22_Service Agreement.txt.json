                "original_text": "Provider shall submit or cause to be submitted to Recipient in writing, within 15 days after the end of each month, an invoice setting forth the Fees for the Services provided to Recipient during such month in reasonable detail, as applicable, due under such invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Provider shall submit or cause to be submitted to Recipient in writing, within 45 days after the end of each month, an invoice setting forth the Fees for the Services provided to Recipient during such month in reasonable detail, as applicable, due under such invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the invoicing period to 45 days. This delay could violate prompt payment laws in certain states (like California), which mandate specific, shorter timeframes for invoicing, particularly for subcontractors or vendors. This forces RCP to wait longer for billing, affecting cash flow and potentially violating regulations requiring timely payment.",

Any amount not received from the invoiced Party within such period shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate, from and including the last date of such period to, but excluding, the date of payment.",
                "changed_text": "Recipient shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Fees shown on an invoice no later than 60 days after Recipient received such invoice unless disputed in accordance with Section 5.7. Any amount not received from the invoiced Party within such period shall bear interest at one percent (1%) per year, from and including the last date of such period to, but excluding, the date of payment.",
                "explanation": "This modification extends the payment deadline to 60 days and lowers the interest rate for late payments to 1%. This creates a potential conflict with state laws like the Illinois Prompt Payment Act (30 ILCS 540), which sets a 30-day payment deadline for state agencies and contractors, and may define a higher minimum interest rate for late payments.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 10 days may not provide sufficient time to properly transition services without disrupting business operations. Certain states and industries may have regulations or standards requiring longer notice periods for service terminations to ensure business continuity and prevent undue hardship or losses. This is also a short amount of time as it relates to the amount of work outlined in exhibit A.",

                "original_text": "Distributor will pay WGT the full amount invoiced within thirty (30) days after the date of WGT's invoice, unless provided otherwise on the applicable invoice, in the lawful money of the United States of America to WGT by wire transfer of immediately available funds to WGT's bank account number 1141139, at the Commerce Bank of Washington, 601 Union Street, Suite 3600, Seattle, WA 98101, ABA routing number 125008013.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will pay WGT the full amount invoiced within ninety (90) days after the date of WGT's invoice, unless provided otherwise on the applicable invoice, in the lawful money of the United States of America to WGT by wire transfer of immediately available funds to WGT's bank account number 1141139, at the Commerce Bank of Washington, 601 Union Street, Suite 3600, Seattle, WA 98101, ABA routing number 125008013.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment term from 30 days to 90 days can create inconsistencies. While not inherently illegal, such an extended payment term deviates significantly from standard commercial practice (30 days is typical). This deviation could raise concerns under laws related to fair business practices, particularly if it disadvantages the supplier (WGT) without clear justification or mutual benefit. It also delays revenue recognition.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the forecast submission timeframe to 5 days could be problematic. If the law requires a company to be aware of potential market changes and this short time is not enabling a company to accurately gauge those insights before presenting their submission, it could cause issues.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the return window for defective products from 30 days to 10 days could violate consumer protection laws or warranty regulations. In many jurisdictions, a 30-day return window is considered a reasonable standard for defective goods, and shortening it significantly could be deemed unfair or unconscionable.",

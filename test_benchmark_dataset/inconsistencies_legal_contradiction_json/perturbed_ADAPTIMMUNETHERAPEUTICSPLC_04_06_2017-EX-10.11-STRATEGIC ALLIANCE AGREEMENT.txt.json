                "original_text": "In relation to Clinical Studies, MD Anderson will keep Adaptimmune reasonably informed of the progress of the Study and respond to any reasonable queries of Adaptimmune in relation to such Study promptly. In relation to Pre-Clinical Studies, oral reports or interim written status reports of the progress of the Studies will be provided by the Principal Investigator to Adaptimmune on a regular basis and at least once every *** (***) months during the course of a Study. Significant developments arising out of Studies will be communicated promptly to Adaptimmune. In the context of any Clinical Study, MD Anderson shall timely prepare and submit to Adaptimmune (a) case report forms, as soon as reasonably possible but in any event within *** (***) business days following completion of any Study patient visit; and (b) responses to data resolution queries as soon as reasonably possible and in any event within *** (***) business days following receipt of such query.",
                "changed_text": "In relation to Clinical Studies, MD Anderson will keep Adaptimmune reasonably informed of the progress of the Study and respond to any reasonable queries of Adaptimmune in relation to such Study at its convenience. In relation to Pre-Clinical Studies, oral reports or interim written status reports of the progress of the Studies will be provided by the Principal Investigator to Adaptimmune when the Principal Investigator deems necessary during the course of a Study. Significant developments arising out of Studies will be communicated to Adaptimmune only if MD Anderson deems it necessary. In the context of any Clinical Study, MD Anderson shall prepare and submit to Adaptimmune (a) case report forms, within 90 business days following completion of any Study patient visit; and (b) responses to data resolution queries within 90 business days following receipt of such query.",
                "explanation": "The modification significantly extends the timeframe for submitting case report forms and responding to data resolution queries to 90 business days, contradicting GCP (Good Clinical Practice) guidelines which mandate prompt and timely data reporting to ensure patient safety and data integrity. Also, it introduces ambiguity and discretion regarding communication timelines and reporting, which does not ensure patient safety, data integrity, and regulatory compliance.",

                "changed_text": "Prior to any disposal of such Study Records, MD Anderson shall give Adaptimmune ten (10) days' prior written notice thereof to allow Adaptimmune the opportunity to request in writing, within such time frame, that MD Anderson continue to store such Study Records at Adaptimmune's expense.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the notification period for record disposal from 30 days to 10 days. This timeframe does not comply with record retention policies and standards as required by regulatory guidelines, therefore affecting regulatory compliance and potentially hindering future audits or investigations.",

If Adaptimmune Limited fails to timely exercise its option within the Option Period with respect to any Invention, Adaptimmune Limited's right to negotiate a license agreement with respect to such Invention will automatically terminate, and MD Anderson will be free to negotiate and enter into a license with any other party.",

                "explanation": "The original contract provided Adaptimmune Limited with a six-month option period to exercise its right to negotiate a license for any invention disclosed by MD Anderson. By changing this period to thirty days, the modification significantly reduces the time available for Adaptimmune Limited to assess the invention's commercial potential and negotiate a licensing agreement. This may unreasonably restrict Adaptimmune Limited's ability to fully evaluate the invention's value, potentially leading to hasty decisions and disputes. This may also violate the principle of good faith negotiation.",

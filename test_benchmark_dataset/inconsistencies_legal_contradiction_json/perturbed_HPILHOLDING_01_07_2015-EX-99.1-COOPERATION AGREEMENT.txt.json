                "original_text": "All notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) when delivered in person, (b) five (5) business days after being sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, (c) when dispatched by electronic facsimile transmission (with confirmation of successful transmission), or (d) one (1) business day after having been dispatched by an internationally recognized overnight courier service, in each case to the appropriate Party at the address or facsimile number specified below:",

                "explanation": "This change increases the notice period for mail delivery to ten business days and overnight courier to five business days, which may conflict with state laws requiring shorter notification periods for certain legal or contractual notices. The original text was already potentially problematic if critical time-sensitive notifications were involved, as five business days via mail could be too long. Increasing these periods exacerbates the risk of non-compliance with laws requiring prompt notification.",

                "explanation": "This modification reduces the termination notice period from thirty days to fifteen days. Depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the obligations under the agreement, this shorter notice period could be deemed unreasonable and conflict with laws that require a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach or wind down operations, particularly if significant investments or ongoing projects are involved. Some jurisdictions may imply a requirement for 'reasonable notice,' which could be longer than 15 days.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with implied legal requirements for 'reasonable notice' for contract termination, or state laws requiring longer notice periods for certain types of business relationships.",

                "explanation": "By shortening the period to achieve objectives to two months, the new deadline introduces conflict with standard contract law principles that require reasonable time for due process. It's possible that some cooperation and agreements could take more time than two months to settle down. Also, the limited time period can potentially lead to inadequate or legally insufficient planning. Therefore, modifying the agreed period could be viewed as unreasonable.",

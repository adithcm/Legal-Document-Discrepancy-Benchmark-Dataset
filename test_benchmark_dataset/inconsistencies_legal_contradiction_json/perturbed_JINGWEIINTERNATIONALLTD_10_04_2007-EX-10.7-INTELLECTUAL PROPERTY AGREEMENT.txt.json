                "original_text": "Without prejudice to any legal or other rights or remedies of the party who asks for termination of this Agreement, any Party has the right to terminate this Agreement immediately with written notice to the other party in the event the other party materially breaches this Agreement including but not limited to the obligation under Article 3 of this Agreement and fails to cure its breach within thirty (30) days from the date it receives written notice of its breach from the non-breaching party. During the term of this Agreement, Party A may terminate this Agreement at any time with a written notice to Party B 30 days before such termination.",
                "changed_text": "Without prejudice to any legal or other rights or remedies of the party who asks for termination of this Agreement, any Party has the right to terminate this Agreement immediately with written notice to the other party in the event the other party materially breaches this Agreement including but not limited to the obligation under Article 3 of this Agreement and fails to cure its breach within fifteen (15) days from the date it receives written notice of its breach from the non-breaching party. During the term of this Agreement, Party A may terminate this Agreement at any time with a written notice to Party B 10 days before such termination.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from 30 days to 15 days, and the termination notice period from 30 days to 10 days, may conflict with PRC contract law, which often implies a reasonable cure period and termination notice period depending on the nature of the contract and breach. These shortened periods could be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable by Chinese courts.",

Party B shall pay the license fee to the account designated by Party A before December 31 each year. Party A has the right to determine whether or not to exempt the Party B's obligation to pay license fee at its discretion.",

Party B shall pay the license fee to the account designated by Party A before June 1 each year. Party A has the right to determine whether or not to exempt the Party B's obligation to pay license fee at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment deadline from December 31st to June 1st imposes a significantly earlier payment requirement. This could create undue hardship for Party B. There are regulations around payment schedules and fairness, especially considering the general principle of good faith in contract performance. Depending on the industry and specific context, pushing the payment deadline forward significantly might be deemed unreasonable or exploitative under PRC law.",

                "original_text": "In case no settlement can be reached through consultation within 30 days after one party ask for consultation, each party can submit such matter to China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the \"CIETAC\") in accordance with its rules, and the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in Chinese and shall take place in Beijing.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the consultation period from 30 days to 10 days before arbitration may be considered too short under PRC law, especially for complex intellectual property disputes. This may impede the parties' ability to reach an amicable resolution before resorting to arbitration, potentially conflicting with the principle of promoting alternative dispute resolution methods where possible. It could lead to a challenge of the arbitration clause based on procedural unfairness.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Seller hereby covenants and agrees, that from time to time forthwith upon the reasonable written request of Backhaul or Buyer, that Seller will, at Backhaul's cost and expense, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, each and all of such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and assurances as may reasonably be required by Backhaul or Buyer in order to transfer, assign, convey and deliver unto and vest in Backhaul title to all right, title and interest of Seller in, to and under the Assigned Intellectual Property.",
                "changed_text": "Seller hereby covenants and agrees, that upon any request of Backhaul or Buyer, Seller will, without Backhaul's cost and expense, attempt to do, execute, acknowledge and deliver such acts as may be required by Backhaul or Buyer in order to effectuate the assignment of Intellectual Property. However, Seller will only act upon such requests if they are made within 30 days of the closing date.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires the seller to assist in transferring intellectual property 'from time to time forthwith upon the reasonable written request' implying an ongoing obligation. The modified clause limits this obligation to 30 days post-closing, which contradicts the potential lifespan of intellectual property rights, which can extend for many years. Furthermore, removing Backhaul's responsibility for the seller's costs could violate basic contract law principles requiring mutual consideration.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract, specifically regarding the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing and consideration in contract law. Also contradicts intellectual property laws regarding the duration of rights.",

                "changed_text": "This Intellectual Property Agreement shall be construed and interpreted according to the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of where the contracts are performed.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates that Georgia law governs the contract, as it's to be performed within Georgia. Changing the governing law to Delaware, especially when the contract is performed in Georgia, introduces potential conflicts of law issues, which can lead to legal challenges regarding the enforceability of the agreement, because it contradicts what the original agreement says and what actually occurs.",
                "contradicted_law": "Conflict of Laws principles, specifically regarding the 'most significant relationship' test for contract interpretation.",

                "explanation": "While electronic signatures are generally legally accepted, relying solely on carrier pigeons for official document delivery is outdated, unreliable, and creates enforceability issues. It can be seen as a blatant attempt to undermine the agreement's validity and contradicts modern standards for secure and reliable document transmission. Some form of delivery confirmation is generally needed to ensure the validity of the contract.",

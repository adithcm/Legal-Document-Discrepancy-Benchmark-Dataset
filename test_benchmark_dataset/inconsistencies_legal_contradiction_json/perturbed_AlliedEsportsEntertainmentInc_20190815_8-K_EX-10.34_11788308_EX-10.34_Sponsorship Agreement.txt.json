                "original_text": "Failure by Allied to perform and comply with any of its obligations in sections 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and Newegg shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately if Allied fails to cure the breach within fifteen (15) days following Newegg's written notice of the breach.",
                "changed_text": "Failure by Allied to perform and comply with any of its obligations in sections 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and Newegg shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately if Allied fails to cure the breach within five (5) days following Newegg's written notice of the breach.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from 15 days to 5 days is inconsistent with what constitutes a reasonable cure period. California courts often look to industry standards and the complexity of the breach when determining reasonableness. A five-day cure period may be deemed unreasonably short, particularly for complex breaches.",

                "original_text": "Before any Party (the \"Complaining Party\") may bring any legal proceeding against the other (the \"Non Complaining Party\"), the Complaining Party shall first make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve all disputes privately by notifying and providing to the Non Complaining Party of the Complaining Party's complaints, reasons and supporting evidence for the complaints, and the reasonable steps Complaining Party would like the Non Complaining Party to take in order to address the complaints. If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints.",
                "changed_text": "Before any Party (the \"Complaining Party\") may bring any legal proceeding against the other (the \"Non Complaining Party\"), the Complaining Party shall first make a reasonable attempt to resolve all disputes privately by notifying the Non Complaining Party of the general nature of the Complaining Party's complaints. The Parties shall attempt an amicable solution for at least ten (10) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints.",
                "explanation": "By reducing the amicable solution period to ten days and removing the requirement for 'good faith,' detailed complaints, reasons, evidence, and specific steps, this change potentially violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in all California contracts. This covenant requires parties to act honestly and fairly in the performance and enforcement of the contract. Curtailing the dispute resolution period and removing requirements for detailed justification undermines this implied covenant.",

                "explanation": "Extended notification periods could conflict with statutes of limitations or other time-sensitive legal requirements. A party may miss a critical deadline or opportunity due to a delay caused by the extended notice period, creating legal vulnerability. For example, if a quick response is needed, a party is unable to give the other notice fast enough.",

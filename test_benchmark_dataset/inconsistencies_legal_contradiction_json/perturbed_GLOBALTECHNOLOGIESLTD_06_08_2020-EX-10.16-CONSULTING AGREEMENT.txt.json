                "original_text": "Notices delivered personally shall be deemed delivered as of actual receipt, notices sent by facsimile shall be deemed delivered one (1) day after electronic confirmation of receipt, notices sent by overnight delivery service shall be deemed delivered one (1) day after delivery to the service, mailed notices shall be deemed delivered as of five (5) days after mailing.",
                "changed_text": "Notices delivered personally shall be deemed delivered as of actual receipt, notices sent by facsimile shall be deemed delivered five (5) days after electronic confirmation of receipt, notices sent by overnight delivery service shall be deemed delivered five (5) days after delivery to the service, mailed notices shall be deemed delivered as of ten (10) days after mailing.",
                "explanation": "This change increases the notification periods required by mail and electronic confirmation, which may conflict with legal requirements that specify shorter notification periods for specific actions (e.g., legal disputes, contract termination) under Florida law, potentially invalidating the notification if the shorter legal timeframes are applicable.",

                "changed_text": "If they do not reach such solution within a period of 30 days, then, upon notice by either party to the other, all disputes, claims, questions, or differences shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the mediation period to 30 days might be too short for complex disputes, potentially violating the legal principle of 'good faith' negotiation required in some jurisdictions. Furthermore, some Florida statutes specify minimum mediation periods for certain types of disputes (e.g., construction defects), making this clause potentially unenforceable if those statutes apply.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida Statutes regarding mandatory mediation periods in specific types of disputes (e.g., construction defect claims) and common law regarding good faith negotiation.",

The Company is not responsible for any errors or omissions in the consultant's tax filings.",
                "explanation": "While the consultant is responsible for their own taxes, this clause attempts to absolve the company of all responsibility related to the consultant's tax filings. Under certain circumstances, if the company misclassifies the consultant or fails to report payments correctly on Form 1099-MISC (as stated later in the agreement), it could still have some vicarious or direct liability related to those errors, potentially contradicting IRS rules and regulations.",

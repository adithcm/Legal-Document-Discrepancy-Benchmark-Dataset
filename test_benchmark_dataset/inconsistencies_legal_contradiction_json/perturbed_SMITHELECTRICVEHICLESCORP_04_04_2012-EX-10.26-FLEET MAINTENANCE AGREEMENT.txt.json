                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "3.3 The Maintenance Charges shall be invoiced by SEV calendar monthly in advance and shall be payable by DCL within fourteen days  of the invoice date.",
                "changed_text": "3.3 The Maintenance Charges shall be invoiced by SEV calendar monthly in advance and shall be payable by DCL within sixty days of the invoice date.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment period to sixty days. While not inherently illegal, excessively long payment terms could violate UK regulations regarding fair payment practices, particularly if they place undue hardship on SEV, the supplier. UK law and Prompt Payment Code encourage businesses to pay suppliers within agreed terms, but generally suggest a shorter timeframe.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of UK's Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 and the Prompt Payment Code if the extended payment term is deemed unfair or causes significant financial distress to SEV.",
                "location": "Clause 3.3"

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "8.4 DCL shall first offer all Surplus Vehicles that DCL wishes to sell for sale to SEV. Any Surplus Vehicle purchased by SEV shall be  removed from DCL site within ten working days.",
                "changed_text": "8.4 DCL shall first offer all Surplus Vehicles that DCL wishes to sell for sale to SEV. Any Surplus Vehicle purchased by SEV shall be  removed from DCL site within one working day.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the removal timeframe to one working day is likely to be impractical and may contradict implied terms of 'reasonableness' within contract law. It places an undue burden on SEV to arrange immediate collection, potentially leading to breaches of contract due to logistical difficulties.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied terms of 'reasonableness' in UK contract law. The changed text also raises concerns about potential breaches in case of logistical issues",
                "location": "Clause 8.4"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "16.1 Following expiry of the initial period described in Clause 15 above, DCL or SEV giving not less than six months notice in  writing may terminate this Agreement. In addition, DCL may terminate this Agreement with effect from the 3rd, 4th or 5th  anniversary of the Commencement Date by giving not less than six months notice in writing to SEV.",
                "changed_text": "16.1 Following expiry of the initial period described in Clause 15 above, DCL or SEV giving not less than one month's notice in  writing may terminate this Agreement. In addition, DCL may terminate this Agreement with effect from the 3rd, 4th or 5th  anniversary of the Commencement Date by giving not less than one month's notice in writing to SEV.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period to one month could be viewed as unreasonable and a violation of fair business practices, particularly given the complexity of the services provided and the potential impact on SEV's workforce and operations. A significantly shorter notice period can be challenged under UK contract law if it's proven to cause disproportionate harm.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates implied terms of 'reasonableness' and fair business practices under UK contract law. The change also doesn't give enough time for companies to accommodate and manage services that have changed after a short notice",

                "original_text": "(f) Interest on Late Payments. Any payment required to be made by Sponsor hereunder that is not paid within fourteen (14) days from the date such payment becomes due and owing shall bear interest at an annual rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum or, if lower, the maximum allowed by law from the due date to the date payment is actually made. The right of Forty Niners SC to receive interest under this Section 5(f) shall be in addition to all other rights it may have as a result of Sponsor's failure to make payments when due.",

Any payment required to be made by Sponsor hereunder that is not paid within five (5) days from the date such payment becomes due and owing shall bear interest at an annual rate of twenty-five percent (25%) per annum or, if lower, the maximum allowed by law from the due date to the date payment is actually made. The right of Forty Niners SC to receive interest under this Section 5(f) shall be in addition to all other rights it may have as a result of Sponsor's failure to make payments when due.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a 14-day grace period for late payments with a 12% interest rate. The modified text shortens the grace period to 5 days and raises the interest rate to 25%. California usury laws (California Constitution Article XV Section 1) restrict the maximum interest rate for non-consumer loans. While there are exemptions, a 25% interest rate may violate these usury laws if the agreement doesn't qualify for an exemption.",

During the Term of this Agreement, *** shall, at no cost to the ***, maintain (or cause to be maintained) the following insurance coverage with insurers having a \"Best's\" rating of A­VIII or better: commercial general liability insurance, including coverage for bodily injury, property damage, personal and advertising injury, products/completed operations and contractual liability with a minimum amount of ten million US Dollars (USD $10,000,000.00) for each occurrence. *** shall furnish the other Party with a certificate of insurance evidencing such insurance coverage, which shall further contain a provision that the policy or policies evidenced thereby shall not be canceled or modified without thirty (30) days advance written notice.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires $10,000,000 in commercial general liability insurance and 30 days' notice for cancellation. The modified text reduces the insurance coverage to $500,000 and shortens the cancellation notice to 10 days. This could be problematic, because if Forty Niners SC requires a specific limit of coverage to be compliant with regulations, then it doesn't meet the requirement amount. Shortening the notification time also means the team may not have enough time to procure more insurance if the initial company cancels without giving a sufficient window of time to secure more coverage.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contractual agreements must adhere to minimum coverage amounts to meet the requirements of a regulatory agency. Also, a specific limit of coverage can be determined by Forty Niners SC's insurance provider.",

All notices, requests, or offers required or permitted to be made under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed properly delivered on the earlier of actual receipt or three days after the date deposited in the U.S. Mail, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by recognized overnight delivery service with signature required (e.g., FedEx, UPS) addressed as follows:   If to Forty Niners SC:\n\n\n\nSan Francisco 49ers Attn: Legal Affairs 4949 Centennial Blvd. Santa Clara, CA 95054\n\nIf to Sponsor:\n\n\n\nViolin Memory, Inc.

All notices, requests, or offers required or permitted to be made under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed properly delivered only upon actual receipt, provided such receipt occurs within thirty (30) days of sending via standard U.S. Mail, without any requirement for certified mail or return receipt. Email notification shall suffice for all legal and contractual agreements.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates certified mail or overnight delivery with signature confirmation for all notices, ensuring proof of delivery. The modified clause permits standard U.S. Mail without tracking and only deems the notice delivered upon actual receipt, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over delivery dates. California law requires specific methods of service for legal notices, and standard mail may not meet those requirements in certain legal contexts, making reliance solely on actual receipt problematic. It also mentions email notification can suffice which is not sufficient.",

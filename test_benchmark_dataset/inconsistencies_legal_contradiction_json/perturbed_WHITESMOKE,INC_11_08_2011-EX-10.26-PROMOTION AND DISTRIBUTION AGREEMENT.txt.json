                "changed_text": "Distributor shall begin such distribution within 24 hours following Google's request.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction because it imposes an unreasonably short timeframe for compliance. Depending on the complexity of the update and the distributor's resources, 24 hours may be insufficient to implement the changes, potentially conflicting with reasonable business practice and regulations regarding fair contract terms.",

                "changed_text": "All payments under this Agreement shall be made at Google's discretion, with no specific timeline for payment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction because it violates laws requiring timely and predictable payment schedules. Labor laws (if payments are considered wages or related) and general contract law require that payment terms be definite and predictable.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction because it creates an overly broad exclusion of liability for intellectual property claims. This attempts to waive all responsibility, regardless of Google's potential negligence or intentional infringement, violating legal standards that do not allow parties to completely waive liability for their own actions, particularly regarding IP rights.",

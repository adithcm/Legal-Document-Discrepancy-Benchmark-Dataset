                "changed_text": "Claims relating to quantity, weight and loss or damage to any Product sold under this Agreement shall be waived by Columbia unless made within 7 days of receipt of Product by Columbia.",
                "explanation": "The original text leaves the claim period undefined ([***]). By setting the claim period to 7 days, we create a potential conflict with the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (UK), which implies terms about satisfactory quality and fitness for purpose. While the Act allows parties to vary these implied terms, a 7-day claim period may be deemed unreasonably short, particularly for complex products where defects might not be immediately apparent. This could render the clause unenforceable under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 if deemed unreasonable in the context of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text does not define the payment period, represented by [***]. Changing the payment term to 90 days may violate The Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 (UK), particularly Section 4, as amended, which aims to combat late payment by setting default payment periods and allowing interest to be charged on late payments. Unless there's a specific agreement in place that justifies or allows for 90 days, it might be considered an excessive delay, especially for smaller suppliers, thus making the term potentially challengeable under UK law.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period from five years to one year could be deemed insufficient to protect trade secrets under UK law and, depending on the type of information, may conflict with reasonable protection measures. The UK courts may consider the one-year period insufficient, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where processes are long term, thus making the protection inadequate under the circumstances of the agreement.",

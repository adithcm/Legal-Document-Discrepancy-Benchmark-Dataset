                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other, except to the extent that she or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the filing of the initial Schedule 13G or 13D, but bear no responsibility for the timely filing of any subsequent amendments. Furthermore, no signatory shall be liable for the completeness or accuracy of any information contained within any filing, regardless of their knowledge or belief.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts SEC regulations regarding ongoing reporting obligations and liability for accurate information in Schedule 13G/D filings. By stating there's no responsibility for amendments or the accuracy of any information, it creates non-compliance with regulatory standards.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to prepare the initial filing of Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D. The responsibility for future filings and amendments shall rest solely with the lead filer as determined by mutual agreement; however, no specific deadline or process is mandated by this agreement and the lead filer has sole discretion on timing of updates.",
                "explanation": "This modification attempts to circumvent SEC rules that require timely amendments to Schedule 13G/D filings. Giving the lead filer sole discretion, without deadlines, contradicts regulatory mandates for keeping ownership disclosures current and accurate. It also implies that others do not need to fulfill their obligations.",

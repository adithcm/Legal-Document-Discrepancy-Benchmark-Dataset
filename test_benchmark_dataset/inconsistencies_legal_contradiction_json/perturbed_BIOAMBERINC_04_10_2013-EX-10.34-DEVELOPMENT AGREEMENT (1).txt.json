                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "2.1 Bioamber shall pay Cargill Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars ($250,000.00) within thirty (30) days of the execution of this Development Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Bioamber shall pay Cargill Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars ($250,000.00) within sixty (60) days of the execution of this Development Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within 30 days. Delaying the payment to 60 days without proper justification could potentially lead to breach of contract issues if the standard payment term is shorter than this, or if it contradicts general business practices that assume prompt payments, even in Minnesota. This implicitly changes payment terms.",

                "original_text": "Cargill shall give Bioamber notice of such election promptly and at least two (2) months prior to the first date that action must be taken to avoid such abandonment or lapse. Bioamber shall have the right to take over at its sole expense the filing, prosecution or maintenance of any such patent application and Bioamber shall keep Cargill informed of Bioamber's filing, prosecution, and maintenance activities.",
                "changed_text": "Cargill shall give Bioamber notice of such election promptly and at least one (1) week prior to the first date that action must be taken to avoid such abandonment or lapse. Bioamber shall have the right to take over at its sole expense the filing, prosecution or maintenance of any such patent application and Bioamber shall keep Cargill informed of Bioamber's filing, prosecution, and maintenance activities.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period from two months to one week before a patent lapses or is abandoned puts Bioamber at a significant disadvantage. This timeframe is insufficient for Bioamber to adequately prepare to take over the filing, prosecution, or maintenance of the patent application, potentially leading to the loss of valuable intellectual property rights. Patent prosecution often requires significant time for review and action, and a week may not be considered a reasonable amount of time.",

                "original_text": "As such, Bioamber shall cease within 30 days any further funding and development of a biocatalyst, including but not limited to the genetic modification or the optimization of fermentation conditions, when such biocatalyst has demonstrated the ability to produce succinic acid at a concentration above [***] grams per liter.",
                "changed_text": "As such, Bioamber shall cease within 5 days any further funding and development of a biocatalyst, including but not limited to the genetic modification or the optimization of fermentation conditions, when such biocatalyst has demonstrated the ability to produce succinic acid at a concentration above [***] grams per liter.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time to cease development from 30 days to 5 days is unreasonable. A 5 days is an insufficient period for a company to wind down R&D activities, reallocate resources, and comply with contractual obligations, and will give rise to a breach of contract claim. It is not a commercially reasonable timeframe.",

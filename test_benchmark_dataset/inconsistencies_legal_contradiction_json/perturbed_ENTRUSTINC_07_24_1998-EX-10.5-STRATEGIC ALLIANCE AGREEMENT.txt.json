                "explanation": "Reduced the notice period for termination due to cause from 60 days to 10 days, which may be deemed unreasonably short depending on the jurisdiction and the complexity of the agreement, thus potentially violating general principles of contract law regarding reasonable notice.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law to the People's Republic of China may create conflicts. Given that Entrust Technologies Inc. is a Maryland corporation, the choice of law might be contested if the contract is primarily performed or has substantial connections to the United States, potentially violating principles of conflicts of law.",

                "explanation": "Removing the jury trial waiver in the contract could undermine the predictability and efficiency of dispute resolution, especially in the United States legal system. This could make disputes in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement to be heard by a jury, which could be longer and more expensive compared to a bench trial. Also, it could be argued that this is againts the interest of both parties.",

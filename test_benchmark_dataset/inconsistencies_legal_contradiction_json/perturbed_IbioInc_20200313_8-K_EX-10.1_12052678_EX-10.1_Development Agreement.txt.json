                "explanation": "The original text requires a 30-day notice period for contract termination due to breach, which is generally acceptable. The modified text reduces this to a 10-day notice period, which may be deemed unreasonably short under Texas law (governing law specified in 9.13), especially for complex breaches requiring substantial corrective action. Courts often evaluate the reasonableness of notice periods based on the circumstances, and 10 days may not provide sufficient opportunity to cure a material breach.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows a six-month delay before the other party can make public any invention disclosure. The modified text reduces this to two months. This change introduces a legal inconsistency because it may not provide sufficient time for the inventing party to adequately assess the invention's patentability, prepare and file a patent application, thus potentially jeopardizing their intellectual property rights. This can be considered unreasonable under principles of good faith and fair dealing, especially considering the collaboration involves technology transfer.",

                "explanation": "The original text states a five-year confidentiality period. Reducing this to one year can be problematic, particularly considering the nature of the agreement involves technology transfer and proprietary information. A one-year period might be considered unreasonably short to protect valuable trade secrets and confidential information, especially in the biopharmaceutical industry where product development cycles are lengthy and competitive advantages rely heavily on maintaining confidentiality for extended periods. This change could be viewed as a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing if it significantly undermines the disclosing party's interests. Texas courts will examine if this duration provides adequate protection given the specific facts of the industry and transferred information.",

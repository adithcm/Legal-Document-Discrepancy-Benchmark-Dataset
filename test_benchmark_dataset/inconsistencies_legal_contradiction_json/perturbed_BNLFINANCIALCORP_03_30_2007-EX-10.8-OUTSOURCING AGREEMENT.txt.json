Any sum due VIP hereunder for which a time for payment is not otherwise specified will be due and payable within ten (10) days after the date of the postmark for an invoice therefor from VIP. If BNL fails to pay any amount due within ten (10) days from the date of the postmark for the invoice, late charges of 1-1/2% per month, or the maximum amount allowable by law, whichever is less, shall also become payable by BNL to VIP.",

Any sum due VIP hereunder for which a time for payment is not otherwise specified will be due and payable within thirty (30) days after the date of the postmark for an invoice therefor from VIP. If BNL fails to pay any amount due within sixty (60) days from the date of the postmark for the invoice, late charges of 1-1/2% per month, or the maximum amount allowable by law, whichever is less, shall also become payable by BNL to VIP.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within ten (10) days of the invoice postmark and imposes late charges if payment is not received within that timeframe. Many states have laws regulating payment deadlines and late fees. By extending the initial payment window to thirty (30) days and not implementing late fees till after sixty (60) days this contract creates a possible legal contradiction to the law.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month for sales during the previous month.",
                "changed_text": "All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within ninety (90) days after the end of each calendar quarter for sales during the previous quarter.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states that royalty payments should be made within 30 days after the end of each calendar month. This has been changed to 90 days after the end of each calendar quarter, which is less frequent. Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act requires prompt payment of earned wages/royalties. Delaying payment to a quarterly basis and extending the payment window may violate these requirements.",

                "original_text": "Notices to the parties shall be sent via overnight mail or U.S. Certified Mail or overnight express or priority mail to the addresses listed in the Agreement. Either party may change its address upon written notice to the other party. Written notices for approvals under this agreement may be via email.",
                "changed_text": "Notices to the parties shall be sent only via standard U.S. mail to the addresses listed in the Agreement. Either party may change its address upon oral notice to the other party. Written notices for approvals under this agreement may be via text message.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows for reliable methods of notice such as overnight and certified mail. The modification restricts notice to standard U.S. mail, which is less reliable and slower, potentially leading to delays or non-receipt of important notices. Additionally, requiring only oral notice for address changes is problematic as it could be difficult to prove and could lead to disputes. Allowing text messages for written approvals further weakens the agreement since they are susceptible to disputes about authenticity and receipt. This contradicts general contract law principles requiring clear and provable forms of notice.",

                "changed_text": "Individual agrees to indemnify Lifeway from and against any and all claims, actions, causes or other expenses incurred arising from any statements made by the Individual in the Marketing Materials, regardless of truthfulness or intent.",
                "explanation": "The original clause limits indemnification to misrepresentations or false statements, implying a requirement of fault. The modified clause expands the indemnification obligation to cover any statement, regardless of truthfulness or intent, which is overly broad and potentially unconscionable. This creates an unreasonable burden on the Individual. This is particularly concerning given that the venue is in Illinois, a state where indemnification agreements are disfavored and scrutinized. This could be viewed as against public policy and unenforceable. This could also contradict consumer protection law, because it could be considered oppressive or unconscionable.",

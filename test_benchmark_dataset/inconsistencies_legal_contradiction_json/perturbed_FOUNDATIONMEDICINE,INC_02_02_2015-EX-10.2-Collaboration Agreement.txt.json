                "original_text": "During the Agreement Term and for […***…] thereafter, a Receiving Party shall (i) treat Confidential Information provided by Disclosing Party as it would treat its own information of a similar nature, (ii) take all reasonable precautions not to disclose such Confidential Information to Third Parties, without the Disclosing Party's prior written consent, and (iii) not use such Confidential Information other than for fulfilling its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement. If any Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by the Receiving Party or its Affiliates to comply with a court or administrative order, the Receiving Party or its Affiliates, prior to making such disclosure, shall furnish as much notice as is reasonable under the circumstances to the Disclosing Party to enable it to resist such disclosure.",
                "changed_text": "During the Agreement Term and for 6 months thereafter, a Receiving Party shall (i) treat Confidential Information provided by Disclosing Party with minimal care, (ii) take only basic precautions against disclosing Confidential Information to Third Parties, and (iii) may use such Confidential Information for purposes beyond fulfilling its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement. If Confidential Information is required to be disclosed to comply with a court order, the Receiving Party shall disclose the information without any notice to the Disclosing Party.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the protection of confidential information to an extent that it could be deemed commercially unreasonable. It sets a short deadline of 6 months, which in some circumstances involving trade secrets, is not enough time. The language allows for the disregard of confidential information because minimal care is an ambiguous statement. The change also eliminates the Receiving Party's obligation to provide notice when compelled to disclose, violating standard practices regarding confidential information and legal notification.",

                "original_text": "A Party (\"Publishing Party\") shall provide the other Party with a copy of any proposed publication or presentation at least […***…] prior to submission for publication so as to provide such other Party with an opportunity to recommend any changes it reasonably believes are necessary to continue to maintain the Confidential Information disclosed by the other Party to the Publishing Party in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement. The incorporation of such recommended changes shall not be unreasonably refused; and if such other Party notifies (\"Publishing Notice\") the Publishing Party in writing, within […***…] after receipt of the copy of the proposed publication or presentation, that such publication or presentation in its reasonable judgment (i) contains an invention, solely or jointly conceived and/or reduced to practice by the other Party, for which the other Party reasonably desires to obtain patent protection or (ii) could be expected to have a material adverse effect on the commercial value of any Confidential Information disclosed by the other Party to the Publishing Party, the Publishing Party shall prevent such publication or delay such publication for a mutually agreeable period of time. In the case of inventions, a delay shall be for a period reasonably sufficient to permit the timely preparation and filing of a patent application(s) on such invention, and in no event less than […***…] from the date of the Publishing Notice.",
                "changed_text": "A Party (\"Publishing Party\") may publish or present information without providing prior notice to the other Party. The Publishing Party has no obligation to consider or incorporate any feedback from the other Party regarding potential disclosure of Confidential Information or patentable inventions. The Publishing Party is free to publish immediately, regardless of the impact on the other Party's confidential information or ability to seek patent protection.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the obligation to provide prior notice before publication, removes any duty to consider recommended changes, and permits immediate publication regardless of potential harm to the other party's confidential information or patent rights. This directly conflicts with the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts, and it also impedes the other party's ability to protect its intellectual property rights.",

The tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators. The place of arbitration shall be New York, New York, US. The language to be used shall be English.",
                "changed_text": "Should the Parties fail to agree within 10 days after such dispute has first arisen, any dispute shall be resolved through a coin flip. The winner of the coin flip determines the outcome, with no further process or appeal. The place of decision shall be at the winner's discretion, and the language shall be whatever the winner chooses.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces arbitration with a coin flip, which is not a recognized or legally enforceable method of dispute resolution. It removes the requirement for a qualified tribunal, any reasoned decision-making process, and any due process protections. This undermines the enforceability of the dispute resolution mechanism and makes it arbitrary and capricious, contradicting standard contract law principles.",

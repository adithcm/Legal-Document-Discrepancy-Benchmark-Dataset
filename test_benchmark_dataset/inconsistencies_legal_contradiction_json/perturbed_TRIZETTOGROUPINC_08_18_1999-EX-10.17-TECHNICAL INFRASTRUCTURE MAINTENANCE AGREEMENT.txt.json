                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Charges will be invoiced and are payable within thirty (30) days after the date of the invoice. All charges are subject to change by MMMW for the forthcoming period capped at the CPI annually, on thirty days written notice. MMMW reserves the right to apply [*] finance charges.",
                "changed_text": "Charges will be invoiced and are payable within sixty (60) days after the date of the invoice. All charges are subject to change by MMMW without any prior notice. MMMW reserves the right to apply finance charges.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a payment term of 30 days, and any changes to the charge needs a written notice of 30 days prior. The modified text extends the payment term to 60 days and removes the requirement of any prior written notice, potentially conflicting with state laws regarding prompt payment and fair business practices. Furthermore, removing the CPI cap and the annual notice of fee increases could violate state consumer protection laws requiring transparent and predictable pricing.",

                "changed_text": "No action, regardless of form, related to, or arising out of this Agreement may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after the cause of action has arisen.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a two-year limitation on legal actions. The modified text reduces this to one year, which may conflict with Indiana's statute of limitations for contract disputes. Lowering the period could make it an illegally short amount of time to bring up a dispute.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Indiana's statute of limitations for contract disputes, which may be longer than one year depending on the specific cause of action.",

Support to include 7X24 hour pager support for emergency services. After the customer has 30 locations, MMMW will locate technical personnel in the current geography. If a system is not able to be on-line after hours, on-site help will be made available.",

Support to only include pager support for emergency services when available. After the customer has 100 locations, MMMW will consider if there is any necessity of technical personnel in the current geography. If a system is not able to be on-line after hours, MMMW will offer a consulting service to help.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear and limited on-call service hours, a guaranteed response time, a goal of on-site visit, and a 7X24 hour pager support for emergency services. The modified text reduces service hours to 9 am to 12 pm, changes the response time to 24 hours with no guarantee of on-site visit, offers a consulting service instead of assistance, and makes the availability of emergency support more vague. The changes could potentially conflict with consumer protection laws if those changes significantly degrade the service level that was initially agreed upon.",

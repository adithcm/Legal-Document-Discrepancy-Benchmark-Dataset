                "original_text": "(b) (i) Provider shall provide Recipient with monthly invoices (\"Invoices\"), which shall set forth in reasonable detail, with such supporting documentation as Recipient may reasonably request with respect to Out-of-Pocket Costs, amounts payable under this Agreement, and (ii) payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be made within fifteen (15) days after the date of receipt of an Invoice by Recipient from Provider.",
                "changed_text": "(b) (i) Provider shall provide Recipient with monthly invoices (\"Invoices\"), which shall set forth in reasonable detail, with such supporting documentation as Recipient may reasonably request with respect to Out-of-Pocket Costs, amounts payable under this Agreement, and (ii) payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be made within forty-five (45) days after the date of receipt of an Invoice by Recipient from Provider.",
                "explanation": "The change extends the payment period from 15 days to 45 days. While not inherently illegal, extending the payment term excessively without reasonable justification may contradict standard business practices and could be deemed unconscionable or violate prompt payment laws if the contract were performed in a jurisdiction with such regulations. Many jurisdictions, including some states in the US, have prompt payment laws requiring payment within shorter timeframes (e.g., 30 days) unless otherwise explicitly agreed and justified.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates prompt payment laws in certain jurisdictions if the contract were to be performed there and the extended payment term is deemed unreasonable.",

                "original_text": "3.2 Each of the Recipient and the Provider may, in their sole discretion, terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time without cause, and without liability except, in the case of the Recipient, for required payment for services rendered and reimbursement for authorized expenses incurred, by providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
                "changed_text": "3.2 Each of the Recipient and the Provider may, in their sole discretion, terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time without cause, and without liability except, in the case of the Recipient, for required payment for services rendered and reimbursement for authorized expenses incurred, by providing at least 30 (thirty) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination from 90 days to 30 days might be considered unreasonable in certain contexts, particularly if significant investments or dependencies are involved. This could potentially be challenged as a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under contract law, depending on the specific circumstances and the jurisdiction's legal standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if the shortened notice period is deemed unreasonable given the nature of the services and investments involved.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If the Force Majeure in question prevails for a continuous period in excess of three months after the date on which the Force Majeure begins, Provider shall be entitled to give notice to Recipient to terminate the Affected Services. The notice to terminate must specify the termination date, which must be not less than ten (10) days after the date on which the notice to terminate is given.",
                "changed_text": "If the Force Majeure in question prevails for a continuous period in excess of six months after the date on which the Force Majeure begins, Provider shall be entitled to give notice to Recipient to terminate the Affected Services. The notice to terminate must specify the termination date, which must be not less than five (5) days after the date on which the notice to terminate is given.",
                "explanation": "Extending the Force Majeure period to six months while simultaneously reducing the termination notice to five days is contradictory. Extending the period that much could be considered an unreasonable amount of time, while reducing the termination date so short could be seen as not enough to prepare for the company to find a new provider.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if the force majeure provisions are deemed unreasonable.",

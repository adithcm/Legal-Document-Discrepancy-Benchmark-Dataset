                "changed_text": "3.6.1 All payments shall be made by bank transfer to such account as may be indicated by Dexcel, Dexcel and Kitov each bearing their own bank transfer costs, net sixty (60) days from Delivery. All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the payment terms to 'net sixty (60) days' may create inconsistencies if it contradicts Israeli law or standard commercial practice. Some jurisdictions have regulations around prompt payment, and extending the payment window might violate these regulations. While 30 days is fairly standard, forcing to 60 could be seen as unduly burdening the supplier in certain circumstances, creating a legal challenge based on fairness or local laws.",

In the event that a defect is not apparent upon visual inspection during the shelf life of the Product (\"Hidden Defect\"), Kitov shall use commercially reasonably best efforts to provide Dexcel with written notification within thirty (30) Working Days of discovering the same, to be accompanied by samples of any such allegedly defective Product, if such samples are available In the event of any failure by Kitov to provide Dexcel with written notification of any such shortfall, Apparent Defect or Hidden Defect within the respective aforementioned periods, it shall be deemed as Kitov having accepted the relevant consignment.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for defects (both apparent and hidden) to 'ten (10) Working Days' could be seen as unreasonably short, potentially violating regulations related to product quality and consumer protection, particularly if those regulations mandate a longer inspection/notification window. It also creates a power imbalance, unduly favouring the manufacturer.",

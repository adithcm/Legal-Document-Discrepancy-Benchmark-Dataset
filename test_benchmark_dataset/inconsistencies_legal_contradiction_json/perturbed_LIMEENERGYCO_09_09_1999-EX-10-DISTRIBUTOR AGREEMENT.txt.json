                "original_text": "Distributor shall pay Company within thirty (30) days of   Distributor's or,  as  the  case  may  be,  the end-user's receipt of Products.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall pay Company within ninety (90) days of Distributor's or, as the case may be, the end-user's receipt of Products.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment term from 30 days to 90 days. While not inherently illegal, such an extension without proper consideration and agreement could violate the Illinois Sales Representative Act (820 ILCS 120/0.01 et seq.) if it significantly alters the payment terms and negatively impacts the manufacturer's cash flow. A dramatic shift in payment terms could be viewed as an unfair or deceptive practice.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of the Illinois Sales Representative Act (820 ILCS 120/0.01 et seq.) regarding fair payment terms.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Company will carry a reasonable amount of product liability insurance through a reasonably acceptable products liability insurance company and will name the Distributor as an additional insured under that policy. Company will make reasonable efforts to procure a policy, which is non-cancelable, except upon thirty (30) days, advance notice to the Distributor.",
                "changed_text": "Company will carry a minimal amount of product liability insurance through a products liability insurance company of its choosing and may or may not name the Distributor as an additional insured under that policy. Company will make minimal efforts to procure a policy, which is cancelable at any time with no advance notice to the Distributor.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens the product liability insurance coverage for the distributor. By reducing the 'reasonable amount' to 'minimal amount' and removing the requirement for 'reasonable acceptability' of the insurance company, the change potentially puts the Distributor at significant risk in case of product-related lawsuits or liabilities. By also removing the 30-day notice period, the change conflicts with standard commercial practices and fairness, making the distributor responsible for product liability claims without knowing they are not covered.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, as well as state laws requiring reasonable insurance coverage for businesses.",

                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, the Distributor (on behalf of itself, each of its affiliates and each of their respective representatives) agrees that it will not directly or indirectly solicit or hire any executive, managerial or technical employee of the Company or any of its affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement and perpetually thereafter, the Distributor (on behalf of itself, each of its affiliates and each of their respective representatives) agrees that it will not directly or indirectly solicit or hire any executive, managerial or technical employee of the Company or any of its affiliates.",
                "explanation": "Changing the non-solicitation period from 12 months to perpetually is likely unenforceable under Illinois law. Illinois courts generally disfavor non-compete and non-solicitation agreements, particularly those that are overly broad in scope or duration. A perpetual non-solicitation clause is unreasonable and would be considered a restraint of trade, making it legally suspect. Illinois courts would likely find such a restriction to be against public policy.",

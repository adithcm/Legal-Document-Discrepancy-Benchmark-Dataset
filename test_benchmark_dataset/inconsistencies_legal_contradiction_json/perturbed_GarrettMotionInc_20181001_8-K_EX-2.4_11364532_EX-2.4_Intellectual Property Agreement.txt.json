                "original_text": "(b) SpinCo shall, and shall cause each member of the SpinCo Group to, remove any Honeywell Trademarks or reference to the Honeywell Business appearing on any Honeywell Content as soon as reasonably practicable following the Distribution Date, but in no event later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Distribution Date.",
                "changed_text": "(b) SpinCo shall, and shall cause each member of the SpinCo Group to, remove any Honeywell Trademarks or reference to the Honeywell Business appearing on any Honeywell Content at its discretion. There is no restriction on how long it takes the SpinCo Group to remove Honeywell Trademarks after the Distribution Date.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a legal contradiction because it removes a definite deadline (180 days) for removing Honeywell trademarks and references. Trademark law requires that a licensee take reasonable measures to avoid consumer confusion, and a complete lack of timeline for removing the licensor's trademarks could be deemed unreasonable, potentially violating trademark regulations related to maintaining distinctiveness and avoiding consumer deception. This is particularly true after a spin-off, where brand separation is crucial.",

                "original_text": "For a period of five (5) years after the Distribution Date, in the event any member of the SpinCo Group, in SpinCo's reasonable judgment, requires a license under any Honeywell IP in order to initiate and pursue any new technical projects not covered by the licenses granted in Section 3.01(a), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to license such Honeywell IP to the applicable member of the SpinCo Group on commercially reasonable terms.",
                "changed_text": "In the event any member of the SpinCo Group requires a license under any Honeywell IP in order to initiate and pursue any new technical projects not covered by the licenses granted in Section 3.01(a), Honeywell is not obligated to negotiate in good faith to license such Honeywell IP to the SpinCo Group on commercially reasonable terms.",
                "explanation": "The modified text completely removes the requirement for Honeywell to negotiate in good faith for licensing Honeywell IP to SpinCo for new technical projects. Good faith negotiation is a standard requirement in contract law, and removing this obligation entirely could be viewed as a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most contracts. This is a particularly sensitive issue in an intellectual property agreement between related entities.",

                "original_text": "(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Honeywell will promptly give notice to SpinCo of any actual or threatened, unauthorized use or infringement of the SpinCo IP of which it receives notice, in each case for a period of five (5) years after the Distribution Date.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Honeywell is not required to promptly give notice to SpinCo of any actual or threatened, unauthorized use or infringement of the SpinCo IP of which it receives notice.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires Honeywell to promptly notify SpinCo of any infringement of SpinCo IP they become aware of. The modified clause removes this obligation entirely. This is a legal contradiction because it absolves Honeywell of any responsibility to protect SpinCo's IP, even if they are aware of infringements, which could be interpreted as a breach of a duty to protect IP rights, potentially violating obligations arising from the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and creating a risk of IP dilution.",

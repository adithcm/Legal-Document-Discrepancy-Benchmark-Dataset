                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Upon written demand of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall cease using the Confidential Information and return the Confidential Information and all copies, notes or extracts thereof to the Disclosing Party within seven (7) days of receipt of notice.",
                "changed_text": "Upon written demand of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall cease using the Confidential Information and return the Confidential Information and all copies, notes or extracts thereof to the Disclosing Party within two (2) days of receipt of notice.",
                "explanation": "California law requires a reasonable period for returning confidential information. Shortening the return period to two days may be considered unreasonable and could be seen as coercive, especially if the volume of information is substantial. This introduces a contradiction with typical standards of reasonableness in California contract law.",

                "explanation": "In California, automatic renewal clauses in service contracts are only enforceable if they comply with specific disclosure requirements under California Business and Professions Code Section 17602. Increasing the renewal period to three years without ensuring explicit, conspicuous disclosure of the automatic renewal terms may render the clause unenforceable under California law.",

                "changed_text": "Notices will be deemed effective (i) ten (10) working days after deposit, postage prepaid, if mailed, (ii) five (5) days after sent by overnight mail, or (iii) five (5) days if sent by facsimile and confirmed as set forth above.",
                "explanation": "Under California law, extending the notice period significantly for mailed notices can contradict implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, particularly if it prejudices one party's ability to respond to time-sensitive communications. Similarly, unreasonably delaying the effective date of overnight mail and fax communications introduces non-compliance with standards of prompt notification.",

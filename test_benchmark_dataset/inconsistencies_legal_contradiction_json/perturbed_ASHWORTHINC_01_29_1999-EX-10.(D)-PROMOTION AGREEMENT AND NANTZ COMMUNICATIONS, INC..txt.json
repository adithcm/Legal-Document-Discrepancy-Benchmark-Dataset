                "original_text": "The Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, advertising and product liability insurance each with limits no less than $5,000,000 and within thirty (30) days from the date hereof, the Company will submit to Nantz Communications a fully paid policy or certificate of insurance naming Nantz Communications and Nantz as insured parties, requiring that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such without written notice to Nantz Communications at least twenty (20) days in advance thereof.",
                "changed_text": "The Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, advertising and product liability insurance each with limits no less than $5,000,000. The Company will submit to Nantz Communications a fully paid policy or certificate of insurance naming Nantz Communications and Nantz as insured parties, requiring that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such without written notice to Nantz Communications at least ten (10) days in advance thereof. The submission of this policy will be at the company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modified text reduces the required advance notice for insurance policy changes from 20 days to 10 days and states the submission of the policy will be at the company's discretion. This contradicts California Insurance Code which typically requires insurers to provide a minimum of 30 days' notice for policy cancellations or material modifications and places a duty on the company to provide the policy.",

                "explanation": "California Labor Code Section 2802 mandates that an employer must indemnify an employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the employee's duties. Extending the reimbursement timeframe to 60 days after receipt, rather than 30 days, could potentially violate Labor Code Section 2802 if such delay results in financial hardship or loss to Nantz Communications.",

In order to be a sufficient notice hereunder, any such written notice shall specify in detail each item of default, and shall specify in detail the action the defaulting party is required to take in order to cure each item.",
                "changed_text": "Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement after being given notice thereof and, where applicable, an opportunity to cure the failure (which shall be 5 days in the event of a failure to timely make a payment pursuant hereto; 15 days otherwise).",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for payment failures to 5 days could be deemed unreasonable under California law, especially if the payment delay is due to circumstances beyond the control of the defaulting party. Courts may find a 10-day cure period to be unreasonably short, especially given potential complexities in resolving payment disputes. Additionally reducing the otherwise timeframe for cure to 15 days may be deemed unreasonable depending on the complexity of the breach.",

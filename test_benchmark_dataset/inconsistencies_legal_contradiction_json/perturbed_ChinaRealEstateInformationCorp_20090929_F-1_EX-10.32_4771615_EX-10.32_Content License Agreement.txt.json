                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority. Licensee's failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites at its convenience. Licensee's failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a strict timeframe for removing offending content, aligned with governmental authority guidelines. The modified text replaces this with 'at its convenience,' effectively nullifying any legally required response time. This contradicts PRC regulations concerning censorship and content control on online platforms, which impose specific and often stringent deadlines for content removal upon notification.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a reimbursement deadline of 7 days, promoting clarity and financial certainty. The modified text replaces this with 'at their earliest convenience,' creating ambiguity and contradicting PRC tax laws, which specify timeframes for tax-related reimbursements and settlements, rendering the new clause unenforceable and potentially in violation of tax regulations.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates arbitration in Beijing under CIETAC rules and Mandarin Chinese. The modified text changes the venue to Los Angeles, specifies mediation instead of arbitration, and uses English as the language. This directly contradicts the agreement to use PRC-based arbitration for dispute resolution, undermining the CIETAC's authority and potentially violating contractual agreements for dispute resolution within the PRC legal framework.",

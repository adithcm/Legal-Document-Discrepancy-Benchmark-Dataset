                "explanation": "Extending the payment deadline to 60 days from the invoice date introduces a potential conflict with standard business practices and potentially with the Illinois Prompt Payment Act (if applicable to this type of service), which generally requires payment within a shorter timeframe. Many jurisdictions favor shorter payment windows to maintain cash flow.",

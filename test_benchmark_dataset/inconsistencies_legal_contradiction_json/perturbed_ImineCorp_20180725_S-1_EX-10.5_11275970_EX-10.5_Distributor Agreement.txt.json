            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Terms of payment shall be net thirty (30) days.",
                "changed_text": "Terms of payment shall be net sixty (60) days.",
                "explanation": "Under the laws governing commercial transactions, extending payment terms significantly beyond standard practices (30 days is generally accepted) without proper justification can be deemed an unfair business practice. While not illegal per se, it can create inconsistencies if the industry standard in Taiwan is shorter, potentially violating fair competition laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with Taiwan's Fair Trade Act if standard industry payment terms are significantly shorter, creating an unfair advantage for JRVS.",
                "location": "Section 6.1"
            },
            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Distributor shall have thirty (30) days (the \"Inspection Period\") upon receipt of each shipment to inspect and test the Products. If the Distributor determines any unit of Products defective, the Distributor shall promptly notify JRVS of such defects. Defective Products may be returned for retest, evaluation and examination subject to JRVS Returned Material Authorization (\"RMA\") procedure; provided, that such written notification and request for an RMA number must be received by JRVS during the Inspection Period.",
                "changed_text": "The Distributor shall have ten (10) days (the \"Inspection Period\") upon receipt of each shipment to inspect and test the Products. If the Distributor determines any unit of Products defective, the Distributor shall promptly notify JRVS of such defects. Defective Products may be returned for retest, evaluation and examination subject to JRVS Returned Material Authorization (\"RMA\") procedure; provided, that such written notification and request for an RMA number must be received by JRVS during the Inspection Period.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the inspection period from 30 to 10 days for potentially complex cryptocurrency mining rig components may be deemed unreasonably short, particularly if industry standards allow for longer inspection periods. This can potentially violate consumer protection laws or fair trade practices in Taiwan, as it unduly restricts the distributor's ability to identify and report defects.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with Taiwan's Consumer Protection Act or Fair Trade Act if 10 days is deemed an unreasonably short inspection period for such products.",
                "location": "Section 7.2"
            },
            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "NO ACTIONS, REGARDLESS OF FORM, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, MAY BE BROUGHT BY DISTRIBUTOR MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION HAS ARISEN.",
                "changed_text": "NO ACTIONS, REGARDLESS OF FORM, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, MAY BE BROUGHT BY DISTRIBUTOR MORE THAN SIX (6) MONTHS AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION HAS ARISEN.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the statute of limitations to six months can be deemed an unreasonably short period, potentially conflicting with legal standards in Taiwan regarding contract disputes. Many jurisdictions have longer statutes of limitations for breach of contract claims, providing parties more time to discover and pursue legal remedies. This alteration unduly favors JRVS by limiting the distributor's ability to bring claims.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with Taiwan's Civil Code regarding the statute of limitations for contract disputes, if Taiwanese law provides for a longer period.",
                "location": "Section 13.2"

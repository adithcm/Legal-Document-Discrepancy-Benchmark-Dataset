Marketing Affiliate shall pay to Equidata, as compensation for its providing of Services under this agreement, such amounts as outlined and detailed in Exhibit A attached hereto. Such amounts shall be billed on a bi-monthly basis by Equidata and are due and payable in full by Marketing Affiliate 30 days from the invoice date.",

Marketing Affiliate shall pay to Equidata, as compensation for its providing of Services under this agreement, such amounts as outlined and detailed in Exhibit A attached hereto. Such amounts shall be billed on a bi-monthly basis by Equidata and are due and payable in full by Marketing Affiliate 60 days from the invoice date.",
                "explanation": "This changes the payment terms from 30 days to 60 days, creating a contradiction if Exhibit A specifies a different payment timeline or if another clause in the agreement relies on the original 30-day term. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment deadline.",

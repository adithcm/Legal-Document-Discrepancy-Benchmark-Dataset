                "original_text": "\"Production Cost\" means actual cost (including reasonable and competitive allowances for: materials, labor, overhead, other fixed costs, delivery, profit, taxes and duties) incurred in manufacturing and delivering AMR products. Reasonable and competitive is defined as being at or below the costs of competing manufacturers with similar capabilities manufactured under similar terms.",
                "changed_text": "\"Production Cost\" means actual cost (including allowances for: materials, labor, overhead, other fixed costs, delivery, profit, taxes and duties) incurred in manufacturing and delivering AMR products. Production Cost will be calculated using LKPL’s internal accounting procedures and is not subject to external benchmarks or comparisons. Axiometric acknowledges that LKPL’s internal procedures are proprietary and agrees not to challenge the cost calculations.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict in the definition of 'Production Cost.' The original definition specifies 'reasonable and competitive allowances' benchmarked against competitors. The revised definition removes the 'reasonable and competitive' qualifier and states that LKPL's internal accounting procedures will determine the cost, removing the ability to compare to market standards, potentially leading to inflated costs and reduced Net Proceeds for Axiometric. This contradicts the original intention of fair and market-based pricing.",

                "explanation": "This modification makes the distribution of proceeds subject to LKPL's 'sole discretion,' contradicting the more objective percentages previously stipulated. While the original clause implies negotiation ('unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing'), this revised language grants unilateral control to LKPL. This creates potential for unfair distribution of profits.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'will automatically renew' to 'may or may not automatically renew', we introduce uncertainty regarding the term of the contract, directly contradicting the original clear automatic renewal clause. This creates a contradiction because, in some sections, obligations could be based on the assumption of automatic renewal, while this section casts doubt on that renewal. This ambiguity could lead to disputes about the enforceability of contractual obligations after the initial term.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'SpinRecords.com's AR Share' is modified. Initially, it's based on Impressions. The added text states that for the first year, it is calculated using unique visitors. This contradiction creates ambiguity in calculating the AR Share, which directly affects the amount SpinRecords.com owes NETTAXI, leading to potential disputes.",

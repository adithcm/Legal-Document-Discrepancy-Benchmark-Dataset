                "explanation": "This creates an internal contradiction regarding the period during which the affiliate is eligible for Advertising Cost Compensation. The original text ties eligibility to the 'term of this Agreement,' implying the entire duration. The modified text restricts eligibility to the 'first year', and removes the condition for fees earned. This is an in-text contradiction if the 'Agreement Period' (Section ยง 7) is defined as an unlimited period of time, creating uncertainty on when the affiliate is eligible for payment.",

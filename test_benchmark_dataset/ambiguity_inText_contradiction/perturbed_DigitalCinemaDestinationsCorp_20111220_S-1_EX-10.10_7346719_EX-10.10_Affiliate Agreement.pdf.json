                "explanation": "The original definition refers to Exhibit A for the meaning of \"Lobby Promotions.\" The modified definition introduces a conflicting interpretation by explicitly stating NCM's sole decision-making authority. This contradicts the spirit of partnership and shared decision making in advertising detailed throughout the contract, creating ambiguity in enforcement. In other sections the contract outlines how Lobby Promotions are collaborative. This conflicting definition disrupts the intended collaborative nature of Lobby Promotions, leading to legal challenges over who truly controls these marketing activities.",

All inventory choices and strategic planning related to these activities are at National CineMedia's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity because it creates an **internal contradiction** by making activities under the Pepsi Beverage agreement, 'as directed and fully approved by NCM,' implying the Pepsi arrangement and any activities around it require approval from National CineMedia. This contradicts a previous section of the contract indicating Network Affiliate retains the right to perform promotional activities related to this agreement. This confusion could lead to legal disputes over control and execution of these advertising promotions.",

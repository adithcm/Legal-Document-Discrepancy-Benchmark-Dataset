                "original_text": "7.       Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods.\n         mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the\n         Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to the current\n         quality of their Goods.",

Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods.\n         mPhase agrees to use its best efforts to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the\n         Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality that is deemed commercially reasonable by mPhase.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires mPhase to maintain a comparable level of quality to its current goods. The modified version introduces subjective language ('best efforts', 'commercially reasonable') that contradicts the original objective standard. This makes enforcement uncertain, as it's now mPhase who determines what is 'commercially reasonable', thus weakening Lucent's ability to ensure quality control.",

                "changed_text": "8.       If Lucent reasonably determines that mPhase's Goods are demonstrably inferior and negatively impacting the Lucent brand, Lucent shall so notify mPhase, in writing, and Lucent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement. However, mPhase shall have a period of 90 days to remedy the identified quality issues to Lucent's reasonable satisfaction.",
                "explanation": "The original clause grants Lucent the right to terminate if the quality isn't maintained. The modified version adds several conditions: the goods must be demonstrably inferior, negatively impacting Lucent's brand, and grants mPhase a 90-day cure period. This introduces a contradiction because the original clause implies immediate termination upon quality drop, while the modified version allows for remediation and subjective assessment of impact. This makes termination less straightforward, as Lucent now bears the burden of proving negative brand impact, and mPhase has a chance to remedy any issues.",

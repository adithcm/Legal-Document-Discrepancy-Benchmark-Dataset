USER shall mean a single person who accesses and views a Site whether\ndirectly from a web browser or through a Link.\n\n     4.6.1. \"VerticalNet Impresse Users\" are the Users that register with\nImpresse through the Co-Branded Site, but specifically excluding those Users\nwho have previously registered with Impresse other than through the\nCo-Branded Site.\n     HOWEVER, for the purposes of data sharing and usage as described in Section 7.6, 'USER' shall only refer to those who have explicitly opted in to data collection during registration.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'USER' is broad, encompassing anyone who accesses the site. Section 4.6.1 then introduces the term 'VerticalNet Impresse Users' with a slightly more restricted definition for revenue sharing. The added clause in Section 1.22 further restricts the definition of 'USER' for the purposes of data usage described in section 7.6, now only encompassing those who have 'opted in' to data collection. This creates an in-text contradiction, as someone could be a 'USER' under the general definition, but not a 'USER' for data collection purposes, leading to ambiguity and potential disputes over data privacy and usage rights.",

Women.com reserves the right to change such policies in its sole discretion from time to time. eDiets may use the Women.com Data to market relevant eDiets products and services to Women.com users, provided that such use complies with applicable laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "The original text prohibits eDiets from disclosing or transferring Women.com data, thus protecting user privacy. The modified version allows eDiets to use this data for marketing, potentially conflicting with the initially stated privacy obligations and causing ambiguity regarding the permissible use of user data. It becomes unclear whether eDiets' marketing use of the data is considered a 'transfer' or 'disclosure,' thus creating an internal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "theglobe shall provide a minimum of *** impressions per month of promotion for auctions on the Co-Branded Pages (including without limitation any of the foregoing). theglobe's sole and exclusive obligation for failing to deliver the minimum number of impressions shall be to continue performing the promotion until it delivers the total number of required impressions.",
                "changed_text": "theglobe shall endeavor to provide a minimum of *** impressions per month of promotion for auctions on the Co-Branded Pages (including without limitation any of the foregoing). theglobe's obligation for failing to deliver the minimum number of impressions shall be to negotiate in good faith with Boxlot to determine a mutually agreeable resolution.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states theglobe's sole obligation for not meeting the minimum impressions is to continue promoting until met. The modified text changes 'shall provide' to 'shall endeavor to provide,' weakening the obligation. It also replaces the guaranteed remedy with a vague 'negotiate in good faith,' creating uncertainty about theglobe's responsibilities and Boxlot's entitlements. This is contradictory if other sections of the agreement assume theglobe will absolutely provide a minimum number of impressions or face a more concrete penalty, which creates an ambiguity.",

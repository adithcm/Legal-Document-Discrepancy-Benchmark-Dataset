For the purposes of Section 3, only stations fully owned by the Affiliate will be considered 'Stations'.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflicting definition of 'Station(s)'. In the original definition, a station licensed to a *subsidiary* of the Affiliate is included. The modified definition excludes stations owned by subsidiaries *specifically for Section 3*, creating ambiguity as to whether subsidiary-owned stations are considered 'Stations' for the grant of rights and obligations, potentially affecting Affiliate's exclusivity and responsibilities.",

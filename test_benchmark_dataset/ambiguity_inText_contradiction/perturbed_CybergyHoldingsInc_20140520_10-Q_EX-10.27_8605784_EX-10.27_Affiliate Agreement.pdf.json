Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company hereby\ngrants to MA the right to advertise, market and sell to corporate users, government\nagencies and educational facilities. For the purpose of this agreement, only government agencies qualify as 'Clients'. These 'Clients' are authorized to use the services for their own internal language learning, soft\nskills and communication purposes only, and not for remarketing or redistribution, and not\nfor use in a data center environment for multiple users Clients, unless otherwise agreed to by\nCompany prior in writing, the Technology listed in Schedule A of this Agreement, and to sell\nand/or bundle Technology Maintenance for the Technology and to provide first line\ntechnical support and implementation services for the Technology in the territories listed in\nSchedule A of this Agreement, providing MA meets the criteria required for delivering\nservices according to Schedule A.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Clients' broadly to include corporate users, government agencies, and educational facilities. The modified text restricts the definition of 'Clients' to only government agencies. This creates a contradiction because later sections of the agreement (like those dealing with revenue or support requirements) might use 'Clients' assuming the broader original definition, leading to uncertainty about MA's obligations regarding support, sales quotas, and revenue sharing with non-government entities.",

Confidential Information shall mean any patient records, financial data, and strategic plans of UDC disclosed to the Business Affiliate, clearly marked as 'Confidential' at the time of disclosure. Any information not explicitly marked as confidential is not subject to the confidentiality provisions of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition broadly defines Confidential Information, while the modified definition narrows it to specifically marked documents, creating a contradiction. This makes it unclear whether information considered confidential under the original definition is still protected if it is not explicitly marked as 'Confidential'.",

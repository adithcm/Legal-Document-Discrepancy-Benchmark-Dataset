There are no explicit deadlines. The delivery of the URL and the access codes or passwords necessary to use the Service to MBE and each subscribing MBE Center will depend on the availability of Company's resources.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets firm deadlines for completion and delivery. The modified text removes these deadlines, making the delivery schedule uncertain and dependent on resource availability. This creates a contradiction because other sections might rely on the initial firm deadlines, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

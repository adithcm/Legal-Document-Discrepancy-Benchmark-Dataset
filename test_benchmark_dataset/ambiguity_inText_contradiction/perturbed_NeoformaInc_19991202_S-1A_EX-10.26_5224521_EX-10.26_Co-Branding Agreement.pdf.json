                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by broadening the definition of Advertising to include elements initially excluded, thus conflicting with Section 7, which outlines revenue sharing for 'paid advertisements'. It blurs the distinction between paid and unpaid promotion, causing uncertainty regarding revenue distribution.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of Commercially Reasonable Efforts specifies a detailed, objective standard, while the modified version introduces subjectivity by relying on what the 'acting party' deems appropriate. This can lead to disputes over whether a party has truly met its diligence obligations, especially since section 3.2 explicitly states Bioeq has to use 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts'.",

                "explanation": "The original definition includes all non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing process development, and activities necessary for regulatory approval. The modified version drastically reduces the scope to *only* clinical research. This contradicts section 3.1, which states that Bioeq shall be solely responsible for Development of Licensed Products, as the modified text could be interpreted to mean Bioeq is no longer responsible for activities like manufacturing process development, which are crucial for the product's viability.",

                "explanation": "The original definition specifies that the Licensed Patents are those controlled by Bioeq and necessary for Licensee to operate without infringing, directly tying them to the license grant. By omitting \"all Patent Rights Controlled by Bioeq during the term of this Agreement that, but for the license granted by Bioeq to Licensee pursuant to Section 2.1 hereunder, would be infringed or misappropriated by Licensee’s use, sale, offering for sale or import of the Licensed Products in the Territory in the Field\", the modified definition loses this direct connection. This change makes the scope of the license unclear. The reference to Schedule 1.38 alone is insufficient because it doesn't explain how these patents relate to the Licensee's activities.",

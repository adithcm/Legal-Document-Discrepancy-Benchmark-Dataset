In the event that Company sells a LICENSED PRODUCT(S) in combination with other ingredients or substances or as part of a kit, the NET SALES for purposes of royalty payments shall be based on the sales revenues and fees received from the entire combination or kit.",

In the event that Company sells a LICENSED PRODUCT(S) in combination with other ingredients or substances or as part of a kit, the NET SALES for purposes of royalty payments shall be determined at JHU's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'less trade discounts allowed, refunds, returns and recalls, and sales taxes' from the definition of NET SALES, the calculation of royalties becomes unclear and potentially disadvantageous to the Company. The addition of 'determined at JHU's discretion' introduces further uncertainty and contradicts the intent of having a clearly defined metric for royalty calculation. This creates a contradiction between the need for a clear royalty calculation and the ambiguity now present in the definition.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'as set forth in Exhibit A' and 'within thirty (30) days of' the specifics around the minimum annual royalties is gone, but in Exhibit A the minimum royalty is still defined. Then by making the statement 'Running royalties accrued under Paragraph 4.3 may be credited against the minimum annual royalties', it introduces ambiguity about how the royalties should be paid and calculated.",

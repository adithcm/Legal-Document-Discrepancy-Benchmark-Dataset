                "explanation": "By removing the sentence 'Channel Partner accepts iPass as the exclusive provider to Channel Partner for all services of the nature of the Services,' we are creating a loophole that can be exploited. This omission would create ambiguity in exclusivity, potentially leading to disputes regarding iPass's role as the sole provider. This affects Section 1.2 because the 'Grant of Authority' implies certain rights to Channel Partner, but without the exclusivity clause, iPass's position as the primary provider is weakened.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definite interest rate (1.5%), we make the late fee ambiguous. This contradicts the need for financial clarity and introduces a subjective element ('interest') without specifying how it's calculated. This impacts Section 3.3 because it describes the 'Late Fees' but lacks a precise calculation, opening the door to disputes.",

                "explanation": "By removing the exculpatory conditions for iPass's indemnity obligations, the section now provides an unconditional indemnity. This creates a conflict because it broadens iPass's financial exposure beyond what they initially intended. This affects Section 8.1 because it drastically alters the scope of iPass's liability, making it harder for iPass to defend itself against IP claims.",

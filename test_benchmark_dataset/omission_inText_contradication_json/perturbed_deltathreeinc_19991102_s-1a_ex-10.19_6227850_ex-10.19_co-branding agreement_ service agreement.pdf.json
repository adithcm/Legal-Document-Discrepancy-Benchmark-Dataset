                "original_text": "PrimeCall and DeltaThree shall jointly develop a DeltaThree prepaid calling card product (or modify and improve an existing PrimeCall product) which bears the logos of each of DeltaThree and PrimeCall. In order to lower the cost structure and increase the competitiveness of the Calling Card, DeltaThree and PrimeCall shall each use their reasonable best efforts to increase the percentage of the traffic derived from the use of the Calling Card which will be carried via the DeltaThree Network. For purposes of this Agreement, the \"DeltaThree Network\" shall mean Internet Protocol (IP) communications services, which utilize the Internet and networks, based on IP to provide telecommunications products and services. It is fully understood that the Calling Card is a DeltaThree product and accordingly all revenues derived therefrom will inure to the benefit of DeltaThree.",
                "changed_text": "PrimeCall and DeltaThree shall jointly develop a calling card product. In order to lower the cost structure and increase the competitiveness of the calling card, DeltaThree and PrimeCall shall collaborate on traffic management. It is understood that the calling card is a product and revenues will inure to the benefit of both parties.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"DeltaThree Network\" is removed, but Section 2.01 still references to 'traffic derived from the use of the Calling Card which will be carried via the DeltaThree Network.' This creates ambiguity as the defining characteristic of what constitutes the \"DeltaThree Network\" is now undefined. Also, the revenue distribution is contradicted, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

In the event that DeltaThree disputes any amounts set forth on the report, DeltaThree shall provide PrimeCall with written notice of such dispute, which notice shall detail the reasons for the dispute, within seven (7) days of its receipt thereof. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputes.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause specifying the seven (7) days dispute notice window, the contract becomes vague on the deadline for disputes, undermining the clarity of reporting obligations. This ambiguity in dispute timeframe directly contradicts the preceding sentence which establishes a requirement for notice.",

                "explanation": "By omitting exception (iii), 'the provisions of Article VII [Limited Warranty] shall continue in full force and effect,' the clause concerning the survival of limited warranty after termination is removed. This conflicts with Article VII if it does not define its enforceability terms clearly, creating ambiguity in post-termination liability.",

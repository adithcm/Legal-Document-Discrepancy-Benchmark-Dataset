                "original_text": "“Nuance Shared Technology Assets” means (i) the Nuance Technology Assets identified on Schedule H-2 and (ii) any other Nuance Technology Assets not identified on Schedule H-2 that are used in the SpinCo Business as of immediately prior to the Distribution; provided that the “Nuance Shared Technology Assets” exclude any OEM Technology.",

                "explanation": "By removing the exclusion of OEM Technology from the definition of “Nuance Shared Technology Assets”, it creates an inconsistency. Later sections may rely on this exclusion, potentially leading to disputes over the licensing and use of OEM Technology under the general licenses granted for Nuance Shared Technology Assets. This contradicts Section 3.01(f), which states OEM Technology is subject to separate agreements.",

                "explanation": "Removing the third clause of the original definition of SpinCo Data creates a contradiction. The term SpinCo Data is now ambiguous, as the part of the definition regarding the data owned by Nuance and SpinCo Group is omitted. Schedule C relies on this definition, therefore, creating ambiguity in its enforcement.",

In the event that either Party, acting reasonably, forms the view that another Party has caused a material breach of the terms of this Agreement, then the Party that forms such a view shall serve written notice of the alleged breach on the other Parties and the Parties shall work together in good faith to resolve any such alleged breach within thirty (30) days of such notice (a “Dispute”). If any such alleged breach is not so resolved, then a senior executive of each Party shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve any such alleged breach within the following thirty (30) days of the referral of the matter to the senior executives. If no resolution is reached with respect to any such alleged breach in accordance with the procedures contained in this Section 11.02, then the Parties may seek to resolve such matter in accordance with Section 11.03, Section 11.04, Section 11.05 and Section 11.06",

                "explanation": "By removing the last sentence in dispute resolution clause it introduces a contradiction. The procedures for resolution are referenced but not defined. This makes enforcement unclear, as subsequent sections regarding governing law, jurisdiction, waiver of jury trial, and interim relief are no longer explicitly linked to the dispute resolution process.",

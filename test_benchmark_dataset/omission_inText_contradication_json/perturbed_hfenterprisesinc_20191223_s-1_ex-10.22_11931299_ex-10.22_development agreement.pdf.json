                "original_text": "1.2.  Development Fees. As payment for Developer’s satisfactory performance of the services set forth in Schedule 1 hereto (the “Technology Development Services”), DSS shall pay Developer the sum of US $23,000 per month, for the duration of the Term hereof, with payments to commence on March 1, 2018.",
                "changed_text": "1.2. Development Fees. As payment for Developer’s satisfactory performance of the services, DSS shall pay Developer fees, with payments to commence on March 1, 2018. The specific amount and payment schedule will be determined based on project milestones as communicated by DSS.",
                "explanation": "By removing the fixed monthly payment of US $23,000, the contract now lacks a defined fee structure. This omission contradicts the initial agreement of a set monthly payment. This creates uncertainty because the services are stated to be paid, but the amount has been omitted. This can lead to disputes regarding what constitutes 'satisfactory performance' and how the milestones affect the final fee amount.",

For purposes of this Agreement, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below.\n \n“Improvements” shall mean technical improvements, modifications or enhancements relating to the Technology that are developed by the Developer pursuant to this Agreement.\n \n“Intellectual Property” shall mean, but shall not be limited to, all of DSS’s (i) issued and pending patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, designs, logos, and copyrights, and all pending applications for registration thereof; (ii) know-how, inventions, improvements, methods, operation manuals and procedures, trade secrets, technical information, formulas; (iii) computer software and programs, and related documentation, updates, and data, whether in object or source code form, and (vi) other similar proprietary and intellectual rights, whether or not registered.\n \n“Person” shall mean any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, trust or any other entity or organization of any kind or character, including a governmental authority or agency.\n \n“Technology” shall collectively mean (i) DSS’s proprietary AuthentiGuard® technology (including DSS’s related patents and patent applications, inventions, software, trademarks, trade names, service marks, technology marks, designs, logos, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and any other DSS owned intellectual property relating thereto), consisting of a unique application of the AuthentiGuard® patent coupled with next generation technology and software which enables and end-to-end brand protection solution for product authentication, counterfeit deterrence and data tracking via embedded customized technology marks with hidden codes placed in products which can be read an authenticated via an application loaded on various devices along with necessary hardware and DSS’s portal, (ii) DSS’s Prism Viewer technology comprised of a custom covert Prism image imbedded in a customer’s products that is viewed and authenticated through the use of DSS’s propriety smart phone application, and (iii) DSS’s AuthentiSite technology suite comprised of an embedded digital Prism image coupled with a cloud-based security server and a smart phone verification application for website authentication.",

                "explanation": "By significantly shortening the definition in Section 4, critical definitions for \"Intellectual Property\" and \"Technology\" are removed. This creates a contradiction because the agreement repeatedly references these terms (e.g., Section 3, Proprietary Rights) without providing clear definitions for them. This vagueness in defining intellectual property and technology rights creates uncertainty. It is now unclear what encompasses DSS’s proprietary technology which is essential for understanding the scope of the development license and subsequent ownership of Improvements.",

The parties acknowledge that they have entered into that certain Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated as of January 18, 2018 (the “NDA”), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A. The terms of the NDA shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Agreement, mutatis mutandis.

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) dated January 18, 2018, and its attachment as Exhibit A, while still mentioning confidentiality, a contradiction arises. The original text clearly stated the NDA's terms are incorporated and binding, which included a 5-year protection period. The edited text removes this explicit link and replaces it with a general statement. This creates uncertainty because the original specific terms of the NDA are no longer incorporated but confidential information is required to be protected, leading to potential disagreement on what constitutes confidential information and the duration of the protection.",

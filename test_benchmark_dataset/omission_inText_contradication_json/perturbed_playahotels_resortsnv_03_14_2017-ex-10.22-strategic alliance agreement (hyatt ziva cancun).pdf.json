During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2018 (the “Development Term”), each Party (the “Offering Party”) agrees to provide to the other Party (the “Receiving Party”) a right of first offer with respect to any proposed offer or arrangement, which the Offering Party (or its affiliate) desires to accept, under which the Offering Party or one of its affiliates would acquire the ownership of real property in the Market Area (the “Development Property”) on which a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort would operate (a “Development Opportunity”).\nIf the Offering Party is required to offer the Receiving Party a Development Opportunity pursuant to this Section 1, the Offering Party must deliver written notice to the Receiving Party, together with reasonable due diligence information in the Offering Party’s possession to enable the Receiving Party to evaluate the Development Opportunity (collectively, the “Offer Notice”). The Receiving Party will have ten (10) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to provide 'reasonable due diligence information' along with the Offer Notice, it creates uncertainty. The initial section still references the \"Offer Notice\" requirement, but the parameters of what constitutes it becomes vague. This could lead to disputes regarding the validity of the offer and whether the Receiving Party received adequate information to make an informed decision.",

                "explanation": "By removing the arbitrator's qualification criteria, specifically that each arbitrator 'shall have no fewer than ten (10) years’ experience in the international hotel business, (2) shall be licensed to practice law in the United States, and (3) shall not be a person, or an affiliate of a person, who has any past, present or currently contemplated future business or personal relationship with either Playa, Hyatt or any of their respective affiliates', it creates an internal contradiction. The agreement initially stipulates that arbitration will occur but now is left with an incomplete selection process which makes it more difficult to arbitrate.",

Best Company and shall, upon Bank of America’s request, be furnished to Bank of America certificates and required endorsements evidencing such insurance. Bank of America shall be named as an ‘‘Additional Insured” to the coverages described in Sections 26.2.3, 26.2.4, and 26.2.5 below for the purpose of protecting Bank of America from any expense and/or liability arising out of, alleged to arise out of, related to or connected with the Products provided by Supplier and/or its Subcontractors. The certificates shall state the amount of all deductibles and self-insured retentions and shall contain evidence that the policy or policies shall not be canceled or materially altered without at least thirty (30) calendar days prior written notice to Bank of America. Supplier and its Subcontractors shalt pay any and all costs which are incurred by Bank of America as a result of any such deductibles or self-insured retentions to the extent that Bank of America is named as an “Additional Insured,” and to the same extent as if the policies contained no deductibles or self-insured retention. The insurance coverages and limits required to be maintained by Supplier and its Subcontractors shall be primary and non-contributory to insurance coverage, if any, maintained by Bank of America. Supplier and Proprietary to Bank of America its Subcontractors and their underwriters shall waive subrogation against Bank of America and shall cause their insurer(s) to waive subrogation against Bank of America.",

                "explanation": "While the section heading 'INSURANCE' is still present, the substantive requirement to secure specific types and levels of insurance is removed. The modified text replaces it with a vague requirement of 'insurance coverage deemed adequate by Supplier.' This contradicts the detailed insurance requirements specified in subsequent sections (26.2.1 through 26.2.7), creating uncertainty about the actual insurance obligations and making enforcement challenging.",

Such Supplier Records referenced above may be inspected, audited and copied by Bank of America, its Representatives or by federal or state agencies having jurisdiction over Bank of America, during normal business hours and at such reasonable times as Bank of America and Supplier may determine. Records available for review shall exclude any records pertaining to Supplier’s other customers deemed proprietary and confidential and Supplier confidential and proprietary records not associated with the Products and services provided under this Agreement. Supplier will give prior notice to Bank of America of requests by federal or state authorities to examine Supplier’s Bank of America Records.

                "explanation": "The modified text removes the specific requirement for Supplier to maintain records pertaining to Products and services provided to Bank of America for seven years, and the obligation to make those records available for audit. This creates an in-text contradiction if other clauses in the contract still rely on Bank of America's ability to audit the Supplier's records related to the agreement. The phrase 'as required by law' is too vague and introduces ambiguity since the original made a specific demand of the supplier.",

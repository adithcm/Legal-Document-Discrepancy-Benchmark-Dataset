                "explanation": "Removing the explicit reference to Exhibit A, which outlines the specific responsibilities of each Joint Venturer, creates ambiguity. Later sections assume these defined roles, and this removal could lead to disputes about task allocation, violating the clarity needed for enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "All direct costs and expenses related to the operations of the Joint Venture shall be subject to mutual agreement between the Joint Venturers.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit inclusion of insurance costs and additional office facilities as direct costs paid by the Joint Venture, and replacing it with a requirement for 'mutual agreement', the clause becomes vague. Section 7 initially specifies certain costs to be covered, but the changed text introduces uncertainty regarding which costs are automatically covered and which require additional approval, potentially leading to disagreement and hindering enforcement of financial responsibilities.",

                "changed_text": "Distributions shall be made at the discretion of both Joint Venturers.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the reference to Section 6, which clearly defines the prorata interest (50% each), and stating that distributions are 'at the discretion of both Joint Venturers', this introduces ambiguity and contradicts the intended equal division of income as defined earlier in the agreement. This creates an internal contradiction by allowing potential unequal distributions despite the stated 50/50 split in Section 6.",

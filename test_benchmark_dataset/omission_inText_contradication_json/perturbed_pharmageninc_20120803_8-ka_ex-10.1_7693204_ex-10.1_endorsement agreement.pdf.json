In-kind Payment: HDS will provide Celebrity with a one (1) year complimentary supply (i.e., at least 365 \ncaplets) of Clotamin product during the Term. \n\nB.

                "explanation": "The specific payment schedule and amounts are removed, including details about the in-kind payment (number of caplets). The removal of the cash payment schedule creates uncertainty about when and how much Celebrity will be paid. Referencing an 'addendum' implies another document defines the cash payment, but if this document doesn't exist or conflicts, it introduces contradiction and ambiguity. The removal of the number of caplets leaves the amount of in-kind payment undefined and open to interpretation.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specification of 'prior written approval of Celebrity via his agent, CSE' and replacing it with 'approval process,' the exact procedure for approval is made vague. The defined time frame of 5 business days for approval is omitted. This omission creates ambiguity about who needs to approve the advertising, what form the approval must take, and the consequences of failing to obtain approval. This contradicts the original detailed approval process.",

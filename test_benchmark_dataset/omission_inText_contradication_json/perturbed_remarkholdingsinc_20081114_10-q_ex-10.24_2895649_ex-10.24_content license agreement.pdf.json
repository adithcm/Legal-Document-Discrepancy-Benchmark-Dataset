                "original_text": "1.3 “Affiliate” means any distributor or franchisee of HSWI or any company or other entity worldwide, including without limitation corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, and limited liability companies in which HSWI directly or indirectly holds at least a 19% ownership, equity, control or financial interest and which HSWI intends to enjoy any of HSWI’s rights hereunder. A list of Affiliates as of the Effective Date is attached hereto as Attachment A. Attachment A may be modified from time to time upon notice by HSWI to reflect a revised list of Affiliates and each modified Attachment A shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference.",

A list of Affiliates as of the Effective Date may be modified from time to time upon notice by HSWI to reflect a revised list of Affiliates.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'Attachment A is attached hereto as Attachment A and each modified Attachment A shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference,' the definition of 'Affiliate' becomes unclear. Other clauses, such as 2.1(vi) 'Affiliate Rights. All rights granted to HSWI under this Agreement may be exercised by or through HSWI and/or its Affiliates', now lack a concrete reference to determine who qualifies as an 'Affiliate,' creating ambiguity regarding the scope of rights.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'and identified in detail in Schedule A' from the definition of 'Affinity' creates a contradiction. Section 2.2 (i) states 'The Affinities will be organized into stand-alone articles around specific topics (each, an “Article”) according to the taxonomy set forth in Schedule A'. Without Schedule A referenced in the definition, it's unclear which subjects are agreed upon, and the basis for organizing articles lacks a clear reference, hindering proper categorization and potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "By removing the references to Sections 2.2(iii), 7.4 and 11.8 in the definition of 'Significant Breach', the contract now lacks specific context. Other clauses mentioning a 'Significant Breach' lack clarity because there's no defined basis to evaluate 'Encyclopedia' branding, use of the World Book Brand, and competitive assignments. This omission undermines enforcement, as the basis for defining a 'Significant Breach' is obscured. The contract contains ambiguities around specific clauses that would define it.",

The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period\ncommencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval\nof that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019.

                "explanation": "The specific quantity for MAOV and the detail about contract periods have been removed, however, the document still makes reference to 'Contract Period' in the last sentence. This lack of specific values introduces ambiguity regarding Premier's purchase obligations. MAOV is still referenced but no longer defined, causing internal contradiction. Also, the facility approval contingency is removed.",

These non-financial aspects of the original agreement is now uncertain.",

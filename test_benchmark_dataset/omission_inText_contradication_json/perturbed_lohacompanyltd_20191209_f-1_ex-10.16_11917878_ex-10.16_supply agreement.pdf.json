                "explanation": "By removing the specific percentage values of payments and the validity period of the Letter of Credit, the contract becomes ambiguous regarding the exact payment terms. Clause 12.1 and 12.2 are still referenced, but now the specific payment schedule linked to these clauses is undefined, making the enforcement of payment obligations uncertain.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause referencing the China Commodity Inspection Bureau and the specification that expenses are borne by the sellers, the claim process now lacks a defined standard and assignment of responsibility for expenses. This makes it harder to prove a claim and creates uncertainty about who pays for the resolution of defects, creating a significant contradiction and enforcement challenge.",

                "original_text": "“Interest Rate” means (a) with respect to a non-defaulting Party, a per annum rate of interest equal to USD 1M LIBOR as per the last\nfixing of the preceding month + 3.5 per cent pro anno (compounded monthly for each month or part thereof) and (b) with respect to a\nDefaulting Party, a per annum rate of interest equal to 5 % over the rate mentioned above in (a), provided, how- ever, that the rate set\nforth in (a) shall be adjusted by the Parties annually at the last meeting of the JDMB (as such term is defined in the Heads of Agreement\nentered into between the Parties as of January 10, 2020.",
                "changed_text": "“Interest Rate” means a rate to be determined at a later date. The JDMB will decide the exact rate.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides a specific formula based on USD 1M LIBOR. The modified text removes this formula and replaces it with a vague reference to a future determination by the JDMB. However, later sections (e.g., 3.3, 4.5) still refer to 'the Interest Rate' without acknowledging that its definition is now uncertain. This creates a contradiction because the contract depends on a specific, defined interest rate for calculations, but the definition is missing, leaving the enforcement of interest-related clauses ambiguous. The change to 'to be determined at a later date' creates uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'with automatic renewals each for a period of five (5) years (a “Renewal Term”) unless notice is given pursuant to 5.2.' the option for automatic renewal is taken away. This creates a contradiction, because the agreement is clear about a term date in 5.1 and a Termination Period in 5.2, but with the removal of automatic renewals, there's no clear path on how the termination would be handled past the first term date.",

                "explanation": "By removing '100,000 bbls/mo. +/- 10 % of a' removes the production capacity. This is a contradiction as the agreement later references quantities within the JSMA, but there is no clear quantity that Vertex should be able to provide. ",

Later clauses that rely on the detailed definition of 'Licensed Services' will become difficult to interpret and enforce. The modified text removes the Territory definition.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee’s own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this Agreement, and except as provided above, neither the Licensee nor any of its affiliates, owners, directors, officers, employees or agents shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivatives without the prior express written consent of the Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion.

                "explanation": "By removing 'in the Territory' and 'Licensed Services', the scope of the license becomes vague. This contradicts earlier clauses referencing Territory and Licensed Services.

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, all rights granted to the Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Mark shall cease, and the Licensee shall immediately delete the term “NMF” from its corporate name and shall discontinue all other use of the Licensed Mark. For twenty-four (24) months following termination of this Agreement, the Licensee shall specify on all public-facing materials in a prominent place and in prominent typeface that the Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with the Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by the Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'delete the term “NMF” from its corporate name and' creates an inconsistency. The Licensee is no longer allowed to use the mark, but there's no explicit instruction to remove it from its name. This could lead to confusion and potential continued association with the Licensor after termination. It also contradicts the intended effect of termination, which is a clean break from the Licensed Mark.",

                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.6 \"Licensed Mark\" means the stylized mark \"H\", as depicted in the USPTO Registration No. 5,283,875, attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\" and made a part hereof.",
                "changed_text": "1.6 \"Licensed Mark\" means a mark as the Licensor deems appropriate, used by the Licensee.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifically defines the Licensed Mark by referencing USPTO Registration No. 5,283,875 and Exhibit A. The modified text removes this specificity, leading to an inconsistent definition of the mark that lacks objective criteria. This creates ambiguity because while other sections might refer to enforcing rights related to the 'Licensed Mark,' it's no longer clear what constitutes that mark, because exhibit A is not attached.",

                "changed_text": "3.1 Either Party may terminate this Agreement with reasonable notice.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement provides a specific condition of termination: thirty (30) days' prior written notice. The modified version states 'reasonable notice,' but provides no clarity about what constitutes 'reasonable'. This omission creates uncertainty in enforcement, especially given the later reference to termination consequences in section 3.3.",

Licensed Users, at Licensed Users' own expense, shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Licensor, its affiliates, successors and assigns, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, against any claim, demand, cause of action, debt, expense or liability (including attorneys' fees and costs), to the extent that the foregoing (a) is based on a claim resulting solely from any service provided or offered by Licensed Users, (b) results from a material breach, or is based on a claim that, if true, would be a material breach, of this Agreement by Licensed Users, or (c) is based upon Licensed Users' unauthorized or improper use of the Licensed Mark.",
                "changed_text": "4.1 Indemnification. Licensed Users shall indemnify Licensor against claims arising from gross negligence.",
                "explanation": "The original text specified distinct conditions under which indemnification applies (a, b, c). The modified version replaces these with the broader term 'gross negligence' and removes 'Licensed Users' own expense' and attorney's fees. This change narrows the scope of indemnification and introduces ambiguity in determining when it applies, contradicting the original broader intention. This creates potential conflict because the agreement could be interpreted to require indemnification for far fewer scenarios than intended originally.",

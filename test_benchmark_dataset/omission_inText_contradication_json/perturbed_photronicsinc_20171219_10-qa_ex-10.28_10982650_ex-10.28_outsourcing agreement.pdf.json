Those terms and conditions of the [***]may be discussed and agreed between the Company and any of the Suppliers prior to issuance of such [***]to any of the [***].",

The Parties agree that the [***]submitted by the Company to any of the [***] will be based on prevailing market conditions. The specific terms and conditions may be discussed and agreed between the Company and any of the Suppliers prior to issuance of such [***]to any of the [***].",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates purchase order terms to mirror end customer requirements. By removing this requirement and replacing it with 'subject to negotiation and mutual agreement' and 'based on prevailing market conditions', it introduces a contradiction. Article 2.3 states that the purchase orders submitted by the company will mirror the terms and conditions of the purchase order, with respect to specification for the product and the end customer's requirement. This change means there is no defined, clear approach for these agreements.",

The Suppliers shall notify the Company of acceptance or rejection of a [***]within [***]hours of receipt of a [***]. Failure of the Suppliers to accept or reject a [***]within [***]hours shall constitute acceptance of such [***]. The lead time for the Products will be as set forth in the applicable [***]. Each [***]shall include the following: (a) the Company’s [***]number; (b) identification of the quantity and type of the Product ordered by the Company; (c) the price of each Product ordered per Schedule 2 attached hereto; (d) the requested delivery date (subject to the applicable Product Lead Time); (e) any shipping instructions, including preferred carrier and shipping destination; and (f) the specifications for the Product.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'good faith efforts', 'all relevant specifications', a strict timeframe for acceptance/rejection of purchase orders, and detailed requirements for what each purchase order includes, along with a reference to Schedule 2 for pricing. The modified text omits the 'good faith' requirement, removes the reference to Schedule 2 for pricing, removes any references to timeframes for the purchase orders, and removes any reference to adhering to relevant specifications of the Product. This directly contradicts the implication that the suppliers must accept all orders that comply with this agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a specific procedure for purchase order allocation based on several factors, including attempting to adhere to the ratios set forth in Section 2.1. The modified text removes the core allocation criteria and grants the Company 'sole discretion' in allocating orders. This contradicts Section 2.1, which mandates an outsource model based on [***]. This creates uncertainty about order distribution and performance metrics.",

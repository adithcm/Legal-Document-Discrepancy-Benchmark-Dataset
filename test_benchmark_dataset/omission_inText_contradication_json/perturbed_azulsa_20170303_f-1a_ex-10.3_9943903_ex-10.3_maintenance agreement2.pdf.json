CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n4.1 Confidentiality obligations  \nUnless otherwise provided in this Amendment, any Confidential Information released by either of the Parties (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other Party (the “Receiving Party”) shall not be released in whole or in part to any third party.\nIn particular, the Receiving Party undertakes:\n\n-to keep the Confidential Information strictly confidential, not to deliver, disclose or publish it to any third party including subsidiary companies and companies having an interest in its capital, except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Disclosing Party;\n\n\n-to use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of this Amendment and except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the Disclosing Party, not to use the same or permit its use for any other purpose;\n\n\n-to disclose the Confidential Information only to those of its direct employees having a need to know such Confidential Information in order to make permitted use thereof, after having beforehand clearly informed such employees of the strictly confidential nature of the Confidential Information and caused them to observe said conditions of confidentiality. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for the correct performance of said obligations of confidentiality by its employees and shall keep up to date the list of its personnel, to whom Confidential Information is communicated, which list shall be made available to the Disclosing Party at its request;\n\n\n-not to duplicate the Confidential Information nor to copy or reproduce the same beyond the purpose of the Amendment;\n\n\n-not to disclose Confidential Information to any third party, unless such third party is acting at the instruction of the Receiving Party and such disclosure is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of the Amendment, provided however, that prior to any such disclosure both of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n\n(i)each of such third parties, shall have signed an acknowledgement to keep such Confidential Information as strictly confidential;\nand,\n\n\n(ii)the Receiving Party shall have obtained written prior approval of the Disclosing Party of such proposed disclosure, which\napproval may be not unreasonably withheld or delayed.",

                "explanation": "By generalizing confidentiality obligations, the detailed procedures and requirements for handling and disclosing confidential information have been omitted. This omission introduces ambiguity because the original section outlines specific actions and approvals needed before disclosure to third parties or employees. The edited clause introduces uncertainty and could lead to disputes over what constitutes 'confidential,' 'appropriate,' or 'necessary' disclosure, since the earlier definitions are now vague and potentially unenforceable. It could also contradict Clause 4.5, which states affiliates are not considered third parties, as this is not longer explicitly mentioned. The prior approval is no longer needed creating ambiguity.",

The Parties shall make their reasonable endeavours to settle the Dispute amicably by a committee composed of one (1) management representative of each Party (the “Representatives”). Such committee shall be created by the Parties within [*****] from the date of receipt of the Notice of Dispute.\n\n\n5.2.1 Subject to sub-Clause 5.2.5 below and in the event the Representatives (i) fail to create such committee or (ii) do not agree on an amicable settlement within [*****] from the date the committee referred to in this sub-Clause 5.2 has been created or such longer period as may be agreed upon in writing by the Representatives (the “Amicable Settlement Period”), the Dispute shall be exclusively and finally settled under the Rules and Conciliation of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICC”) by an arbitral tribunal composed of three (3) arbitrators; each Party shall then appoint one (1) arbitrator within [*****]from the last day of the Amicable Settlement Period and the third arbitrator, who will act as President, will be appointed by the other two (2)\narbitrators.

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a structured arbitration process under ICC rules, including timelines for committee formation and arbitrator appointment. By changing the text, the obligation to follow ICC rules and the detailed process for appointing arbitrators is removed. This creates uncertainty because the contract now lacks a clear mechanism for resolving disputes beyond 'methods deemed appropriate,' making enforcement ambiguous and potentially conflicting with the intention of binding arbitration initially agreed upon. Furthermore, removing explicit timeframes and arbitral rules introduces ambiguity, potentially conflicting with other sections relying on a specific dispute resolution framework.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit disclaimer of license or proprietary interest, and the detailed list of items considered intellectual property, this revision introduces ambiguity about the specific rights retained by the Disclosing Party and the Repairer. The phrase 'shall retain ownership of intellectual property' is far less specific than the original, potentially creating uncertainty in determining the scope of intellectual property rights and what constitutes infringement or unauthorized use. This omission could lead to disputes over whether specific information or processes are protected under intellectual property law, especially given the deletion of the list of items. It could also contradict Clause 4.5 if the scope of intellectual property is not well defined and affiliates' access to this information is restricted.",

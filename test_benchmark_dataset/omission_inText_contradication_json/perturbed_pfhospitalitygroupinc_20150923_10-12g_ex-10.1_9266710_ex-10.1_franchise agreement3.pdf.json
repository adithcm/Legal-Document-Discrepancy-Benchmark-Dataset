                "original_text": "As used in this Agreement, the term “Post-Term Period” shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of two (2) years from the date of: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement (regardless of the cause for termination); (c) termination of Member’s employment with Franchisee; and/or (d) a final order of a duly authorized arbitrator, panel of arbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been taken) with respect to any of the foregoing or with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement; either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or entity).",
                "changed_text": "As used in this Agreement, the term “Post-Term Period” shall mean a continuous period from the date of: (a) a transfer permitted under the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement; (c) termination of Member’s employment with Franchisee. Either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or entity).",
                "explanation": "By removing the specified duration and the mention of Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement, we have removed clarity on the length and triggers of the post-term non-compete obligations. It introduces ambiguity as the 'continuous period' is undefined and Section 14 can no longer be properly referenced, potentially weakening the enforceability of the non-compete clause. The omission creates uncertainty about the actual duration and specific events triggering the Post-Term Period.",

Member shall not, during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose other than the operation of the Franchised Business, any confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how which may be communicated to Member or which Member may learn by virtue of Member’s relationship with Franchisee. All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (“Confidential Information”) is deemed confidential, except for information that Member can demonstrate came to Member’s attention by lawful means prior to disclosure to Member; or which, at the time of the disclosure to Member, had become a part of the public domain.",

All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (“Confidential Information”) is deemed confidential.",
                "explanation": "By removing the exception for information that was already publicly known or lawfully obtained prior to disclosure, the definition of 'Confidential Information' becomes overly broad. It implies that even publicly available knowledge is protected, creating a contradiction if the agreement later refers to only legitimately confidential data being protected. This broadens the scope in a way that contradicts common legal understandings of confidentiality, making enforceability questionable.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'irreparable' and 'reasonable attorney's fees', we remove a requirement for a certain threshold of harm. 'Irreparable injury' is a legal standard often required to justify injunctive relief. By removing this, the burden of proof for Franchisor is potentially lowered, which, without further context, creates a contradiction if other clauses imply that significant harm needs to be demonstrated for specific remedies. Removing 'reasonable attorney's fees' causes additional uncertainty, as most attorney fees are awarded based on reasonableness.",

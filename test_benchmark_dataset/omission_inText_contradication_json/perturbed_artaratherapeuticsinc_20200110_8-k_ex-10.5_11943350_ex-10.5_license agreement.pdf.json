                "explanation": "By removing \"and any similar products\" from the definition of 'Product,' later references to royalties on 'Product' become ambiguous. If ArTara develops a slightly modified version of TARA-002, it's unclear if royalties apply, potentially leading to disputes. This creates uncertainty in enforcement of royalty obligations.",

The University and ArTara each agree to treat matters of authorship of the Publication in a proper collaborative spirit and following guidelines and policies in accordance with the University of Iowa’s Operations Manual which may be found at: https://opsmanual.uiowa.edu/.\nIt is anticipated that employees of the University will be first and senior authors on the Publication, but it is understood that final authorship will be determined in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations in publication practice, including Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act a/k/a Sunshine Act and with ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) guidelines, standard scientific practice and journal guidelines.\nUniversity and/or Principal Investigator shall provide ArTara with a copy of any proposed Publication for review and comment at least […***…] prior to submission thereof for publication. ArTara shall have […***…], after receipt of said copy to object to such proposed Publication because there is Confidential Information which needs protection. In the event that ArTara makes such objection, University and/or Principal Investigator shall refrain from submitting such Publication for a maximum of […***…] from date of receipt of such objection in order for ArTara to file patent application(s) directed to patentable subject matter contained in the proposed Publication. If in its review, ArTara identifies information it considers to be its Confidential Information, ArTara may require redaction of that Confidential Information; provided, however, that ArTara shall not require removal of information necessary for complete and accurate presentation and interpretation of the Program Data and results.

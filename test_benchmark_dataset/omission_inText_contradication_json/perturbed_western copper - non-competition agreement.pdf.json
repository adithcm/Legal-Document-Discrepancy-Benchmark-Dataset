                "changed_text": "Affiliate means, in respect of a party hereto, an entity with some form of business connection.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' provided a specific, legal definition based on subsidiary relationships and control. The modified definition is vague, replacing clear criteria with the ambiguous 'some form of business connection'. This creates uncertainty about the scope of the agreement's applicability to related entities. Later sections of the contract may imply the original scope, creating contradiction when enforcing clauses related to affiliates.",

                "changed_text": "Area of Non-Competition will be determined by mutual agreement of the parties, and will take into consideration all active locations where Western Silver holds legal interests.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Area of Non-Competition' was precise, geographically defining the restricted area. The modified definition introduces ambiguity by stating the area will be determined by mutual agreement and using the vague term 'active locations'. If a later section references the Area of Non-Competition without acknowledging this modification, or assumes the original geographical definition, it creates a contradiction about how the non-competition clause is enforced.",

                "changed_text": "Designated Mineral Property means any property either party deems as worthy of being legally protected under the terms of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Designated Mineral Property' clearly specified the properties to which the right of first offer applied. The modified definition introduces an element of subjectivity by stating that 'any property either party deems as worthy of being legally protected' could be covered. If a later section refers back to this term in the context of the original definition, it creates contradiction, making enforcement of the right of first offer uncertain.",

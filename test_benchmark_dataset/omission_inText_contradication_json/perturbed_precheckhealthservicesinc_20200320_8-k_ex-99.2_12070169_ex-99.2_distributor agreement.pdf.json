The Products are described on Exhibit A to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Principal appoints the Distributor as a non-exclusive distributor, to sell Principal’s products (the “Products”).",
                "explanation": "By removing the list of products and the reference to Exhibit A, but keeping the term 'Products' defined, the contract creates uncertainty. Other sections referring to 'Products' (e.g., pricing, discounts) become vague, since there's no definitive list. Also, removing 'qPCR infectious disease kits, Logix Smart COVID-19 PCR diagnostic test and Co-Dx Box™ instrument' creates ambiguity as to what products the distributor has rights to sell.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'based on the Products and Prices' along with 'The proposed discount is expected to be ¨%', the contract introduces uncertainty regarding discount calculation. Section 1 defines the products covered by this contract. The discount percentage is not set, leading to possible disputes. The contract references discounts, but it removes specific details about the discount values, creating a lack of clarity and creating an internal contradiction.",

                "changed_text": "The Principal grants Distributor non- exclusive rights to sell these products within the countries of Romania (the “Territory”).",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'which may be amended by mutual written agreement' introduces rigidity to the territory defined. If other parts of the contract assume the possibility of territory amendments through mutual written agreement, they will now conflict with this section, potentially creating disputes. The reference to territory remains, but the defined process of changing it is omitted.",

                "original_text": "The Parties hereby agree to remove Schedule C-1 in its entirety and replace it with the following:\nSchedule C-1. The following is attached to an incorporated into the Agreement as Schedule C-1:\nSchedule C-1([***])",
                "changed_text": "The Parties hereby agree to remove Schedule C-1 in its entirety.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause that replaced Schedule C-1, the agreement now states that Schedule C-1 is removed, but doesn't specify what it's replaced with. Later sections of the original agreement may still reference Schedule C-1, creating an inconsistency as the replacement isn't defined, leading to enforcement uncertainty if those sections relying on the undefined replacement are triggered.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'covenants', the contract introduces ambiguity. If any subsequent clause relies on a covenant within the original agreement, its enforceability is now uncertain. The remaining 'terms and conditions' might be interpreted differently without the specific inclusion of 'covenants,' potentially affecting the overall execution of the contract.",

                "explanation": "Removing the titles introduces uncertainty regarding the signatories' authority to bind their respective companies to the agreement. Although signatures are present, the missing titles may allow a party to later argue that the signatory lacked the necessary authority, especially if internal bylaws require specific titles for contract execution. This can be a basis to question the validity of the agreement.",

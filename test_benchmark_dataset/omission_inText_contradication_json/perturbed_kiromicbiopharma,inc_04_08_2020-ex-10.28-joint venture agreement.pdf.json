The specific discipline relating to the management of rights in co-ownership is at the sole discretion of Kiromic. Molipharma may always use the Results for teaching and research purposes.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specification of equal shares (50% for each Party) and stating the management of rights is at the sole discretion of Kiromic, it contradicts the initial statement of joint ownership. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as the original text implies a negotiated agreement, while the modified text gives unilateral control to Kiromic.",

                "explanation": "By removing the Molipharma royalty structure, the agreement creates a contradiction. The original states specific royalties will be given to Molipharma from the Oncology project, while removing the entire section, and restating the \"rest of the world\" will be 'determined at a later date', makes the original commercial arrangement uncertain. The removal creates ambiguity around if Molipharma receives any economic considerations.",

                "explanation": "By removing failure of each Party to comply with its obligations, including the economic commitments, creates an in-text contradiction. Later clauses still reference the expenses for the supply of equipment and materials. Thus, the contract would still reference cost allocations, but now failure of economic commitments cannot cause termination.",

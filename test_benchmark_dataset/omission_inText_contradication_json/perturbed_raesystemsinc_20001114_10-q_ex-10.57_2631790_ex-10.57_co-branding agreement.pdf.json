DEFINITIONS\n     1.1     \"Spinrecords.com Brand Features\" means the SpinRecords.com name and\nlogo  and  other  trademarks,  trade  names  and service names including but not\nlimited  to those set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein\n                               ---------\nby  reference  and  all  Intellectual  Property  Rights  related  thereto.\nSpinRecords.com  Brand  Features  shall include any derivatives, improvements or\nmodifications  thereto  or  thereof and any Intellectual Property rights related\nthereto.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'logo and other trademarks, trade names and service names including but not limited to those set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference and all Intellectual Property Rights related thereto' from the definition of \"Spinrecords.com Brand Features\", the contract now lacks a clear, comprehensive definition of what constitutes these features. This is further exacerbated by removing the reference to Exhibit A which is where the specific brand features are outlined. If later sections rely on a complete understanding of 'Spinrecords.com Brand Features' for co-branding or licensing, enforcement becomes uncertain. This introduces an internal contradiction because the contract operates on the assumption that both parties understand the scope of SpinRecords.com Brand Features, but now this scope is vaguely defined.",

                "explanation": "By altering the definition of \"Statement of Work\" and removing the connection to Exhibit C, later references to the Statement of Work become ambiguous. Clauses referencing specific activities outlined in the original Exhibit C now lack a concrete basis. This creates a contradiction because the contract implies that a detailed Statement of Work exists but the actual definition suggests it is merely an agreement of general tasks.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"in the manner set forth in the Statement of Work\" to \"a mutually agreed upon sum\", the original agreement to compensate based on guidelines in the Statement of Work is removed. Because earlier, Statement of Work was modified, this clause now contradicts the original intent of detailed, structured payments. This creates uncertainty in future disputes over payment amounts, as the means of determining those amounts is now undefined.",

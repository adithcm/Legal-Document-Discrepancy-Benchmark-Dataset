                "original_text": "A. “Celebrity Endorsement” shall mean the right to use, subject to the provisions hereof, CELEBRITY’s name (including variations and derivations of the same), nickname, initials, autograph, voice, video or film portrayals, facsimile signature, photograph, trade name, likeness and image or facsimile image, or means of endorsement (not including video) (individually and collectively, the “Personality Rights”), in each case, solely as Approved (as hereinafter defined) by ABG, in connection with the advertising, promotion and sale of Products.",
                "changed_text": "A. “Celebrity Endorsement” shall mean the right to use CELEBRITY’s likeness and image in connection with the advertising, promotion and sale of Products.",
                "explanation": "By removing the detailed list of what constitutes 'Celebrity Endorsement' and 'Personality Rights' (name, autograph, voice, etc.), but continuing to reference those broader terms later in the agreement, there's now a contradiction. The definition is limited, but later sections assume a broader scope creating potential disputes regarding usage rights.",

For purposes of this Agreement, “Approval” (and all grammatical variations thereof, e.g., Approve, Approved, etc.) shall be defined as ABG’s prior written approval, which may be given or withheld in ABG’s sole discretion. ABG has the right to Approve all uses of the Celebrity Endorsement and the Personality Rights, whether by PAPA JOHN’S or any of its approved designees (including, without limitation, the use of the Personality Rights in connection with any and all Products and Materials. PAPA JOHN’S hereby agrees that: (A) no Materials may be released or exhibited publicly, in any manner, unless and until ABG has Approved the same, (B) all Materials must be re-submitted for Approval each time a revision is made incorporating any changes, and (C) ABG’S Approval of Materials hereunder is specifically limited to Approval of the use of the Personality Rights contained therein, and that to the extent any materials owned by third parties (e.g., logos, locations, individuals, music, etc.) (“Third-Party Materials”) are incorporated therein, PAPA JOHN’S shall be solely responsible for identifying such Third-Party Materials, and for obtaining an appropriate license from the owner(s) of such Third-Party Materials to secure all applicable rights to use and otherwise exploit such Third-Party Materials.",
                "changed_text": "D. Approval Standard. For purposes of this Agreement, “Approval” shall mean that PAPA JOHN’S must notify ABG of all Celebrity Endorsement usage.",
                "explanation": "By changing the definition of 'Approval' from requiring ABG's prior written consent to simply requiring notification, but still referencing 'Approval' in sections that imply prior consent (e.g., regarding material release), there is an in-text contradiction. The modification makes it unclear whether ABG can actually reject any material, which contradicts the purpose of earlier agreement sections.",

In addition to and separate from the Cash Payment and any other compensation payable to ABG (and, as applicable, CELEBRITY) hereunder, for purposes of this Agreement, forty percent (40%) of the Cash Payment shall be allocated to union-covered services. If PAPA JOHN’S engages any performance or service of CELEBRITY hereunder in any way that is subject to the jurisdiction of any applicable union, guild or other organization of which CELEBRITY is a member (including, without limitation, SAG-AFTRA), either during or after the Term, then PAPA JOHN’S shall pay, as required by such union, guild or other organization, all minimum (and other, as applicable) payments or fees (or for SAG-AFTRA, minimum pension and welfare contributions) required to be made with respect to PAPA JOHN’S use of the Services hereunder (“Union Fee(s)”). PAPA JOHN’S shall be solely responsible for all Union Fee(s) and any costs and/or fees associated with making any and all payments to ABG as required under this Agreement, including, without limitation, wire transfer fees (“Other Fees”). In no event shall ABG or CELEBRITY be responsible for any Union Fees or Other Fees that may arise out of this Agreement. Upon PAPA JOHN’S reasonable request, and subject to CELEBRITY’s and ABG’s prior consultation with counsel of their own choosing, ABG shall work together in good faith with CELEBRITY and PAPA JOHN’S to have CELEBRITY sign a Screen Actors Guild contract for each session for tracking purposes.",

PAPA JOHN’S shall be solely responsible for any costs and/or fees associated with making any and all payments to ABG as required under this Agreement, including, without limitation, wire transfer fees (“Other Fees”). In no event shall ABG or CELEBRITY be responsible for any Other Fees that may arise out of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing all mention of Union Fees and SAG-AFTRA obligations, while keeping the section regarding 'Other Fees', the contract now implies that only 'Other Fees' exist. However, the allocation of 40% of the Cash Payment to union-covered services elsewhere in the document creates an ambiguity: is PAPA JOHN'S still responsible for these payments, even if the mechanism to calculate them is now unclear? This creates uncertainty and potential for dispute.",

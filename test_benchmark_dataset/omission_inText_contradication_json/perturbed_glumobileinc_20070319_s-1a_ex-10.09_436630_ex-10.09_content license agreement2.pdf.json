                "explanation": "Removing the specific reference to Paragraph 15(c) and the Guarantee amount creates ambiguity. Later sections referencing the 'Guarantee Forfeiture Payment' will be unclear about its initial value or the conditions initially established, creating an internal contradiction.",

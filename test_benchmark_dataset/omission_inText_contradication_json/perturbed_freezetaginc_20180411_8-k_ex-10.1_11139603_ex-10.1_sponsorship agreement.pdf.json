                "explanation": "By removing the specific insurance coverage amounts, the contract becomes ambiguous. While it still mandates insurance, the lack of defined amounts creates uncertainty and makes it difficult to enforce the insurance requirement, as the 'appropriate' coverage is no longer clear. Later sections referencing the insurance obligation now lack a concrete definition.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Licensor *is* the owner of the Brand. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating the Licensor *asserts* rights, which doesn't guarantee ownership. This contradicts later sections which assume Licensor's ownership for enforcement and indemnity purposes.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates *prior written approval* for any use of the Brand. The modified text changes this requirement to a non-binding suggestion to consult 'where feasible.' This directly contradicts the quality control measures implied throughout Section 3 and introduces ambiguity regarding who bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the Brand's integrity.",

                "original_text": "Section 4.4. Termination of Advisory Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate automatically without notice and immediately (a) if MS Capital Partners Adviser Inc. or another affiliate of Licensor is no longer acting as the investment adviser (any such entity, the “Advisor”) to Licensee under the Investment Advisory Agreement, dated as of [·], 201[9] (as the same may be amended, modified or otherwise restated, the “Investment Advisory Agreement”), or a similar agreement, or (b) the Advisor is no longer an affiliate of Licensor. Further, Licensor may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice, at any time after 30 days from the date that Licensee notifies Licensor that the Investment Advisory Agreement has terminated or is not being renewed. The term “affiliate” as used herein shall have the meaning given to such term in the Investment Advisory Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Section 4.4. This Agreement may be terminated if deemed necessary by Licensor or Licensee.",
                "explanation": "The original Section 4.4 outlines specific conditions under which the agreement terminates automatically or upon notice, tied directly to the Investment Advisory Agreement. The modified version is extremely vague and removes all specifics, essentially granting both parties arbitrary termination rights. This contradicts the purpose of having defined termination clauses and introduces uncertainty about the stability of the trademark license, and related obligations, particularly in regards to winding down use of the brand effectively.",

                "original_text": "Company desires to appoint Distributor as its exclusive distributor of the Products to all Clients that Distributor introduce, and upon confirmed the first order, this client come to be exclusive of Distributor, every new customer introduced by Distributor, must be approved by the company prior to any sale. After official approval from the Company, the customer introduced by Distributor, will appear on an official list in this contract, and will only be met by the Distributor and will follow the rules of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Company desires to appoint Distributor as its exclusive distributor of the Products to Clients that Distributor introduces, subject to Company’s final determination.",
                "explanation": "The original clause detailed a process for customer exclusivity: distributor introduces a customer, company approves, customer appears on an official list, and the distributor gains exclusive rights to that customer. The changed text removes the guaranteed exclusivity and the explicit approval process by stating it's subject to 'Company's final determination'. This creates an internal contradiction if later sections assume the distributor has automatic exclusivity after introducing a client or relies on an \"official list\" that may never exist, since the company can override this.",

Company agrees to sell, and Distributor agrees to purchase, the Products in accordance with the Prices and Volume Discount Prices set forth in Schedule A. Such Prices and Volume Discount Prices shall only be subject to increase once per year on each anniversary date of this Agreement, provided (i) Company provides Distributor with at least Ninety (90) days prior written notice of any such increase, and (ii) such increase does not exceed 5% of the preceding year’s Prices, except for reasons of force majeure, (Chapter 10), and Volume Discount Prices nor the lowest price charged to others for the same Product. Any such change shall not apply for any order(s) accepted prior to the effective date of the increase.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Prices and Shipment. Company agrees to sell, and Distributor agrees to purchase, the Products in accordance with the Prices set forth in Schedule A. Prices are subject to change at any time at Company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text limits price increases to once per year and caps it at 5%. The changed text removes the volume discount prices and allows for unlimited price increases at any time. This omission directly contradicts references to the previous price and volume restrictions. If other sections refer back to the original pricing structure or rely on a stable price for calculating profits or obligations, this change introduces serious uncertainty.",

Upon Customer’s acceptance of any order, Distributor shall submit to Customer via wire transfer at least Twenty-Five Percent (25%) of the total order price. Distributor shall submit to Customer via wire transfer the remaining balance upon receipt Packing List and Bill of landing documents, from origin in Brazil Farm.",
                "changed_text": "(e) Payment. Payment terms will be determined on a per-order basis.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a clear payment schedule: 25% upfront and the remaining balance upon receipt of shipping documents. The changed text removes this fixed schedule. This omission contradicts any implicit assumptions of the prior payment schedule in other clauses (e.g., clauses dealing with order fulfillment timelines or remedies for non-payment based on the assumption of a 25% deposit). This will create confusion regarding the payment expectations of both parties.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Board' is changed to 'advisory committee', however, subsequent sections still refer to the 'Board' as if it has the powers of a board of directors, creating a contradiction about its actual authority and purpose.",

                "explanation": "Section 4.7 previously required unanimous Board approval for significant actions. This change weakens it to mere notification to the 'Advisory Committee'. However, later references to the 'Board' continue to imply decision-making authority, creating a contradiction regarding whether the Advisory Committee has the power to approve or merely needs to be informed.",

                "explanation": "Originally, Section 3.3.1 mandated strict adherence to a jointly prepared Business Plan approved by the Board. The revised text introduces ambiguity by stating 'general alignment' and removing the Board's approval authority, giving it to 'company's officers'. However, references to the 'Business Plan' in other sections still imply a binding document requiring Board-level agreement, causing an inconsistency.",

                "explanation": "By removing the line about compliance with the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, we obfuscate the distributor's obligation to adhere to consumer protection laws regarding warranties, making it harder to enforce those protections.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly reminds the distributor of insider trading prohibitions. The modified clause weakens this reminder, stating only that securities laws 'may pertain' and removes acknowledgement of understanding legal responsibilities. This reduces clarity and enforceability of insider trading rules.",

                "explanation": "The alteration replaces a specific jurisdiction (Illinois) with a vague reference to 'laws determined at the company's discretion.' This introduces ambiguity and allows the company to potentially choose laws that are favorable to them in case of a dispute, making the governing law clause difficult to enforce and creating a contradiction with standard legal practices.",

The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other, except to the extent that she or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",

The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned.

                "explanation": "By moving the part of the agreement, to the second part it and re-writing it introduces a contradiction. The original text clearly states that the filing is in accordance with Rule 13d-1(k), but the changed text introduces ambiguity by stating that it isn't mandatory. This could lead to legal challenges regarding the validity of the filing.",

                "original_text": "d.Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the termination of the JV Agreement with respect to VNBJ, VNBZ or the Veoneer Parties shall not release any Veoneer Party or any Nissin Party from liability for the breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the JV Agreement that arise prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable.",
                "changed_text": "d.Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the termination of the JV Agreement with respect to VNBJ, VNBZ or the Veoneer Parties shall not release any Veoneer Party or any Nissin Party from liability for the breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the JV Agreement that arise prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable. Any disputes arising under this agreement shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of the Nissin Party involved in the dispute, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.",
                "explanation": "By appending the governing law provision to a clause concerning liability release upon termination, its significance is obscured. Governing law should typically be a standalone clause, not buried within termination clauses. This reduces its prominence and clarity.",

                "explanation": "Replaced the original clause with a statement about \"mutual understanding and good faith\" which is not a recognized legal framework for governing contracts, this clause makes it very difficult to enforce since it does not specify which laws would apply.",

If any provision of this agreement is found to be unenforceable, it shall be severed from the agreement, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. However, the parties agree that the severability shall be determined at the sole discretion of Veoneer AB.",
                "explanation": "A standard severability clause is appended, but with the added condition that severability is at the 'sole discretion of Veoneer AB.' This creates an imbalance and questions the enforceability of the entire severability clause. In most jurisdictions, severability is determined by the court, not a single party.",

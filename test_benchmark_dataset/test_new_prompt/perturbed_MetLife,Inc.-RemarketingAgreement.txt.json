                "original_text": "15. GOVERNING LAW. THIS REMARKETING AGREEMENT AND THE PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.",

THIS REMARKETING AGREEMENT AND THE PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.",
                "explanation": "The governing law clause has been changed from New York to Delaware. This change introduces a legal contradiction because, in general, contracts related to financial transactions are expected to be governed by New York law, especially when significant business is conducted in New York. Delaware law might be suitable given that the Company is incorporated there, but placing that in Governing law is to make the contract difficult to interpret.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a condition that allows the CEO of MetLife to overrule the judgment of the Remarketing Agents in determining whether a downgrading event makes proceeding with the remarketing impracticable. This could be seen as an unenforceable condition, as it allows for a subjective overruling of an event that is supposed to protect investors, making it harder to enforce the condition.",

                "explanation": "This change adds the decision to a literal bear fight. This renders this part of the contract unenforceable, and would be viewed as absurd. Furthermore, this would bring into question the state of mind when creating the contract.",

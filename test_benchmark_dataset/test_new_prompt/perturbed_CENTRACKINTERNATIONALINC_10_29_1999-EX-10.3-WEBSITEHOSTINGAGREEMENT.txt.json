The parties understand that work i-on does in the development and maintenance of Web content and applications for Centrack International is governed by separate agreement(s).\n\nThe Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless i-on, against any lawsuits, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) to which i-on may become subject related to or arising out of Customer's use of i-on's services, and will reimburse i-on for all legal and other expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in connection with investigating, defending, or settling any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action, or proceeding whether or not in connection with pending or threatened litigation in which i-on is a party.

                "explanation": "The removal of 'It is mandatory that' introduces ambiguity regarding the mandatory nature of the jurisdiction and venue clause, weakening its enforceability. Original clause stated that it is mandatory that any claim arising out of the breach will be subject to Texas Law, and removing 'it is mandatory that' will make that term not clearly defined, making it difficult to interpret.",

                "explanation": "Changing the applicable law from Kansas to Delaware could affect the interpretation and enforcement of the contract, as Delaware law may have different precedents and statutes relevant to contract disputes. This introduces uncertainty about which jurisdiction's laws will govern the agreement.",

ARBITRATION\n\nIn the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Venue shall be Kansas. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction.",

SIGNIFICANCE OF HEADINGS\n\nSection headings contained herein are solely for the purpose of aiding in speedy location of subject matter and are not in any sense to be given weight in the construction of this Agreement. Accordingly, in case of any question with respect to the construction of this Agreement, it is to be construed as though such section headings had been omitted.\n\n33.  ARBITRATION\n\nIn the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a single person arbitrator (who shall be a paralegal), in a decision required. If the parties cannot agree upon the arbitrator, then each party may pick a paralegal and the two chosen paralegals shall choose the arbitrator. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. Venue shall be China. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be subject to appeal and not final, binding nor conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of incompetent jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause to the 'Significance of Headings' section makes it less prominent and harder to find. Changing the arbitration from a panel of three lawyers to a single paralegal arbitrator, changing the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association to International Chamber of Commerce, changing the venue to China, and removing the finality of the arbitration decision significantly alters the dispute resolution process, contradicting standard arbitration practices and potentially making the clause unenforceable. These changes affect the fairness and predictability of dispute resolution.",

Therefore, both parties agree not to disclose the terms of this Agreement, without the permission of the other party, to any third party other than to CONSULTANT'S business, legal and financial advisors, and with respect to all such advisors, CONSULTANT shall take all reasonable steps to ensure such confidentiality to ADAMS GOLF. Furthermore, CONSULTANT recognizes that during the course of performing his duties hereunder he may become aware of proprietary, confidential information concerning ADAMS GOLF, its PRODUCT, methods, processes, billing practices, financial condition, etc., or information ADAMS GOLF designates as confidential (collectively \"Confidential Information\").

                "explanation": "Adding \"Unless required by law or regulation\" to the confidentiality clause creates a large loophole that can easily be abused. Also adding, \"This provision shall survive termination of this agreement indefinitely\", could make the terms difficult to enforce. Further, adding \"In the event of disclosure is required by law or regulation, CONSULTANT shall notify ADAMS GOLF immediately.\" adds another contradictory term as it does not state whether ADAMS GOLF has the right to decline that request, which if the third party is already aware, makes it more difficult to enforce.",

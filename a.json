        "section": "4.2 Newegg shall provide to Allied the Sponsorship Benefits set out in Schedule 3, including paying the Sponsorship Fee as provided in that Schedule. Any value-added, goods and services, or similar tax or duty imposed by any government or tax authority on any Sponsorship Benefit shall be borne solely by Allied. Newegg has 60 days from the invoice date to remit payment.",
        "explanation": "The sentence Newegg has 60 days from the invoice date to remit payment lacks clarity regarding when the invoice is issued. It does not specify a timeframe of when the invoice should be issued after the Sponsorship Benefits have been given. This could lead to confusion and payment delays if Allied delays issuing invoices.",

        "section": "5.1 Allied grants Newegg a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-transferable, and non- sublicensable worldwide license to use, publicly display, transmit, broadcast, stream, distribute and reproduce the Allied Marks in all approved forms and in manners for the purposes of this Agreement during the Term.",
        "explanation": "The phrase in all approved forms and in manners for the purposes of this Agreement during the Term is vague. It does not specify who approves the 'forms' and 'manners.' This ambiguity could lead to disputes over the permitted uses of the Allied Marks.",

        "section": "6.1 Newegg grants Allied a revocable, non-transferrable, non-assignable (whether voluntarily, or as a result of a change of control, or by operation of law), non-sublicensable, non-exclusive and limited license to use, during the Term, the Newegg Marks solely in connection with Allied\u2019s marketing and conduct of the Arena.",
        "explanation": "The term limited license is used but the limits of the license are not explicitly defined. This creates ambiguity regarding the scope of Allied's permitted use of the Newegg Marks. While later sections elaborate on usage restrictions, the initial granting clause lacks specific parameters, potentially leading to disagreements.",

        "explanation": "The phrase where possible and appropriate and where reasonably practicable are subjective and create ambiguity. It is unclear who determines what is 'possible,' 'appropriate,' and 'reasonably practicable.' This vagueness could allow Allied to avoid actively promoting Newegg's exclusive sponsorship.",

        "section": "8.1 Without limitation of other rights of Newegg under this Agreement, the Parties agree to negotiate a reasonable reduction and, where applicable, the refund of the Sponsorship Fee to reflect any material restriction in the benefit or value of the Sponsorship Rights to Newegg, including as a result of any change in any laws or regulatory provisions which has an adverse impact on the value of the Sponsorship Rights.",
        "explanation": "The term reasonable reduction is subjective and undefined. There is no objective standard or formula provided to determine what constitutes a 'reasonable reduction' of the Sponsorship Fee. This ambiguity could lead to disputes during negotiations.",

        "section": "15.10 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. Without reference to choice or conflict of law principles, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA. The Parties unconditionally submit to exclusive jurisdiction of and accept as the exclusive venue for any legal proceeding involving this Agreement the state and federal courts located in the County of Los Angeles, California. Before any Party (the \u201cComplaining Party\u201d) may bring any legal proceeding against the other (the \u201cNon Complaining Party\u201d), the Complaining Party shall first make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve all disputes privately by notifying and providing to the Non Complaining Party of the Complaining Party\u2019s complaints, reasons and supporting evidence for the complaints, and the reasonable steps Complaining Party would like the Non Complaining Party to take in order to address the complaints. If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles County, California, by an arbitrator of JAMS, in accordance with its arbitration rules and procedures then in effect. Judgment on the arbitrator\u2019s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing Party in any dispute involving this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the other Party its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees (including any fees for expert witnesses, paralegals, or other legal service providers). This Section 15.10 shall not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.",
        "explanation": "This section contains conflicting clauses regarding dispute resolution. It states that parties must attempt to resolve disputes privately for 30 days before bringing any legal proceeding. However, it then states that any dispute shall be determined by arbitration. This contradicts the initial statement that a party can bring any legal proceeding. Further, the final sentence states that this section does not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction, which contradicts the arbitration clause.",

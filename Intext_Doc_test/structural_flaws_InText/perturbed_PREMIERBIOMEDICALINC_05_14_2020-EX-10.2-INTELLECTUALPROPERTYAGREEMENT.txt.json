By written notice to Marv and at least ninety (90) days before the non-extendable due date for the filing of a national phase application of an Application, THI shall elect those countries or authorities in which it desires to file a patent application based on the Application. Intellectual Property rights in an unelected country shall revert to Marv.",

Intellectual Property rights in an unelected country shall remain with THI regardless.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction regarding the ownership of intellectual property rights. The original text clearly states that if THI does not elect to file a patent application in a specific country, the Intellectual Property rights for that country revert to Marv. The modified text, however, states that the Intellectual Property rights remain with THI regardless of whether they elect to file a patent application. This contradicts the original allocation of rights and creates uncertainty about who owns the intellectual property if THI chooses not to pursue a patent in a particular country. It directly creates an in-text contradiction because it changes the condition under which the IP can revert back to Marv, and clearly says that is no longer possible.",

                "changed_text": "If THI denies payment, THI shall still retain the license but must pay the IP Costs, associated with the Application or Patent in that country.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a direct contradiction in the terms related to payment of Intellectual Property (IP) costs. The original clause stipulates that if THI denies payment of IP costs in a particular country, the license and all associated rights for the Application or Patent in that country revert to Marv. However, the changed clause states that even if THI denies payment, it still retains the license but must pay the IP Costs. This directly conflicts with the original provision that denial of payment results in a reversion of the license to Marv, creating ambiguity around what happens when THI denies payment. This affects section 2(c)3, that creates contradiction.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradiction within the confidentiality clause. The original text mandates that each party must refrain from disclosing confidential information both during and after the agreement. The added text, however, allows a party to disclose confidential information 'if deemed necessary for business purposes'. This introduces ambiguity, as it is unclear what constitutes 'necessary for business purposes' and effectively voids the original restriction. This creates uncertainty and contradiction, directly weakening the confidentiality provisions established earlier in the same section. This contradiction is created on Section 7.",

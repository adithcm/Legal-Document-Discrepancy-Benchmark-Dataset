Either Consultant or Company may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice thereof to the other party. Upon termination of this Agreement, all rights and duties of the parties hereunder shall cease except: Company shall be obliged to pay, within thirty (30) days after receipt of Consultant's final statement, all amounts owing to Consultant for unpaid Services completed by Consultant and related expenses, if any, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 hereof, and Sections 2, 3, S(c), 6, 7, 8 and 10 shall survive termination of this Agreement.",

Company may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without prior written notice to the Consultant. The Consultant may only terminate this agreement with a 90-day written notice period. Upon termination of this Agreement, all rights and duties of the parties hereunder shall cease except: Company shall be obliged to pay, within thirty (30) days after receipt of Consultant's final statement, all amounts owing to Consultant for unpaid Services completed by Consultant and related expenses, if any, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 hereof, and Sections 2, 3, S(c), 6, 7, 8 and 10 shall survive termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction in Section 5 regarding the termination clause. Originally, the agreement allowed either party to terminate with prior written notice. The modified text now grants the Company the right to terminate 'at any time, with or without prior written notice,' while imposing a 90-day written notice period for the Consultant to terminate, resulting in an imbalance of power between the company and the consultant. This contradicts the initial clause implying equal termination rights and may make enforcement difficult to ascertain the power of each party in case of a termination process.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the 'Company agrees to pay Consultant the compensation set forth on Exhibit A hereto for the performance of the Services,' implying a guaranteed payment for services rendered. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that the company 'may, at its sole discretion, pay Consultant compensation'. This contradicts the original intent and makes the enforcement of compensation ambiguous. Exhibit A becomes a source of disagreement on if the consultant will receive their promised compensation. The payment being subject to market conditions creates even more uncertainty. This is more highlighted when reading the section below in Exhibit A.",

The modified text grants the company the unilateral right to amend or modify the agreement, only requiring written notice to the consultant. This creates a power imbalance and uncertainty because it removes the consultant's ability to negotiate amendments. Continued performance is not explicit consent and is coercing acceptance on the new terms. The contradiction occurs in the section describing the general agreement.",

Company may assign this Agreement to any entity that succeeds to substantially all of the business or assets of Company. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without reference to its conflicts of law principles.

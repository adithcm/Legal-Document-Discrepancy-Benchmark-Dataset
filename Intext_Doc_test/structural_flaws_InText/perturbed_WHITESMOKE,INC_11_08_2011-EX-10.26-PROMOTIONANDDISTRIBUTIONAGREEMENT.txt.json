                "original_text": "\"Term\" means the earlier of: (a) the end of the two year period from the Effective Date to 31 July 2013; or (b) the last day of the calendar month within which the Maximum Distribution Commitment is reached.",
                "changed_text": "\"Term\" means a period of five years from the Effective Date, regardless of whether the Maximum Distribution Commitment is reached. Google reserves the right to extend the Term indefinitely with written notice to Distributor 30 days prior to the current Term's expiration.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Term' clearly defined a specific end date or a condition (reaching Maximum Distribution Commitment) for termination. The modified definition removes the certainty by establishing a five year term, while simultaneously introducing a condition where Google can extend the Term indefinitely. This contradicts the initial fixed term and introduces uncertainty regarding the agreement's duration. There is a contradiction in this section, where the original text defines it as a term of 2 years and a condition being met, while the changed text provides a five year period, and also a condition where google can extend the term indefinitely. This can lead to a contradiction on how long the term can extend to.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that Distributor must begin distribution within a specified timeframe after Google's request. The modified clause directly contradicts this by stating that Distributor 'may' begin distribution 'at any time,' removing the obligation to comply with Google's request. This creates uncertainty about whether Google has the power to enforce a timely distribution. The contradiction is explicit, turning an obligation into an option, leading to confusion about expectations. the original statement is implying the company shall begin the distribution within a timeframe specified by google, while the changed text is contradicting the previous statement by implying that the company can choose anytime at their convenience.",

Beginning on the Launch Date and continuing throughout the Term, Distributor shall ensure that [ * ]Distributor App distributed by or on behalf of Distributor is bundled with the Distribution Products as set out in this Agreement."

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly requires all notices of termination or breach to be in English, in writing, and sent to specific addresses. The modified clause directly contradicts this by stating that such notices 'may be communicated verbally,' removing the writing requirement and the specific addressee requirement. It renders the whole process of notice uncertain, as verbal notifications are hard to verify and creates ambiguity about what is consider a valid notification. The original statement and the changed statement are clearly contradicting each other. The original is implying that a formal written notice is required, while the changed statement implies that a verbal notice is also a valid notification.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement stated that the confidentiality applied 'during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter'. The changed agreement now states the member is allowed to use and communicate the confidential information after the termination of the agreement. This creates a direct contradiction about the duration of the confidentiality obligation. This directly contradicts the rest of section 1, since it states all information is deemed confidential.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'exclusively' to 'in connection' with the Business, it creates ambiguity. The original text specifies that assigned IP includes intellectual property used *exclusively* for the Business. The changed text broadens this to include IP used *in connection with* the Business, which could include IP also used for other purposes. This contradicts the intention of a clear separation of IP, creating potential disputes over ownership or licensing rights, as a term is now in multiple locations with conflicting implications.",

                "explanation": "The change here removes the clause allowing the parties to agree to amend the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules. Removing the option to amend the arbitration rules could contradict other provisions in the contract that allow for flexibility and mutual agreement, creating uncertainty about the arbitration process and enforcement, since a clause is now in multiple locations with conflicting implications.",

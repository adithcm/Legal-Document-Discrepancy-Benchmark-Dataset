                "explanation": "By changing 'exclusive' to 'non-exclusive', the appointment clause now directly contradicts Section 1.1 which grants the distributor an exclusive right. This creates uncertainty regarding the scope of the distributor's rights and the company's ability to appoint other distributors in the same market.",

Company hereby appoints Distributor as Company's exclusive distributor within the Market and grants to Distributor the exclusive right to sell and distribute Products within the Market, and Distributor hereby accepts such appointment and such grant, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Distributor acknowledges that customers of other distributors of the Products may have sites, locations or operations in the Market, which will use the Products. Distributor will sell any and all Products required by such customers in the Market to those customers. Distributor also acknowledges that if its customers have sites, locations or operations outside the Market, in the market of another exclusive distributor of the Products, those customers will be required to purchase products from the applicable exclusive distributor in that market; otherwise, Distributor shall be free to sell to its customers in any market which does not have another exclusive distributor."

                "explanation": "By changing the payment terms from 30 days to 90 days and adding the exception 'unless otherwise agreed to in writing,' the original text now directly conflicts with Section 4.2 (A). This creates uncertainty regarding the definitive payment terms, making it subject to potentially unwritten agreements and weakening the clause. The addition makes it more difficult to enforce the 'full and prompt payment' condition.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days prior written notice to the other upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (A) the Distributor's failure to make full and prompt payment to the Company of all sums due and owing to it; (b) either party's default in the performance of any of the material, terms, conditions, obligations, undertakings, covenants or liabilities set forth herein and such default is not cured within a commercially reasonable time after the defaulting party has been notified of the default by the other party and (c) as otherwise expressly provided herein. In the event either party (a) becomes adjudicated insolvent, (b) discontinues its business, (c) has voluntary of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings instituted against it, or (d) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, the other party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement effective immediately upon written notice."

                "explanation": "The original text states renewals are on 'the same terms.' The modification introduces renegotiation, contradicting the original clause. This contradicts the certainty of the original renewal terms established in 1.3, creating ambiguity and potential disputes over renewal conditions. The contradiction undermines the initial term's conditions since they're no longer guaranteed upon renewal.",

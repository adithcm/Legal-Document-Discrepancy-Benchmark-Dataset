                "explanation": "The original contract states that the Interim Period is four years in section 1.2. Changing the duration to ten years creates a contradiction when sections 2.2.1, 2.3.1, 2.5.1, 2.8.1 refer to the Interim Period with an explicit 4 year duration, making them inconsistent and affecting obligations tied to the interim period. Therefore, after reading this contract, a party wouldn't know if the Interim Period is 4 or 10 years long.",

Any confusion is the sole responsibility of the party causing the confusion.",
                "explanation": "By changing the obligation to cooperate to 'are not obligated to cooperate,' this directly contradicts the purpose and content of the Coexistence Agreement referenced in the original text. This introduces ambiguity as the contract now both references and negates the need for cooperation to prevent market confusion, undermining the intent of the Coexistence Agreement, that creates uncertainty. It also creates an in-text contradiction that can cause legal dispute, since Exhibit C refers to the coexistence agreement, and this is directly contradicting that.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'HSI shall defend, indemnify and hold HERC harmless' to 'HSI may, at its sole discretion, defend, indemnify and hold HERC harmless', HSI removes the contractual obligation to protect HERC from trademark infringement claims during the Interim Period. This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty regarding HSI's responsibility, creating an in-text contradiction because, in other sections, the document is referring to HSI's responsibilities during the Interim Period, which this change makes ambiguous.",

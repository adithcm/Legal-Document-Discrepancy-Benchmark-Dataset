Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term.",

                "explanation": "The original text specified an automatic renewal for *one* additional twelve-month period unless notice was given. The modified text eliminates the possibility of opting out of the renewal, making it an *indefinite* term. This contradicts the original condition allowing termination with 90-day notice in section 7.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows for a lead-finder fee 'to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue'. The modified text sets the fee at a fixed 5% *unless* otherwise specified by Bravatek's CFO, thus it's creating contradictory terms on 'to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY'.",

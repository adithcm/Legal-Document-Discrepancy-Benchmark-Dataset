                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces uncertainty around the consequences of the Company being untruthful. Initially, untruthfulness leads to immediate termination and forfeiture. The modified version states, untruthfulness is optional but consideration paid until then is subject to renegotiation, essentially negating the original termination clause. This directly contradicts the original clause in Section 1 by giving the Consultant discretion to continue the agreement and renegotiate past payments instead of automatic termination, potentially creating disputes over past services and payments.",

Should the Company withhold relevant information, this Agreement will continue in effect at the Consultant's discretion, but all consideration paid until the point of the discovery of the information being withheld shall be subject to renegotiation. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company agrees to cooperate with Consultant in carrying out the purposes of this Agreement, keep Consultant informed of any developments of importance pertaining to the Company's business and abide by this Agreement in its entirety."

                "explanation": "The original text gives a clear right to terminate, whereas the modified version suggests the party *may consider* terminating, thus introducing ambiguity. The addition of 'pending a thorough review and mutual agreement to terminate' creates a direct contradiction with the 'without notice' clause, as it introduces a condition of mutual agreement, which needs prior notice. This change is made in Section 2 and contradicts the right to terminate clause.",

                "explanation": "The original contract specifies that the consultant *shall* be paid a compensation of 250,000 dollars. The modified version changes 'shall' to 'may', and introduces contingency on the Company's financial performance and Board's discretion. This creates a direct contradiction by making a previously guaranteed compensation uncertain and subject to internal factors within the company. This change contradicts the idea of guaranteed compensation",

As Consultant's initial compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company may pay Consultant up to $250,000.00 cash compensation, contingent on the Company's financial performance and subject to the discretion of the Company's board of directors. In addition, the Consultant shall earn additional cash compensation for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019. For example: The $250,000 cash compensation paid to Consultant shall reduce the Jetco Note principal amount by $250,000. In the event the Consultant were to sale $100,000 of inventory held by the Company, the payout of $100,000 to Consultant will reduce the principal on the Jetco Note by $100,000. Additional compensation to the Consultant for future products sold by the Company, or revenue earned by the Company for services provided will be negotiated by the Company and Consultant at the time of potential revenue recognition. The Consultant will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state or local tax authority with respect to the Consultant's performance of services and receipt of fees under this Agreement. The Company will regularly report amounts paid, if any, to the Consultant by filing Form 1099-MISC and/or other appropriate form with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law. Because the Consultant is an independent contractor, the Company will not withhold or make payments for social security; make consulting contract insurance or disability insurance contributions; or obtain worker's compensation insurance on the Consultant's behalf. The Consultant agrees to accept exclusive liability for complying with all applicable state and federal laws governing self-employed individuals, including obligations such as payment of taxes, social security, disability and other contributions based on fees paid to the Consultant under this Agreement. The Consultant hereby agrees to indemnify and defend the Company against any and all such taxes or contributions, including penalties and interest."

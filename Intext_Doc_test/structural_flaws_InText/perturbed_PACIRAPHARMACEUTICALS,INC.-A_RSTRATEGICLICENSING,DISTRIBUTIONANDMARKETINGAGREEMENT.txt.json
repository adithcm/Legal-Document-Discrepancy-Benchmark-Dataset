Definitions 1.1 As used in this Agreement, the following words and expressions have the following meanings: \"Affiliate\" With respect to any Party to this Agreement shall mean any company, corporation, firm, individual or other entity which Controls, is Controlled by or is under common Control with such Party to this Agreement for only so long as such Control exists; -3- \"Applicable Laws\" Shall mean all laws, rules and regulations regarding the manufacture, packaging, labeling, import, export, storage, distribution, representation, promotion, marketing and sale of the Products including but not limited to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended (\"FD&C Act\") and the Controlled Substances Act, as amended (21 U.S.C. ยง801 et seq.), or as defined in attendant regulations promulgated under authorities granted by the FD&C Act, together with any equivalent laws, rules, regulations, codes or guidelines having effect in any jurisdiction in the Territory",

                "explanation": "The original definition of affiliate, specifies that an affiliate only remains as such 'for only so long as such Control exists'. By removing this part from the original definition, in Section 1.1, we are creating a conflict with section 20.1. Because if there is no time period in which the affiliate is being defined, that means that, if an agreement is being made, and the affiliate no longer has control, that it will remain as an affiliate. In this case, there is no time defined in Section 1.1 for when the agreement is made.",

For the avoidance of doubt, either Party may grant a security interest with respect to its rights under this Agreement in connection with a secured financing or similar transaction."

Modifying Section 1.1 to allow PPI to include countries in writing directly contradicts Section 4.1.

EKR shall at its own cost and expense use commercially reasonable efforts to take those steps reasonably necessary in order to obtain and thereafter maintain Marketing Authorizations (including pricing and reimbursement approvals) for the Product in those countries of the Territory other than the United States which the Committee determines to present commercially viable opportunities for the Product. EKR shall provide PPI with a copy of any original certificates of approval/registration in each country in the Territory other than the United States. EKR shall provide PPI with a copy of any other registration matters received from the appropriate Regulatory Authorities concerning maintenance, renewal or variations to the original certificates of approval/registration in each country in the Territory. Except as provided in Section 3.17, EKR shall be solely responsible for, and shall bear all costs associated with, all regulatory activities related to the development and approval of the Product in the countries of the Territory (including, after the Agreement Date, the United States) and shall own the Marketing Authorizations for the Product in each other country of the Territory. EKR will comply with all conditions and requirements attaching to such Marketing Authorizations."

By modifying Section 6.1 to state that the upfront payment is 'refundable' we are directly contradicting the same section, because it is now a point of debate on if EKR were to get a refund on the upfront payment.

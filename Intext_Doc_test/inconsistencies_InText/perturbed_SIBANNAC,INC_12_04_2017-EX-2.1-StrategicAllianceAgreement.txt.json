                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment deadline for lead-finder fees from NET 30 days to NET 60 days. This contradicts the expectation established in other sections of the contract that assume standard payment terms, potentially leading to disputes over when Bravatek should be compensated. There is no defined or described payment term of NET 30 days or NET 60 days, which causes contradiction on what payment term is valid.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the notification period required to prevent automatic renewal from ninety (90) days to thirty (30) days. This contradicts the clause indicating termination upon 90 days written notice, causing uncertainty as to which notice period applies and creating potential disputes over contract duration and termination rights. Since both parties now have different notification period, this will create contradiction.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by limiting the scope of indemnification. The modification restricts indemnification to 'direct damages' and requires 'gross negligence or intentional misconduct' for COMPANY's obligations, creating inconsistencies with other sections that don't specify such limitations. Indemnification on the original text is not limited only for 'direct damages', which creates an In-Text Contradiction",

                "explanation": "The modification in Section 1(f) introduces an in-text contradiction by altering the deadline for the Remarketing Agents to notify relevant parties about a Successful Remarketing. The original text states the notification must occur 'on the Remarketing Settlement Date,' while the modified text pushes this deadline to 'one business day following the Remarketing Settlement Date.' This in-text contradiction will create uncertainty and disputes over whether the company has to deliver securities if the notification is done after the original deadline in the text.",

(a) The Company hereby appoints Deutsche Bank as the initial Remarketing Agent, and Deutsche 3 Bank hereby accepts appointment as Remarketing Agent, for the purpose of (i) Remarketing the Remarketed Securities on behalf of the holders thereof, (ii) establishing the Reset Rates (as defined below) for the Securities in connection with the Remarketing and (iii) performing such other duties as are assigned to the Remarketing Agents in the Remarketing Procedures, all in accordance with and pursuant to the Remarketing Procedures. (b) The Remarketing Agents agree (i) to use commercially reasonable efforts to remarket the Remarketed Securities tendered or deemed tendered to the Remarketing Agents in the Remarketing, (ii) to establish the Reset Rates in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures and to notify the Company, the Trustee and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent promptly of the Reset Rates and (iii) to carry out such other duties as are assigned to the Remarketing Agents in the Remarketing Procedures, all in accordance with the provisions of the Remarketing Procedures. (c) On the Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agents shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to remarket the Remarketed Securities tendered or deemed tendered for purchase, at a price which results in cash proceeds equal to at least the sum of (i) the remarketing fee to be paid to the Remarketing Agents in connection with the Remarketing in an amount to be specified in the Pricing Agreement (such fee, the \"Remarketing Fee\"), (ii) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of such Remarketed Securities, (iii) the accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Initial Scheduled Third Stock Purchase Date on such Remarketed Securities and (iv) the product of five basis points (0.05%) and the aggregate principal amount of such Remarketed Securities (such sum, the \"Remarketing Price\"). (d) On the Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agents shall determine the rate per annum, rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of one percent (0.001%), that each tranche of Securities should bear (which rate will apply to all Securities of the applicable tranche whether or not such Securities were included in the Remarketing) (the \"Reset Rate\") in order for each tranche of the Remarketed Securities to generate cash proceeds from the Remarketing equal to at least the Remarketing Price allocable to that tranche and that in the sole reasonable discretion of the Remarketing Agents will enable them to remarket all Remarketed Securities of such tranche tendered or deemed tendered for purchase in such Remarketing at no less than the Remarketing Price allocable to that tranche; provided, that, each such Reset Rate need not, but may, be the same for each tranche of Securities; provided, however, that, unless such requirement has been validly waived by the Company, the Reset Rate may not exceed the prevailing market yield, as determined by the Remarketing Agents, of the benchmark U.S. treasury security having a remaining maturity that most closely corresponds to the period from the Remarketing Settlement Date until the Stated Maturity of the applicable tranche of the Securities (after giving effect to the change in the Stated Maturity of each tranche of the Securities on the Remarketing Settlement Date pursuant to the Indenture), plus 750 basis points per annum; provided, further, that neither Reset Rate may be less than 0% per annum. 4 (e) In the event of a Remarketing that is not a Successful Remarketing, the Remarketing Agents shall promptly remit (i) to the Custodial Agent the Remarketed Securities, if any, that are no longer a component of the Units (\"Separate Securities\"), and (ii) to the Collateral Agent the balance of the Remarketed Securities. (f) By no later than 4:30 P.M., New York City time, one business day following the Remarketing Settlement Date, provided that there has been a Successful Remarketing, the Remarketing Agents shall advise, by telephone, the Company, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and the Trustee that the Remarketing was a Successful Remarketing and of the Reset Rates determined in the Remarketing and the aggregate principal amount of Remarketed Securities sold in the Remarketing. (g) In accordance with The Depository Trust Company's (the \"Depositary\") normal procedures, on the Remarketing Settlement Date, the transactions described above with respect to each Remarketed Security tendered for purchase and sold in the Remarketing shall be executed through the Depositary, and the accounts of the respective Depositary participants shall be debited and credited and such Remarketed Securities delivered by book-entry as necessary to effect purchases and sales of such Remarketed Securities. (h) On the Remarketing Settlement Date, the tender and settlement procedures set forth in this Section 1, including provisions for payment by purchasers of the Remarketed Securities in the Remarketing, shall be subject to modification to the extent required by the Depositary or, if the book- entry system is no longer available for the Remarketed Securities at the time of the Remarketing, to facilitate the tendering and remarketing of the Remarketed Securities in certificated form. In addition, the Remarketing Agents may modify the settlement procedures set forth herein in order to facilitate the settlement process. (i) On the Remarketing Settlement Date, the Remarketing Agents shall deduct the Remarketing Fee from the gross proceeds of the Remarketing and shall remit any proceeds remaining after such deduction as follows: (i) to the extent such net proceeds relate to Remarketed Securities that form part of any Normal Common Equity Unit (as defined in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement), to the Securities Intermediary and (ii) to the extent such net proceeds relate to the Separate Securities that were included in the Remarketing as Remarketed Securities to, or at the direction of, the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of such Separate Securities. Holders whose First Tranche Series E Debt Securities and Second Tranche Series E Debt Securities are remarketed pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement will not otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. 5 (j) If fewer than all of the Remarketed Securities are remarketed in accordance with the terms hereof, the Remarketing shall be deemed to have failed as to all Remarketed Securities. (k) If at any time during the term of this Remarketing Agreement, any Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) or event that with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would become such an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, then the obligations and duties of the Remarketing Agents under this Remarketing Agreement shall be suspended until such default or event has been cured. The Company will promptly cause the Trustee, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent to give the Remarketing Agents notice of all such defaults and events of which such trustee or agent is aware."

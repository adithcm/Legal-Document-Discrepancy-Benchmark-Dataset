                "original_text": "If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "If you do not make the extra payment within 30 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 10% per year.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by shortening the grace period for extra payments from 60 to 30 days and increasing the interest rate from 5% to 10%. This directly contradicts the initial allowance of 60 days in the original text, creating ambiguity regarding the actual payment deadline and applicable interest rate. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the enforcement terms.",

If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 30 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 10% per year."

                "original_text": "Each year, we will determine our divisible surplus. This contract's share, if any, will be credited as a dividend. Since we do not expect this contract to contribute to divisible surplus, it is not expected that any dividends will be credited.",
                "changed_text": "Each year, we may determine our divisible surplus. This contract's share will be credited as a dividend. It is expected that dividends will be credited annually, as determined by the Society.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by stating that dividends are 'expected' to be credited annually, while the original clause indicated that dividends are not expected. This direct conflict introduces uncertainty about the dividend policy, potentially leading to disputes and misinterpretations about the anticipated returns on the contract.",

                "explanation": "The change introduces an in-text contradiction regarding the transferability of the contract ownership and society membership rights. Originally, the contract could only be transferred in accordance with the bylaws, and membership rights were non-transferable. The modified text allows unrestricted transfer of contract ownership and permits the transfer of membership rights with written consent, directly contradicting the original terms and creating uncertainty about the actual transfer conditions.",

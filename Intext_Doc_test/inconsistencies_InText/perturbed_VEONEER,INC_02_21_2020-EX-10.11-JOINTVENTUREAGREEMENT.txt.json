                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by removing the 'except as expressly set forth in this Amendment' clause and changing 'all rights and obligations' to 'some rights and obligations'. This contradicts Article 2, which explicitly states that certain D&O indemnification obligations continue notwithstanding Article 1.1. This creates uncertainty regarding which rights and obligations terminate upon the VNBJ Closing, specifically in relation to D&O indemnification.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by removing the 'Except as expressly set forth in this Amendment' clause and adding 'except for ongoing liabilities'. While Article 1.d clarifies some liabilities that survive termination, the phrase 'ongoing liabilities' is vague and undefined, which contradicts the specific exceptions outlined in Article 1.d. It creates uncertainty about what constitutes an 'ongoing liability' and whether it aligns with or expands beyond the liabilities stated in Article 1.d. The specific survival of liabilities is now ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by changing the effectiveness condition. Originally, the amendment's articles have staged effectiveness based on each specific VNBJ and VNBZ closings. The new amendment states this amendment becomes effective after only one of the company closings, creating ambiguity of how each article is working during that specific time of transition, contradicting the intentions of staged effectiveness as originally mentioned. This creates uncertainty because, as defined in Article 1 a. and b. , the effectiveness of each article becomes contradictory.",

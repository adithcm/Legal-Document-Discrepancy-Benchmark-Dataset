                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D. Future amendments thereto are optional, depending on the filer's discretion, regarding each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with general guidance under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, rather than strict adherence to Rule 13d-1(k).",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that future amendments are optional, while the original text implies they are mandatory for reporting ownership changes. It further weakens the commitment by referencing 'general guidance' instead of strict adherence to Rule 13d-1(k). This contradicts the later statement where each party 'shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments,' creating uncertainty about the actual obligations of the parties.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts,' the obligation to file amendments becomes less strict and more subjective. Additionally, stating that a party is not responsible for the accuracy of the other party's information even if they know it is inaccurate introduces a conflict of interest and weakens the overall agreement. This contradicts the earlier part of the same paragraph as now it is the sole discression of a member, whether they would like to move forward with the filing, despite knowing the details of the other member.",

                "changed_text": "Dated: March 27, 2020, or as otherwise agreed.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'or as otherwise agreed,' the date of the agreement becomes uncertain. This contradicts the implicit assumption that the agreement is effective from March 27, 2020, creating ambiguity about when the obligations and responsibilities outlined in the agreement actually begin. This creates an in-text contradiction as it isn't clear whether the text is being applied at the original date, or a future possible date which could result in a difference.",

In quarters where the per unit royalties and fees for services are less than the corresponding quarterly Second Component, IntriCon may carry forward the remaining credit to be offset against future quarters per unit royalties and fees for services. Any amounts due from per unit royalties and fees for services that exceed the value of the corresponding quarterly payment of the Second Component, net of any carried forward credit, will be paid within 30 days of the end of that royalty quarter.",

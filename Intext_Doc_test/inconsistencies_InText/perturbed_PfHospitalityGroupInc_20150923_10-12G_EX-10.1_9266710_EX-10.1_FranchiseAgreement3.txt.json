                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by altering the binding nature of the non-disclosure agreement for the member. The original text states the member 'must therefore be bound' while the modified text introduces uncertainty by stating it will be decided 'on a case-by-case basis'. This directly contradicts section 6, which designates the Franchisor as a third-party beneficiary with the right to enforce the agreement, implying a consistent, binding agreement, not one subject to individual discretion.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the clause 'except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor' from the non-compete agreement. This contradicts the original intent of franchisor's control over the member's competitive activities after the agreement concludes, as written in the agreement's overview where it's specified that the member must be bound to the non-compete agreement as the Franchisee is. This introduces an in-text contradiction by implying the member can engage in competitive business within the specified radius without needing approval from the Franchisor, creating an inconsistency in the enforcement of the non-compete clause, due to the changing of the agreement after it was stated that the member must be bound to the same rules.",

By removing this point, it introduces an in-text contradiction with section 3 regarding Injunctive Relief, where the Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury. This point contradicts the removal, since the arbitrator, panel of arbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction is no longer included in the 'Post-Term Period' definition, which impacts the overall agreement and its enforcement.",

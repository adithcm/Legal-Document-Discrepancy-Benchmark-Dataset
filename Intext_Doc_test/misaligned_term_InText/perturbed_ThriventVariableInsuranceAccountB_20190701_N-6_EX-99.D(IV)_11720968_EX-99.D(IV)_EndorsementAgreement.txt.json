                "original_text": "MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the financial stability of the Society becomes questionable, you may be asked to contribute additional funds. The Executive Committee will determine if this contribution is needed. The contribution will be determined at their discretion. You may satisfy the contribution by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by tendering a cash payment. Should you fail to contribute within 30 days from the date we alert you of the situation, the amount will be treated as a loan against the contract with interest calculated at a variable market rate.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'solvency' is being replaced with 'financial stability', 'extra payment' with 'contribution' to imply there's no legal obligation, and 'Board of Directors' is changed to 'Executive Committee' shifting authority, and changing the period to satisfy payment within 60 days, to 30 days. Also, 'charged as an indebtedness' is replaced with 'treated as a loan'. This creates uncertainty about the true nature of the obligation and shifts the terms in favor of the Society. This is a contradiction as it changes fundamental aspects that can impact enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'dividends' to 'distributions' and 'divisible surplus' to 'excess resources' and the change from 'will be credited' to 'may be allocated' decreases the obligation on the side of the Society, creating a contradiction on if anything can be claimed here. It is also changing from 'do not expect' to 'unlikely that any distributions will be made', to show uncertainity, decreasing the possiblity of receiving anything here.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'ENTIRE CONTRACT' to 'AGREEMENT DETAILS' and 'The Entire Contract consists of' to 'The Complete Agreement includes' lessens the legal importance, and the original text excludes future amendments to bylaws and articles of incorporation from affecting benefits, while the edited version says 'Terms may be adjusted based on changes to our governing documents', which introduces the possibility that benefits *can* be reduced or eliminated in the future.

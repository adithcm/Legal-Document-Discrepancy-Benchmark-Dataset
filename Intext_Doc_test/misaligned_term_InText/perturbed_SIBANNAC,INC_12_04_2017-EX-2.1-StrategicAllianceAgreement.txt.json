                "explanation": "The term \"lead finder\" is replaced with \"lead generator,\" and the phrase \"best efforts\" is replaced with \"reasonable efforts.\" Additionally, the word \"Products\" has been changed to \"Services.\" This introduces ambiguity and contradiction because later sections refer to \"Products\" and impose obligations based on \"best efforts.\" Now it's unclear if Bravatek's obligations are tied to finding leads, generating them, providing Products or Services and whether they must use 'best' or 'reasonable' efforts. This change introduces uncertainty and thus a contradiction.",

In this capacity, Bravatek will use its best efforts to provide the following services to COMPANY. a. Promote, market and introduce the Products to prospective clients in the government space nationwide.\" Further, the mode of agreement is being changed from \"in writing\" to \"orally\", which introduces ambiguity and contradiction because later sections refer to \"written\" agreements, especially clause 11 which states \"No changes or modifications of this Agreement or any of its terms shall be deemed effective unless in writing and executed by the parties hereto.\"",

It is now ambiguous which specific products/services/solutions attract fees, who needs to be contacted to register, and the amount and timing of the fee payments. This is contradictory because earlier sections imply a different agreement process and compensation structure. It also contradicts the following sentence \"the parties shall agree to a proposed sales price for use during the project in writing prior to the commencement of each project.\"",

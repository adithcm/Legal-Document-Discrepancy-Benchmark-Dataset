All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (\"Confidential Information\") is deemed confidential, except for information that Member can demonstrate came to Member's attention by lawful means prior to disclosure to Member; or which, at the time of the disclosure to Member, had become a part of the public domain.",

                "explanation": "The change in Section 1 modifies the definition of 'Confidential Information'. Originally, information that came to the Member's attention by lawful means prior to disclosure was an exception. The modified text includes that within the definition. This creates a contradiction because the member is unable to use confidential information, even if obtained before the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The change in Section 2(c) replaces 'Franchisor' with 'Pizza Fusion Corporate'. While it might be implied that they are the same, it is not explicitly defined. This creates uncertainty about who needs to provide written approval for the Member to engage in a Competitive Business during the Post-Term Period, leading to ambiguity. There's also no definition that 'Pizza Fusion Corporate' refers to franchisor. ",

This means the Franchisee is entitled to court costs/attorney's fees if the Member breaches the agreement, but it creates a conflict. Because, under this non-disclosure agreement, Franchisor is also a third-party beneficiary of the agreement with the right to enforce it, independently or jointly with Franchisee, it's unclear who can claim these damages in the event of a breach.",

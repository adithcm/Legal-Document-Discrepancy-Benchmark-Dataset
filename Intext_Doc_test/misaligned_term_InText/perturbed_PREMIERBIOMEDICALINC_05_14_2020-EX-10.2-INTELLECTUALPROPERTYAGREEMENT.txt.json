The modified text changes this to \"Licensed Patents\" in the third 'WHEREAS' clause. This creates an internal contradiction because it references 'Licensed Patents' without explicitly stating which patents are being referred to under this designation, contradicting the initial definition and impacting the subsequent clauses that rely on the original 'Issued Patents' definition. This discrepancy could lead to confusion regarding which patents are covered under Premier's Exclusive License and create ambiguity, particularly in later sections about royalty payments for Licensed Products.",

The modified text introduces the term \"Intellectual Property Expenses\" without defining it or explicitly stating that it is equivalent to \"IP Costs.\" While seemingly similar, using a different term creates ambiguity. This contradiction matters in section 2(c)3, where it details the process for THI to affirm or deny payment of 'IP Costs'. If they affirmed 'IP Cost' payment but deny what they deem as simply an expense, it is unclear whether this affirmation extends to Intellectual Property Expenses, leading to disputes over payment obligations, as THI might argue that 'Intellectual Property Expenses' fall outside of their affirmed 'IP Costs', even though they seem very similar.",

                "explanation": "The original text consistently uses the term \"Joint Venture\" to refer to the collaboration between Premier and THI. The modified text replaces “Joint Venture” with “Collaboration” in section 3(d). While “collaboration” is a reasonable synonym, this creates an ambiguity because the contract never defines or clarifies that “Collaboration” and “Joint Venture” are intended to be interchangeable. This matters because section 3 is dedicated to the Joint Venture and its details. Introducing 'Collaboration' creates uncertainty about whether other agreements related to the 'Joint Venture' still apply to this 'Collaboration', or if the parties intended for it to create an entirely new set of obligations.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'distributor' to 'vendor' in Section 1.1 introduces confusion, as 'distributor' is consistently used throughout the agreement to define the role and rights of Electric City of Illinois LLC. This change creates an in-text contradiction by creating ambiguity as to whether the entity is truly acting as a distributor or simply a vendor.",

Distributor will sell any and all Products required by such customers in the Market to those customers. Distributor also acknowledges that if its customers have sites, locations or operations outside the Market, in the market of another exclusive distributor of the Products, those customers will be required to purchase products from the applicable exclusive distributor in that market; otherwise, Distributor shall be free to sell to its customers in any market which does not have another exclusive distributor."

                "explanation": "Replacing 'distributor' with 'retailer' creates ambiguity because the Distributor is intended to be a wholesaler, not necessarily directly involved in retail sales. The in-text contradiction arises as it's now unclear if the 'retailer' refers to the subdistributors or if the Distributor itself is expected to operate as a retailer.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'insurance company' with 'insurance provider' could create confusion. While 'insurance provider' can be a broader term, the specific requirement is for a 'product liability insurance company.' Changing it opens the interpretation to less specialized providers, potentially invalidating the Distributor's protection. It contradicts the intended certainty that a dedicated product liability company is providing the coverage.",

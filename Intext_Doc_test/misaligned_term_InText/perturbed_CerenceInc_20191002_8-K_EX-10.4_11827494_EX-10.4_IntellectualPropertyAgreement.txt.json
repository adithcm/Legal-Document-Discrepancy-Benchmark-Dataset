                "explanation": "Changing 'confidential Data, Trade Secrets or Technology source code' to 'secret Data, Proprietary Processes or Technological source code' introduces ambiguity. 'Proprietary Processes' is not defined, and it is unclear if it is interchangeable with 'Trade Secrets' which is a defined term. This creates a contradiction since the definition now includes an undefined term alongside defined ones, making the scope of 'Confidential Technical Information' uncertain. This contradiction is relevant in Section 6.02, where the disclosure of Confidential Technical Information is restricted. If 'Proprietary Processes' are not considered 'Trade Secrets', then their disclosure might not be restricted, which is a contradiction.",

The Receiving Party shall take, at its sole expense, all reasonable measures to prevent any prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use of any Confidential Technical Information, including by its Permitted Recipients, and shall be liable for any breaches of this Agreement by any of its Permitted Recipients, in each case, as if committed by the Receiving Party."

                "explanation": "Changing the definition of 'Intellectual Property Rights' to include 'contractual rights' creates a direct contradiction. The original definition explicitly excludes contractual rights. This affects Section 5.03, which discusses implied rights, because it's now unclear whether the exclusion of implied rights applies to contractual rights (licenses) or not. This creates uncertainty about the scope of rights granted under the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Altering the definition of “Data” by including 'information' along with 'structured data' introduces redundancy and possible contradiction. While 'data' in a broad sense encompasses 'information,' the original definition focused on databases and compilations, implying a level of organization. By specifying 'structured data' initially, and then including 'information' which can be unstructured, the definition becomes self-contradictory. This impacts Section 6.01 and 6.02 which reference the confidential information to be the Data. By introducing the unstrucutred information, the confidentiality rules of the confidential information becomes vague.",

Section 1.2 Integrity agrees to use its best efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares at the public offering price, as determined in accordance with the Registration Statement, and will undertake such advertising and promotion as it believes is reasonable in connection with such solicitation.

                "explanation": "By changing \"Registration Statement\" to \"Offering Documents\" in Section 1.1 while keeping \"Registration Statement\" in Section 1.2, the contract creates ambiguity. It's now unclear whether 'Offering Documents' encompasses only the Registration Statement or other documents as well, thus impacting how Integrity determines the public offering price and fulfills its responsibilities.",

By changing 'trustees' to 'directors' in the first sentence of Section 4.1 and not making corresponding changes throughout Section 4, it is unclear whether 'trustees' and 'directors' are referring to the same group of people. This introduces an ambiguity about who exactly must be indemnified, as the rest of the section refers to 'trustees' without explicitly including 'directors', creating an internal contradiction that can impact legal obligations and liabilities",

Integrity's agreement to indemnify the Fund, its officers and trustees, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon Integrity's being notified of any action brought against the Fund, its officers or trustees, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or telegram addressed to Integrity at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to Integrity by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify Integrity of any such action shall not relieve Integrity from any liability that Integrity may have to the Fund, its officers or trustees, or to such controlling person by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of Integrity's indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.2. Integrity agrees to notify the Fund promptly of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against Integrity or any of its officers or governors in connection with the issuance and sale of any Shares."

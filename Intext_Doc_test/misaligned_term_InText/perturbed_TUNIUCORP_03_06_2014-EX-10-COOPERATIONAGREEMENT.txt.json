The total sum of Service Fee shall be equal to the amount of profits gained by Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. Party B shall have the right to adjust the amount of Service Fee at its own discretion, without the prior consent of Party A or its subsidiaries. Party A shall cause its subsidiaries to pay the Service Fee in respect of Party B's Services provided to such subsidiaries.",
                "changed_text": "Party A and Party B unanimously agree that they will allocate the proceeds generated from cooperation in accordance with thefollowing provisions: Party B shall have the right to charge, on a quarterly basis, the commission (\"Service Fee\") from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services, or designate another person to charge Service Fee from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services.

                "explanation": "Changing \"service fee\" to \"commission\" introduces ambiguity. While the parenthetical reference initially equates 'commission' with 'Service Fee,' the subsequent text only uses 'Service Fee,' implying they are distinct. This creates an in-text contradiction regarding the calculation and adjustment of the fee. Is it a commission based on a percentage, or a service fee equal to the profits?",

                "explanation": "By changing the term \"Intellectual Property\" to \"Intellectual Creations\" within the definition, we create a contradiction. The section initially implies that Party B owns all 'intellectual property', but then defines Intellectual Creations separately.

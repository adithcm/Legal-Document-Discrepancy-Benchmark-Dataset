If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or modifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order.

                "explanation": "The perturbation changes 'seller' to 'supplier' in the first sentence of section 2.2 but leaves 'seller' unchanged in the subsequent sentences. This creates confusion as to whether the obligations apply to the same entity throughout the section, leading to potential disputes over order confirmation and acceptance. The term 'seller' and 'supplier' are used interchangeably without clear definition.",

Now itâ€™s unclear who is responsible for shipping marks. If the 'Vendors' are different from the 'Sellers', it causes a contradiction on who is ultimately responsible for marking the packages which could have costs implications.",

The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. The rate of penalty is charged at 0.5% for every seven days, odd days less than seven days should be counted as seven days. In case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the contract and the Sellers, in spite of the cancellation, shall still pay the aforesaid penalty to the Buyers without delay, the seller should refund the money received and pay the 30% of the total goods price of the penalty"

                "explanation": "The term 'Sellers' has been changed to 'Suppliers'. This change leads to a contradiction because the contract uses the term 'Sellers' elsewhere, specifically in sections like 16 (CLAIMS), 17 (FORCE MAJEURE), and 18 (LATE DELIVERY AND PENALTY). If the Suppliers and Sellers are not the same entities, guarantees of quality and handling of these aspects would be unclear and create a contradiction.",

The Certificate so issued shall be accepted as the base of a claim. The Sellers, in accordance with the Buyers' claim, shall be responsible for the immediate elimination of the defect(s), complete or partial replacement of the commodity or shall devaluate the commodity according to the state of defect(s). Where necessary, the Buyers shall be at liberty to eliminate the defect(s) themselves at the Sellers' expenses. If the Sellers fail to answer the Buyers within one weeks after receipt of the aforesaid claim, the claim shall be reckoned as having been accepted by the Sellers."

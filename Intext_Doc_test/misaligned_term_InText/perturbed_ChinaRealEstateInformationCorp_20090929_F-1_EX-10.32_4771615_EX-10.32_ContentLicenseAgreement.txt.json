The modified text changes \"shall\" to \"may\", removing the mandatory nature of the action. However, it states afterwards that \"Licensee shall remove any offending Content\". As it uses SHALL, this creates a contradiction about whether the Licensee has a mandatory duty to actively monitor the content or not.

The identification number and password used by a Software User is reusable and reassignable and may be used and transferred by Corio, in accordance with the licenses granted below, between Customers as one Customer discontinues the Corio Services and another Customer subscribes.",

The system user is permanently tied to the initial Customer account and cannot be reassigned or transferred under any circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"SOFTWARE USER\" allowed for reassignment of user credentials between Customers. The modified definition explicitly prohibits this reassignment, creating an internal contradiction. This creates uncertainty around the portability of user licenses between subscribing customers. The in-text contradiction is made within the same section 1.1, where the definition initially allows and later forbids the reassignment of the user.",

                "explanation": "The initial definition restricted \"CUSTOMER(S)\" to those within the Territory (North America) and within the Corio Market Segment (annual sales less than $1B). The modified version broadens this to any entity using the service, regardless of location or revenue, creating an internal contradiction. This change also affects Section 2.10, regarding expansion of the geographical scope of the licenses. It introduces ambiguity over whether the restrictions in the rest of the contract now apply to this broader definition of 'Customer'.",

If and when localized versions of the Software become available, these versions shall be made available under the maintenance and support provisions of this Agreement."

Corio acknowledges that no copy of the source code of the Software will be provided to 4 5 Corio.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Acceptance Testing shall be complete by December 30, 1999, and Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing of it's acceptance or rejection of the Software no later than December 31, 1999. If after the third Acceptance Test Corio does not accept the Software, Corio may, at its sole option, elect to (i) repeat the Acceptance Test or (ii) terminate the Agreement and receive a refund of any fees paid to Commerce One as of such date.

This introduces the in-text contradiction because the contract is written expecting software to be delivered at once for testing according to the Documentation. Now Acceptance testing is based on 'user stories' and 'CI/CD functionality' instead. The text refers to the 'Software performs in substantial accordance with the Documentation' however the acceptance process is centered around User Stories.",

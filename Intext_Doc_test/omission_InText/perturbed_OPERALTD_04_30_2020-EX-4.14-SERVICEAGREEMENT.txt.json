Confidential Information includes the disclosing Party's software end prototypes and information relating to the disclosing Party's business affairs, including business methods, marketing strategies, pricing, competitor Information, product development strategies, and financial results. Confidential Information does not include information which (a) is known by the receiving Party, free of any obligation to keep it confidential; (b) is at the time of disclosure, or thereafter becomes, publicly available through no wrongful act of the receiving Party; (c) Is independently developed by the receiving Party, without relying on or referring to the Confidential Information of disclosing Party; or (d) is approved for release by prior written authorization of the disclosing Party.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the phrase \"designated as being 'proprietary' or 'confidential' or which by its nature or the circumstances reasonably ought to be treated as confidential\" and \"software end prototypes and information relating to the disclosing Party's business affairs, including business methods, marketing strategies, pricing, competitor Information, product development strategies, and financial results\", the definition of Confidential Information is broadened. This creates an in-text contradiction because later in Section 7, 'CONFIDENTIALITY & PUBLICITY Neither Party shall disclose the other Party's Confidential Information to any third party or use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fur the proper fulfillment of this Agreement.' This change means ANY information disclosed, not just that reasonably considered confidential, is now covered and protected. This broadens scope creates ambiguity and could hinder normal business operations.",

                "explanation": "By omitting \"consent driven architecture\" from the PC Financial's obligations and Mobimagic's warrant, there is an internal contradiction. The contract requires PC Financial to maintain a privacy policy, but the explicit requirement for a consent-driven architecture to ensure legal data collection is removed. This is contradiction to Section 3.2 (d), the section talks about 'metadata or hashed data collected in full compliance with applicable law and PC Financial's privacy policy' This creates uncertainty as to whether the data collection methods used by Mobimagic and PC Financial fully comply with privacy laws regarding user consent, potentially leading to legal and compliance issues.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase '(e.g., external auditors)' and 'The costs arising out of the third- party inspection shall be borne by the Parties according to their respective faults.', it creates uncertainty about who qualifies as an 'independent third party' and, more importantly, how the costs of such an inspection are allocated. This introduces ambiguity, especially because Section 4.3 states 'PC Financial has the right to continuous review and assesses the Services provided by Mobimagic and give its necessary suggestions towards the Services', as this section empowers PC Financial to have an inspection and give suggestions but does not specify how third party will be paid. This omission can lead to disputes during the contract's enforcement.",

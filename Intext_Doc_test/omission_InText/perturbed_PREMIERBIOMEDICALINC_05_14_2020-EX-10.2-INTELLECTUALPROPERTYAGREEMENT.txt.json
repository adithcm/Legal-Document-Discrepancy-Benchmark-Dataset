Defines as all applications of the United States and foreign countries, including Patent Cooperation Treaty applications that claim priority to the Applications listed in Appendix A, including any non-provisional applications, continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions, reissues, re-examinations or extensions thereof; and all applications including those applications filed in the United States or applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty on subject matter directly related to the Applications in Appendix A whether or not priority to said applications was claimed.",

Section 2(c)2 discusses the 'Extension of Application' into other countries and authorities, this now becomes ambiguous and contradictory, because the defintion of applications, is only regarding the United States. This creates uncertainty around international rights and obligations.",

THI shall reimburse Marv for all IP Costs incurred on behalf of THI, as well as pre-paid IP Costs incurred prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement, including the costs of provisional and non-provisional applications that are filed to preserve Intellectual Property.

                "explanation": "By changing 'THI shall reimburse Marv for all IP Costs' to 'THI will negotiate Marv's Intellectual Property Costs,' we introduce a contradiction. The original text clearly defines 'License Fee' in section 2(b) including IP Costs as part of the 'License Fee'. Now section 2(c) is not clear on the payment structure.

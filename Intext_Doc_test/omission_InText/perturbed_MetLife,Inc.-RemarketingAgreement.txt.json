                "changed_text": "Effective on September 15, 2014, the Series E Debt Securities may convert into units consisting of two tranches, as determined by the Company.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will automatically convert' to 'may convert' and adding 'as determined by the Company', we've introduced ambiguity. The original text mandated an automatic conversion, but the revised text makes it discretionary. This creates an in-text contradiction because subsequent sections rely on the assumption that the conversion occurs automatically, which now may not be the case due to this change.",

(as successor in interest to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (as successor to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.)), as trustee (the \"Trustee\"), as supplemented by the Twenty- Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 1, 2010 (the \"Twenty-Second Supplemental Indenture\" and, together with the Base Indenture, the \"Indenture\"), between the Company and the Trustee. Effective on September 15, 2014, the Series E Debt Securities may convert into units consisting of two tranches, as determined by the Company. A 1/40t h or 2.50% undivided beneficial ownership interest in each Series E Debt Security having a principal amount of $1,000 is part of a common equity unit (each, a \"Unit\"), which currently includes one stock purchase contract (the \"Stock Purchase Contract\") which was issued pursuant to the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2010, as amended and supplemented by Supplemental Agreement No. 1, dated June 26, 2013, between the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent (as so amended and supplemented, the \"Stock Purchase Contract Agreement\"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as stock purchase contract agent (the \"Stock Purchase Contract Agent\"), and under which the holder of the Unit is obligated to purchase from the Company on the Third Stock Purchase Date (as defined in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement), for $25.00 per Stock Purchase Contract, a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the \"Common Stock\"), equal to the applicable Settlement Rate as set forth in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement."

                "changed_text": "The Company and the Remarketing Agents may discuss terms related to Remarketed Securities and Fees.",
                "explanation": "By replacing the commitment to 'enter into a Pricing Agreement' which 'will set forth the final terms...' with 'may discuss terms...', the contract introduces uncertainty about whether a Pricing Agreement will actually be created and if final terms and fees will be formally established. Later sections assume a Pricing Agreement exists and defines important terms; this creates a contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The change removes the firm commitment of the Remarketing Agents to take definitive actions to remarket the securities or establish reset rates. By softening the language to 'will consider,' the perturbation introduces uncertainty. Several subsequent clauses assume the Remarketing Agents have a definite obligation to perform these duties, creating a contradiction because those obligations are no longer guaranteed.",

Neither e-details, nor presentations made at conventions, exhibit booths, a sample drop, educational programs or speaker meetings, or similar gatherings, shall constitute a Detail.",

                "explanation": "This change broadens the definition of 'Detail(s)' to include 'any form of communication' and explicitly includes presentations at various events, which were previously excluded. This contradicts Section 4.2.1(a), which refers to Detailing by Field Force Personnel and Section 4.2.2 (a) which establishes that Valeant must keep accurate and complete records, consistent with pharmaceutical industry standards, of each Detail. Broadening the definition creates ambiguity on what qualifies to be part of those records, therefore creating an in-text contradiction.",

Such records shall be kept for the longer of (i) [***] after the end of the Calendar Year to which they relate and (ii) such period of time as required by Applicable Laws. Within [***] following the end of each Calendar Quarter during the Term, Valeant shall provide Dova with a written report (each a \"Detail Report\"), setting out (i) the quarterly average number of Sales Representatives during such Calendar Quarter (calculated by taking the sum of the number of Sales Representatives employed by Valeant (or its affiliates) that have incentive compensation packages that comply with the terms of Section 4.1.3 on each Business Day of the Calendar Quarter divided by the number of Business Days in such Calendar Quarter) (the \"Quarterly Average Sales Force Size\"), and (ii) the aggregate actual number of Details for the Product made by its Sales Representatives during such Calendar Quarter, and the number of Details broken down by the name of the Target Professionals,. Through the JSC, the Parties shall agree on a mutually acceptable form of Detail Report."

In addition, [***] and continuing throughout the remainder of the Term, Valeant shall ensure the incentive compensation package for each Sales Representatives requires that at least fifty percent (50%) of the target incentive compensation is derived from achieving target sales of the Product. On at least a quarterly basis, the Parties will meet, through the JSC, to review the target incentive compensation and the actual incentive compensation paid out to the Sales Representatives to discuss, in good faith, any appropriate adjustments to the sales targets and goals related to the Product (but not to the above-mentioned fifty percent (50%) threshold of the target incentive compensation), with the intent of achieving, on average, an actual payout to the Sales Representatives of 50% of their incentive compensation relating to sales of the Product.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the clause mandating that at least 50% of the incentive compensation be derived from product sales, this modification contradicts the intended financial incentive structure. This omission creates a contradiction when considering Section 3.3.7, where the Joint Steering Committee (JSC) is tasked to decide on the acceptable form of, review, and discuss the Compensation Reports and incentive compensation matters, which assumed the previously defined compensation structure.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation removes the specification that the non-solicitation clause only applies to professional personnel who have had direct involvement with the JSC, with the Valeant Activities under this Agreement (which, in the case of Valeant, includes the Field Force Personnel) or with Dova's commercialization activities for the Product. It also omits the statement stating that 'in no event shall the restrictions set forth in this Section 2.3.2 apply to [***]', which likely contained terms for when the non-solicitation restriction wouldn't apply. The change contradicts with Section 4.5.2 where a reference is made to the Field Force Personnel, this creates uncertainty as it could have been previously agreed that there were exceptions to which this clause didn't apply to, for example, if an employee left the company.

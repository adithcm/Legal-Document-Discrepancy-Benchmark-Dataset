References to \"Company\" will follow standard business naming conventions.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'all references to \"Company\" or \"Companies\" in the JV Agreement (either in the body of the JV Agreement or its schedules and other attachments) shall read and be interpreted to mean VNBZ and/or ANRA except as the context otherwise requires,' the contract now has no defined meaning for Company which previously only meant VNBZ and/or ANRA, however, Article 2 still refers to the JV agreement. This lack of clarity regarding which 'Company' is being referred to in Section 2 creates an in-text contradiction and uncertainty in enforcement, as it's unclear if the D&O Indemnity applies only to VNBZ and/or ANRA or potentially all previous companies.",

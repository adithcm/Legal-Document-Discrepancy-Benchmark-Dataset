                "explanation": "The word \"irreparable\" was removed from \"irreparable injury\". This omission creates an in-text contradiction because the standard legal remedy of 'specific performance' and 'injunction' typically requires a demonstration of irreparable harm. By removing \"irreparable\", it implies that the injury does not need to be irreparable, but the continued mention of specific performance suggests that it would need to meet the same legal standard, creating a point of contention and uncertainty.",

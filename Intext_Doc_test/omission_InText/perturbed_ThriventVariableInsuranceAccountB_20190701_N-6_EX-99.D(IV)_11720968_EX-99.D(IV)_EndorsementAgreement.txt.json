If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.' we create an ambiguity. The contract still mentions an 'extra payment,' but the method of calculation and the recourse for not paying within 60 days is omitted. This creates an in-text contradiction because the solvency clause is referenced, but the exact obligations and calculations are unclear.",

                "explanation": "The original text specified that the agreement remains in effect for one year or until the consultant completes services. By removing 'or until Consultant completes the services requested,' the contract now contradicts section 3, where Consultant will perform the services described below (the 'Consulting Services') for the Company. Removing this key component in Section 2, where the Term of Agreement is now defined, makes it so it is not clear what happens if consultant completes services before the one year date. This change creates uncertainty because it is not clear how services are requested in Section 3 and how they are suppose to relate with the original Term of Agreement defined in Section 2, this creates ambiguity about the contract's term if the services are completed before the year is up.",

As Consultant's entire compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant $250,000,00 cash compensation. In addition, the Consultant shall earn additional cash compensation for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019. For example: The $250,000 cash compensation paid to Consultant shall reduce the Jetco Note principal amount by $250,000. In the event the Consultant were to sale $100,000 of inventory held by the Company, the payout of $100,000 to Consultant will reduce the principal on the Jetco Note by $100,000. Additional compensation to the Consultant for future products sold by the Company, or revenue earned by the Company for services provided will be negotiated by the Company and Consultant at the time of potential revenue recognition. The Consultant will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state or local tax authority with respect to the Consultant's performance of services and receipt of fees under this Agreement. The Company will regularly report amounts paid, if any, to the Consultant by filing Form 1099-MISC and/or other appropriate form with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law. Because the Consultant is an independent contractor, the Company will not withhold or make payments for social security; make consulting contract insurance or disability insurance contributions; or obtain worker's compensation insurance on the Consultant's behalf. The Consultant agrees to accept exclusive liability for complying with all applicable state and federal laws governing self-employed individuals, including obligations such as payment of taxes, social security, disability and other contributions based on fees paid to the Consultant under this Agreement. The Consultant hereby agrees to indemnify and defend the Company against any and all such taxes or contributions, including penalties and interest. 2 ____ ____",

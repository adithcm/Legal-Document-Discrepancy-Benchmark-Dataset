                "explanation": "The original text defined ERB by referencing the Distribution Agreement, providing a concrete definition. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating the scope is at HERC's discretion. This creates a contradiction if other sections assume a fixed definition per the Distribution Agreement, because now HERC can arbitrarily change the definition of ERB, therefore making the original Distribution Agreement definition nul and void.",

                "explanation": "The removal of \"during the Interim Period only\" from Section 5.2 extends the indemnification indefinitely, conflicting with sections that limit rights and licenses to the Interim Period, because now there is an indefinite indemnification for a period that is supposed to be limited. This contradicts the defined timeline for trademark usage and creates uncertainty in liability. This will create a contradiction with Section 2.",

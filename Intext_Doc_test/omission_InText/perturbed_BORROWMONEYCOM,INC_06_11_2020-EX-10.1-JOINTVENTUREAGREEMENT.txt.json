                "explanation": "By removing the specific definition of 'Purpose' and delegating it to the Managers, this creates uncertainty. Section 10 states that the Managers' authority is 'within the limits of the Purpose of the Venture'. However, if the Purpose itself is undefined, this creates an in-text contradiction regarding the scope of the Managers' authority, making it difficult to enforce.",

An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Members. A withdrawing Member's interest will be based on the proportion of their respective capital account less any outstanding liabilities a Member may have to the Venture.

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for a fair market value appraisal and an independent accounting firm, and replacing it with 'a manner deemed appropriate by the remaining members', and 'at the discretion of the remaining members' creates a contradiction with the intent of the section, which is 'to ensure the survival of the Venture despite the withdrawal of any individual Member'. It creates in-text contradiction with the original intent because the withdrawal of a member creates a liability and now its solely at the discretion of the remainging member, so it creates a loop-hole making it contradict the original reason the clause was made.",

In order to maintain the exclusive rights to sell, lease, distribute and service Products in the Market, the Distributor must use all commercially reasonably efforts to purchase for sale to subdistributors the following minimum quantities of the Products from the Company: On the commencement of the Term Distributor will issue to the Company an irrevocable letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference. The LC shall have a two (2) month term, and shall be renewed for five (5) consecutive bimonthly periods. A minimum of a $250,000.00 purchase order must be received by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month period. The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for Distributor's purchases, which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are Page -2- provided by the Company as Exhibit C. The Company will be entitled to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC. (A) 375 units in the first Product Year (1999) (B) 750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000) (C) 937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001) (D) 1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002) (E) 1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003) (F) 1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004) (G) 2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005) (H) 2,856 unit each in the lat three years of the initial Term of this Agreement and any renewals thereof. For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period following the commencement of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve (12) months thereafter. Distributor's expected sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter. Sales in excess of the expected sales which are actually made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation, if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for year two and 60 units are sold in year one and 195 units are sold in year two, the expectation for year two will have been met, but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the Distributor shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the Distributor's exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market, may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated. Company agrees that Distributor shall not be liable or subject to reevaluation for failure to meet expectations due to any occurrence beyond Distributor's reasonable control, including, but not limited to, Acts of God, fires, floods, wars, sabotage, accidents in shipping, labor disturbances, weather conditions, governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by Company, failure of Company to honor warranties or otherwise materially support the Products. The aggregate units to be sold on an annual basis described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.",

                "explanation": "The omission of the LC's specific amount ($500,000), term, renewal conditions, minimum monthly purchase order requirements, and defined unit quantities per year creates an in-text contradiction. While section 1.6 still states that the LC can be drawn to pay for purchases, the specific conditions attached to it have been removed. Section 2.7 refers to payment terms, and the LC is mentioned as the source of payment in Section 1.6. Therefore, without specifying the LC amount, renewal and term conditions, and minimum monthly purchase order requirements, the enforcement of payment becomes vague, and it is not well-defined to what extent the LC should cover the purchases, thus creating contradiction. This change affectes sections 1.6 and 2.7.",

The prices set forth in Section 2.4(a) shall be subject to adjustment annually on the first day of each Product Year beginning in the calendar year 2000 and on the first day of each succeeding Product Year for the remainder of the Term and all renewals of this Agreement in proportion to the increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as compared to the CPI as it existed on the first day of the Term of this Agreement. The Company also reserves the right to increase or decrease the price per unit based on Company wide changes in unit prices to all distributors of the Company, provided however, that any price changes, other than those based on the CPI, shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the Products and shall reasonably applied to all distributors of the Products and shall reasonably reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products and/or market demand for the Products, provided further than any increase in price based upon market demand shall not be so great as to deprive Distributor of its normal and customary profit margin. The Company agrees to exercise this right in good faith, and consider all circumstances of the Distributor and the Company.

                "explanation": "By omitting the reference to 'Exhibit C' which specifies the prices for the Products in the first Product Year, the modified text contradicts itself. While Section 2.4(A) initially mentions prices for the first product year are available, it no longer provides any tangible way to determine them, thus making this section not useful and open to discussion, which contradicts the aim of the section initially, creating an in-text contradiction. Furthermore, removing details about CPI-based adjustments and limiting distributors normal profit margin increases uncertainty in pricing for subsequent years, potentially conflicting with Section 2.5, which gives distributors discretion over resale prices, as without knowing the cost, this discretion is limited, and can create issues for the distributor.",

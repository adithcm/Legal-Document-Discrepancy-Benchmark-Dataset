                "explanation": "The phrase \"all Inventions (as defined below)\" has been removed, but the contract continues to use and reference the term \"Inventions\" without a clear definition. This omission creates an in-text contradiction because Section 3 relies on a definition that is no longer explicitly provided, making the scope of assigned rights uncertain. The contract refers to assign all rights and title of such inventions but never clearly defines what constitutes as an invention after this perturbation.",

Consultant agrees to sign, execute and acknowledge or cause to be signed, executed and acknowledged without cost, but at the expense of Company, any and all documents and to perform such acts as my be necessary, useful or convenient for the purposes of perfecting the foregoing assignments and obtaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights in any and all countries with respect to Inventions."

                "explanation": "Section 5(c) regarding termination rights and duties has been removed from the surviving sections upon termination. The omission creates an in-text contradiction because, without specifying the surviving rights related to termination, it is unclear which provisions related to the termination process, notice, or consequences still apply, leading to uncertainty about the obligations of both parties after termination.",

The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party shall not unilaterally cancel the order before the two sides agreed .",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by limiting the seller to only 10 modifications after the first order. This contradicts the first condition of the same sentence which grants 3 working days for sellers to modify if found unacceptable. The in-text contradiction arises because the original text implies unlimited modifications can be proposed within the timeframe, whereas the modified text restricts this freedom significantly, leading to potential disagreements on whether a modification is valid if it exceeds the set limit of 10 modifications.",

                "explanation": "This modification removes the clause stating 'all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers.' By deleting this, it creates an in-text contradiction within the claims section. The buyer still retains the right to claim for replacement or compensation, but the responsibility for associated expenses becomes ambiguous. This is an in-text contradiction because it creates uncertainty: the initial part of the section suggests the buyer can claim for defects, but it's unclear who pays for the costs associated with that claim, if the sellers do not answer. Does the buyer bear the costs? Or is it implied that the sellers still responsible?",

This change removes the conditionality of the penalty for late delivery. The original text implies a strict agreement where the penalty is mandatory for postponement, while the modified text suggests a postponement can occur even without the penalty agreement. This is an in-text contradiction because the clause states that buyers are suggested even if penalties are not paid, however, the remaining text still mentions and enforces the seller to pay the penalty, regardless of buyer's suggestion to postopone. It is contradicting whether the buyer is okay even if the seller does not pay the penalty.",

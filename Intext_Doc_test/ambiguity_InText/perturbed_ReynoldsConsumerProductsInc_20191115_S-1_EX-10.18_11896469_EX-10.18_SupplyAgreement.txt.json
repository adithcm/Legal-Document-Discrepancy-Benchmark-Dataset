                "explanation": "The modification in Section 6a introduces an ambiguity regarding product condition. The original text states that each product will be in 'new, undamaged, and unadulterated condition'. The modified text states products 'may exhibit minor cosmetic defects'. The change in Section 6c from 'compliance' to 'substantial compliance' introduce some ambiguity. These contradictions creates uncertainty, as the original warranty implies perfect condition, while the modified text allows for imperfections. This creates a contradiction because itâ€™s unclear what standards the product must meet, creating a potential loophole regarding product defects and compliance. This contradicts Section 6a, as the original clause stated 'new, undamaged, and unadulterated condition free of any defects in design, materials and manufacture'.",

Be fit for the purpose of packaging, selling or use in consuming food subject to qualifications and instructions on the use of the product in the written specifications for the product identified in the applicable Purchase Schedule. f. Be conveyed by Seller to Buyer with good and marketable title free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and claims arising by, through or under Seller. g.

If a Buyer receives a product that fails to conform to these representations and warranties, the sole remedies of Buyer for the breach of warranty will be to: (1) reject and return the non-conforming product to Seller for a refund or credit, or a replacement conforming product, in the manner and time period provided in the SOP; (2) obtain reimbursement from Seller for actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer in the recovery, return or disposal of a non-conforming product that is the subject of a mandatory product recall required under Applicable Laws or a voluntary withdrawal declared by Seller or approved by Seller (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and (3) obtain indemnification from Seller for any Indemnified Claim arising from or related to the non-conforming product as provided in Section 7."

                "explanation": "By modifying Section 3 to state that the Parties will 'adhere to the SOPs to the extent reasonably practicable,' instead of 'comply with the applicable SOPs', it introduces a level of subjectivity to the SOP compliance. This change is an in-text contradiction because, while the original wording mandates strict adherence to the SOPs, the modified version allows for deviations based on 'reasonable practicability'. This reasonableness is subject to interpretations by both parties, hence creating an ambiguity of what the parties are expected to do under the original SOP's. It contradicts with the original statement that the parties will comply, as now there is a reasonability element.",

Over approximately the past eight years, the Parties have been supplying select Products to one another for use in the operation of their respective businesses within the United States of America, Canada and Mexico. The Parties developed and been following certain standard operating procedures in connecting with, among other topics, forecasting, production planning, ordering, delivering and resolving claims on the Products supplied to one another (the \"Current SOPs\"). The Parties will be updating their respective business systems over the next six months, and the updates to these business systems will require the Parties to modify the Current SOPs. Once the Parties have completed the updates to the business systems and agreed on the necessary modifications to the Current SOPs, the Parties will sign a written amendment to this Agreement appending the updated standard operating procedures (the \"Updated SOPs\"). Until the Parties have signed a written amendment appending the Updated SOPs, the parties will continue to follow the Current SOPs. The Parties will adhere to the SOPs to the extent reasonably practicable in connection with the purchase and sale of products identified in a Purchase Schedule. The Parties may add terms and conditions to, and amend the terms and conditions of, the SOP in a Purchase Schedule, but any additional and amended terms and conditions in a Purchase Schedule supplementing and modifying the SOP will only apply the specific products identified in that Purchase Schedule for its duration."

                "explanation": "By removing 'any breach, negligence, criminal misconduct or other act or omission of any third-party;' from Section 9c's examples of Force Majeure events, a conflict emerges. This is because in the original agreement, third-party misconduct is considered a Force Majeure event. However, in Section 5a, there is a guarantee the parties are in compliance with Applicable Laws. This could lead to a confusion as to whether or not the force majeure will apply to one of the parties if a third-party act of misconduct takes place.",

An incident of actual, alleged or suspected non-compliance by a Party with a warranty under this Section being investigated, contested or corrected in good faith by the Party and which, regardless of outcome, will have no material adverse effect on the Party or its performance under this Agreement or on the other Party, will not be considered a breach of this clause. An incident of actual, alleged or suspected non-compliance by a Party of this Section or any other Section of this Agreement will be grounds for the other Party to demand adequate assurances of performance as provided by Section 2-609 of the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code. A Party will have ten (10) days to provide adequate assurances of performance to the other Party in a form acceptable to the other Party in its good faith discretion."

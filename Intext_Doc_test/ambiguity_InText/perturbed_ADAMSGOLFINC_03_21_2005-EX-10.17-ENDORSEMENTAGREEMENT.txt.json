                "changed_text": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name solely for marketing materials directly created by ADAMS GOLF. This excludes use of likeness or image for promotional events unless specifically agreed upon in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is broad, including name, likeness, and image. The modified definition restricts the endorsement to the use of name only for marketing materials, contradicting the broad definition of endorsement in the original clause. This introduces ambiguity about whether Adams Golf can use Watson's likeness in promotional events without additional written agreements, creating potential legal disputes about the scope of the endorsement rights originally granted. This is contradicting with section 3.",

EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, except that CONSULTANT is permitted to use equipment from any manufacturer without restriction, provided he makes a good faith effort to use ADAMS GOLF products whenever possible.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates exclusive use of Adams Golf's \"MANDATORY PRODUCTS,\" but allows for limited exceptions with non-endorsement. The modified clause permits unrestricted use of competitor products if a 'good faith effort' is made to use ADAMS GOLF products, potentially undermining the exclusivity intended in the original agreement. This introduces a subjective standard (\"good faith effort\") that creates an in-text contradiction, since there isn't more clarification around it, the original contract clearly stated which were mandatory product.",

ADAMS GOLF shall reimburse CONSULTANT for reasonable travel expenses for CONSULTANT when making special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph but ADAMS GOLF shall not pay CONSULTANT session fees, residual payments or the like for television appearances.

The modified version states that CONSULTANT 'may, at his discretion, participate' in those same activities, this introduces ambiguity by making his participation optional, thereby creating a contradiction. If ADAMS GOLF structures its marketing plans with the assumption that CONSULTANT is required to attend a specific number of events (based on the original wording), and CONSULTANT refuses based on the updated discretionary clause, it leads to a clear conflict.",

                "original_text": "As of the VNBJ Closing, except as expressly set forth in this Amendment, the JV Agreement shall immediately cease to have any application or effect with respect to VNBJ, all rights and obligations with respect to VNBJ under the JV Agreement shall terminate and all references to \"Company\" or \"Companies\" in the JV Agreement (either in the body of the JV Agreement or its schedules and other attachments) shall read and be interpreted to mean VNBZ and/or ANRA except as the context otherwise requires.",
                "changed_text": "As of the VNBJ Closing, the JV Agreement shall immediately cease to have any application or effect with respect to VNBJ only if all parties agree in writing, and all rights and obligations with respect to VNBJ under the JV Agreement shall terminate only upon mutual written consent of all parties. All references to \"Company\" or \"Companies\" in the JV Agreement (either in the body of the JV Agreement or its schedules and other attachments) shall read and be interpreted to mean VNBZ and/or ANRA except as the context otherwise requires.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a condition that the JV Agreement ceases to have effect only if all parties agree in writing, directly contradicting the initial statement that the agreement shall immediately cease to have any effect with respect to VNBJ. This creates uncertainty regarding the termination process and requirements, as the original text stipulates immediate cessation upon the VNBJ Closing, while the changed text introduces a conditional cessation dependent on mutual written agreement.This creates an **internal contradiction** with the Article 1.1",

                "explanation": "The modification now states that termination *does* release parties from liability for breaches prior to closing, under the condition the court does not deem them 'material'. This creates a contradiction since the original agreement explicitly stated that the termination does not release any parties from liability prior to the closings. Now liability is conditional. This creates an **internal contradiction** within Article 1 regarding liability post-termination.",

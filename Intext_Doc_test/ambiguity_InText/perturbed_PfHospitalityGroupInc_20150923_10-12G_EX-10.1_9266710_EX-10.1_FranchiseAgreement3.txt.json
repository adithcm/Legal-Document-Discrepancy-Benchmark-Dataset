                "explanation": "This change introduces an ambiguity to the definition of 'Confidential Information.' Originally, the definition only excluded information already in the public domain or previously known to the Member. By adding 'Information that is generally known within the specific restaurant industry is also exempt from this definition of Confidential Information,' it broadens the exception. This contradicts the latter part of the original definition, because something can be in the restaurant industry and still not be considered public domain. The definition provided in the last part of the section is now being conflicted. ",

                "explanation": "By changing 'will receive' to 'may receive', it introduces an internal contradiction because in all of Section 2, the contract treats receiving 'valuable specialized training and Confidential Information' as a given, a necessary condition for the restrictions that follow. If the member 'may receive' it, the subsequent restrictions in 2(b) and 2(c) become less enforceable because they are predicated on something that is no longer certain. This now contradicts the member covenants in the later part of section 2, since it may be argued that the member did not receive Confidential Information. This makes the covenants not to compete less enforceable because they are tied to the Member actually receiving Confidential Information.",

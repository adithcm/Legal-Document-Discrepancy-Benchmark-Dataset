                "explanation": "By changing the definition of 'Specifications' from a concrete description to a 'general guideline,' it introduces ambiguity. Section 3.1 requires deliverables to 'substantially conform to the relevant Specification.' If 'Specifications' are now just guidelines, it's unclear what 'substantially conform' means, creating an in-text contradiction on the required level of precision for the software deliveries.",

Subject to payment by On2 of the Closing Date Payment Amount in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement, Wildform shall deliver each Deliverable in accordance with the timeframe (the \"Timeframe\") set forth in Exhibit B, which Exhibit is made a part of this Agreement. On2 will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Wildform as necessary in completing the Development Work and delivery of the Deliverables. Upon receipt of each Deliverable, On2 shall have a period of thirty (30) working days within which to inspect such Deliverable based upon the relevant Specification (an \"Acceptance Period\"). Should On2 find that any Deliverable does not substantially conform to the relevant Specification, On2 shall promptly so notify Wildform in writing, which notice shall provide sufficiently detailed explanation of the non-conformities so as to allow Wildform to reproduce them (any such notice is referred to herein as a \"Nonconformance Notice\"). Each of the Deliverables shall be deemed accepted by On2 unless On2 delivers to Wildform a Nonconformance Notice within thirty (30) business days of the delivery of such Deliverable. In the event that Wildform receives such Nonconformance Notice from On2, Wildform shall make commercially reasonable efforts to modify such Deliverable and re-deliver it to On2 after any such modification is completed. Each Deliverable shall be deemed to have been accepted by On2 when either (i) On2 notifies Wildform in writing of its acceptance of such Deliverables or (ii) On2 does not deliver a Nonconformance Notice to Wildform within the Acceptance Period. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, On2 shall not unreasonably withhold acceptance of any Deliverable."

                "explanation": "By changing the obligation to 'resolve Program Errors' to 'attempt to resolve Program Errors at its discretion', it introduces a contradiction with Exhibit A. Exhibit A defines specific response and correction times for Program Errors. This alteration significantly weakens Wildform's commitment, allowing for potential neglect of error resolution, directly contradicting the defined resolution process and timelines in Exhibit A.",

On2 shall promptly report to Wildform any Program Errors accompanied by documentary evidence in a mutually agreeable form that permits the defect or error to be reproduced. During the first twelve (12) months of the Term, Wildform shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct Program Errors within the response times set forth below. For purposes of the response times set forth below a \"Serious\" Program Error shall be defined as a Program Error that (a) causes the Deliverables to crash (malfunction), or (b) substantially degrades the performance, usability or appearance of the Deliverables. A \"Minor\" Program Error shall be defined as a bug that causes a less than substantial degradation in the performance, usability or appearance of the Deliverables. Program Error Response Correction ------------- -------- ---------- Serious Within 1 business day Within 8 business days Minor Within 4 business days Within 15 business days Failure by Wildform to provide a correction for a Program Error within the specified period shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement provided that Wildform has used commercially reasonable efforts to correct such Program Error. Wildform shall not be required to provide corrections for defects in or conflicts with products developed by other companies, including On2, Macromedia and Microsoft provided that such defect or conflict cannot reasonably be corrected except through modification of the product of such other companies. If a Deliverable, including the Macromedia Flash Player that is shipped with the Deliverable, does not exhibit the Program Error, then no Program Error shall be deemed to exist."

                "explanation": "The original text states 'strict confidence' while the modified text uses 'reasonable care' and acknowledges 'potential unintentional disclosures'. This introduces a contradiction in terms of the level of protection required for confidential information. Article 5.2 outlines circumstances of permissible disclosure and injunctive relief for breaches, creating uncertainty as to the enforceability of confidentiality obligations when the standard of care is lessened. The first section implies absolute protection while the changed text allows for potential breaches.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall be permitted to disclose Confidential Information without any violation of this Agreement if such disclosure is required by law, but in such event the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party in writing in advance of such disclosure, and provide the Disclosing Party with copies of any related information so that the Disclosing Party may take appropriate action to protect its Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party may cause irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party and damages that may be difficult to ascertain. The Disclosing Party shall, therefore, be entitled to injunctive relief upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in violation of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as may be available at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall promptly advise the Disclosing Party in the event that the Receiving Party learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party through the Receiving Party has violated or intends to violate the terms of this Agreement."

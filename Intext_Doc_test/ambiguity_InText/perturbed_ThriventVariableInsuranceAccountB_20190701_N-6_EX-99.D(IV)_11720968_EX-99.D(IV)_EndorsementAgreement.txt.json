If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the policyholder's obligation to make extra payments if the Society's solvency is impaired. Originally, the contract stated that you 'may be required' to make an extra payment and that the Board of Directors 'will determine' the amount. The modified text now states that you '*may not* be required' to make an extra payment and that the Board of Directors '*will not*' determine the amount. It then goes on to say '*must*' make the extra payment. This creates an in-text contradiction because it is uncertain whether the policyholder is obligated to pay. This contradiction directly impacts the 'MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY' section, creating uncertainty about the contractual requirements during times of financial instability.",

Initially, it states that the contract is not expected to contribute to divisible surplus and, therefore, no dividends will be credited. The modified text indicates that the contract is expected to contribute, yet *still* no dividends are expected to be credited. This creates confusion regarding the dividend policy and how it is to be determined.

The original text allows the transfer of contract ownership but prohibits the transfer of membership rights.

                "explanation": "By changing the definition of \"Gross Revenues\" to exclude proceeds from business interruption insurance, it creates an internal contradiction if section 6.19 'Insurance' requires franchisees to maintain business interruption insurance. If Gross Revenues exclude those proceeds, the royalty calculation on business revenue becomes ambiguous if there is a business interruption. This creates an In-Text Contradiction, with a direct impact to section 6.19 because now this section is reffering to the need of the insurance but the calculation on section 3 is not including proceeds of such insurance.",

Policies that we require must be written by an insurance company reasonably satisfactory to us with an A.M. Best rating of \"A\" or better, and, must name us as an additional insured party. At a minimum, such policies must include the following: (a) commercial general liability insurance, completed-operations and independent-contractors coverage in the amount of $1,000,000, per person/per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage combined with a general aggregate of $3,000,000. (b) workers'-compensation coverage in the amount of at least $100,000/$500,000/$100,000, unemployment insurance and employer's liability insurance, as well as such other insurance as may be required by statute or rule of the state in which the Franchised Business is located; (c) fire, lightning, vandalism, theft, malicious mischief, flood (if in a special flood-hazard area), sprinkler damage, and the perils described in ex-tended-coverage insurance with primary and excess limits of not less than the full-replacement value of the supplies, furniture, fixtures, equipment, machinery, inventory, and plate glass having a deductible of not more than $1,000 and naming us as a loss payee; (d) automobile liability insurance-including coverage of vehicles not owned by you, but used by employees in connection with the Franchised Business, with a combination of primary and excess limits of not less than $1,000,000; (e) commercial blanket bond in the amount of $100,000; and (f) such other insurance, in such amounts, as we reasonably require for our and your protection. At any time, we may adjust the amounts of coverage required under such insurance policies and require different or additional kinds of insurance, including excess liability insurance."

                "explanation": "Changing 'must' to 'may' for marketing expenditure creates ambiguity and contradicts the 'must submit documentation' later in the same section. This creates uncertainty about whether local marketing is strictly enforced, which contradicts the original intent of mandating local marketing efforts, resulting in an In-Text Contradiction. This means the obligation is not clear and is a contradiction within the same section",

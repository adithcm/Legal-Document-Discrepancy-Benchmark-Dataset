Additionally, the original text specified 'in accordance with', while the modified text specified 'in general accordance with'. This introduces uncertainty and ambiguity in Section 1. Website Design and Development of the text, as it's unclear how a 'reasonable sum' will be determined and leaves open to interpretation and debate what constitutes 'general accordance' with the Scope of Work, potentially conflicting with Section 2. Payment Terms where a specific amount ($5,000) and payment schedule are outlined.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the Company will use 'its best efforts,' allowing for potential delays and flexibility. This is contradicted by the changed text, which says the 'Company guarantees to deliver' and also that 'any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are not subject to any delay'. This introduces an in-text contradiction because a guarantee implies a firm commitment, whereas the earlier clause allows for potential delays under the client's actions. This directly contradicts the original agreement, creating a significant source of ambiguity and potential legal conflict.",

                "explanation": "The original text in Section 3 states that the 'Client shall pay' an additional surcharge, establishing a mandatory obligation. The changed text replaces this with 'Client may be asked to pay', making the surcharge discretionary and also changed the definition of the surcharge to be different from the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%). This creates an in-text contradiction, introducing ambiguity about whether the client is required to pay a surcharge and also contradicts the specific rate, conflicting with the intended meaning of this agreement.",

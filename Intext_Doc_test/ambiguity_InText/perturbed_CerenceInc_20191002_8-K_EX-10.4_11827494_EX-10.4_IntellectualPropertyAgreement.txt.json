                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by excluding voice recordings from the definition of 'Data.' Initially, 'Data' encompassed all forms and mediums. Now, voice recordings are explicitly excluded. This contradiction impacts how data-related clauses in the agreement are interpreted, particularly concerning rights and obligations related to data use. For instance, if Section 3.01 discusses 'Nuance Data' and provides usage rights, it becomes unclear whether these rights extend to voice recordings.",

(b) Technology. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as of the Distribution Date, Nuance hereby grants to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual and irrevocable, transferable (subject to ARTICLE VIII), sublicensable (subject to Section 3.01(g)) license to install, access, use, reproduce, perform, display, modify (including the right to create improvements and derivative works), further develop, sell, manufacture, distribute and market products and services based on, using or incorporating the Nuance Shared Technology Assets within the SpinCo Field of Use, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof.

(d) Trademarks. The Parties acknowledge and agree that no rights are granted to the SpinCo Group in this Agreement with respect to any Trademarks or Domain Names, provided that certain rights and obligations with respect to the use by the SpinCo Group of certain Nuance Trademarks and related Domain Names shall be set forth in the Transitional Trademark License Agreement. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Transitional Trademark License Agreement, the terms of the Transitional Trademark License Agreement shall control. (e) Nuance Data. The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain rights and obligations with respect to the use or benefit by the SpinCo Group of certain Nuance Data shall be as provided in Schedule B. (f) OEM Technology. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that this Section 3.01 does not grant any rights or licenses to any OEM Technology, which is subject to certain separate agreements between the Parties, and to the extent there is a conflict between this Agreement and such separate agreements, such separate agreements shall control. (g) Sublicenses. The licenses granted in Sections 3.01(a), (b) and (c) to the SpinCo Group include the right to grant sublicenses within the scope of such licenses only to members of the SpinCo Group and, without any further right to sublicense, to their respective (i) contractors, distributors, manufacturers and resellers, in each case solely for the benefit of the SpinCo Business, and (ii) end users and customers, in each case solely in connection with the use of products and services of the SpinCo Business. Notwithstanding the forgoing, subject to Section 3.02(b) and ARTICLE VI, members of the SpinCo Group may only sublicense the Nuance Shared Technology Assets pursuant to terms and conditions as protective as those under which it licenses its own Technology of a similar nature and value, and in any event terms and conditions that provide for commercially reasonable protection for the source code, structure and other confidential and proprietary elements of the Nuance Shared Technology Assets. The SpinCo Group shall remain liable for any breach or default of the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement by any of its sublicensees."

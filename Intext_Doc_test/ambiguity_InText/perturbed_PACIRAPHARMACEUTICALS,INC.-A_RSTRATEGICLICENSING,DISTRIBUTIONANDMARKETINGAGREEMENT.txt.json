                "explanation": "The modification removes the phrase 'for only so long as such Control exists' from the definition of 'Affiliate.' This creates an in-text contradiction because in other sections, the agreement may rely on the understanding that affiliation ceases when control ceases. This change could lead to disputes over obligations if a company was once an affiliate but is no longer controlled by the party.",

                "explanation": "The change removes EKR responsibility to ensure packaging, labeling, etc. complies with Applicable Laws. This is an in-text contradiction because Section 4.12 says 'EKR shall obtain and maintain all necessary licenses, permits, records and authorizations required by Applicable Laws'. Now, section 4.18 states EKR isn't responsible for complying packaging, labeling, etc with Applicable Laws, but section 4.12 states otherwise.",

The original text states EKR Improvements are owned by EKR but licensed to PPI upon termination, and Joint Improvements are jointly owned. The modified text states that all EKR improvements shall be owned by PPI and the Joint Improvements are owned by EKR in addition to the all the Parties interest. This creates conflict since the owner of these said improvements would be up for debate and the terms may not be enforceable if any dispute arises",

In order to maintain the exclusive rights to sell, lease, distribute and service Products in the Market, the Distributor must use all commercially reasonably efforts to purchase for sale to subdistributors the following minimum quantities of the Products from the Company: On the commencement of the Term Distributor will issue to the Company an irrevocable letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference. The LC shall have a two (2) month term, and shall be renewed for five (5) consecutive bimonthly periods. A minimum of a $250,000.00 purchase order must be received by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month period. The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for Distributor's purchases, which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are Page -2- provided by the Company as Exhibit C. The Company will be entitled to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC. (A) 375 units in the first Product Year (1999) (B) 750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000) (C) 937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001) (D) 1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002) (E) 1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003) (F) 1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004) (G) 2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005) (H) 2,856 unit each in the lat three years of the initial Term of this Agreement and any renewals thereof. For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period following the commencement of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve (12) months thereafter. Distributor's expected sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter. Sales in excess of the expected sales which are actually made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation, if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for year two and 60 units are sold in year one and 195 units are sold in year two, the expectation for year two will have been met, but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the Distributor shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the Distributor's exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market, may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated. Company agrees that Distributor shall not be liable or subject to reevaluation for failure to meet expectations due to any occurrence beyond Distributor's reasonable control, including, but not limited to, Acts of God, fires, floods, wars, sabotage, accidents in shipping, labor disturbances, weather conditions, governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by Company, failure of Company to honor warranties or otherwise materially support the Products. The aggregate units to be sold on an annual basis described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'must use' to 'is encouraged to use,' the obligation to purchase minimum quantities becomes non-mandatory and discretionary. Similarly, modifying 'Distributor will issue' to 'Distributor is encouraged to issue' makes the letter of credit issuance optional. This introduces ambiguity and affects enforceability, contradicting the original intent of maintaining exclusive rights based on guaranteed minimum purchases. Another section, specifically the clause about reevaluation of exclusive rights ('If the Distributor shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the Distributor's exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market, may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated') is contradicted, because the original text enforces mandatory requirements, whereas the modified text makes minimum purchase volumes purely optional.",

The modified definition broadens this to include any entity expressing interest, regardless of location or whether they actually become a sublicensee. This introduces an in-text contradiction because Section 2.1, which grants rights based on the definition of 'Customer,' now becomes ambiguous. It's unclear if the rights extend to just potential customers or only those who actually subscribe to the services and fall within the original definition's limitations.",

If during the Warranty Period the Software and MarketSite.net Service does not perform in substantial compliance with the Documentation, Commerce One shall take all commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Software and MarketSite.net Service, or if correction of the Software and MarketSite.net Service is reasonably not possible, replace such Software and MarketSite.net Service free of charge. Commerce One will replace any defective media returned to Commerce One during the Warranty Period. In the event any such breach of warranty can not be reasonably corrected at Commerce One's sole expense, Corio has the right to terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of all prepaid fees. The foregoing are Corio's sole and exclusive remedies for breach of product warranty. The warranty set forth above is made to and for the benefit of Corio only. The warranty shall not apply only if: (a) the Software and MarketSite.net Service has been not properly installed and used at all times and in accordance with the Documentation; and (b) Corio has requested modifications, alterations or additions to the Software and MarketSite.net Service that cause it to deviate from the Documentation."

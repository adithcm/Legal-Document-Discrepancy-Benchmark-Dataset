                "explanation": "This change broadens the definition of 'Specialty' to include Target Professionals with Hepatology designations, directly contradicting the original definition that excludes them. Additionally, it replaces Dova's Third Party Data Source with internal sales data reported by Valeant, altering the data source used to determine specialty, which introduces further uncertainty. This change creates an in-text contradiction because section 4.1.1 states, Valeant shall conduct the Valeant Activities for the Product in the Specialty in the Field. By changing the original definition and removing the exclusivity in the specialty, can change in the scope of Valeant Activities and potentially impact royalties.",

Valeant shall use its own discretion to ensure that the Product Materials prepared and approved by it are in compliance with the Regulatory Approval for the Product, the Product Labeling and Applicable Law.",
                "explanation": "By altering Section 4.4.1(a) and providing Valeant the right to modify Product training materials for Field Force Personnel, contradicts the original definition of Dova having sole responsibility for the content of training and marketing materials (the Product Materials). The original contract gives Dova control over the Product Materials. This could allow Valeant to create materials that aren't aligned with Dova's intended messaging. This is an in-text contradiction because it directly conflicts with Section 4.5.1 Activities of Field Force Personnel that states, Valeant shall instruct and cause the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing to use only the Product Labeling and, subject to the terms of Section 4.4, Product Materials approved by Dova for the conduct of the Valeant Activities for the Product and consistent with Applicable Laws.",

                "explanation": "By changing Section 5.8 and making Valeant jointly responsible for accepting and filling purchase orders, billing and returns for the product it introduces ambiguity and is conflicting with the the original text stating, Dova shall be exclusively responsible for accepting and filling purchase orders, billing, and returns with respect to the Product. By changing the responsibilities of Sales Revenues, creates an in-text contradiction since this can cause issues in Financial Provisons. 6.

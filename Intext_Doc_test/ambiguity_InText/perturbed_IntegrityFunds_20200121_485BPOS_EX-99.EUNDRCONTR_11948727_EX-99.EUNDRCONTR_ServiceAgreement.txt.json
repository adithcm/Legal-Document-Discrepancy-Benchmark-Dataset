                "original_text": "Section 1.2 Integrity agrees to use its best efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares at the public offering price, as determined in accordance with the Registration Statement, and will undertake such advertising and promotion as it believes is reasonable in connection with such solicitation. Integrity shall order Shares from the Fund only to the extent that it shall have received purchase orders therefore.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.2 Integrity agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares, and will undertake such advertising and promotion as it deems necessary in connection with such solicitation. Integrity may order Shares from the Fund irrespective of whether it has received purchase orders, allowing for speculative investments.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes 'best efforts' to 'commercially reasonable efforts,' weakening the obligation. It also removes the requirement that Integrity order Shares only upon receiving purchase orders, contradicting Section 1.1 which states Integrity will act as principal underwriter for the distribution of Shares covered by the registration statement and prospectus, implying a direct link between solicitations and orders. It also creates an in-text contradiction within Section 1, as now solicitations and orders are decoupled allowing Integrity to order irrespective of purchase orders.",

For purposes of this Agreement, \"distribution expenses\" of Integrity shall mean all expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, including, but not limited to, office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services; (b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising; (c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund; (d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund; (e) costs involved in obtaining whatever information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and 2 Source: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020 (f) sales commissions and other fees paid, together with related financing costs to brokers, dealers or other selling entities with a dealer agreement in effect for the sale of Fund Shares.

For purposes of this Agreement, \"distribution expenses\" of Integrity shall mean all expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, including, but not limited to, office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services; (b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising; (c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund; (d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund; (e) costs involved in obtaining whatever information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and 2 Source: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020 (f) sales commissions and other fees paid, together with related financing costs to brokers, dealers or other selling entities with a dealer agreement in effect for the sale of Fund Shares.

Section 1.7 states Integrity shall receive the excess, if any, of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity. This infers the Integrity shall receive the expenses and it also contradicts the clause that Integrity will bear all expenses as it contradicts it being some. There is now an in-text contradiction if Integrity exceeds the cap and requires reimbursement.",

                "explanation": "The removed clause ensures the Qualified Trustees which are not interested persons need to approve every year and insert a termination clause to only occur if Integrity is in a material breach of this contract. The original clause states that the contract can be terminated with 60 days written notice, without penalty, by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities. Introducing this material breach condition directly contradicts the termination with a 60 days written notice by a qualified trustee. It creates an in-text contradiction, because the text now indicates it can be terminated by a 60 day notice while also including a clause that states it can only be terminated if Integrity is in breach.",

If you instantly know the setting of one switch, you *instantly* know the setting of the other, *no matter how far apart they are*.  That's kind of like **entanglement**.  When qubits are entangled, changing the state of one instantly affects the state of the other, even if they are separated by vast distances. This interconnectedness allows for incredibly complex calculations.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Omissions also cause **in-text contradictions** when a **key contractual clause is removed**, but **other sections still reference it**, creating an internal contradiction.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a **key term** in the contract.\n",
    "    2. Modify its definition in different sections so that they **conflict**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure the contradiction creates **uncertainty in enforcement**.\n",
    "    4. For that perturbation, make sure in the file there should be **2-3** of them. \n",
    "    5. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",
    "    6. Make sure that when taking the original texts, there should be no jumps between sentences. Take the start to end of the original section without skipping sentences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Examples of Missing Clauses Creating Inconsistencies:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Section 5:** \"If the contract is terminated, the client shall receive a prorated refund.\"\n",
    "    - **Omitted Clause:** \"Refund calculations shall be based on monthly service fees.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The contract **still references refunds**, but there’s **no formula provided**, making enforcement ambiguous.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Section 2:** \"The vendor is responsible for defective products.\"\n",
    "    - **Omitted Clause:** \"The vendor must provide free replacements.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Section 2 **still requires responsibility**, but there’s **no requirement for replacements**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Section 8:** \"Employees may appeal a termination decision.\"\n",
    "    - **Omitted Clause:** \"The appeals process is outlined in Section 12.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The contract **references an appeals process**, but that process **no longer exists**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Section 3:** \"Late payments incur a penalty.\"\n",
    "    - **Omitted Clause:** \"The penalty shall be a 5% surcharge.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** **The penalty is still mentioned**, but its amount is **undefined**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Section 7:** \"Clients must comply with security audits.\"\n",
    "    - **Omitted Clause:** \"Security audit requirements are listed in Appendix A.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The contract **references an appendix that no longer exists**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The employer shall provide employees with a 30-minute unpaid meal break for every five consecutive hours worked, in compliance with state labor laws. The employer must also provide a second 30-minute break if an employee’s shift exceeds 10 hours. Employees are not required to perform any work duties during their break periods.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The employer shall provide employees with meal breaks in accordance with internal policies. Employees are encouraged to take breaks as needed.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** By removing the specific **30-minute meal break requirement**, the modified text contradicts **state labor laws** that mandate legally defined break periods. 'Encouraged to take breaks' introduces uncertainty, suggesting that breaks are discretionary rather than required. This contradicts state law if another contract section claims full compliance with labor regulations.\n",

Payment to the Distributor for the sale of the Products to Customers shall be as follows: (i) Company will pay Distributor (or its Assignee) Ten Percent (10%) of the Master Distributor Override generated by each Customer Kiosk Location. (Master Distributor Override (\"MDO\") shall mean Total Revenue per Customer Kiosk Location collected by SRXS from third party payors and patient cash payments). This 10% of the total revenue generated is payable only if the EBITDA is a positive EBITDA and exceeds the 10% of the revenue. In cases of a positive EBITDA but shortage of funds compared to the 10% of the revenue, Distributor will take less than 10%. If the EBITDA is negative, no payments will be made to Distributor. Additionally, it will be the sole responsibility of Distributor to make a full disclosure of the 10% MDO to all its clients. (ii) The MDO will be payable within ninety (90) days from the date of the transaction (First Month payable by the end of ninety (90) days from the end of the month). (iii) For each Customer Kiosk contracted and implemented by Distributor, Company shall also pay a management fee of 40% of Net Income (Net Income for this purpose is defined as EBITDA less percentage paid to the client. The balance is then split 40%/60% to A3 Development Group, LLC and Smart RX Systems, Inc. respectively). Net Income is defined as total Customer revenue collections less all incurred expenses, and is the distributable cash generated by each Customer location. These payments will also follow the payment policy outlined in 4.1 above. (iv) The Payment(s) to Distributor or its Assignee, as set forth herein, shall be further set forth in each Class A Series Agreement, along with the respective ownership interest for both the Company and the Distributor (or its Assignee) for each respective Kiosk Location which shall have its own separate Series, as defined by the Texas Business Organizations Code for Series Limited Liability Companies, and as set forth in the Company's Operating Agreement. (v) The Payments set forth in Section 4.1(i) and 4.1(iii) above will reflect the following: The Parties further agree that to the extent a Pharmacy Kiosk is located in a medical facility that is subject to the Stark Law (or similar State Stark Law), that such medical facility may not be able to fulfill any Federal Healthcare Program (\"FHP\") (Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare) prescription, but rather the Pharmacy Kiosk will bill such FHP prescriptions through a separate billing system. The Parties cannot share such FHP revenues with the Healthcare Facility Investors who are subject to the applicable Stark Laws, but Company and A3 Development Group, LLC shall share in the EBITDA on a 60/40 basis respectfully.\n",

      "Warning: Could not find section in text: 5.5 Insurance During the term of this Agreement, you shall maintain in force under policies of insurance issued by licensed insurers approved by us insurance coverage as we from time to time require. You must maintain insurance related to your operation of the Franchised Business. Such insurance coverage will include: 5.5.1 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: broad form comprehensive general liability coverage against claims for employment practices coverage, bodily and personal injury, death and property damage caused by or occurring in conjunction with the conduct of business by you pursuant to this Agreement and broad form contractual liability coverage, including errors and omissions coverage, under one or more policies of insurance containing minimum liability coverage prescribed by us from time to time, but in no event in an amount less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) aggregate. Such insurance shall not have a deductible or self-insured retention in excess of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000); 5.5.2 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: automobile liability insurance coverage, including owned and non-owned vehicles, with limits of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence; 5.5.3 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: worker’s compensation and employer’s liability insurance in statutory amounts, unemployment insurance and state disability insurance as required by governing law for your employees; 5.5.4 As it relates to the Unit Franchisees’ operation in the Master Territory, and if you elect to obtain such coverage: general liability insurance, which insurance is in addition to any general liability insurance the Unit Franchisees are required to maintain under their Unit Franchise Agreements. You shall also maintain such additional insurance as is necessary to comply with all legal requirements concerning insurance. We may periodically increase the amounts of coverage required under such insurance policies and require different or additional kinds of insurance at any time including excess liability insurance to reflect inflation, identification of new risks, changes in law or standards of liability, higher damage awards, or other relevant changes in circumstances. The insurance policies required herein shall: (a) name us as an additional named insured and contain a waiver of all subrogation rights against us, our affiliates, and our and their successors and assigns; (b) provide for thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to us of any material modification, cancellation, or expiration of such policy; (c) provide that the coverage applies separately to each insured against whom a claim is brought as though a separate policy had been issued to each insured; (d) contain no provision which in any way limits or reduces coverage for you in the event of a claim by any one or more of the parties indemnified under this Agreement; (e) be primary to and without right of contribution from any other insurance purchased by the parties indemnified under this Agreement; and (f) extend to and provide indemnity for all obligations assumed by you hereunder and all other items for which you are required to indemnify us under this Agreement. You shall provide us with evidence of the insurance required hereunder not later than ten (10) days before you begin operating as a Master Franchisee, and with a complete copy of each insurance policy no more than thirty (30) days after delivery of the original proof of insurance. Thereafter, prior to the expiration of the term of each insurance policy, you shall furnish us with a copy of each renewal or replacement insurance policy to be maintained by you for the immediately following term and evidence of the payment of the premium therefor. Should you, for any reason, fail to procure or maintain the insurance required by this Agreement, as such requirements may be revised from time to time by us in writing, we shall have the right and authority (without, however, any obligation to do so) immediately to procure such insurance and to charge same to you, which charges shall be payable by you immediately upon notice together with a ten percent (10%) administrative fee. The foregoing remedies shall be in addition to any other remedies we may have at law or in equity. The maintenance of sufficient insurance coverage shall be your responsibility. Your obligations to maintain insurance coverage as herein described shall not be affected in any manner by reason of any separate insurance maintained by us nor shall the maintenance of such insurance relieve you of any indemnification obligations under this Agreement.\n",

Payment to the Distributor for the sale of the Products to Customers shall be as follows: (i) Company will pay Distributor (or its Assignee) Ten Percent (10%) of the Master Distributor Override generated by each Customer Kiosk Location. (Master Distributor Override (\"MDO\") shall mean Total Revenue per Customer Kiosk Location collected by SRXS from third party payors and patient cash payments). This 10% of the total revenue generated is payable only if the EBITDA is a positive EBITDA and exceeds the 10% of the revenue. In cases of a positive EBITDA but shortage of funds compared to the 10% of the revenue, Distributor will take less than 10%. If the EBITDA is negative, no payments will be made to Distributor. Additionally, it will be the sole responsibility of Distributor to make a full disclosure of the 10% MDO to all its clients. (ii) The MDO will be payable within ninety (90) days from the date of the transaction (First Month payable by the end of ninety (90) days from the end of the month). (iii) For each Customer Kiosk contracted and implemented by Distributor, Company shall also pay a management fee of 40% of Net Income (Net Income for this purpose is defined as EBITDA less percentage paid to the client. The balance is then split 40%/60% to A3 Development Group, LLC and Smart RX Systems, Inc. respectively). Net Income is defined as total Customer revenue collections less all incurred expenses, and is the distributable cash generated by each Customer location. These payments will also follow the payment policy outlined in 4.1 above. (iv) The Payment(s) to Distributor or its Assignee, as set forth herein, shall be further set forth in each Class A Series Agreement, along with the respective ownership interest for both the Company and the Distributor (or its Assignee) for each respective Kiosk Location which shall have its own separate Series, as defined by the Texas Business Organizations Code for Series Limited Liability Companies, and as set forth in the Company's Operating Agreement. (v) The Payments set forth in Section 4.1(i) and 4.1(iii) above will reflect the following: The Parties further agree that to the extent a Pharmacy Kiosk is located in a medical facility that is subject to the Stark Law (or similar State Stark Law), that such medical facility may not be able to fulfill any Federal Healthcare Program (\"FHP\") (Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare) prescription, but rather the Pharmacy Kiosk will bill such FHP prescriptions through a separate billing system. The Parties cannot share such FHP revenues with the Healthcare Facility Investors who are subject to the applicable Stark Laws, but Company and A3 Development Group, LLC shall share in the EBITDA on a 60/40 basis respectfully.\n",

Instead of fixed compensation, the Affiliate receives result- dependent Advertising Cost Compensation (also known in the element 5 Control Panel as \"Commission\") in exchange for publishing the advertisements. The Advertising Cost Compensation depends on the actual sales generated by end users referred via the electronic advertisement (the Affiliate's link).",

                "explanation": "Here the term \"cancel\" is replaced by the word \"terminate\", and \"Control Panel\" is replaced by the term \"Web Interface\". This could cause confusion regarding the process for ending the agreement. While \"cancel\" implies a simple nullification, \"terminate\" suggests a more formal cessation with potential consequences. The change from \"Control Panel\" to \"Web Interface\" introduces ambiguity about the exact method for initiating termination. This perturbation undermines the clarity of the termination clause.",

For the avoidance of doubt: (a) all Intellectual Property Rights In and to the Marks and the Business Data shall remain the property of PC Financial or its Affiliates as the case may be.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Marks' is replaced with 'Brand Identifiers' in the definition section, but Section 5.1(a) still refers to 'Marks'. This creates confusion as to what intellectual property PC Financial retains. Are 'Brand Identifiers' and 'Marks' the same thing? This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty in the enforcement of intellectual property rights.",

                "explanation": "The exception regarding data retention is modified. Originally, Mobimagic could retain 'records of transactions' for 'invoicing and billing'. Now, they can retain 'metadata' for 'system improvements'. It's unclear whether records of transactions are included in metadata. If metadata means something different, it could lead to a dispute over compliance with data privacy laws. Also, the purpose changed, which also adds confusion about what data Mobimagic can save, and what are the legitimate purposes.",

                "explanation": "The term \"Servicing Standard\" is replaced with \"Operational Guideline,\" \"reasonable care\" is replaced with \"standard care,\" \"comparable receivables that it services for itself or others\" is replaced with \"receivables that it services,\" and \"Applicable Law\" is replaced with \"regulations\". The change from \"Servicing Standard\" to \"Operational Guideline\" creates uncertainty because the contract later refers to the original term. By using the term “regulations” the term Applicable Law becomes vague. By eliminating \"for itself or others\" it is unlcear for what other type of receivables they are comparing to.",

Any opinion, filing or other services performed by the Servicer hereunder that generates additional costs shall be at the expense of the Owner.",
                "explanation": "Here, \"Servicing Fee\" is replaced with \"Service Payment\", and \"Servicing Period\" is replaced with \"Servicing Month\". This creates confusion as to what the correct terminology is. This also creates confusion as to the actual amount that would be paid to the servicer. If the servicer is expecting a fee and instead gets a payment they may take legal action.",

Sub-Servicers; Collection Agents.\n\n(a) The Servicer may appoint one or more Persons (including any Affiliate) as a sub-servicer (each a \"Sub-Servicer\") with respect to some or all of the Serviced Assets to perform any of the Servicer's obligations hereunder from time to time in its sole discretion; provided, however, that such servicing arrangement and the term of the related subservicing agreement (if any) must provide for the servicing of the Serviced Assets in a manner equivalent or greater than the Servicing Standard; provided, further, that the Servicer shall remain obligated and be liable to the Owner for the servicing and administering of the Serviced Assets in accordance with the provisions hereof without diminution of such obligation and liability by virtue of the appointment of such Sub-Servicer and to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Servicer alone were servicing and administering the Serviced Assets.",
                "changed_text": "Section 10. Sub-Servicers; Collection Agents.\n\n(a) The Servicer may appoint one or more Persons (including any Affiliate) as a vendor (each a \"Sub-Servicer\") with respect to some or all of the Serviced Assets to perform any of the Servicer's obligations hereunder from time to time in its sole discretion; provided, however, that such servicing arrangement and the term of the related vendor agreement (if any) must provide for the servicing of the Serviced Assets in a manner equivalent or greater than the Servicing Standard; provided, further, that the Servicer shall remain obligated and be liable to the Owner for the servicing and administering of the Serviced Assets in accordance with the provisions hereof without diminution of such obligation and liability by virtue of the appointment of such Sub-Servicer and to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Servicer alone were servicing and administering the Serviced Assets.",
                "explanation": "The term \"Sub-Servicer\" is changed to \"vendor\" in the first sentence, but continues to be referred to as \"Sub-Servicer\" later in the paragraph. This creates an internal contradiction, making it unclear what the agreement actually refers to. This may cause confusion because the term \"Vendor\" is very broad and could mean a variety of providers.",

                "original_text": "As of the VNBJ Closing, except as expressly set forth in this Amendment, the JV Agreement shall immediately cease to have any application or effect with respect to VNBJ, all rights and obligations with respect to VNBJ under the JV Agreement shall terminate and all references to \"Company\" or \"Companies\" in the JV Agreement (either in the body of the JV Agreement or its schedules and other attachments) shall read and be interpreted to mean VNBZ and/or ANRA except as the context otherwise requires.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Company\" to \"Business Entity\" introduces ambiguity. The original JV Agreement likely defines \"Company,\" while \"Business Entity\" is undefined. This could lead to disputes about which sections of the JV Agreement still apply after the closing.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Veoneer Party\" and \"Nissin Party\" to \"Veoneer Member\" and \"Nissin Member\", respectively, introduces ambiguity because 'Party' is defined in the opening paragraph but the word 'Member' is not, and suggests that the agreement is binding on the individual members rather than corporate entities. This raises questions about the scope of liability, particularly if 'Member' refers to individuals or different entities within the Veoneer or Nissin groups.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Directors and Officers\" to \"Board Members and Executives\" creates uncertainty regarding who is covered by the indemnification clause. \"Directors and Officers\" is a common and generally understood term with legal precedent, while \"Board Members and Executives\" lacks a precise legal definition and may exclude certain individuals who would otherwise be covered, potentially leading to disputes over indemnification obligations.",

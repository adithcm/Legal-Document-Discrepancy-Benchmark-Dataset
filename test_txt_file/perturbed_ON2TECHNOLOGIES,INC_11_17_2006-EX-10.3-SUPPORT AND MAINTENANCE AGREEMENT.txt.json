                "explanation": "In this scenario, the terms 'Confidential Information' and 'Sensitive Data' are used seemingly interchangeably within the same section, particularly within the same enumerated list of obligations (5.1.1 and 5.1.4). The term 'Sensitive Data' is introduced and then abandoned, with the rest of the section reverting to 'Confidential Information'. This creates confusion about whether 'Sensitive Data' is a subset of, equivalent to, or distinct from 'Confidential Information'. Without a clear definition or consistent usage, it's unclear which information the Receiving Party's obligations extend to. Is the Receiving Party required to destroy 'Sensitive Data' but not necessarily all 'Confidential Information'? This uncertainty creates a significant risk of dispute and weakens the enforceability of the confidentiality provisions.",

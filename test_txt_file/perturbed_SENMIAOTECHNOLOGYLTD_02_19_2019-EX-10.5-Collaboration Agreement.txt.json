                "explanation": "The terms 'liquidated damages' and 'termination fees' are used interchangeably in this section, creating confusion about the exact financial obligation of the driver.

                "explanation": "Using 'fines' instead of 'liquidated damages' implies a penal nature rather than compensation for actual loss. 'Deal' instead of 'Agreement' creates uncertainty about which agreement is being terminated. Replacing 'Affiliates' with 'Subsidiaries' narrows the scope, potentially excluding entities that might have been included under the original, broader term. This creates confusion and limits the agreement's reach in cases of violations.",

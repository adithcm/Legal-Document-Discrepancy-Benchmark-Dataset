                "original_text": "MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the solvency of Thrivent Financial becomes impaired, you may be required to contribute additional funds. The Finance Committee will determine the method of calculation for these additional funds. It will be based on a metric decided at their discretion. You may resolve the amount owed by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not resolve the owed funds within 90 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 7% per year.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Society' to 'Thrivent Financial' introduces uncertainty, as the original text defines 'Society' elsewhere. Replacing 'extra payment' with 'additional funds' obscures the nature of the obligation. Altering 'Board of Directors' to 'Finance Committee' and 'each member's fair share of the deficiency' to 'a metric decided at their discretion' adds further ambiguity. The change from '60 days' to '90 days' and '5%' to '7%' creates conflicting terms.",

Rights and privileges of membership are set forth in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Society. These rights and privileges are separate from the ownership of this contract.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Insured(s)' to 'Policyholder(s)' and 'Annuitant(s)' to 'Recipient(s)' creates ambiguity as to who is being referred to. Replacing 'benefit member of the Society' with 'affiliated parties of Thrivent Financial' changes the nature of the relationship. Altering 'Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Society' to 'Thrivent Financial's internal governance documents' and contradicting the last statement by changing 'separate from the ownership of this contract' to 'contingent upon ownership of this contract' creates conflicting terms.",

                "changed_text": "DISTRIBUTIONS. Each year, Thrivent Financial will calculate available earnings. This contract's portion, if any, will be allocated as a distribution. Since we project minimal earnings attributable to this contract, it is unlikely that any distributions will be allocated.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'DIVIDENDS' to 'DISTRIBUTIONS' and 'divisible surplus' to 'available earnings' without defining them introduces uncertainty. The use of 'credited' vs 'allocated' may also confuse the parties. The change may not explicitly contradict the law, but creates a ambiguity between both terms, adding risk when interpreting the contract.",

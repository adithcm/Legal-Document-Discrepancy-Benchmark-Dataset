                "original_text": "MS hereby grants (subject to any existing third party contractual obligations) to MSCI a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, world- wide, royalty-free license for MSCI to use, modify, copy, create derivative works of and sublicense, for any business purpose, the MS Licensed Materials.",
                "changed_text": "MS hereby grants (subject to any existing third party contractual obligations) to MSCI a non-exclusive, term-based, revocable, regionally-limited, royalty-bearing permit for MSCI to utilize, adjust, replicate, produce alternative versions of and authorize use, solely for internal business operations, the MS Licensed Materials.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'license' and 'permit' are used interchangeably, but their meanings are significantly different. 'Perpetual, irrevocable, world-wide, royalty-free license' are replaced with 'term-based, revocable, regionally-limited, royalty-bearing permit', which completely contradicts the initial grant, creating uncertainty on the nature and scope of the grant.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'license' and 'authorization' are confused, creating an internal contradiction about the nature of the grant. The original text enforces a 'non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, world- wide, royalty-free license', whereas the modified version replaces with 'temporary, recallable, nationally-bound, fee-based authorization' This creates conflicting obligations.",

                "original_text": "Any action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any other New York State court sitting in New York County, and each of the parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'action,' 'lawsuit,' 'provision,' and 'clause' are used interchangeably, which creates contradiction. The original text enforces that any action shall be brought in the courts of New York, while the modified text specifies that any lawsuit shall be initiated exclusively in Delaware courts. This change makes it unclear where disputes should be resolved, thereby creating potential conflict.",

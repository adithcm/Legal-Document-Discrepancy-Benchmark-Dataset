                "explanation": "Replacing \"Site\" with \"domain\" changes the fundamental definition, while referring to \"product\" adds another layer of discrepancy. This contradiction blurs what exactly Impresse is responsible for, whether the whole website or just the domain name.",

                "explanation": "Changing “Users” to “Clients”, “Site” to “Portal,” and “register” to “sign up” without defining these new terms creates confusion. This blurs who the agreement applies to, whether it's just casual site users or paying clients. Also, “via” and “formerly signed up” have been altered to increase ambiguity.",

User Data shall be maintained by each Party as Confidential Information of the other Party during the Term and 5 years thereafter, provided such User Data may be disclosed only as part of an aggregation or analysis of all User Data but not as independent data. Upon termination of the Agreement, VerticalNet and Impresse shall jointly own all User Data. Neither Party shall use the User Data other than in accordance with the VerticalNet privacy policy and all applicable laws during the Term and thereafter.",

This will be done by sending a message with such information to a digital address designated by VerticalNet when the request occurs. Client Records will be kept by each Party as Private Details of the other Party during the Timeframe and 5 years afterward. This implies Client Records may only be revealed if part of a compilation or examination of all Client Records, but not as separate facts. When the Deal ends, VerticalNet and Impresse will jointly possess all Consumer Details. Neither Party is to use the Client Records other than what matches the VerticalNet privacy guidelines and all effective legislations during the Timeframe and forward.",
                "explanation": "Swapping \"User Data\" with \"Client Records\", \"User\" with \"Consumer\", \"Co-Branded Site\" with \"Co-Branded Channel\", and \"Agreement\" with \"Deal\" generates inconsistencies. It remains uncertain whether 'Client Records' are 'User Data' or hold a distinctive importance. Introducing terms like 'Private Details', 'Timeframe', 'Deal', and 'effective legislations' increases ambiguity, causing uncertainty about what information is protected and for how long.",

                "explanation": "The term \"Managers\" is replaced with \"executives\" and “unanimous consent” is replaced with “majority vote”, creating ambiguity as to whether \"Managers\" and \"executives\" are the same and contradicting the original requirement of unanimous consent for their appointment, replacement, or removal. This could cause disputes over who has the power to make these decisions.",

                "explanation": "The term “Duties of Members” is replaced with “Responsibilities of participants” which may/may not be the same entity and removes the requirement that Members’ interests must not be affected by amendments unless with unanimous consent. The modified version implies that responsibilities can be changed without considering the impact on individual Members, creating a direct contradiction and potential for unfair changes.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Subcontractor' to 'Contractor' introduces confusion. Throughout the document, 'Subcontractor' has specific obligations and rights. By using 'Contractor' in the initial definition, it's uncertain if those obligations apply to the newly named entity, creating a contradiction in terms and a lack of clarity regarding the responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Subcontractor' to 'Supplier' and 'firm' to 'estimated' introduces contradiction. The original states that shipment dates are firm, while the modified text uses 'estimated' delivery dates based on 'Supplier' advice. This creates ambiguity around the obligation to meet firm delivery dates.",

                "original_text": "Since Manufacturer is paying the actual manufacturing cost of the product, Supplier has not reserved for any warranty related costs. The Manufacturer acknowledges that it is solely responsible for any warranty costs associated with Manufacturer's Products. Should any nonconformities be detected during or after the manufacturing process, Subcontractor will assist Manufacturer in resolving any quality issues with the suppliers. Subcontractor will provide support to Manufacturer to train Manufacturer's employees to repair the non-conforming products as appropriate.",

The Manufacturer acknowledges that it is solely responsible for any warranty costs associated with Manufacturer's Products. Should any nonconformities be detected during or after the manufacturing process, Technician will assist Manufacturer in resolving any quality issues with the vendors. Technician will provide support to Manufacturer to train Manufacturer's employees to repair the non-conforming products as appropriate.",
                "explanation": "Here, Supplier and Subcontractor are changed to Vendor and Technician respectively. This generates ambiguity. If 'Vendor' is the original 'Supplier', then the warranty terms outlined elsewhere in the document do not necessarily apply. Furthermore, replacing 'Subcontractor' with 'Technician' introduces even greater uncertainty about liability for non-conforming products and the roles and responsibilities each party has.",

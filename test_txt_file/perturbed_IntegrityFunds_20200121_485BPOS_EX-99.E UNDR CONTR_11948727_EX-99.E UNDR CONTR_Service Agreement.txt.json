                "original_text": "In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive the excess, if any, of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as underwriter. The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the \"Plan\") adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive the excess, if any, of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as underwriter. The Fund may also offer Integrity additional compensation as determined by the Compensation Schedule (the \"Schedule\") set forth by the fund manager. The specifics of additional compensation will be at the discretion of the fund manager.",
                "explanation": "The original text guarantees payment of fees according to the Shareholder Services Plan. The modified text replaces 'distribution and/or service fees' with 'additional compensation' and makes it subject to the fund manager's discretion, contradicting the original guaranteed payment structure. This also introduces uncertainty to compensation amounts which were originally set by the Shareholder Services Plan.",

                "changed_text": "All activities by Integrity as underwriter of the Shares should generally align with relevant governmental guidelines and corporate governance practices.",
                "explanation": "The original text enforces a strict adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations, including those of the SEC. The modified text replaces this with 'should generally align,' weakening the obligation and potentially conflicting with mandatory regulatory compliance. This also creates ambiguity by not specifying which governmental guidelines and corporate governance practices apply.",

                "changed_text": "The Fund may, at its discretion, inform Integrity of communications with governmental bodies and of potential regulatory changes.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates immediate written notification from the Fund to Integrity regarding SEC requests, stop orders, and any events affecting the accuracy of the registration statement. The modified text changes this to a discretionary act, replacing 'agrees to advise immediately in writing' with 'may, at its discretion, inform'. This introduces a significant conflict, as Integrity may be left uninformed of critical regulatory matters, increasing risks and contradicting the original obligation.",

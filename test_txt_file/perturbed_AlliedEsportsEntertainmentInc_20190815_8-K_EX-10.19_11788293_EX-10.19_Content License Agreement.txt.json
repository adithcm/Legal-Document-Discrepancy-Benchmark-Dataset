The contract previously defined the Initial Term and Renewal Term as forming the Term, but now it's the Initial Term and Extension Period. This will make the duration of the full agreement uncertain.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Royalty' to 'Compensation' in one instance but keeping the term 'Royalty' in other places within the same paragraph creates confusion. The document defines 'Royalty' elsewhere and makes it unclear if the term 'Compensation' is the same as 'Royalty' or some other payment.",

All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (\"Confidential Information\") is deemed confidential, except for information that Member can demonstrate came to Member's attention by lawful means prior to disclosure to Member; or which, at the time of the disclosure to Member, had become a part of the public domain.",
                "changed_text": "Personnel may, during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose relating to any business, information, knowledge, business secrets or best practices which may be communicated to Personnel or which Personnel may learn by virtue of Personnel's relationship with Franchisee. Only data specifically marked as proprietary is deemed confidential, unless previously known.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits the use of confidential information, whereas the modified version allows the use of information, knowledge, business secrets or best practices for any business purpose, unless specifically labeled as proprietary. This creates a contradiction regarding what information is truly protected, and replaces 'Member' with 'Personnel'.",

                "explanation": "The original text enforces a strict non-compete clause, whereas the modified version allows staff to engage in similar businesses if 'directed by Franchisee.' This completely reverses the intent of the original clause and create conflict between 'Competitive Business' and 'Similar Business'. Also, it introduces 'Staff' instead of 'Member' which creates more confusion.",

The enforcement of this Understanding will be subject to mediation prior to any legal action.",
                "explanation": "The original text describes severe penalties for non-compliance, including court costs and attorney's fees, while the modified version limits the damages to a maximum of $1000 and mandates mediation. This significantly reduces the franchisor's ability to enforce the agreement effectively by adding 'Understanding', adding ambiguity by stating 'spirit of this', replacing the term 'Agreement' with 'Understanding' and replacing 'Member' with 'Personnel'.",

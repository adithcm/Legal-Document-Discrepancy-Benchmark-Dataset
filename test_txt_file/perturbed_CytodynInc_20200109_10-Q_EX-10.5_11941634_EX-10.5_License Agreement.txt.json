(b) Sublicense Rights. The licenses granted to Vyera under this Agreement shall not be transferrable and/or sublicensable without CytoDyn's written consent, which it may grant, condition or withhold in its sole discretion.",

(b) Sublicense Rights. The rights granted to Vyera under this Agreement are fully sublicensable and transferable without CytoDyn's prior authorization.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction on whether Vyera can sublicense/transfer rights, leading to uncertainty in enforcement. In the original agreement, sublicensing requires CytoDyn's consent; in the modified text, it is allowed outright.",

CytoDyn shall conduct the activities under the Development Plan, and shall ensure that its Affiliates and contractors conduct their activities under the Development Plan, in a good scientific manner and in material compliance with Applicable Law, including cGLP, cGCP, cGMP and applicable national and international guidelines.

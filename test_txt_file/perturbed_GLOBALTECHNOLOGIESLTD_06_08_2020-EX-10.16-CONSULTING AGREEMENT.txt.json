The entire document references 'Consultant', creating ambiguity and confusion regarding whether the terms are interchangeable or refer to different roles.

As Consultant's entire compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant $250,000,00 cash compensation. In addition, the Consultant shall earn additional cash compensation for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019.

                "explanation": "Multiple terms are introduced without proper definition ('Service Provider', 'Consultant', 'Contractor'), while others are used interchangeably within the same section. The section starts talking about COMPENSATION TO SERVICE PROVIDER but then goes on to say the cash will be paid to the Consultant. It is unclear whether these roles refer to distinct or overlapping entities. This creates a conflict regarding which entity is entitled to the compensation and affects the enforceability of payment terms.",

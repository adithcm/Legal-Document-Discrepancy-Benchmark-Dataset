                "original_text": "\"Customer\" means a third party who purchases the Products from Reseller within the Territory, for its internal use only (including for the personal use of its End Users), such as nursing homes. \"End User\" means a third party who is a customer of Customer or is otherwise related to a customer of Customer, and who purchases and/or uses the Products within the Territory, for its personal use only.",
                "changed_text": "\"Customer\" means a third party who purchases the Products from Reseller within the Territory, for its internal use only. \"End User\" means a third party who purchases the Products directly from the Supplier for their internal use. Such as nursing homes.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'End User' is changed to state they purchase directly from the 'Supplier,' contradicting the original definition and the overall reseller agreement structure where 'Reseller' is meant to sell to the 'Customer,' who then may have 'End Users'. This creates confusion about who the 'End User' actually purchases from and bypasses the Reseller.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Distributor' is replaced with 'Reseller', changing who is responsible for maintaining the server interface.

                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "changed_text": "The participants hereby agree to jointly prepare and submit to the relevant regulatory bodies this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any subsequent modifications thereto detailing each of the participant's holdings of shares of the company specified herein, and hereby state that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being submitted on behalf of each of the participants pursuant to and in compliance with the requirements of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'undersigned' with 'participants', 'file' with 'submit', 'regulatory authorities' with 'regulatory bodies', 'amendments' with 'modifications', 'ownership of securities' with 'holdings of shares', and 'issuer named herein' with 'company specified herein' introduces inconsistent terminology for the same concepts. It's unclear if 'undersigned' and 'participants' have the exact same obligations.",

                "changed_text": "The parties acknowledge that each will ensure the prompt submission of such changes, and for the thoroughness and correctness of the details relating to their representation therein, but will not be held liable for the thoroughness and correctness of the details relating to others, unless they are aware or have grounds to suspect that such details are incorrect.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'undersigned' with 'parties', 'filing' with 'submission', 'amendments' with 'changes', 'completeness and accuracy of the information' with 'thoroughness and correctness of the details' and 'knows or has reason to believe' with 'are aware or have grounds to suspect' introduces ambiguity. Are 'parties' and 'undersigned' the same with the same duties? Does 'submission' have the same requirements as 'filing'?",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Dated' with 'Effective as of' introduces a different legal nuance. While seemingly similar, 'Dated' simply refers to the date the agreement was signed, whereas 'Effective as of' denotes the date the agreement becomes legally binding. It is unclear whether the intention is of creation or activation of the agreement.",

                "original_text": "Effective with Period Two, Schoolpop shall provide to AEIS a twelve (12) month sold Card forecast and Card inventory forecast (hereinafter defined). In addition, Schoolpop shall provide AEIS with a monthly forecast, no later than the third business day of each month, of the number of Cards to be sold to its clients, (\"Sold Card Forecast\") as well as the number of Cards to be stocked in inventory, (\"Card Inventory Forecast\"), (collectively referred to as the \"Forecasts\") for the month, ninety-days out. For example, Schoolpop shall provide AEIS with the Card Inventory Forecast and Sold Card Forecast in August for the month of November. The Forecasts will be relied on, (\"Locked\") at the time they are reported.",
                "changed_text": "Effective with Period Two, Schoolpop shall provide to AEIS a twelve (12) month sold Card forecast and Card inventory forecast (hereinafter defined). In addition, Schoolpop may provide AEIS with a quarterly forecast, no later than the last business day of the quarter, of the number of Cards to be sold to its clients, (\"Sold Card Projection\") as well as the number of Cards to be stocked in inventory, (\"Card Inventory Estimate\"), (collectively referred to as the \"Estimates\") for the next quarter, ninety-days out. For example, Schoolpop may provide AEIS with the Card Inventory Estimate and Sold Card Projection in August for the month of November. The Estimates are optional, and won't be relied on, (\"Optional\") at the time they are reported.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a monthly forecast that AEIS relies on, creating a specific obligation. The modified text changes the forecast to a quarterly projection, makes it optional, and states that it will not be relied upon. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the frequency, mandatory nature, and reliance on the forecast.",

                "original_text": "Schoolpop agrees that it will review all requests for each Program requested by the Client and will use reasonable and customary business practices to qualify and recommend Clients proposed for a Program. Schoolpop shall take commercially reasonable efforts to ensure all information requested for a Client is true, accurate and correct. AEIS may, from time to time, provide Schoolpop with commercially reasonable qualification standards for Clients. Schoolpop shall not knowingly submit an Order to AEIS on behalf of any Client that does not meet any such standards.",
                "changed_text": "Schoolpop suggests that it will analyze a few requests for each Program requested by the Consumer and use a few ordinary and atypical business practices to qualify and recommend Consumers proposed for a Program. Schoolpop might take poor and uncommercial efforts to ensure a little information requested for a Consumer is generally true, accurate and correct. AEIS may, from time to time, decide to provide Schoolpop with absurd qualification standards for Consumers. Schoolpop shall knowingly submit an Order to AEIS on behalf of any Consumer, even if doesn't meet such standards.",
                "explanation": "The original text puts an obligation on Schoolpop to ensure its client meets the qualification standards. The modified text changes \"Client\" to \"Consumer\", changes the responsibility of the company to analyze its Consumer to 'suggest,' and that they 'might' ensure the accuracy of the provided data. The most contradicting part is that they can now knowingly submit an order to AEIS even if the Consumer doesn't meet the minimum standards set, which contradicts the original intent of the contract.",

                "original_text": "Effective with Period One, Schoolpop's designated contact shall place Orders by submitting data in an electronic document via email to AEIS. Schoolpop will be assigned a user name and password that will be used for identification when placing Orders using easyorder(TM). Schoolpop authorizes AEIS to accept and process Orders from anyone using Schoolpop's password. AEIS will have no obligation or responsibility for verifying the identity of anyone using Schoolpop's password. Schoolpop shall have the responsibility of safeguarding Schoolpop's password and should not reveal its password to anyone. AEIS will not ask Schoolpop in an unsolicited telephone call or email for its password. In addition, Schoolpop should take precautions when using a computer that is not its own or in a public setting. If Schoolpop suspects that someone else may have had access to its password, Schoolpop shall notify AEIS immediately.",
                "changed_text": "Ineffective with Period One, Schoolpop's undedicated contact might submit Orders by writing data on a physical document to AEIS. Schoolpop will not be assigned a user name and password to use EasyOrder(TM). Schoolpop authorizes AEIS to not accept and not process Orders from someone not using Schoolpop's password. AEIS will have the obligation to verify the identity of anyone using Schoolpop's password. Schoolpop shall not have the responsibility of safeguarding Schoolpop's password and may reveal its password to anyone. AEIS will ask Schoolpop in an unsolicited telephone call or email for its password. In addition, Schoolpop shouldn't take precautions when using a computer that is not its own or in a public setting. If Schoolpop suspects that someone else may have had access to its password, Schoolpop should not notify AEIS immediately.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation completely inverts the responsibilities related to order placement and password security. The original clause enforces a digital order process, user authentication for security, and password protection. The modified clause enables physical documents for orders, denies the existence of authentication, allows sharing of the password, and also introduces the possibility of phishing by AEIS. This is a radical shift from secure online ordering to a vulnerable manual one.",

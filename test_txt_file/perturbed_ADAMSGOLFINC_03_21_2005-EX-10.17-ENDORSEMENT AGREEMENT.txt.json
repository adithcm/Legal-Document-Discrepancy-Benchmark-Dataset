                "original_text": "This Agreement is entered into on January 13, 2005 between professional golfer, TOM WATSON, (hereinafter referred to as \"CONSULTANT\") and ADAMS GOLF, LTD. (hereinafter referred to as \"ADAMS GOLF\").",

                "explanation": "The agreement initially defines Adams Golf as \"ADAMS GOLF\". By changing this in the introduction to \"Company\", while still referring to Adams Golf as \"ADAMS GOLF\" throughout the document, it creates confusion as to whether 'Company' and 'ADAMS GOLF' are the same entity.",

                "explanation": "The term \"PRODUCT\" is defined here, but later sections of the document could inadvertently refer to \"Items\" instead. This perturbation creates ambiguity as to whether \"PRODUCT\" and \"ITEMS\" have the same meaning, or whether ADAMS GOLF is obligated to use consultant's likeness only to \"PRODUCT\".",

                "original_text": "Minimum Payment Schedule (All amounts are in US Dollars):\n\n   The Minimum Payments will be paid quarterly in advance in equal installments at the beginning of each royalty quarter, as defined in 4.7.  The first quarterly Minimum Payment (for the quarter beginning 1st October, 2008) shall be made at the date of signing of this Agreement and the  second quarterly minimum payment shall be made at January 1, 2009 with all further quarterly Minimum Payments following the schedule as  defined in 4.7.",
                "changed_text": "Minimum Payment Schedule (All amounts are in US Dollars):\n\n   The Quarterly Dues will be paid quarterly in arrears, meaning at the end of each royalty quarter, as defined in 4.7.  The first quarterly payment (for the quarter beginning 1st October, 2008) is waived, and the second quarterly payment shall be made at January 1, 2009 with all further quarterly payments following the schedule as defined in 4.7.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that 'Minimum Payments' are paid 'quarterly in advance'. The modified text changes 'Minimum Payments' to 'Quarterly Dues' and states that these payments are made 'quarterly in arrears' and waive the first payment. This directly contradicts the original agreement regarding payment timing and amounts.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'accurate and complete records', whereas the modified version suggests keeping 'rough estimates' and 'summaries of information' rather than precise records. This creates ambiguity regarding the level of detail and accuracy required for record-keeping, making enforcement of royalty payment obligations uncertain.",

Existing products are those  products that IntriCon is selling at the date of termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, IntriCon may negotiate for a potential right after termination to continue selling  future products that include the Dynamic Hearing Technology pending an approval in a future agreement between the parties, with IntriCon paying potential royalties in accordance with payment clauses, subject to a future negotiation in section 4.9 and, for the avoidance of doubt, no clauses of this Agreement will automatically apply in respect of such sales. Potential products are those  products that IntriCon may hypothetically sell under an agreement with Dynamic Hearing in a potential future.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states IntriCon’s right to sell existing products with continued royalty payments post-termination. The modified text introduces uncertainty by replacing ‘shall have a right’ with ‘may negotiate for a potential right’, changing ‘existing products’ to ‘future products’ and making royalty payments and clause applicability subject to future negotiation, contradicting the original guaranteed right.",

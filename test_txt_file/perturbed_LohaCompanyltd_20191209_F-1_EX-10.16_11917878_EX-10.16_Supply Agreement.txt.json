                "explanation": "The terms 'buyer' and 'seller' are fundamental to the contract. Changing them to 'customer' and 'provider' introduces confusion about the parties' roles and obligations, especially since the rest of the document consistently refers to 'Buyer' and 'Seller'. This creates uncertainty about which entity is bound by which clause.",

                "original_text": "11. PAYMENT: Under Letter of Credit or T/T: Under the Letter of Credit: The Buyer shall open an irrevocable letter of credit with the bank within 30 days after signing the contract, in favor of the Seller, for 100% value of the total contract value. The letter of credit should state that partial shipments are allowed. The Buyer's agent agrees to pay for the goods in accordance with the actual amount of the goods shipped. 80% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.1. The remaining 20% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.2. The Letter of Credit shall be valid until 90 days after the latest shipment is effected.",
                "changed_text": "11. PAYMENT: Under Letter of Credit or T/T: Under the Letter of Credit: The Customer may initiate a letter of credit with the bank within 30 days after contract signing, in favor of the Vendor, for up to 100% of the total contract estimation. The letter of credit should state that partial deliveries are permissible. The Customer's representative agrees to remit funds for the products based on the calculated value of the merchandise transferred. Approximately 80% of the agreed amount shipped will be paid upon presentation of the specified documents in Clause 12.1. The subsequent 20% of the arranged payment shipped will be released upon receipt of the required documents as specified in Clause 12.2. The Letter of Credit will remain effective until 90 days subsequent to the final shipment commencement.",
                "explanation": "Here, 'Buyer' is changed to 'Customer', 'Seller' to 'Vendor', 'shipments' to 'deliveries', 'value' to 'estimation' and 'paid' to 'remit funds'. This not only changes the terminology but also introduces ambiguity. 'May initiate' vs 'shall open' changes the obligation, 'deliveries' vs 'shipments', and 'calculation' vs 'value' lead to potential disputes, making enforcement unclear.",

CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers. The Certificate so issued shall be accepted as the base of a claim. The Sellers, in accordance with the Buyers' claim, shall be responsible for the immediate elimination of the defect(s), complete or partial replacement of the commodity or shall devaluate the commodity according to the state of defect(s). Where necessary, the Buyers shall be at liberty to eliminate the defect(s) themselves at the Sellers' expenses. If the Sellers fail to answer the Buyers within one weeks after receipt of the aforesaid claim, the claim shall be reckoned as having been accepted by the Sellers.",
                "changed_text": "16. CLAIMS: Within 7 days following the merchandise's arrival at its final location, should its characteristics, details, or volume fail to align with the agreed-upon terms, barring any claims covered by the insurer or vessel owners, the Patrons, relying on verification from the relevant regulatory agency, retain the option to request replacements or reimbursement. All associated costs, encompassing inspection fees, return shipping, replacement dispatch, insurance premiums, storage, and handling charges, are to be absorbed by the Suppliers. This verification serves as the foundation for any compensation demand. In adherence to the Patrons' request, the Suppliers will promptly address any shortcomings, offering comprehensive or fractional product substitutes or altering value in line with discrepancies. Should the Patrons deem it necessary, they may rectify the issues themselves, billing the resulting expenses to the Suppliers. If the Suppliers do not acknowledge the Patrons' communication within seven days of its receipt, the claim will be automatically validated.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Buyers' to 'Patrons', 'Sellers' to 'Suppliers', 'goods' to 'merchandise', 'specification' to 'details', 'quantity' to 'volume', and so on, creates a situation where the obligations are less clear. While the intent remains, the lack of consistent terminology allows for interpretation and potential disputes over which entity is responsible for which specific actions and costs, especially regarding claims and reimbursement.",

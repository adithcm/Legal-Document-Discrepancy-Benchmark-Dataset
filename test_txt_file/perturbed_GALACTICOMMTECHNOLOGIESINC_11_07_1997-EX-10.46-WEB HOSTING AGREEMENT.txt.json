                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Horst Entertainment agrees to pay Galactcomm $0.01 (one cent) per access up to 400,000 accesses thereafter payment shall be $0.005 (one-half cent) per access. Horst Entertainment shall send this amount to Galacticomm by no later than Wednesday for accesses used from the previuos week (Monday thru Sunday).",
                "changed_text": "Horst Entertainment agrees to compensate Galacticomm $0.01 (one cent) per access up to 400,000 accesses thereafter payment shall be $0.005 (one-half cent) per access. Horst Entertainment shall remit this amount to Galacticomm within ten days of invoice for accesses used from the previous month.",
                "explanation": "The term 'pay' is replaced with 'compensate', introducing ambiguity. The payment deadline changes from 'Wednesday for accesses used from the previous week (Monday thru Sunday)' to 'within ten days of invoice for accesses used from the previous month'. This creates a contradiction regarding when and how frequently Galacticomm receives payment and introduces the concept of an 'invoice' which was not previously mentioned. It is unclear whether 'accesses' are the same for both sentences.",

                "original_text": "Galacticomm must provide a person(s) to correct any technical problems (Server being down or inaccessible) 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. This person(s) must be available by beeper or telephone. Horst Entertainment shall provide this same 24 hour service at the broadcast location.",
                "changed_text": "Galacticomm shall endeavor to provide personnel to address any service disruptions (Server experiencing downtime or inaccessibility) during business hours. Such personnel shall be reachable via email. Horst Entertainment is responsible for on-site support during broadcast hours.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'correct any technical problems (Server being down or inaccessible)' is changed to 'address any service disruptions (Server experiencing downtime or inaccessibility)'. The original text mandated '24 hours per day, 7 days per week' availability by 'beeper or telephone', while the modified text requires only 'during business hours' contact via 'email'. The obligation of Horst Entertainment also moves from '24 hour service' to 'on-site support during broadcast hours', which introduces two new undefined terms: business hours, and broadcast hours creating inconsistencies.",

                "changed_text": "Should Galacticomm elect to cancel this agreement, Horst Entertainment retains the option to acquire a software license at fair market value.",
                "explanation": "The term 'terminate' is replaced with 'cancel', and the right to 'purchase a license copy of the software in the amount of $15,000.00' is altered to the 'option to acquire a software license at fair market value.' The specific price of $15,000 is removed, introducing ambiguity as to the cost and requiring a determination of 'fair market value', which can be subjective and lead to disagreements. Further, 'fair market value' also introduces a new term that is not in line with the original text. It is unclear if it is the same license in both cases.",

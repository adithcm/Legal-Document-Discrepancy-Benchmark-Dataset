Now therefore, the parties mutually agree to enter into a strategic alliance under the following terms and conditions:   1) Responsibilities of Bravatek   Bravatek may serve as a project sales lead finder for COMPANY at its discretion. In this capacity, Bravatek will endeavor to provide the following services to COMPANY.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Duties' is replaced with 'Responsibilities', and 'agrees to serve' is softened to 'may serve at its discretion.' This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of Bravatek's obligations, making it unclear whether they are legally required to perform the listed services. Also, 'best efforts' is now 'endeavor' that reduces duty of Bravatek.",

                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek may be eligible for a finder's reward, the amount of which shall be determined by COMPANY at its sole discretion, considering project profitability. Payment terms will align with standard industry practices.",
                "explanation": "The term 'lead-finder fee' is replaced with 'finder's reward,' and the guaranteed range of 10-20% is removed, giving COMPANY complete discretion over the amount. The specific NET 30 payment term is replaced with vague 'standard industry practices', creating uncertainty about payment timing.",

                "original_text": "COMPANY shall indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of COMPANY or breach of COMPANY of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

Bravatek is responsible for safeguarding COMPANY, its directors, officers and employees, from significant damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities stemming from critical actions by Bravatek regarding this Arrangement.",
                "explanation": "The term 'indemnify' is changed to 'endeavor to protect' for COMPANY and 'responsible for safeguarding' for Bravatek, diluting the legal obligation of indemnification for COMPANY while also changing the scope to cover actions/inactions and Arrangement, changing the scope of protection and creating potential ambiguity about the extent and nature of each party's responsibility. 'shall indemnify' is a clear obligation whereas the newer terms introduce doubt.",

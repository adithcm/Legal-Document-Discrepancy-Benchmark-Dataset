                "explanation": "Changing the term \"Client\" to \"Mortgage Logic.com, Inc.\" in the first \"WHEREAS\" clause and keeping \"Client\" in the second clause creates uncertainty. It's now ambiguous whether 'Client' in the second 'WHEREAS' refers to the defined 'Client' or 'Mortgage Logic.com, Inc.' It is unclear about whom is TrueLink is willing to provide, potentially contradicting the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"Client\" with \"Mortgage Logic.com, Inc.\" and introducing the new term \"Customer\" without defining it creates confusion about who is responsible for payment for 'other services'. \"Customer\" could refer to Client's customers or a different entity entirely, creating a contradiction about payment obligations.",

                "explanation": "The indemnity clause originally relies on 'Client' as the responsible party. By changing only some instances to 'Mortgage Logic.com, Inc.' and introducing 'User', we create ambiguity. Is \"Client\" here separate from 'Mortgage Logic.com, Inc.' in (i), requiring both to indemnify? Is the omission of \"Client\" a deliberate transfer of liability? The inconsistent terminology disrupts clarity.",

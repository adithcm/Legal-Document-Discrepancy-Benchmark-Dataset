HERC shall immediately discontinue use of the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks upon expiration of the Interim Period, or the earlier termination of this Agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement.",

The modified text replaces this with 'may, at its discretion, permit', making the granting of the license optional. This introduces a contradiction as to whether HERC has an assured right to use the trademarks or if it's dependent on HSI's approval.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that HSI *shall* take all necessary actions to protect trademarks. The modified version changes this to 'may, at its discretion, take actions', making it optional. Also, the original text says 'HSI shall continue', and the modified says 'HSI will endeavor to continue' which is a lower standard of obligations. This weakens HSI's obligation and creates uncertainty regarding trademark protection. The meaning becomes ambiguous.",

In the event of a material breach of this Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements exhibited hereto, THC or HSI may notify HERC of such material breach and terminate this Agreement upon written notice. If HERC has not cured any such breach within thirty (30) days after HERC receives such notice, this Agreement shall automatically terminate without further notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the nature of the breach is such that it cannot be cured, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon notice of termination by THC or HSI to HERC (without any opportunity to cure the breach).",

In the event of a material breach of this Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements exhibited hereto, THC or HSI may notify HERC of such material breach and terminate this Agreement upon written notice. If HERC has not cured any such breach within what THC or HSI considers to be a reasonable amount of time after HERC receives such notice, this Agreement shall terminate at the discretion of THC or HSI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the nature of the breach is such that it cannot be remedied, then this Agreement shall terminate if THC or HSI determines the breach warrants termination (without any opportunity to cure the breach).",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a 30-day cure period for breaches. The modified version replaces this with 'what THC or HSI considers to be a reasonable amount of time,' making the cure period subjective and controlled by THC/HSI. Also the termination will not happen automatically, because it says 'at the discretion of THC or HSI'. This contradicts the original defined timeline and makes enforcement uncertain. Similarly the second line weakens from automatically terminate to terminate 'if THC or HSI determines'.",

The term \"Premises\" means the location shown on the cover page to this Agreement or a location that is determined under process set out in Section 4.1 [Site Selection and Approval] below.",

                "explanation": "The contract originally defined 'Premises' as the approved location. This change uses 'Location' in the first sentence but retains the original definition of 'Premises.' This introduces confusion as to whether 'Location' and 'Premises' are interchangeable, potentially affecting obligations tied to a specific defined term.",

If by reason of state or other law, we are prohibited from receiving a percentage of certain components of Gross Revenues (including alcoholic-beverage sales), you must pay us an equivalent amount by increasing the Royalty percentage applied to Gross Revenues exclusive of the prohibited components.",

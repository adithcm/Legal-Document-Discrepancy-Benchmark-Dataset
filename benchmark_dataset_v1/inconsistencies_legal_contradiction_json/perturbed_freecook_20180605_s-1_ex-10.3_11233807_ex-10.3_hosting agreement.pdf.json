                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Upon the signing of this Agreement, Client agrees to pay to Company a total of\n$5,000. Client shall make a prepayment of $1,900 and pay the remaining $3,100 on completion of the\nScope of Work.",
                "changed_text": "Upon the signing of this Agreement, Client agrees to pay to Company a total of\n$5,000. Client shall make a prepayment of $500 and pay the remaining $4,500 within 180 days of completion of the\nScope of Work.",
                "explanation": "This change alters the payment terms to delay the final payment significantly. Many jurisdictions have laws regarding timely payment for services rendered, and delaying payment for 180 days after completion could be considered an unreasonable delay, especially if the contract doesn't specify a valid reason for such an extended payment period.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state-level prompt payment laws or implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "The original contract specifies a 12-week timeframe. Reducing this to 2 weeks creates an unrealistic deadline for the completion of website design, development, and hosting services. This could be seen as a deceptive practice if the company knows it cannot realistically deliver the services within this timeframe.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of consumer protection laws regarding misrepresentation of services and unrealistic deadlines.",
                "location": "Section 1(b)"

                "explanation": "This change allows the company to use any feedback, even negative feedback, in marketing materials without explicit consent. This could violate privacy laws or regulations related to the use of personal information in advertising. Additionally, it is generally understood in marketing that testimonials should be positive, so using negative feedback in this way could be considered misleading or deceptive.",

                "original_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement by giving the other Party thirty (30) days' prior written notice.",
                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement by giving the other Party five (5) days' prior written notice.",
                "explanation": "California law, which governs this agreement according to section 4.10, often requires longer notice periods for contract termination to ensure sufficient time for parties to wind down affairs or find alternative arrangements. A five-day notice period may be deemed unreasonably short and thus conflict with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under California contract law.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the termination timeframe to ten days after an acquisition of the Licensee or cessation of management by the Licensor's affiliate may be considered an unreasonably short period under California law, potentially conflicting with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. A shorter period can severely impair the Licensee's ability to transition its business operations or secure alternative licensing arrangements, especially given the complexities often involved in corporate acquisitions or management changes. This change introduces a potential breach of fiduciary duty depending on the relationship between Licensor and Licensee.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the period to cease using the Licensed Trade Name and Licensed Mark to 5 days might not allow a reasonable transition period, particularly considering California's laws protecting businesses from undue hardship. This could contradict the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, especially if the Licensee requires more time to rebrand or adjust marketing materials. The California Consumer Legal Remedies Act also addresses unfair practices, and such a short timeframe might be argued as imposing unfair or oppressive terms.",

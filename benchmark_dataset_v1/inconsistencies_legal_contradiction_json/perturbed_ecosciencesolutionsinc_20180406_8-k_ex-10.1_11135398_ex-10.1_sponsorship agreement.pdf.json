                "explanation": "The original contract requires full payment upon signing. Modifying the payment term to allow 120 days from signing introduces a contradiction. Florida Statutes Chapter 83 requires payment within 30 days for services rendered.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement spans a month. Shortening it to two days creates an unreasonable term, especially considering the sponsor's obligations. This might be viewed as unconscionable under Florida contract law if the sponsor cannot reasonably benefit from the agreement in such a short timeframe, or if it is deemed not to be a reasonable time to recoup expenses.",

                "explanation": "While arbitration is generally enforceable, completely waiving the right to any other legal recourse, including the right to a jury trial, might be considered unconscionable or against public policy in Florida, especially if the mediation process is unfair or biased. Florida law requires waivers of jury trials to be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. This could be problematic if there's an imbalance of power, or if the mediation process is later deemed inadequate.",

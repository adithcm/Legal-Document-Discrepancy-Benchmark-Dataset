                "original_text": "4.2 Payment for the Products shall be in U.S. Dollars, or such other currency as STAAR may require in its sole discretion, and made within thirty (30) days of STAAR’s invoice. Late payments shall be subject to an interest charge of 1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.",

Late payments shall be subject to an interest charge of 1.5% per month regardless of any conflicting laws.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the payment timeframe to sixty (60) days and setting a 1.5% monthly interest charge regardless of the law contradicts states' usury laws, which place a cap on the maximum allowable interest rate that can be charged on debts, and prompt payment laws.",

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and except as otherwise stated in this Agreement: (a) the foregoing Warranty is exclusive; and (b) all other terms, representations, undertakings, rights, remedies and warranties are excluded, whether express or implied (including but not limited to any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or against infringement). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the exclusive remedy for breach of the Warranty shall be, at STAAR’s option, the repair or replacement, at STAAR’s expense, of the non-conforming Product; provided that Distributor notifies STAAR of the non-conformity and returns the non-conforming Product within the Warranty Period.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the warranty period to six (6) months could contradict implied warranty laws in some jurisdictions, where a longer reasonable period might be expected for medical devices, especially given their intended use and potential impact on health.

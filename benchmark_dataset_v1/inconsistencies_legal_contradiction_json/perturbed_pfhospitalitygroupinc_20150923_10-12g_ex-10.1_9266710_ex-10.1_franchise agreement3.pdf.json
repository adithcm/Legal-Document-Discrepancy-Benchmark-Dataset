                "original_text": "(d) As used in this Agreement, the term “Post-Term Period” shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of two (2) years from the date of: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement (regardless of the cause for termination); (c) termination of Member’s employment with Franchisee; and/or (d) a final order of a duly authorized arbitrator, panel of arbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been taken) with respect to any of the foregoing or with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement; either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or entity).",
                "changed_text": "(d) As used in this Agreement, the term “Post-Term Period” shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of five (5) years from the date of: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement (regardless of the cause for termination); (c) termination of Member’s employment with Franchisee; and/or (d) a final order of a duly authorized arbitrator, panel of arbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been taken) with respect to any of the foregoing or with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement; either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or entity).",
                "explanation": "Increasing the non-compete period to five years may be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable under many state laws, which typically look unfavorably on non-compete agreements that extend beyond one or two years, especially for lower-level employees. This creates a legal contradiction as the extended period may be deemed an undue restraint of trade.",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws governing non-compete agreements (e.g., California Business and Professions Code Section 16600, which generally prohibits non-compete agreements; laws in other states that require non-competes to be reasonable in time and scope).",

Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury, and Member agrees to pay all court costs and attorney’s fees, including costs to seek injunctive relief, capped at $500, regardless of actual expense, incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By capping the attorney's fees for injunctive relief at a low amount like $500, this creates a scenario where the franchisor would not be able to receive full attorney's fees even if they win the claim. Many franchise agreements require the losing party to pay the winner's attorney's fees.",

All information, knowledge and\nknow-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (“Confidential Information”) is deemed confidential,\nexcept for information that Member can demonstrate came to Member’s attention by lawful means prior to disclosure to Member; or which, at the\ntime of the disclosure to Member, had become a part of the public domain.",

All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor is deemed confidential. It is the Member's responsibility to prove that they did not use that confidential information to their benefit.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the confidential information clause to only last 1 year could be too short, as the lifespan of the value of the trade secrets may last much longer. Making the member responsible for proving that they did not use confidential information improperly is generally not acceptable, as typically the business bringing the suit would need to prove that trade secrets were misappropriated.",

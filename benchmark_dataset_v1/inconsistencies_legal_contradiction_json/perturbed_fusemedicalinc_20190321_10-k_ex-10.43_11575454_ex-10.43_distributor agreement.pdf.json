                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Distributor must pay the full amount invoiced to it by the Supplier in USD$’s within thirty (45) days of the date of invoice.",
                "changed_text": "The Distributor must pay the full amount invoiced to it by the Supplier in USD$’s within ninety (30) days of the date of invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction because it alters the payment deadline. While the original contract said 45 days, the modified one is 30 days. Many jurisdictions favor prompt payment but it must be reasonable, thus this perturbation favors the supplier in an unreasonable manner, by asking for a payment of 30 days, reducing the payment period from 45 days.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for potential product liability claims to one day is unreasonable and potentially violates the distributor's right to adequately investigate and prepare a defense. This creates an imbalance of power favoring the supplier and could be deemed unconscionable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - potentially violates general contract law principles by setting an unreasonably short notification period.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the grace period for payment defaults to 1 day is extremely strict and potentially violates principles of fairness and good faith in contract law. Many jurisdictions require a reasonable opportunity to cure a payment default, and 1 day is likely insufficient.",

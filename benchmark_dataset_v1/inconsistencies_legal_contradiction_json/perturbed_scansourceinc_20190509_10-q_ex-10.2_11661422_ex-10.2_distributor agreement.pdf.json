                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Distributor has the right to cancel, reschedule or modify all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such cancellation or modification request is made within [*****] business days of PO acceptance or rescheduling request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non-cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor may cancel, reschedule, or modify purchase orders accepted by Xplore only within one (1) business day of PO acceptance. Changes to the destination of a purchase order are not permitted under any circumstance once the order is accepted by Xplore. Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non-cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.",
                "explanation": "This change severely restricts the distributor's ability to cancel or modify orders, reducing the allowable cancellation window to just one business day and completely eliminating the option to change the destination. This introduces a legal contradiction as standard commercial practices and potentially the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), which governs sales contracts in the U.S., generally require a 'reasonable' opportunity to inspect goods or cancel orders under certain conditions.  The original text allows a reasonable time contingent upon the days of PO acceptance. By reducing the window, it creates non-compliance with regulatory standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 2, Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, general contract law principles regarding reasonable opportunity for inspection and cancellation.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Stock on Hand. Distributor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain thirty (30) days of stock in Distributor’s inventory to support sales. Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor’s inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties.",
                "changed_text": "Stock on Hand. Distributor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain thirty (30) days of stock in Distributor’s inventory to support sales. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than ten (10) consecutive days, Xplore, upon verbal notice to Distributor, shall immediately cease all shipments of product to Distributor.",
                "explanation": "This change drastically reduces the grace period for maintaining the agreed-upon stock levels.  The original language gives 60 days to replenish after the level has dropped under 30. This drastically changes the provision. It also stipulates that upon the distributor failing to meet this level for over ten days. The original text also allows for a more formal discussion on what to do with this product and what to replenish.  Verbal notice is not permitted as it reduces Xplore's obligation. This introduces a contradiction by creating a scenario where Xplore can unilaterally and rapidly halt shipments, potentially leading to breach of contract issues and violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in commercial contracts. The original language allows for negotiation, and the new text introduces a penalty that could be deemed unreasonably punitive.",

                "original_text": "Shipping Terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Distribution Agreement, and unless notified by Xplore otherwise, shipping terms for Xplore Products will be Delivery Duty Paid (DDP) INCOTERMS® 2010, whereby Distributor’s price, includes all costs of delivery, insurance, import and / or export duties and tariffs. Such prices are exclusive of all federal, state, municipal or other government excise, sales, use, occupational or like taxes in force, and any such taxes shall be assumed and paid for by Distributor in addition to its payment for the Xplore Products. Title and risk of loss to Xplore Products shall pass to Distributor upon delivery to Distributor, as indicated in the Proof of Delivery (PoD) documents.",
                "changed_text": "Shipping Terms. All shipping costs, insurance, import, export duties, and tariffs are the sole responsibility of the distributor. Regardless of shipping arrangements, title and risk of loss transfer to Distributor immediately upon the Xplore Product leaving Xplore's facility.",
                "explanation": "This shifts all shipping-related costs and risks to the distributor. This contradicts common carrier regulations and UCC provisions concerning risk of loss, particularly if the distributor doesn't control the shipping. The UCC typically assigns risk of loss based on the shipping terms (e.g., FOB origin vs. FOB destination). Forcing the distributor to assume risk immediately, even before they have any control over the goods, can be deemed unconscionable, especially in international transactions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 2-509 regarding risk of loss, INCOTERMS® rules (to the extent they were initially referenced and now contradicted), potential violations of consumer protection laws regarding unfair or deceptive practices.",

                "original_text": "Within fifteen (15) calendar Days following receipt of each of Transporter’s invoices and statements, Customer shall make payment to Transporter of all undisputed amounts by wire transfer, in accordance with the account information provided to Customer, unless another form of payment is agreed to in writing by the Parties. Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid.",
                "changed_text": "Within five (5) calendar Days following receipt of each of Transporter’s invoices and statements, Customer shall make payment to Transporter of all undisputed amounts by wire transfer, in accordance with the account information provided to Customer, unless another form of payment is agreed to in writing by the Parties. Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid.",
                "explanation": "Shortening the payment period to 5 days may contradict prompt payment laws in some states, including Texas, where the standard timeframe for payment can be longer depending on the specific industry and circumstances. This creates a potential legal inconsistency.",

                "changed_text": "Each invoice and statement shall be final as to both Parties unless questioned in writing within six (6) Months following the date of such invoice or statement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the period to question an invoice to 6 months may conflict with the statute of limitations for breach of contract claims in Texas, which is typically four years. This could prevent a party from contesting an incorrect invoice within the legally allowed timeframe.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 10 days may be deemed unreasonable in certain circumstances, particularly given the potential impact on gas transportation services. A longer notice period might be implied by law or common business practice to ensure adequate time for the other party to find alternative arrangements, especially considering the dedicated facilities and long term commitment. The original text of 30 days is more likely to comply with regulations.",

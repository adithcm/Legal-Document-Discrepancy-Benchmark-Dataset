                "original_text": "Past due cash payments (i.e., payments due more than thirty (30) days after Berkshire’s receipt of the applicable invoice) shall bear interest at the rate of one (1%) percent per month.",
                "changed_text": "Past due cash payments (i.e., payments due more than ninety (90) days after Berkshire’s receipt of the applicable invoice) shall bear interest at the rate of twenty-five (25%) percent per year.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 1% per month interest rate on payments overdue by more than 30 days. The modified text changes this to 25% per year on payments overdue by 90 days. This introduces a potential issue by significantly increasing the interest rate, which could be considered usurious under Connecticut law (C.G.S. § 37-4) depending on the type of loan and the lender's status, as it exceeds the legal interest rate ceiling if not properly exempted.",

                "changed_text": "Upon the breach of either of the above conditions, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: (A) as to a default under clause (i) above, if payment is not made within two (2) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make payment; or (B) as to a default under clause (ii) above, if such default is not cured within five (5) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default and such action the defaulting party must take in order to cure each such item of default.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 10-day cure period for payment defaults and a 30-day cure period for other defaults. The modified text reduces these cure periods to 2 days and 5 days, respectively. This unreasonably short cure period may be deemed unconscionable and contradict the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Connecticut law, especially if the breach is minor or due to circumstances beyond the breaching party's control.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows for a 60-day delay due to a Force Majeure event before termination can occur. The modified text reduces this period to 10 days. This drastically shortened period could be deemed commercially unreasonable and potentially violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Connecticut law. Courts often consider the reasonableness of contractual terms, especially in unforeseen circumstances.",

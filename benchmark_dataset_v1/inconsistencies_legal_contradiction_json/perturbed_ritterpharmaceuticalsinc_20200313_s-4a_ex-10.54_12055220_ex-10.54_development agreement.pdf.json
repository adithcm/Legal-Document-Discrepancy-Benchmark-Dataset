                "original_text": "4.7.\nInvoice Terms. Sekisui shall pay for each Product sold by Qualigen within 30 days after Sekisui has received the applicable invoice\nfrom Qualigen.",
                "changed_text": "4.7.\nInvoice Terms. Sekisui shall pay for each Product sold by Qualigen within 90 days after Sekisui has received the applicable invoice\nfrom Qualigen.",
                "explanation": "This modification extends the payment term to 90 days. While the UCC doesn't explicitly define 'reasonable time' for payment, extending it this far, particularly without clear justification, may conflict with the standard commercial practice of shorter payment cycles, and may cause undue hardship for the supplier, thereby contravening good faith business practices. In some jurisdictions such an extension may be regarded as unconscionable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) - Implied duty of good faith and commercial reasonableness. State laws pertaining to unfair business practices.",

                "original_text": "12.4.\nGovernmental Warnings. Each Party shall advise the other Party promptly (but in any event within no more than 48 hours) of any\nwarning (including any FDA Form 483), citation, indictment, claim, lawsuit, or proceeding issued or instituted by any federal, state or\nlocal governmental entity or agency against the Party, or of any revocation of any license or permit if, and only to the extent that, the\nmanufacture, storage, or handling of the Product, or the marketing, selling, promotion or distribution of the Product, is affected.",
                "changed_text": "12.4.\nGovernmental Warnings. Each Party shall advise the other Party when they deem necessary, without a set deadline, of any\nwarning (including any FDA Form 483), citation, indictment, claim, lawsuit, or proceeding issued or instituted by any federal, state or\nlocal governmental entity or agency against the Party, or of any revocation of any license or permit if, and only to the extent that, the\nmanufacture, storage, or handling of the Product, or the marketing, selling, promotion or distribution of the Product, is affected.",
                "explanation": "The original contract mandates notification 'within no more than 48 hours' for governmental warnings. The modified version removes the strict deadline, stating notification should occur 'when they deem necessary, without a set deadline.' This change is problematic because FDA regulations and similar regulatory bodies require prompt reporting of significant issues. Removing the 48-hour requirement introduces a substantial risk of delayed reporting, which is a violation of regulatory requirements for medical device companies, risking legal penalties and endangering public health.",

If\nan investigation is needed in response to a complaint or inquiry related to the Product, Qualigen shall perform the investigation and\nshall bear the cost of such investigation. The documentation of such investigation shall include, but not be limited to, investigation\nresults, cause analysis, corrective and preventative action and health hazard/medical assessment, as appropriate. In the event a\nProduct is returned by a customer for investigation, Qualigen shall ship a replacement Product to the customer. (Provided, that if a\nrequest for a return of Product is due to a change of mind over using the Product or the Sekisui customer has overstocked the\nproduct, rather than due to a warranty issue, Qualigen need not accept the return or provide any replacement or substitute.) Qualigen\nshall retain records of all Product related complaints, or Adverse Events for a period of not less than five (5) years beyond the\nexpiration date of the Product or for such longer period as may be required by applicable law. Qualigen shall use commercially\nreasonable efforts to ensure that all complaints are appropriately closed within 90 days or less from the receipt of such complaint.",
                "changed_text": "12.6.\nComplaints. Qualigen may receive and investigate customer complaints at its discretion. Qualigen is not obligated to investigate every complaint, nor bear the cost of any investigation. Qualigen may determine, at its sole discretion, what documentation, if any, is maintained. Qualigen is not required to ship a replacement product to the customer. Qualigen shall retain records of all Product related complaints, or Adverse Events for a period of two (2) years, regardless of any applicable law. Qualigen will attempt to ensure that complaints are closed when possible.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens Qualigen's obligations regarding customer complaints. It allows Qualigen to selectively address complaints and reduces the record retention period to 2 years. FDA regulations mandate robust complaint handling processes and retention of records for at least five years post-expiration, or longer if legally required. This change introduces non-compliance with FDA regulations, posing legal and regulatory risks.",

                "original_text": "Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum with respect to a particular Product or Products, Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of Customer’s rights under this Agreement. If any payment required to be made under this Agreement is not made within twenty (20) days of the applicable date when such payment is due (the “Late Payment Date”), interest shall accrue on such past due amount from the Late Payment Date until the date payment is actually made at a quarterly rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Three-Month U.S. dollar LIBOR (Reuters Page LIBOR01) on the Late Payment Date (or the next Business Day if such Late Payment Date is not a Business Day), and (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law. Time for any payments hereunder shall be of the essence.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum with respect to a particular Product or Products, Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within ninety (90) calendar days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of Customer’s rights under this Agreement. If any payment required to be made under this Agreement is not made within ten (10) days of the applicable date when such payment is due (the “Late Payment Date”), interest shall accrue on such past due amount from the Late Payment Date until the date payment is actually made at a quarterly rate equal to the lesser of (i) ten percent (10%) per month, and (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law. Time for any payments hereunder shall not be of the essence.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 60-day payment term, which is relatively standard. Modifying it to 90 days while decreasing the late payment window to 10 days and inflating the interest rate creates a contradiction. Many jurisdictions have laws regulating the maximum interest rate that can be charged on late payments. Charging 10% per month could easily exceed these limits, rendering the interest rate clause unenforceable. Additionally, removing 'time is of the essence' could be used to argue against penalties for late payment.",

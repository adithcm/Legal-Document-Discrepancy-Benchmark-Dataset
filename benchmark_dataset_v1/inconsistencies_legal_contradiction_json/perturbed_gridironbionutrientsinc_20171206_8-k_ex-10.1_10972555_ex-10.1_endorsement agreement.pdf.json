The NFLA agrees that any material, advertising or otherwise, submitted for approval as provided in this section may be deemed by Company to have been approved under this section if the same is not disapproved in writing within ten (10) business days after receipt of the material.",

The NFLA agrees that any material, advertising or otherwise, submitted for approval as provided in this section may be deemed by Company to have been approved under this section if the same is not disapproved in writing within two (2) business days after receipt of the material.",
                "explanation": "The modification shortens the approval period for advertising material from ten business days to two business days. This creates a legal contradiction because, depending on the specific type of advertising and the claims made, applicable advertising regulations (e.g., those enforced by the FTC) may require a longer period for legal review to ensure compliance and avoid misleading claims. This timeframe is unreasonably short.",

Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the NFLA-NC beginning on the first full quarter (three month period) of the Agreement and continue on a quarterly basis thereafter for the term of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment period from ten business days to forty-five business days after the end of each quarter. This creates a legal contradiction if such a delay violates California's prompt payment laws, which may require payments to be made within a significantly shorter timeframe, especially for charitable contributions tied to sales revenue. Unreasonable delays in payments to charitable organizations may also be considered a breach of fiduciary duty or raise concerns about the company's financial practices.",

                "explanation": "The modification shortens the liquidation period from ninety days to fifteen days and extends the sales report delivery to sixty days. This creates a legal contradiction because California's Commercial Code regarding the sale of goods may imply a reasonable time for liquidation that is longer than 15 days, especially considering the potential volume of inventory and the need to maximize sales proceeds. Also, the sales report should be before the liquidation not after.",

                "original_text": "Naked shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Wade in the event Wade fails to perform the Wade Services or breaches any other covenant or agreement set forth herein (including the essence of this Agreement), and fails to cure same (if curable) within seven (7) days of receipt of written notice.",
                "changed_text": "Naked shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon two (2) days prior written notice to Wade in the event Wade fails to perform the Wade Services or breaches any other covenant or agreement set forth herein (including the essence of this Agreement), and fails to cure same (if curable) within one (1) day of receipt of written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for a ten-day notice period for termination and a seven-day cure period, which is standard. The modified text reduces the notice period to two days and the cure period to one day. This introduces a legal contradiction because many jurisdictions, including New York (as indicated in the 'Choice of Law' section 25), require reasonable notice and cure periods that are longer than two and one days, respectively, especially considering the complexities of contractual obligations and potential disputes.",

                "changed_text": "B. Payment Terms. Wade Product Royalties described above in Section 8A will be paid on an annual basis on the last day of December and shall be accompanied by minimal documentation.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies quarterly royalty payments with reasonable backup documentation. The modification changes this to annual payments with 'minimal documentation.' This contradicts standard business practices and potentially violates implied duties of good faith and fair dealing. New York law generally expects payments to be made with reasonable frequency and accompanied by sufficient documentation to verify the accuracy of the payments. An annual payment schedule with minimal documentation places an undue burden on Wade to monitor sales and potentially obscures discrepancies, creating a legal vulnerability.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows Wade's team ten days to review and comment on designs, which is a reasonable period. The modification reduces this to a single day. This is unreasonably short, particularly given the potential complexity and detail involved in design reviews. It can constitute a breach of good faith and fair dealing, as it effectively deprives Wade of a meaningful opportunity to provide input, undermining the collaborative design process outlined elsewhere in the agreement. New York law implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing in every contract, meaning neither party can act in a way that deprives the other of the benefits of the agreement. Reducing the review period to one day likely violates this duty.",

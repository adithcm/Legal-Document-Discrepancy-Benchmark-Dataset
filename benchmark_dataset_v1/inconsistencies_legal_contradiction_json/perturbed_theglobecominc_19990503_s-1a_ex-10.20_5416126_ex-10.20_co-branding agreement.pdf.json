By providing written notice, a\nparty may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party\nmaterially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within 15 days\nafter receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.6  [Boxlot Content]\nor 12.7  [Force Majeure] or Exhibit B.  In addition, by providing written notice, theglobe may\nimmediately terminate this Agreement, or at its option immediately suspend its\npromotion and other efforts hereunder, in the case of Boxlot's breach of Section\n12.1  [Compliance with Laws].",

By providing written notice, a party may terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within 5 days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.6 [Boxlot Content] or 12.7 [Force Majeure] or Exhibit B.

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from 15 days to 5 days may be considered unconscionable or violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in some jurisdictions, especially if the breach requires significant effort to remedy. Courts often look unfavorably on clauses that provide unreasonably short cure periods, especially in complex commercial agreements. This may introduce legal challenges.",

                "explanation": "Charging 25% interest per month on overdue payments far exceeds the usury limits in most states, rendering this provision illegal and unenforceable.

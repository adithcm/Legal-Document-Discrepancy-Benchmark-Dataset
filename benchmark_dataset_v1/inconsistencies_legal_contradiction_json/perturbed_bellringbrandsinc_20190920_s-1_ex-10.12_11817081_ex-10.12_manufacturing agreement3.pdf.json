Upon expiration, this Second Amendment shall be of no further force or effect, and the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall as they were before the Second Amendment Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Party’s right to enforce the terms and conditions of this Second Amendment shall survive the Second Amendment’s expiration.",
                "changed_text": "This Second Amendment shall be effective from The Second Amendment Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2021. Upon expiration, this Second Amendment shall be of no further force or effect, and the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall as they were before the Second Amendment Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Party’s right to enforce the terms and conditions of this Second Amendment shall terminate immediately upon the Second Amendment’s expiration, forfeiting all rights to enforce the terms and conditions.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the survival clause for enforcing the agreement's terms, contradicting standard contract law which generally allows parties a reasonable period (often dictated by statute of limitations) to enforce contractual rights after the agreement's formal expiration. By explicitly forfeiting all rights immediately, it creates a legal contradiction and could be deemed unconscionable or unenforceable depending on the specific circumstances and jurisdiction.",

Heritage shall invoice Premier 90 days after product delivery, regardless of the [***] billing identified on the relevant Schedule C or Schedule C-l. Heritage shall purchase excess ingredients and packaging materials to meet Premier demands.",
                "explanation": "The altered text modifies the payment terms to specify '90 days after product delivery', irrespective of the original schedule. Many jurisdictions have prompt payment laws that mandate faster payment timelines, especially for goods or services. Forcing a 90-day delay directly contradicts these laws. Moreover, mandating 'excess' purchases could violate laws related to fair business practices if it compels the supplier to incur unnecessary expenses and potential losses. The change forces Heritage to buy excess packaging, regardless of need. This imposes an undue burden on Heritage and potentially contradicts fair business practices.",

                "explanation": "This change specifies a 'Vacant Office Address' and an invalid General Counsel email address for official notices. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, as providing incorrect contact information could impede effective communication and legal notification, especially concerning contract disputes or breaches. Proper notification is a legally required element for many contractual actions and legal proceedings.",

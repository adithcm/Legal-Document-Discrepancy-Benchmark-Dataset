Each party shall keep a record of all sales and shall submit, together with the royalty statements, a quarterly summary report of such sales. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to Paragraphs 7(b) (2) and 7(b)(3), Fox shall make all payments of revenue remitted directly by VGSL or any other CSP with whom the parties prospectively agree Fox will receive revenue directly, within thirty (30) days of receipt of such revenue.",

Each party shall keep a record of all sales and shall submit, together with the royalty statements, a quarterly summary report of such sales. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to Paragraphs 7(b) (2) and 7(b)(3), Fox shall make all payments of revenue remitted directly by VGSL or any other CSP with whom the parties prospectively agree Fox will receive revenue directly, within ninety (90) days of receipt of such revenue.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that royalty payments are due within 30 days after the close of each calendar quarter. The modified text extends this period to 90 days. This change introduces non-compliance as many jurisdictions (including California, where the agreement is governed under Section 17(e)) require more frequent payment of royalties and statements, especially in licensing agreements. Delaying payment beyond standard practices can be seen as a breach of good faith and fair dealing, and potentially violates labor laws if these royalties are tied to individual performance.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows 12 months to bring a legal action. The modified text shortens this to 6 months. This conflicts with standard statutes of limitations for contract disputes, which are typically longer (e.g., 4 years in California for written contracts). Reducing the time limit makes it more difficult for Licensee to pursue legitimate claims, violating principles of fairness and potentially rendering the clause unenforceable.",

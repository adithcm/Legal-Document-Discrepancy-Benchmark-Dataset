The\ninvoice shall state the amount to be paid by the Distributor for all Products in such shipment, as well as any taxes, duties or\nexcises paid by JRVS which shall be reimbursed by the Distributor in accordance with Section 5.4.

The\ninvoice shall state the amount to be paid by the Distributor for all Products in such shipment, as well as any taxes, duties or\nexcises paid by JRVS which shall be reimbursed by the Distributor in accordance with Section 5.4. Terms of payment shall be net\nforty-five (45) days. All payments shall be in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "In the United States, while there's no federal law mandating specific payment terms between businesses, unreasonably long payment terms (like 45 days) can be deemed unfair, especially for smaller distributors. This can run afoul of state-level prompt payment laws or be viewed as an unconscionable contract provision, creating a legal contradiction.",

Defective Products may be returned for retest, evaluation and examination subject to JRVS\nReturned Material Authorization (“RMA”) procedure; provided, that such written notification and request for an RMA number\nmust be received by JRVS during the Inspection Period. Returns must be prepaid by Distributor. When requesting a return\nauthorization, Distributor must supply Distributor’s purchase order number and JRVS’s invoice number.

                "explanation": "Reducing the inspection period to 10 days is very short. If the distributor needs longer to test all the units, this could contradict implied warranty laws or general fairness principles, particularly if defects aren't immediately apparent. This could be argued as an unconscionable or unreasonable limitation on the distributor's ability to identify and address defects.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the statute of limitations for bringing actions to 6 months from the standard limitations periods for contract disputes (which can be several years, depending on the jurisdiction and type of claim) could be deemed unconscionable and legally questionable. A shorter period severely limits the distributor's ability to pursue legal remedies if issues arise.",

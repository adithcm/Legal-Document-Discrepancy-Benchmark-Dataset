                "original_text": "Within 30 days of the end of each quarter during the term of this agreement, PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT shall receive from THE HENRY FILM\nAND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION, a detailed accounting statement showing Net Due and Paid Shared Revenues for that quarter and shall\nremit to PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT its share of such revenues.",
                "changed_text": "Within 90 days of the end of each quarter during the term of this agreement, PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT shall receive from THE HENRY FILM\nAND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION, a detailed accounting statement showing Net Due and Paid Shared Revenues for that quarter and shall\nremit to PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT its share of such revenues.",
                "explanation": "California law requires that payments for services rendered be made promptly. While there isn't a specific law for revenue sharing agreements, delaying payment for 90 days significantly extends the payment timeframe and could be deemed unreasonable, potentially conflicting with California's prompt payment principles.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 15 days could be considered an unreasonably short timeframe, particularly given the length of the extension terms (3 years). This could be challenged under California contract law as unconscionable or violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, especially if it significantly disadvantages one party.",

                "explanation": "California law provides limited grounds for appealing arbitration decisions (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1286.2). Completely removing the option to appeal, even with these limited grounds, may be considered unconscionable, especially if it disproportionately affects one party's rights and access to justice. Parties generally have the right to challenge arbitration outcomes based on arbitrator misconduct or errors of law. The changed text could be seen as an attempt to eliminate any recourse, conflicting with principles of fairness and due process.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month for sales during the previous month.",
                "changed_text": "All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within ninety (90) days after the end of each calendar month for sales during the previous month.",
                "explanation": "Extending the payment deadline to 90 days may violate state laws regarding prompt payment, potentially conflicting with regulations requiring faster payment timelines, especially if the individual is considered an independent contractor in Illinois. Illinois law requires that independent contractors get paid based on the agreed terms, and a 90 day timeline may be seen as unreasonable or exploitative. ",
                "contradicted_law": "Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act, and general contract law principles regarding reasonable payment terms.",

                "changed_text": "Individual agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Lifeway from and against any and all claims, actions, causes or other expenses incurred arising from any misrepresentations or false statements made by the Individual in the Marketing Materials, regardless of whether Lifeway contributed to or was aware of said misrepresentations or false statements.",
                "explanation": "This change broadens the indemnification clause to include situations where Lifeway knew or contributed to the misrepresentations. This conflicts with general principles of indemnity, which typically do not allow a party to be indemnified for their own misconduct or negligence. Enforcing such a clause may be against public policy, as it would shield Lifeway from liability for its own actions in Illinois.",

                "changed_text": "The waiver by either party of a breach or a default of any provision of this Agreement by the other party will not be construed as a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same or any other provision, even if such waiver is expressed in writing and supported by consideration.",
                "explanation": "This modification attempts to negate the legal effect of a written waiver supported by consideration. Under Illinois law, a written waiver supported by consideration is generally enforceable. This change attempts to override this established legal principle, making the waiver provision potentially unenforceable and contradictory to contract law.",

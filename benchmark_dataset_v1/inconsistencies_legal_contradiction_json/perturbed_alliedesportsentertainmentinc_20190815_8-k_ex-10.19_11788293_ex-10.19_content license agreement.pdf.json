                "explanation": "Extended payment terms beyond standard commercial practices could be seen as unfair or create cash flow issues, potentially violating California's prompt payment laws if WPT is considered a small business or if specific regulations around service contracts apply, as California law often mandates quicker payment timelines to protect smaller entities. Although no specific law is violated, this could be considered an unusually long payment period for a large sum that may affect smaller business' cash flows.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with implied obligations of good faith and fair dealing under California contract law and prompt payment statutes depending on WPT's size and the nature of the services. Delayed payment may disproportionately affect a smaller business.",

The other party shall have thirty (30) days from the effective date of such notice in which to correct any such default(s) (except those which are not curable), and failing such correction by the end of such thirty (30) day cure period, this Agreement shall thereupon immediately terminate.",

This is especially relevant if the breach involves complex issues that require more than 10 days to resolve. This shorter period may not provide sufficient opportunity to cure the breach, potentially leading to unjust termination.",

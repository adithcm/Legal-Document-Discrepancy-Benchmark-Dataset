                "changed_text": "Following the Effective Date, the Parties will enter into a pharmacovigilance agreement setting forth the worldwide pharmacovigilance procedures for the Parties with respect to the Products, such as safety data sharing, adverse events reporting and safety profile monitoring (the “Pharmacovigilance Agreement”) 180 days after Sanofi's request. If there are any changes, adverse events and safety profile monitoring prior to 180 days then it is the responsbility of each party to ensure it is shared at their descretion.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a fixed timeframe of 180 days after Sanofi’s request for entering into the pharmacovigilance agreement, removing the earlier requirement before the first clinical trial. It also gives each party descretion to ensure events are shared prior to the 180 days. This delay and descretion introduce potential non-compliance, as pharmacovigilance agreements are legally required to be in place before clinical trials commence to ensure patient safety.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires neutral, independent, and impartial arbitrators with relevant experience. The modified text removes these requirements and allows parties to appoint arbitrators that are not neutral and potentially biased (former company executives), conflicting with standard arbitration practices.",

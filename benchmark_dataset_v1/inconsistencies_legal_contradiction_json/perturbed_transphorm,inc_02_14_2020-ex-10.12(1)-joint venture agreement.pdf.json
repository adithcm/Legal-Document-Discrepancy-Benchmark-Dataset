                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "FSL and AFSL may not exercise the Put Option prior to the Option Starting Date nor more than one hundred eighty (180) days after the Option Starting Date.",
                "changed_text": "FSL and AFSL may not exercise the Put Option prior to the Option Starting Date nor more than thirty (30) days after the Option Starting Date.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows 180 days for exercising the Put Option after the starting date. By reducing this to 30 days, we create a condition that may unreasonably restrict the option holder's ability to exercise their right within a timeframe that could be deemed insufficient or conflict with standards of commercial reasonableness, depending on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with principles of 'reasonable time' in contract law, which is interpreted based on specific circumstances and jurisdictions.",

                "explanation": "Similar to the Put Option change, reducing the Call Option exercise window to 15 days may be deemed unreasonably restrictive, potentially conflicting with principles of 'reasonable time' for contract execution. This short timeframe could be seen as coercively limiting the option holder's ability to assess and act on their rights effectively.",

                "explanation": "By reducing the cure period for a material breach from 30 days to 10 days, this modification creates a situation where the breaching party has significantly less time to rectify the issue. This may be considered an unreasonably short timeframe, particularly for complex breaches that require substantial investigation or remediation efforts. Such a restriction might contradict the principle of good faith and fair dealing, and certain statutory protections related to curing contractual defaults depending on the applicable jurisdiction.",

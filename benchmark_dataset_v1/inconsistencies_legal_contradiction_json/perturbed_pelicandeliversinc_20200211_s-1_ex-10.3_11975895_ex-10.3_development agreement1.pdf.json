                "explanation": "Under Washington State law (where Bellevue, WA is located) and federal regulations, the collection and verification of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as IDs and selfies, require explicit consent and adherence to data privacy principles. By mandating ID verification and selfie uploads immediately after payment confirmation, the modified clause violates these principles. The original clause allows users to proceed with payment without preconditions of providing sensitive identification data first, and the change requires ID verification *before* completing the order, and has not included language that ensures compliance with laws like GDPR or CCPA, especially regarding user data protection.",

                "explanation": "Limiting the acceptance time to 5 seconds creates unrealistic time constraint for drivers which can be considered an unfair labor practice under Washington State labor laws.  Washington State labor laws prioritize fair and reasonable working conditions.  A 5-second window may impede a driver's ability to carefully assess order details, potentially leading to unintended rejections and impacting their earnings. This can lead to potential liability. An unreasonably short timeframe may also disproportionately affect drivers with disabilities, violating anti-discrimination laws.",

The final 20% payment will be made at the company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modified text changes the final payment condition to 'company's discretion,' creating ambiguity and potential conflict with contract law principles. Under Washington State contract law, payment terms must be clearly defined. By making the final payment discretionary, the contract violates these principles and may be deemed unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "ETON shall enter into a commercial supply agreement with a contract manufacturing organization and Aucta shall enter into a commercial supply agreement with an active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier within one hundred eighty (180) days from the Execution Date unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing.",
                "explanation": "This modification extends the deadline for entering into commercial supply agreements. While seemingly innocuous, if this delay causes a failure to meet FDA submission deadlines or other regulatory requirements under the FD&C Act, it could result in regulatory penalties or delays, contradicting the implied obligations to comply with FDA regulations. This is regulated under 21 U.S. Code § 351.",

                "original_text": "If either Party shall learn of (a) any claim or assertion that the manufacture, use or marketing of the Product under this Agreement, or any other action taken by either party in performance of its obligations hereunder infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights of any Third Party, or (b) the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or other violation by any Third Party of the intellectual property rights of any party that are the subject of this Agreement (“Intellectual Rights Suits”), then the Party becoming so informed shall as soon as reasonably practicable, but in all events within three (3) Business Days thereafter (the “Infringement Notification Date”), notify the other Party of such claim or assertion, or actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or other violation.",
                "changed_text": "If either Party shall learn of (a) any claim or assertion that the manufacture, use or marketing of the Product under this Agreement, or any other action taken by either party in performance of its obligations hereunder infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights of any Third Party, or (b) the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or other violation by any Third Party of the intellectual property rights of any party that are the subject of this Agreement (“Intellectual Rights Suits”), then the Party becoming so informed shall notify the other Party of such claim or assertion, or actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or other violation at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates notification within three business days of learning about potential intellectual property infringement. This modified version removes the mandatory timeframe, giving the party discretion on when to notify. However, under US patent law, specifically 35 U.S. Code § 287, a patent holder's ability to recover damages is contingent upon providing notice of the infringement. By removing the defined notification period, this change can severely impact the other party's ability to protect its rights and seek damages, potentially violating implied legal obligations and rights under patent law.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the payment period from 30 days to 90 days can create inconsistencies with state prompt payment laws, which mandate specific timelines for payments in commercial transactions. While the contract is governed by Delaware law, the actual sales occur in all 50 states. Many states have laws requiring payments to be made within a shorter timeframe, typically 30 to 45 days. By setting a 90-day payment term, the contract violates those state laws related to prompt payment if they apply to royalty payments.",

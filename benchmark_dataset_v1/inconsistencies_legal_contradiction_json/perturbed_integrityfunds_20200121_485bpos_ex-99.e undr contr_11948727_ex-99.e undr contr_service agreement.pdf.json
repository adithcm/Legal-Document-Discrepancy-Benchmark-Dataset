The Fund’s agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers and governors, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon the Fund’s being notified of any action brought against Integrity, its officers or governors, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or by telegram addressed to the Fund at its principal office in Minot,\nNorth Dakota, and sent to the Fund by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'ten days' to 'two days' for notification to the Fund regarding legal action against Integrity contradicts standard legal practice and may violate due process rights.

                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for termination by the Fund from 60 days to 10 days may be considered unreasonable, especially considering Integrity only needs to provide 90 days notice to terminate. This discrepancy could violate principles of good faith and fair dealing implicit in contract law, as it provides a significantly shorter period for the Fund to find a replacement underwriter, potentially leading to disruptions in service. Additionally, it could contradict regulations requiring fund managers to act in the best interest of shareholders, as such a short notice period might not allow for an orderly transition.",

As used in this Agreement, the terms “registration statement,” “prospectus,” and “statement of additional information” shall mean any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information filed by the Fund with the SEC and any amendments and supplements thereto which at any time shall have been filed with the SEC. The Fund represents and warrants to Integrity that any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information, when such registration statement becomes effective, will include all statements required to be contained therein in conformity with the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC; that all statements of fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information will be true and correct when such registration statement becomes effective; and that neither any registration statement nor any prospectus or statement of additional information when such registration statement becomes effective will include an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to a purchaser of Shares.

The\nFund shall not file any amendment to any registration statement or supplement to any prospectus or statement of additional\ninformation without giving Integrity reasonable notice thereof in advance; provided, however, that nothing contained in this\nAgreement shall in any way limit the Fund’s right to file at any time such amendments to any registration statement and/or\nsupplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information, of whatever character, as the Fund may deem advisable,\nsuch right being in all respects absolute and unconditional.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the time the Fund has to propose amendments/supplements from fifteen days to two days after Integrity's request places an unreasonable burden on the Fund. Given the complexities involved in SEC filings and regulatory compliance, two days is insufficient time for the Fund to properly assess, draft, and file necessary documents. This violates the standard of reasonable time for compliance and contradicts SEC regulations which emphasize accuracy and completeness of filings.",

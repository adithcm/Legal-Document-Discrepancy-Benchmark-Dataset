                "original_text": "The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (“Dispute Notice”) to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (“Dispute Notice”) to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within fifteen (15) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the negotiation period from 60 days to 15 days could be considered unreasonable and may conflict with standard legal practices regarding dispute resolution, potentially violating principles of good faith negotiation. While there isn't a specific law mandating a 60-day negotiation period, courts in Taiwan (where the agreement is governed) generally expect a reasonable timeframe for dispute resolution before resorting to arbitration. 15 days may be viewed as too short to allow for meaningful negotiation, particularly in complex commercial disputes.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the negotiation period for an extension from six months to one month before expiration may be considered commercially unreasonable. This severely limits the time available for both parties to assess the alliance's performance, negotiate new terms, and secure internal approvals for an extension. Such a short period could be construed as a breach of good faith or hinder effective strategic planning and continuation of the alliance, violating principles of fair dealing under Taiwanese contract law.",

                "changed_text": "The notices and other expressions of intent for the purpose of this Agreement shall be deemed received: when delivered by express delivery or personal delivery, at the actual time of receipt; when delivered by mail, 24 hours after mailing.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the deemed receipt time for mailed notices to 24 hours could be problematic. This timeframe may not be realistically achievable, especially for international mail between Taiwan and China, potentially disadvantaging one party if timely notice is crucial. This change might contradict principles of fair notice and due process under Taiwanese law, as it creates an unreasonable assumption of prompt delivery that is not aligned with practical mailing realities.

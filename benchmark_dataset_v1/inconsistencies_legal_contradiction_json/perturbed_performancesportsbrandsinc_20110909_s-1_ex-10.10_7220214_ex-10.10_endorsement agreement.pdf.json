                "original_text": "Amounts not received within ten (10) days following their respective due dates shall be assessed a late charge equal to one and one-half percent (1 _%) per month of the overdue amount until paid, commencing on the eleventh day.",
                "changed_text": "Amounts not received within five (5) days following their respective due dates shall be assessed a late charge equal to five percent (5%) per month of the overdue amount until paid, commencing on the sixth day.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a penalty that may violate usury laws, which regulate the maximum interest rates that can be charged on debts. Florida law sets limits on interest rates, and a 5% monthly charge (60% annually) could exceed those limits, especially for commercial transactions, making it an illegal contradiction. Additionally, reducing the grace period to 5 days could be considered unconscionable and violate fair business practices.",

Sepulveda Blvd., Suite G, Manhattan Beach, CA 90266, a complete and accurate set of books and records maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and business practices. Said books and records shall be maintained for a two (2) year period following the expiration or termination of this Agreement. Company shall make said books available to North or North’s representative on reasonable notice during the Term of this Agreement and the two (2) year period immediately following thereafter.",

Said records shall be maintained for a one (1) year period following the expiration or termination of this Agreement. Company shall make said books available to North or North’s representative with a 3-day notice during the Term of this Agreement and the one (1) year period immediately following thereafter.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period to one year may violate accounting regulations and best practices, potentially contradicting legal standards that require longer retention periods for financial records to ensure compliance and auditability. This is especially problematic if audits are performed later. Furthermore, reducing the notice period to 3 days could be considered unreasonable and may violate standards of fair access to information.",

North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and Company has no obligation to advise North of the specific grounds for the disapproval.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the approval window to two business days is an unreasonable timeframe. Further, removing the requirement for the Company to justify disapprovals may violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which is a principle of contract law. This is because it gives the company considerable power to approve/disapprove marketing material with very little time and no requirement to notify Andy North with the reasoning for the decision.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "MBE agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to execute agreements, or to facilitate the execution of agreements among the appropriate parties, so that such Basic Fee is paid to the Company directly from the carrier which ships such package no later than fifteen (15) days following the end of the month in which such package was shipped.",
                "changed_text": "MBE agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to execute agreements, or to facilitate the execution of agreements among the appropriate parties, so that such Basic Fee is paid to the Company directly from the carrier which ships such package no later than sixty (60) days following the end of the month in which such package was shipped.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment deadline to sixty days, which could violate prompt payment laws in some states, requiring payment within a shorter timeframe, like 30 days.",

                "explanation": "By giving the company complete discretion over payment timing, this contradicts laws that require timely and predictable payment schedules. This is especially problematic since the agreement appears to relate to franchise operations, where payment schedules are crucial.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may, at its option, terminate this Agreement upon notice to the other party if the other party materially fails to comply with any of the material terms and conditions of this Agreement and such default has not been cured within ten (10) days after written notice to the other party, regardless of the nature of the breach.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the cure period to a flat ten days for any material breach, which may be insufficient and unreasonable, especially for complex breaches.

                "original_text": "All payments hereunder will be in US Dollars and are due and payable within thirty (30) days after the date of invoice. iPass may terminate or modify these payment terms with reasonable notice, when, in its reasonable discretion, iPass believes that its payments may be at risk.",
                "changed_text": "All payments hereunder will be in US Dollars and are due and payable within sixty (60) days after the date of invoice. iPass may terminate or modify these payment terms without any prior notice, when, in its reasonable discretion, iPass believes that its payments may be at risk.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for payment within thirty (30) days of the invoice date, but the modified text extends the payment period to sixty (60) days. Many states have prompt payment laws that mandate specific payment terms. This change could potentially contradict the prompt payment laws. Additionally, the original requires 'reasonable notice' for termination, but the modified text removes any notice requirement, allowing iPass to terminate or modify payment terms without warning, which may violate fair contracting principles and potential state laws regarding sufficient notice.",

                "changed_text": "Without limiting iPass’ other available rights and remedies, iPass reserves the right to suspend or to terminate any Services five (5) days after sending written notice of a payment that is thirty (30) or more days past due.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for a ten (10) day notice period before suspending or terminating services due to late payment. The modified text reduces this notice period to five (5) days. This could contradict state laws requiring longer cure periods or notice periods before service termination, particularly if the Channel Partner is considered a small business or faces specific protections under state law.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides thirty (30) days for the Channel Partner to dispute an invoice and sixty (60) days to submit a claim. The modified text reduces these periods to fifteen (15) and thirty (30) days respectively. This could be considered unreasonably short and might violate state laws that imply a reasonable time for dispute resolution and claim submission. Especially concerning is the change from 'reasonably disputes' to 'disputes' which opens the door for the parties to dispute any amount.",

                "changed_text": "Such amounts shall be billed on a bi-monthly basis by Equidata and are due and payable in full by Marketing Affiliate 60 days from the invoice date.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires payment 30 days from the invoice date. This has been modified to 60 days from the invoice date. This could be problematic as extending payment terms significantly without clear justification or mutual agreement could be seen as an unfair business practice, particularly if it deviates from standard industry practices and imposes undue hardship on Equidata. While not explicitly illegal in itself, excessively long payment terms may violate state-level prompt payment laws or be deemed unreasonable depending on the specific goods or services provided.",

                "original_text": "Marketing Affiliate shall give Equidata written demand of dispute within 10 days of the due date of the invoice. The demand shall set forth a statement for the nature of the dispute and the amount involved. If Equidata and Marketing Affiliate can not resolve the dispute on their own within 10 days after Equidata receive said dispute, the parties shall jointly select an arbitrator.",
                "changed_text": "Marketing Affiliate shall give Equidata written demand of dispute within 5 days of the due date of the invoice. The demand shall set forth a statement for the nature of the dispute and the amount involved. If Equidata and Marketing Affiliate can not resolve the dispute on their own within 5 days after Equidata receive said dispute, the parties shall jointly select an arbitrator.",
                "explanation": "The original contract stipulates that the Marketing Affiliate must provide a written demand of dispute within 10 days of the invoice due date, and that there is a 10-day period for resolving disputes before arbitration. By reducing both of these periods to 5 days, the modified clause creates an unreasonably short timeframe for identifying and addressing billing discrepancies. This could potentially violate general contract law principles relating to fairness and reasonable opportunity to resolve disputes, making it difficult for the Marketing Affiliate to effectively challenge incorrect invoices and increasing the risk of rushed or incomplete dispute resolution processes. Further, this may violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "Such approval is at Equidata's discretion and shall be completed within 7 days of receipt of Marketing Materials for review.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires Equidata to review and approve Marketing Affiliate's marketing materials within 48 hours, with a condition that the approval should not be unreasonably withheld. The modified clause changes this to give Equidata complete discretion over the approval and extends the review period to 7 days. Removing the 'not unreasonably withheld' clause could violate consumer protection laws that require fairness and reasonableness in commercial transactions. Furthermore, this modification could also be argued to be a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it allows Equidata to arbitrarily block the Marketing Affiliate's promotional efforts without any reasonable justification, potentially causing significant economic harm to the Marketing Affiliate.",

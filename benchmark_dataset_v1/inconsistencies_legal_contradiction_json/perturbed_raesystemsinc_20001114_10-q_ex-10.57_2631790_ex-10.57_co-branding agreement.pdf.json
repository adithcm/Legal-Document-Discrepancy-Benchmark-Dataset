                "changed_text": "Upon written demand of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall cease using the Confidential Information and return the Confidential Information and all copies, notes or extracts thereof to the Disclosing Party within two (2) days of receipt of notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the Receiving Party to return Confidential Information within 7 days of receiving a written demand. The modified text shortens this period to 2 days. California law, where this agreement is governed, may require a more reasonable timeframe depending on the volume and complexity of the confidential information, and 2 days might be deemed an unreasonably short period, especially if a significant amount of data needs to be compiled and returned.",

                "changed_text": "Notices will be deemed effective (i) fifteen (15) working days after deposit, postage prepaid, if mailed, (ii) five (5) days if sent by overnight mail, or (iii) five (5) days if sent by facsimile and confirmed as set forth above.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines the timeframes for when notices are considered effective. The modified text extends these timeframes significantly. While contract law typically allows parties to define notice periods, unreasonably long notice periods can be challenged, especially if they prejudice one party's ability to act in a timely manner. The modified timeframes could be deemed unreasonable, potentially conflicting with good faith and fair dealing principles, especially if time-sensitive actions are involved.",

Upon reasonable notice of not less than seven (7) business days, but in no event more than once per year (unless the immediately preceding audit showed a material underpayment), NETTAXI shall have the right, subject to suitable confidentiality measures, to cause a certified public accountant to inspect those portions of the books of account and records which relate to the royalties owed NETTAXI, to confirm that the correct amount owing NETTAXI under this Agreement has been paid.",

NETTAXI shall have the right, subject to suitable confidentiality measures, to cause a certified public accountant to inspect those portions of the books of account and records which relate to the royalties owed NETTAXI, to confirm that the correct amount owing NETTAXI under this Agreement has been paid. NETTAXI can exercise this right at any time and without notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'reasonable notice of not less than seven (7) business days' before NETTAXI can audit SpinRecords.com's books and limits audits to once per year. The modified text removes the notice period and the annual limit, allowing NETTAXI to conduct audits at any time without prior warning. This change could be considered unreasonable and a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it gives NETTAXI an unrestricted and potentially disruptive audit power. Such a clause might not be enforceable under California law without a clear demonstration of a legitimate business need for such unfettered access.",

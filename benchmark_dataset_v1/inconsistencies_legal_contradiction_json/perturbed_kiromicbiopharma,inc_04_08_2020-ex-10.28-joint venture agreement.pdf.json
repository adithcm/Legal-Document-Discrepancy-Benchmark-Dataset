                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Steering Committee shall appoint, within 30 days of the signature of this JV, a Technical Committee composed of one representative of each of the Parties in relation to each specific",
                "changed_text": "The Steering Committee shall appoint, within 60 days of the signature of this JV, a Technical Committee composed of one representative of each of the Parties in relation to each specific",
                "explanation": "This change extends the deadline for appointing the Technical Committee. Although seemingly minor, if Italian law (governing the agreement per section 16) mandates a shorter timeframe for establishing such committees in joint ventures related to clinical trials, this alteration would create a legal inconsistency.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates Italian law regarding the establishment of committees in joint ventures, depending on specific regulations regarding clinical trials and R&D collaborations.",
                "location": "Section 3"

                "original_text": "The Parties undertake to promptly notify each other about the achievement of the Scope, as mentioned in point 2 (“the Results”) , that may be subject to Industrial and Intellectual Property Rights, within 30 days from the achievement of such Results and to cooperate in the evaluation of the existence of the necessary requirements for the patenting/registration of such Results.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties may, at their discretion, notify each other about the achievement of the Scope, as mentioned in point 2 (“the Results”) , that may be subject to Industrial and Intellectual Property Rights, with no specified timeline, and cooperate only when feasible in the evaluation of requirements for patenting/registration.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the mandatory notification and the 30-day deadline.  Intellectual property law, depending on the jurisdiction, often requires prompt disclosure and action to protect patent rights. Removing the deadline and making the notification discretionary could jeopardize patent applications if deemed untimely under relevant patent laws (e.g., first-to-file systems, grace periods).",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates patent laws and regulations regarding timely disclosure and filing of patent applications in both Italy and the United States.",

                "changed_text": "Withdrawal can be exercised verbally, with no advance notice required.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts fundamental contract law principles that require written notice for significant actions like withdrawal, especially when dealing with international commercial agreements. It creates ambiguity and potential for disputes, making the withdrawal clause unenforceable.  Under Italian law, and generally in contract law, significant contractual changes or withdrawals require written notification to ensure clarity and prevent misunderstandings.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates Italian contract law regarding the requirements for valid notice and withdrawal from agreements.",

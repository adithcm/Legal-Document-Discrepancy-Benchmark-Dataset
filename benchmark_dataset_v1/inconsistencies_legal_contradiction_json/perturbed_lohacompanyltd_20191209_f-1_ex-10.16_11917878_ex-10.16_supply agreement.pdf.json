If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or modifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party shall not unilaterally cancel the order before the two sides agreed .",
                "changed_text": "The seller shall confirm within one working day after receipt of order. If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party immediately after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or modifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party shall not unilaterally cancel the order before the two sides agreed .",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the confirmation period to one working day and requires immediate notification for unacceptable orders. This could be considered an unreasonably short timeframe, especially for complex orders, potentially violating fair business practices depending on the jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions may have implied terms of 'reasonable time' for contract responses.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates principles of 'reasonable time' for contract acceptance, depending on jurisdiction and the nature of the goods. It could be argued as unconscionable if the seller doesn't have enough time to properly assess the order.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the claim period to 2 days is potentially unreasonable and could violate the buyer's rights to a fair inspection period. This short timeframe may not allow for adequate inspection, especially for complex goods or large shipments. Depending on the governing law, such a short claim period might be deemed unconscionable or against public policy.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the response time to 24 hours for claim acceptance is highly unreasonable and could be considered a violation of due process. Such a short timeframe is unlikely to allow the seller adequate time to investigate the claim and respond appropriately. This could be deemed an unfair business practice.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates principles of fair dealing and reasonable opportunity to respond to claims. May conflict with standard commercial law principles requiring reasonable time for investigation and response.",

                "original_text": "3. INDEMNIFICATION AND SURVIVAL. All representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall survive the Closing of this Agreement, except that any party to whom a representation or warranty has been made in this Agreement shall be deemed to have waived any misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty of which such party had knowledge prior to Closing. Any party learning of a misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty under this Agreement shall immediately give written notice thereof to all other parties to this Agreement. The representations and warranties in this Agreement shall terminate one year from the Closing Date, and such representations or warranties shall thereafter be without force or effect, except any claim with respect to which notice has been given to the party to be charged prior to such expiration date. LEADER hereby agrees to indemnify and hold EZJR, it successors, and assigns harmless from and against any and all damage or deficiency resulting from any material misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant, or nonfulfillment of any agreement on the part of LEADER under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "3. INDEMNIFICATION AND SURVIVAL. All representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall terminate immediately upon the Closing of this Agreement. Any claims for misrepresentation or breach of warranty must be asserted within 30 days of Closing. LEADER's indemnification obligations are capped at $10,000 total, regardless of the extent of the damages suffered by EZJR. LEADER hereby agrees to indemnify and hold EZJR, it successors, and assigns harmless from and against any and all damage or deficiency resulting from any material misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant, or nonfulfillment of any agreement on the part of LEADER under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows representations and warranties to survive for one year, which is a reasonable timeframe. The modified text significantly shortens the survival period to immediate termination upon closing, and limits claims to 30 days. This introduces a conflict with general contract law principles regarding reasonable timeframes for discovering and pursuing claims, and specifically may conflict with Nevada statutes of limitations applicable to breach of contract or misrepresentation claims. Additionally, capping indemnification obligations at $10,000, regardless of damages, may be deemed unconscionable or against public policy if the potential damages from a breach could far exceed this amount.",

                "changed_text": "12. NOTICES. All notices, requests, demands, and other communications required or permitted hereunder will be considered delivered upon successful transmission of telepathic signal by one party to the other.",
                "explanation": "The original notice provision allows for written notices delivered through conventional means. The modified text requires telepathic communication. This is not a legally recognized method of communication and creates a contradiction with established principles of contract law, which require that notice be reasonably communicated and documented. The impossibility of verifying the receipt or content of a telepathic message renders the clause unenforceable.",

If any action is brought among the parties with respect to this Agreement or otherwise, by way of a claim or counterclaim, the parties agree that in any such action, and on all issues, the parties irrevocably waive their right to a trial by jury.

If any action is brought among the parties with respect to this Agreement or otherwise, by way of a claim or counterclaim, the parties agree that in any such action, and on all issues, the parties irrevocably waive their right to any form of legal recourse. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any such action shall be decided by Leader Act Ltd HK, regardless of where the dispute arises.",
                "explanation": "While parties can generally agree to a governing law, choosing the laws of North Korea, a jurisdiction with a legal system fundamentally incompatible with that of the United States, raises serious enforceability issues and conflicts with public policy. Moreover, the clause now includes the phrase 'the parties irrevocably waive their right to any form of legal recourse'. This could be interpreted as preventing any legal action, which is contradictory to basic principles of contract law and due process. Moreover, giving Leader Act Ltd HK unilateral control over jurisdiction regardless of the dispute's origin may be seen as unreasonable and unenforceable.",

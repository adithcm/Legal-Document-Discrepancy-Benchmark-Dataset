                "changed_text": "Either party may cancel this Agreement upon the occurrence of any of the\nfollowing:\nMaterial breach of any covenant, term, condition or other provisions of this\nAgreement, which breach is not remedied within two (2) days after notice\nof such breach is received by the breaching party",
                "explanation": "The original text allows a 10-day cure period for a material breach. Changing this to a 2-day cure period creates a legal contradiction because such a short period may be deemed unreasonable and violate principles of contract law regarding adequate opportunity to cure a breach, depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the breach.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires a 90-day notice for price changes. Reducing this to 5 days is likely unreasonable, especially considering the potential impact on MA's marketing plans and sales forecasts. This could be considered a breach of good faith and fair dealing, potentially violating contract law principles regarding adequate notice.",

A 10-day warranty claim period may be deemed unreasonably short, especially for complex technology, and could be viewed as an unconscionable limitation on the buyer's rights under the UCC or similar consumer protection statutes, depending on the end-user agreement.",

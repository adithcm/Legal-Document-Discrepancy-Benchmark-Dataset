                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A Party will have ten (10) days to provide adequate assurances of performance to the other Party in a form acceptable to the other Party in its good faith discretion.",
                "changed_text": "A Party will have two (2) days to provide adequate assurances of performance to the other Party in a form acceptable to the other Party in its good faith discretion.",
                "explanation": "Under the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), Section 2-609, while the timeframe for providing adequate assurance is not explicitly defined, ten days is generally considered a reasonable period. Reducing this to two days places an undue burden on the party required to provide assurance and contradicts the implicit reasonableness standard of the UCC, potentially leading to disputes over compliance.",

                "original_text": "An insuring Party must deliver the following written evidence of the required insurance coverage to the other Party (Attention: Risk Management), or its designated insurance monitoring service, within ten (10) of written request and at least thirty (30) days in advance of the expiration of a then current policy term (if a declaration or endorsement is not available from an insurer at the time requested or required, an insuring Party will provide them as soon as the declaration or endorsement is available from the insurer):",
                "changed_text": "An insuring Party must deliver the following written evidence of the required insurance coverage to the other Party (Attention: Risk Management), or its designated insurance monitoring service, within seventy five (75) of written request and at least five (5) days in advance of the expiration of a then current policy term (if a declaration or endorsement is not available from an insurer at the time requested or required, an insuring Party will provide them as soon as the declaration or endorsement is available from the insurer):",
                "explanation": "The original contract allows for 30 days advance notice before the expiration of a policy. The modified text shortens that to five days. Such limited notice conflicts with standard insurance renewal practices, creating a potential breach of contract if the other party cannot fulfill the requirement in time and possibly violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. Moreover, giving the insuring party 75 days to respond with the evidence makes no sense since they only have 5 days until the insurance expires. It's an impossible ask.",

                "changed_text": "If a Disclosing Party neglects to label or deliver timely written notice to the Receiving Party identifying the disclosed information as confidential in nature, the disclosed information will never be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original contract establishes a provision where, even without explicit labeling, information can be deemed confidential if proven that the receiving party knew it was a trade secret. The modified version removes this protection, mandating that information that is accidentally not labeled is not confidential. This contradicts the Illinois Trade Secrets Act (ITSA), which protects trade secrets regardless of labeling, as long as reasonable efforts are made to maintain secrecy. This change unfairly allows the receiving party to exploit accidentally unlabeled trade secrets, potentially leading to misappropriation.",

                "explanation": "The original contract specifies a two-year non-compete period and excludes India from the non-compete region. It also permits up to 5% passive investment. Changing the non-compete period to ten years, including India in the non-compete region, reducing passive investment allowance to 1%, and removing the net sales limit could render the clause overly broad and unreasonable under Pennsylvania law, which governs the agreement. Pennsylvania courts typically disfavor overly broad non-compete agreements, especially in duration and geographic scope. This change makes the restriction likely unenforceable.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former",
                "changed_text": "(d) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and continuing indefinitely after the Closing Date (the “Non-Solicit Period”), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business. Sellers shall be restricted from soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) regardless of when the employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) or soliciting employees of the Combined Business by any means.",
                "explanation": "Pennsylvania law disfavors non-solicitation agreements that are unlimited in time. Removing the three-year limit and extending the non-solicitation obligation indefinitely is likely unenforceable under Pennsylvania law because it is an unreasonable restraint on trade and on an individual's ability to earn a living. By removing the exception for soliciting former employees and prohibiting general solicitations, the clause becomes even more overly restrictive, increasing the likelihood of unenforceability.",

To this end, the parties agree that the covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be construed to extend in\ntime and territory and with respect to degree of participation only so far as they may be enforced in such jurisdiction, and that the covenants\ncontained in this Section 1 are to that end hereby declared divisible and severable. It being the purpose of this Section 1 to govern competition by\nthe Sellers and their respective subsidiaries, the non-competition covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be governed by and construed\naccording to the Law of all the jurisdictions in which competition in breach of this Agreement is alleged to have occurred or to be threatened that\nbest gives them effect.",

This Section 1 shall be governed and construed to give maximum effect to its restrictive terms, overriding any principles of reasonableness or public policy.",
                "explanation": "The original clause aims for maximum permissible enforcement. By changing the language to enforce Section 1 regardless of conflicting laws, overriding reasonableness and public policy, the clause becomes directly contradictory to established legal principles. Pennsylvania courts (and courts generally) will not enforce contract terms that are against public policy or violate statutory restrictions. This change effectively negates the principle of severability and the clause's original intention to comply with applicable law, making it directly contradict legal standards for contract enforceability.",

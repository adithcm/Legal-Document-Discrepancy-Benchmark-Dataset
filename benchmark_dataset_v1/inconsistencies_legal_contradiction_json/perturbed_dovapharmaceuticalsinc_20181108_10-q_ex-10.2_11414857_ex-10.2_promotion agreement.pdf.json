                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Within [***] following the end of each Calendar Quarter during the Term, Valeant shall provide Dova with a written report (each a “Compliance Report”), which sets out a summary of Valeant’s compliance monitoring and auditing of the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing (as such monitoring is further described in Section 4.5.1(b)), a summary of any compliance-related disciplinary actions relating to any Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing and any associated remedial actions, a summary of all compliance investigations conducted by Valeant of any of the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing and any associated outcome, and, for the fourth Calendar Quarter only, a summary of the compliance-related training (including a reasonable description of each training topic) received by each Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing during the Calendar Year. Through the JSC, the Parties shall agree on a mutually acceptable form of Compliance Report.",
                "changed_text": "Valeant will provide Dova with a Compliance Report at its sole discretion, no more than annually. This report will summarize Valeant's compliance monitoring of Field Force Personnel and any compliance-related disciplinary actions. Valeant is not required to detail specific remedial actions or investigation outcomes. Details of compliance training will only be included if Valeant deems them relevant.",
                "explanation": "The modified text significantly reduces the frequency and scope of compliance reporting, potentially violating federal regulations that require regular and comprehensive monitoring of pharmaceutical sales practices. By limiting the details required in the report and making the inclusion of training details discretionary, the change reduces transparency and oversight, increasing the risk of non-compliance with anti-kickback statutes and other healthcare laws.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each Party agrees that, during the Term and for a period of [***] thereafter, it shall keep confidential and shall not publish or otherwise disclose and shall not use for any purpose other than as provided for in this Agreement (which includes the exercise of its rights or performance of any obligations hereunder) any Confidential Information furnished to it by or on behalf of the other Party pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees that it shall keep confidential information confidential only for as long as each party deems necessary. All the confidential information should be disclosed to the relevant person in the organization and should be accessible by any authorized person of the organization.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens confidentiality protections. By allowing each party to determine the duration of confidentiality and mandating disclosure within the organization, the text increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure and use of confidential information, potentially violating trade secret laws and contractual obligations. It contradicts standard confidentiality practices that require a clearly defined protection period and limited access to confidential information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Uniform Trade Secrets Act",

                "original_text": "Within [***] after identification of such adjustment. Valeant shall bear the out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with any such inspection or audit, unless the audit shows an undisputed under-reporting or underpayment for that audited period in excess of [***] of the amounts properly determined, in which case, Dova shall reimburse Valeant for its audit fees and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with said audit, which reimbursement shall be due and payable within [***] of receiving appropriate invoices and other support for such audit-related costs.",
                "changed_text": "Valeant shall bear all costs and expenses of the audit, regardless of the outcome. Any adjustments required as a result of audit will be addressed at Dova's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By making the audit fees the responsibility of Valeant irrespective of what the result of the findings, or if there's an underpayment for that audit, this deters Valeant from conducting an audit. This modification removes the incentive for accurate financial reporting, violating principles of good faith and fair dealing. This potentially hinders the enforcement of financial obligations and increases the risk of financial misconduct, potentially violating securities regulations requiring accurate financial reporting.",

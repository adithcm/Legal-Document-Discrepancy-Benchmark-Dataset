                "original_text": "Consistent with Paragraph 15(c) of the Agreement, Licensee shall forfeit the Guarantee paid to date of ***** dollars",
                "changed_text": "Consistent with Paragraph 15(c) of the Agreement, Licensee shall forfeit the Guarantee paid to date of ***** dollars, regardless of any state or federal regulations regarding forfeiture or recoupment of payments.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a clause that ignores any laws protecting the licensee from unfair or premature forfeiture of payments, which could be deemed unconscionable or in violation of regulations governing commercial transactions. This directly contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in most US jurisdictions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; potential violation of state-specific consumer protection laws or commercial codes.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee’s term of exclusivity with respect to the KOH Video Clips shall expire on October 29, 2005, and Licensee’s right and license to distribute the KOH Video Clips shall expire six (6) months after the initial theatrical release of the Property “KINGDOM OF HEAVEN”.",
                "explanation": "This reduces the distribution window, potentially harming the licensee's ability to recoup costs. This could be problematic under the principle of unconscionability if the initial investment by the licensee was significant and six months is demonstrably insufficient to realize a reasonable return, potentially running afoul of business regulations.",

                "explanation": "This attempts to release all future claims of intellectual property infringement, even those not yet known. Such a broad release might be unenforceable in some jurisdictions, particularly if the infringement is discovered much later and caused significant damages. Patent and copyright law provide specific remedies and limitation periods for infringements, which this clause attempts to circumvent, leading to a potential legal conflict.",

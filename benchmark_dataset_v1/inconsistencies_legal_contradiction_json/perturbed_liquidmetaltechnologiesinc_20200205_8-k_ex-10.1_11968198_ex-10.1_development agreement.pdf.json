                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Payment terms are net 30 days after the date of the invoice, or the date of receipt by Liquidmetal of the invoice if the invoice is received more than 10 days after the date of the invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Payment terms are net 60 days after the date of the invoice, regardless of the date of receipt by Liquidmetal of the invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment term to 60 days without considering the invoice receipt date, which could potentially violate prompt payment laws in some states (including California, where Liquidmetal's principal place of business is located, which generally requires payment within 30 to 45 days unless otherwise agreed to in writing), especially if the agreement doesn't explicitly and conspicuously waive those rights.",

Upon reasonable and prior notice to Eutectix, Eutectix will also provide Liquidmetal or its designee from time to time with reasonable access to Eutectix’s facility and the facilities of its sub-suppliers and other subcontractors to permit Liquidmetal to inspect the production, handling, and storage of Liquidmetal Products and the Licensed Equipment and inventories of raw materials and components. Eutectix shall maintain an orderly storage bookkeeping so that the respective inventory of the Licensed Equipment, Liquidmetal Products and property of Liquidmetal can be immediately recognized; and\n(e)\tsuch confirmation and validation to be conducted with minimal disruption to Eutectix’s business operations and all information disclosed during such exercise to be deemed to be Confidential Information.",

                "explanation": "This modification increases the audit frequency to four times per year and extends the audit period after termination to five years. This could be deemed an unreasonable burden on Eutectix, especially regarding access to sensitive financial and operational information, and may conflict with state laws protecting business privacy or trade secrets. Arizona law requires good faith and fair dealing in contracts; this change could be viewed as overreaching.",

                "explanation": "This attempts to remove all potential remedies. Removing all remedies for breach of contract can make the contract unconscionable and unenforceable. Under Arizona law, a complete exclusion of all damages, including direct damages, might be challenged as violating public policy, especially if it leaves one party without recourse for the other party's serious misconduct or breach.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential conflict with Arizona law regarding unconscionability and enforceability of contracts; may violate public policy by denying all remedies for breach.",

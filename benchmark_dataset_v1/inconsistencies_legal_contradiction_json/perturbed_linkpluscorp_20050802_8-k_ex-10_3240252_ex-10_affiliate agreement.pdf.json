                "explanation": "Maryland law generally requires payments to subcontractors to be made promptly. While 'promptly' isn't explicitly defined in all contexts, 90 days significantly exceeds reasonable payment terms and can be considered an unreasonable delay, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing which exist in every Maryland contract. This extended delay could also create financial hardship and impede Axiometric's ability to meet its financial obligations.",

                "explanation": "By extending the period before a late payment constitutes a material breach from 60 to 90 days, the contract diminishes the protection afforded to the payee. This contradicts the general principle that the non-breaching party is entitled to seek remedies promptly when a material breach occurs and may conflict with the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code provisions that govern commercial transactions between merchants.",

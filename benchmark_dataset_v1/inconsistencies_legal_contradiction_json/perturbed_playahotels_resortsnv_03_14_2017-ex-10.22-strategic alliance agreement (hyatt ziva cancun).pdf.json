                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Receiving Party will have ten (10) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity.",
                "changed_text": "The Receiving Party will have two (2) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period to two business days places an unreasonable burden on the Receiving Party to conduct due diligence, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing which are recognized under Illinois law, the governing law of this agreement. Such a short timeframe does not allow for adequate evaluation of complex real estate development opportunities.",

                "original_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall to the extent possible be settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties within fifteen (15) days from the date of written notice by either Party of the existence of such dispute, and, failing such amicable settlement, shall be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“Rules”).",
                "changed_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall to the extent possible be settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties within five (5) days from the date of written notice by either Party of the existence of such dispute, and, failing such amicable settlement, shall be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“Rules”).",
                "explanation": "Reducing the amicable negotiation period to five days may be considered unreasonably short, hindering meaningful dispute resolution. Some jurisdictions require a more substantial timeframe for good-faith negotiation before arbitration, and this abbreviated period could be challenged as insufficient, especially for complex commercial disputes.",

                "changed_text": "Any required notice shall be effective five business days after it is sent by regular mail to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and a confirmation of mailing shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice.",
                "explanation": "Changing the delivery method to 'regular mail' and extending the effective date to five business days significantly increases the risk of delayed or lost notices. This contradicts standard commercial practices that prioritize reliable and trackable delivery methods. In legal contexts, timely notice is crucial, and this change creates an unreasonable burden on the sending party to prove actual receipt, and is not considered timely delivery under contract laws in most jurisdictions.",

                "original_text": "Bank of America shall pay Supplier for all services and applicable taxes invoiced In arrears in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of receipt of a valid and correct invoice by Bank of America. Bank of America reserves the right to pay prior to the expiration of the sixty (60) day period. If Bank of America pays within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice by Bank of America, a discount of two percent (2%) will be subtracted from the total invoice amount for Services.",
                "changed_text": "Bank of America shall pay Supplier for all services and applicable taxes invoiced In arrears in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, within ninety (90) calendar days of the date of receipt of a valid and correct invoice by Bank of America. Bank of America reserves the right to pay prior to the expiration of the ninety (90) day period. If Bank of America pays within seventy-five (75) calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice by Bank of America, a discount of two percent (2%) will be subtracted from the total invoice amount for Services.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment terms to 90 days while offering a discount for payments made within 75 days. Many states have prompt payment laws, especially concerning government contracts or specific industries (e.g., construction), that mandate payment within a shorter timeframe (e.g., 30 or 45 days). This modification extends the payment period beyond what is legally permissible in certain jurisdictions, creating non-compliance. Extending payment terms can cause cash flow problems for the supplier and potentially violate state prompt payment laws.",

                "original_text": "Supplier shall make reasonable efforts to respond within two (2) hours to Bank of America’s initial request for assistance in correcting or creating a workaround for an Error. Supplier’s response shall include assigning fully-qualified technicians to work with Bank of America to diagnose and correct or create a workaround for the Error and notifying the Bank of America Representative making the initial request for assistance of Supplier’s efforts, plans for resolution of the Error, and estimated time required to resolve the Error. Supplier shall correct Errors caused by the Object Code by modifying Source Code and distributing the modified Software to Bank of America on the schedule called for in this Section.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier shall make reasonable efforts to respond within twelve (12) hours to Bank of America’s initial request for assistance in correcting or creating a workaround for an Error. Supplier's response shall include assigning technicians to work with Bank of America to diagnose the Error. Supplier shall correct Errors caused by the Object Code by modifying Source Code and distributing the modified Software to Bank of America on the schedule called for in this Section.",
                "explanation": "This change increases the response time for error correction to 12 hours, removing the requirement for assigning 'fully-qualified' technicians and notifying the Bank of America representative of efforts and resolution plans. For critical infrastructure, depending on industry-specific regulations (e.g., in financial services), a 2-hour response time may be mandated by regulatory compliance frameworks to ensure minimal disruption and data security. By increasing the response time and weakening the requirements for initial support, it creates a contradiction with regulatory expectations for timely incident management and resolution in some contexts.",

Callers will be asked to identify themselves as Supplier. Such notification to Bank of America shall precede notifications to any other party.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier shall notify Bank of America within seventy-two (72) hours following discovery of any suspected breach or compromise of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of nonpublic personal information of any current or former Bank of America employee or customer (‘‘Affected Persons”) or otherwise provided to Supplier by Bank of America under this agreement through the defined security escalation channel of Bank of America, the Bank of America Incident Response Team (“InfoSafe”) by calling (800) 207-2322, option 1. Callers will be asked to identify themselves as Supplier.",
                "explanation": "This modification alters the notification timeframe for data breaches from 'immediately (within 24 hours)' to 'within 72 hours'. Many state data breach notification laws (and federal regulations for certain industries) mandate notification to affected parties (and/or regulators) within a shorter timeframe than 72 hours, upon discovery of a breach. By extending the notification window, the contract could violate these laws, subjecting the supplier to legal penalties and compliance failures.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the objection period to one week may violate laws requiring a reasonable timeframe for dispute resolution. While Germany law applies, generally accepted business practices often entail longer periods for reviewing invoices and raising objections.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts principles of good faith and fair dealing; may also conflict with standard commercial practices requiring reasonable dispute resolution periods.",

WHITHIN 14 DAYS OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF CHANGED PARTICIPATION TERMS,\nAFFILIATE AND SOFTWARE PUBLISHER MAY OBJECT TO SUCH CHANGES. IF NO\nOBJECTION IS RECEIVED DURING THIS TIME, THE PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED TO HAVE\nACCEPTED THE CHANGES AND THEY WILL BECOME PART OF THE EXISTING RELATIONS\nUNDER THE AGREEMENT.",

AFFILIATE AND SOFTWARE PUBLISHER MAY OBJECT TO SUCH CHANGES WITHIN 3 DAYS OF ANNOUNCEMENT. IF NO OBJECTION IS RECEIVED DURING THIS TIME, THE PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHANGES AND THEY WILL BECOME PART OF THE EXISTING RELATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the objection period for changes to participation terms to 3 days is unreasonable and could be considered a breach of contract. This timeframe is insufficient for a party to adequately review and assess the impact of the changes on their business. While the contract is under German Law, reducing this time frame to 3 days is unreasonable.",

                "changed_text": "(3) element 5 is authorized to retain final payment indefinitely to ensure that the correct amount is paid.",
                "explanation": "Changing the clause to allow indefinite retention of final payment contradicts legal principles requiring timely payment for services rendered. While the original clause allows for a reasonable delay, removing the minimum 30-day limit and making it indefinite is unreasonable and potentially illegal under German Law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates principles of prompt payment and potentially constitutes unjust enrichment under German law.",

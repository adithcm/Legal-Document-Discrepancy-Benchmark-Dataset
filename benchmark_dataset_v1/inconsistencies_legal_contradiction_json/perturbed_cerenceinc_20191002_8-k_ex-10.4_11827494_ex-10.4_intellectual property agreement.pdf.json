                "original_text": "Section 11.03. Governing LawÍ¾ Jurisdiction. Any disputes relating to, arising out of or resulting from this Agreement, including to its execution, performance, or enforcement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof. Each Party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction, forum and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court or the federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) over any and all claims, disputes, controversies or disagreements between the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns under or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including their execution, performance or enforcement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that it shall not assert, and shall hereby waive, any claim or right or defense that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, that the venue is improper, that the forum is inconvenient or any similar objection, claim or argument. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any legal proceeding resolved in accordance with this Section 11.03, Section 11.04, Section 11.05 and Section 11.06 shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.",
                "changed_text": "Section 11.03. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. Any disputes relating to, arising out of, or resulting from this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of a jurisdiction chosen at the sole discretion of Nuance. Each Party consents to the jurisdiction of the court selected by Nuance, waiving any objections to venue or inconvenience of the forum. Final judgments will be enforceable only within the jurisdiction of the chosen court and will not be automatically recognized or enforced in other jurisdictions.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction by allowing Nuance to unilaterally choose the governing law and jurisdiction, potentially selecting a jurisdiction with laws unfavorable to SpinCo. This contradicts the principle of mutual agreement and fairness in contract law, where both parties should have a say in the governing legal framework. This also implies the final judgements can only be enforced in one jurisdiction, which is not how it works under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution (if both parties are U.S. entities) or principles of international law regarding the recognition of judgements. This creates uncertainty and potential unenforceability of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates a legal contradiction by implementing a one-sided jury trial waiver. Contract law requires waivers to be knowing, voluntary, and mutual. Forcing only one party (SpinCo) to waive their right to a jury trial while allowing Nuance to retain it is likely unenforceable and contrary to the principles of fairness and equal protection under the law. This raises concerns about procedural fairness and equal bargaining power.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction by establishing unequal notice provisions. Generally, contract law requires that notice provisions be fair and reasonable. This revision favors Nuance by deeming notices effective upon dispatch, while requiring written acknowledgment from Nuance for notices to SpinCo to be considered valid. This imbalance creates a significant disadvantage for SpinCo, potentially leading to missed deadlines and other legal complications. This violates the standard of good faith and fair dealing in contractual relationships.",

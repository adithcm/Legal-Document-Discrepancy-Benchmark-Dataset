                "changed_text": "Excite@Home will remove advertising from Application Provider's listed competitors displayed on the Co-Branded Pages at its earliest convenience.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a deadline of \"three business days\" for removing competitor advertising. The modification replaces this with \"at its earliest convenience\", which is vague and unenforceable. California law requires businesses to avoid deceptive advertising and provide clear, prompt action to rectify any potential issues. Removing the specific deadline contradicts this requirement by creating uncertainty and potentially allowing for delays in addressing advertising for named competitors which could be considered deceptive.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a payment deadline of \"within ten (10) days\" of the agreement's effective date. The modified text removes this specific timeframe, indicating payments will be made “at the end of each calendar year”. California law requires prompt payment for services rendered. By significantly delaying the initial payment, the modification contradicts the legal requirement for timely compensation for the provision of user data, potentially violating state wage and payment laws.",

Application Provider shall use best efforts to provide\n          a fix, work around, or to patch Severity 1 bugs within twenty four\n          (24) hours after the bug is replicated by Application Provider and\n          confirmed as a bug by Application Provider.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates a two-hour response time and a 24-hour resolution timeframe for critical (Severity 1) maintenance issues. The modification replaces these specific deadlines with vague terms like \"when reasonably possible\" and \"when resources are available\". California Consumer Rights laws necessitate businesses provide timely remedies for malfunctions in services. By weakening the response and resolution commitments, the modified text introduces non-compliance with consumer law, allowing for potentially unreasonable delays in addressing critical system failures.",

                "explanation": "This change extends the deadline for the Employer to provide a written statement to the Insurer regarding the policy proceeds payable to the employee's beneficiary. While not explicitly illegal, such a long delay could be deemed unreasonable and contradict the implicit requirements of promptness and good faith in insurance claims processing, potentially violating Pennsylvania's Unfair Insurance Practices Act which prohibits unfair settlement practices and unnecessary delays. Pennsylvania law does not specify an exact time frame, but generally expects reasonable and timely processing.",

                "explanation": "This change reduces the time a claimant has to request a review of a denied claim from 60 days to 30 days. This contradicts the ERISA regulations (29 CFR § 2560.503-1) which state that the claimant should have at least 60 days to appeal the decision.",

The Named Fiduciary (or its designee) will render a decision upon review of a denied claim within 60 days after receipt of a request for review. If special circumstances warrant additional time, the decision will be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than 120 days after receipt of request for review. Written notice of any such extension will be furnished to the Claimant prior to the commencement of the Extension. The decision on review will be in writing and will include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant, as well as specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Plan on which the decision is based. If the decision on review is not furnished to the Claimant within the time limits prescribed above, the claim will be deemed denied on review.",

                "explanation": "This change extends the time frame for rendering a decision upon review of a denied claim, which is already at risk of being considered excessive given Pennsylvania's requirement for reasonable claims handling. While ERISA doesn't dictate exact maximums for all claim types, extending the review period significantly beyond what's generally considered prompt could lead to violations of ERISA's requirement for a reasonable claims procedure and could be deemed a violation of Pennsylvania's Unfair Insurance Practices Act, particularly if the extension isn't justified or properly communicated.",

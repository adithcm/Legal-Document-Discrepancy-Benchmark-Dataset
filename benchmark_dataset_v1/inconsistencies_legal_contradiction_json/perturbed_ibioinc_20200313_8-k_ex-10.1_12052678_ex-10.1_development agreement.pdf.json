                "original_text": "If either Party to this Agreement fails to perform or violates any material obligation of this Agreement, then, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the breaching Party specifying such failure or violation, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement without liability, unless: (a) the failure or violation specified in the default notice has been cured within the thirty (30) day notice period; or (b) the failure or violation reasonably requires more than thirty (30) days to correct, and the breaching Party has begun substantial corrective action to remedy the failure or violation within the thirty (30) day notice period and diligently pursues such action, in which event, termination shall not be effective unless sixty (60) days has expired from the date of the default notice without such corrective action being completed and the failure or violation remedied.",
                "changed_text": "If either Party to this Agreement fails to perform or violates any material obligation of this Agreement, then, upon ten (10) days written notice to the breaching Party specifying such failure or violation, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement without liability, unless: (a) the failure or violation specified in the default notice has been cured within the ten (10) day notice period; or (b) the failure or violation reasonably requires more than ten (10) days to correct, and the breaching Party has begun substantial corrective action to remedy the failure or violation within the ten (10) day notice period and diligently pursues such action, in which event, termination shall not be effective unless fifteen (15) days have expired from the date of the default notice without such corrective action being completed and the failure or violation remedied.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination due to breach of contract to 10 days could be problematic. While a specific law mandating a precise notice period isn't universally applicable, contract law generally requires a 'reasonable' notice period. 10 days may be deemed unreasonably short, particularly for complex breaches, thereby conflicting with general principles of fair contracting and potentially leading to legal challenges based on insufficient opportunity to cure.",

                "changed_text": "Each of the parties agrees that for one (1) year from the date of disclosure, the receiving Party agrees to limit disclosure of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to only the receiving party’s direct employees, and the receiving Party agrees to use minimal discretion to avoid disclosure, publication or dissemination outside of those employees as the receiving Party deems necessary.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year and limiting the scope of protection, weakens the protection of confidential information. This change introduces a legal contradiction because trade secret laws often provide protection for as long as the information remains a trade secret and is actively protected. Limiting the protection to one year and weakening the discretion required conflicts with the reasonable measures required to maintain trade secret status, potentially jeopardizing legal protection under state and federal trade secret laws.",

                "original_text": "The other Party must advise the Inventing Party in writing within 60 days of each disclosure to the other Party whether or not the other Party elects to negotiate a license agreement to obtain commercial rights to such Agreement Invention. In the event that the other Party elects to negotiate for a commercial license to an Agreement Invention, the Parties must initiate negotiation of a license agreement, with negotiations not to extend beyond ninety (90) days from notice of election without the consent of both Parties. The Parties will negotiate in good faith a license containing reasonable business terms common to the other party’s field of commercial interest and proposed application.",
                "changed_text": "The other Party must advise the Inventing Party in writing within 15 days of each disclosure to the other Party whether or not the other Party elects to negotiate a license agreement to obtain commercial rights to such Agreement Invention. In the event that the other Party elects to negotiate for a commercial license to an Agreement Invention, the Parties must initiate negotiation of a license agreement, with negotiations not to extend beyond thirty (30) days from notice of election without the consent of both Parties. The Parties have no obligation to negotiate in good faith for a license containing reasonable business terms.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame to 15 days and 30 days respectively puts undue pressure on the receiving party, which could be seen as a constraint to negotiate in good faith. Also, lack of negotiation in good faith would create a legal contradiction, as the 'good faith' standard may be deemed legally insufficient, particularly if it effectively prevents any meaningful negotiation and frustrates the purpose of the agreement regarding joint inventions.",

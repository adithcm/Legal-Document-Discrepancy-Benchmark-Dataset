                "explanation": "This change introduces non-compliance by removing the obligation to provide sub-distributor agreements. This could hinder compliance monitoring with anti-corruption laws like FCPA, as visibility into these agreements is crucial for ensuring compliance within the distribution chain. The original text ensures transparency which supports due diligence and helps prevent violations of applicable laws.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Party is subject to an unannounced audit from the MHLW or receives a notice of an imminent audit from the MHLW, in each case with respect to the Product in the Territory, such Party shall notify the other Party promptly, but in any event within [***]. Such other Party shall have the right to have its or its Affiliates’ or its subcontractors’ employees or consultants participate in any audits or other inspections to the extent permitted by Applicable Law. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the audited Party shall provide the other Party with the copies of any resulting document or",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts regulatory compliance standards. Notification of audits and providing resulting documents are essential for transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements. By removing these obligations, the contract obstructs the ability of both parties to ensure adherence to MHLW (Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare) regulations and other applicable laws. This hinders due diligence and increases the risk of non-compliance.",

Neither Party shall be required to destroy Confidential Information contained in any electronic back-up tapes or other electronic back-up files that have been created solely by its automatic or routine archiving and back-up procedures, to the extent created and retained in a manner consistent with its standard archiving and back-up.",
                "changed_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement, neither Party is obligated to return or destroy any Confidential Information of the other Party. Each Party may continue to use the Confidential Information for any purpose, notwithstanding the termination of the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a major contradiction to standard confidentiality practices and potentially violates trade secret laws. By allowing the continued use of Confidential Information post-termination, the contract fails to protect sensitive business data. The original text includes the term for confidentiality, but the modified text completely ignores this and allows both parties to utilize each others confidential information. This directly conflicts with legal protections afforded to confidential and proprietary information and is a departure from fair competition.",

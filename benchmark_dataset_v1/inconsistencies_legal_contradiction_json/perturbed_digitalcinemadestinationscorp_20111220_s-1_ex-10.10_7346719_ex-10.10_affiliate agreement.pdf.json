                "original_text": "On or before sixty (60) days after the end of each month during the Term, NCM shall pay to Network Affiliate $30.00 per digitized screen (i.e., a screen connected to the Digital Content Network), provided Network Affiliate provides the required attendance and screen count information as such information time frames are established by NCM on a monthly basis.",
                "changed_text": "On or before ninety (90) days after the end of each quarter during the Term, NCM shall pay to Network Affiliate $10.00 per digitized screen (i.e., a screen connected to the Digital Content Network), provided Network Affiliate provides the required attendance and screen count information as such information time frames are established by NCM on a quarterly basis.",
                "explanation": "This change alters the payment terms, making them less frequent and for a smaller amount. This is a legal contradiction if state laws mandate more frequent payments or set minimum payment standards for services rendered. For example, labor laws often specify payment deadlines; changing from monthly to quarterly and reducing the payment amount introduces non-compliance.",

During the Term and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, each Party, at its sole expense, shall, upon reasonable advance notice from the other party, make such books and records available at its offices for inspection and audit by the other party, its employees and agents.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall keep and maintain books and records of all matters relating to the performance of its obligations hereunder. During the Term and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, each Party, shall make such books and records available at its offices for inspection and audit by the other party, its employees and agents.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the audit period from three years to one year could violate statutes of limitations for breach of contract claims. In many jurisdictions, the statute of limitations for such claims is longer than one year. By limiting the audit period, the contract attempts to restrict the ability to discover breaches beyond the one-year window, creating a legal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "If either party wishes to extend the Initial Term it shall provide notice to the other not later than 180 days, nor sooner than 270 days, before the end of the Initial Term. The parties shall then engage in discussions regarding renewal for a period of 30 days. If no agreement is reached during that 30-day period, then neither party shall have any obligation to extend this Agreement beyond the Initial Term.",

The parties shall then engage in discussions regarding renewal for a period of 5 days. If no agreement is reached during that 5-day period, then neither party shall have any obligation to extend this Agreement beyond the Initial Term.",
                "explanation": "Decreasing the notification period for extending the initial term may conflict with state franchise laws. Some states require businesses to provide franchisees with significantly longer notice periods for renewal decisions. Reducing the notice to 30-45 days could violate these regulations, making the contractual term unenforceable.",

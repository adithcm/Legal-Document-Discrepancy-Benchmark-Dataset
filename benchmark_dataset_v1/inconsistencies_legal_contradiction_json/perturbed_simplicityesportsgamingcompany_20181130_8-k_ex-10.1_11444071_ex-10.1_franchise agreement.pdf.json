                "original_text": "8.2 Termination by Franchisor with Notice. Franchisor may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to Franchisee upon the occurrence of any of the following:\n(a) Franchisee fails to make any payment required under or in connection with this Agreement;\n(b) Franchisee ceases to operate or otherwise abandon the Smaaash Centres without the consent of Franchisor, or otherwise\nforfeit the right to do or transact business in the Territory;\n(c) Franchisee fails to use its best efforts to market and promote Smaaash Centres and the services and products offered by\nSmaaash Centres within the Territory and such failure is not cured within thirty (30) days of Franchisor’s notification to Franchisee of such failure.",

Franchisor may terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days written notice to Franchisee upon the occurrence of any of the following:\n(a) Franchisee fails to make any payment required under or in connection with this Agreement;\n(b) Franchisee ceases to operate or otherwise abandon the Smaaash Centres without the consent of Franchisor, or otherwise\nforfeit the right to do or transact business in the Territory;\n(c) Franchisee fails to use its best efforts to market and promote Smaaash Centres and the services and products offered by\nSmaaash Centres within the Territory and such failure is not cured within five (5) days of Franchisor’s notification to Franchisee of such failure.",
                "explanation": "The original text provided a 30-day notice period for termination. By reducing this to 10 days in the general termination clause and 5 days for failure to market/promote, it potentially contradicts the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach. Some jurisdictions might view 10 days as insufficient, especially considering the potential investments and ongoing obligations of the franchisee. Similarly, 5 days to cure marketing deficiencies is unreasonably short.",

During the Term, Franchisor shall have the right to conduct audits of Franchisee\nwith respect to the Smaaash Centres, and inspect the Smaaash Centres, after providing a written notice of 5 (five) days. Franchisee shall be under\nan obligation to provide any information as may be requested by Franchisor with respect to the Smaaash Centres, including the books of accounts\nand other relevant documents or records maintained in relation to the Smaaash Centres.",

During the Term, Franchisor shall have the right to conduct audits of Franchisee\nwith respect to the Smaaash Centres, and inspect the Smaaash Centres, after providing a verbal notice of 24 hours. Franchisee shall be under\nan obligation to provide any information as may be requested by Franchisor with respect to the Smaaash Centres, including the books of accounts\nand other relevant documents or records maintained in relation to the Smaaash Centres.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for audits to 24 hours verbal notice and changing from written to verbal notice may be deemed unreasonable and conflict with fair business practices. The franchisee might require more time to gather necessary documents and prepare for an audit. Some states may have laws protecting businesses from unreasonable or unduly burdensome audit requests. This also potentially conflicts with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "10.7 Force Majeure. The parties will not be liable to each other for any failure or delay in performance, other than failure to make\ntimely payments due under this Agreement, if it is because of earthquake, flood, fire, acts of God, civil unrest, terrorism, acts of any governmental\nauthority or any other reason beyond the reasonable control of either or both of the parties (“Force Majeure”). However, either party may terminate\nthis Agreement by and upon notice to the other if the other is unable to perform any of its material obligations for a period of thirty (30) days by\nreason of a Force Majeure.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 30-day waiting period before termination due to Force Majeure can be problematic. While Force Majeure events excuse performance, an immediate termination right could be viewed as unfair, especially if the disruption is likely to be temporary. This is against standard business practices and depending on the nature of the franchise and Territory, may go against legislation enacted to protect small business owners from arbitrary terminations. Such quick termination may also contradict the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

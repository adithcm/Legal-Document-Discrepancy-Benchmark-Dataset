                "original_text": "The Suppliers shall notify the Company of acceptance or rejection of a [***]within [***]hours of receipt of a [***]. Failure of the Suppliers to accept or reject a [***]within [***]hours shall constitute acceptance of such [***].",
                "changed_text": "The Suppliers shall notify the Company of acceptance or rejection of a [***]within 1 hour of receipt of a [***]. Failure of the Suppliers to accept or reject a [***]within 1 hour shall constitute acceptance of such [***].",
                "explanation": "This modification reduces the acceptance/rejection timeframe to 1 hour, which could be considered an unreasonably short timeframe for reviewing complex purchase orders, potentially violating general principles of contract law regarding reasonable opportunity for review and acceptance. This creates a scenario where acceptance could be implied without adequate time for due diligence.",

                "explanation": "This modification extends the payment timeframe to 90 days. Delayed payment terms without justification may violate prompt payment laws, depending on the jurisdiction and industry standards, potentially exposing the company to penalties and legal challenges for unreasonable payment delays. The original contract likely had a shorter timeframe.",

                "explanation": "This modification reduces the end-of-life notice period to 1 day. Such short notice could be deemed commercially unreasonable, particularly if the Company relies on the product and needs time to find an alternative supplier or adjust its production processes. This could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in contract law, potentially making the termination clause unenforceable or triggering claims for breach of contract if the abrupt termination causes significant harm.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Todos shall invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to the Reseller, and the Reseller shall pay such sums by no later than thirty (30) days from the date of shipment. All payments made to Todos shall be in New Israeli Shekels.",
                "changed_text": "Todos shall invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to the Reseller, and the Reseller shall pay such sums by no later than ninety (90) days from the date of shipment. All payments made to Todos shall be in New Israeli Shekels.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires payment within 30 days, which might not be compliant with standard prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions or industry standards which mandates specific deadlines for payments of invoices. Increasing the payment timeline to 90 days could create conflict with the Israeli Standard Contracts Law, which might define reasonable payment terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts Israeli Standard Contracts Law regarding reasonable payment terms.",

                "changed_text": "Within sixty (60) days of the end of each quarter, the Reseller shall provide Todos with a written report of (a) the quantities of Products distributed, sold, or otherwise transferred; the prices at which the Products were sold; and payments received therefore; and (b) the identity and location of all Customers to whom Products were sold, during the preceding quarter (each a “Quarterly Report”).",
                "explanation": "The original deadline for quarterly reports is 15 days. Extending it to 60 days introduces non-compliance risks with standard accounting or auditing requirements. This can be perceived as an unreasonable delay and a potential breach of duty to provide timely information, especially if Todos needs the data for regulatory reporting or financial planning. This also may affect the 'duty of good faith' to cooperate on the execution of contract.",

Upon completion of the Initial Term, provided that the Reseller has achieved the Annual Milestones, the term of the Agreement shall be automatically renewed for an additional five (5) years. Thereafter, at the end of each renewal term, the Agreement shall renew for an additional two (2) years unless one party provides the other party with prior written notice of non-renewal at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term.",

                "explanation": "The original non-renewal notice period is 60 days. Reducing it to 5 days is problematic and creates non-compliance. Such a short notice period is most likely be deemed unreasonable, particularly considering the investments and commercial relationships built. It risks violating principles of good faith and fair dealing, especially under Israeli law, which emphasize reasonableness and fairness in contractual relations. This is especially important when the subject matter concerns distribution and marketing rights.",

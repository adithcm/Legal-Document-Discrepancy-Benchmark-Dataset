Insurance: During the term of this Agreement, and before any sponsorship or promotional activities are conducted under this Agreement, Company shall obtain and maintain at its expense, Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage with an insurance carrier with a Best’s rating of A+. The insurance shall be in an amount of: $2,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate with a $2,000,000 aggregate for products and completed operations. The Association must be a named additional insured, and shall be provided at least 30 days’ notice for cancellation of policy and 10 days’ notice for non-payment of premium. Such insurance shall be primary and non-contributory.",

Insurance: During the term of this Agreement, and before any sponsorship or promotional activities are conducted under this Agreement, Company shall obtain and maintain at its expense, Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage. The insurance shall be in an amount of: $500,000 per occurrence and $500,000 aggregate.

This contradicts standard business practices and potentially puts the Association at risk due to inadequate coverage.  Some states have regulations or case law implying 'reasonable' notice, and 5 days for cancellation is unlikely to be deemed reasonable, particularly with significant sponsorship activities.",

Termination: Before expiration of the Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon: (i) any material breach of the Agreement by the other Party, if such breach is not remedied to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party within ten (10) business days after written notice; (ii) ten (10) business days written notice to the other Party whenever the notifying Party in its sole discretion determines that the continuation of the Agreement will damage its reputation or good will; or (iii) written notice in the event one Party (a) becomes or is declared insolvent or bankrupt or is subject to the appointment of a trustee or receiver or any equivalent thereof, (b) is the subject of any proceeding related to its liquidation or insolvency (whether voluntary or involuntary) which is not dismissed within ninety (90) days, (c) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (d) is subject to any sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to any entity; or (e) is subject to a change of control (whether by merger, stock transfer or otherwise), except in the case of an initial public offering.",

                "explanation": "The original text provided 10 business days to remedy a breach and 90 days for dismissal of liquidation proceedings. The modified text reduces these periods to 2 and 30 days respectively, which may be considered commercially unreasonable and could be challenged in court.

                "explanation": "The original clause allows for deemed delivery based on objective methods (personal delivery, fax, mail). The modified text requires *acknowledgment* of receipt. This is problematic because a party could intentionally refuse to acknowledge receipt, effectively preventing a valid notice and potentially voiding contractual obligations. This conflicts with the principle of good faith and fair dealing, as a party could manipulate the notice provision to their advantage. Some jurisdictions might find such a clause unconscionable.",

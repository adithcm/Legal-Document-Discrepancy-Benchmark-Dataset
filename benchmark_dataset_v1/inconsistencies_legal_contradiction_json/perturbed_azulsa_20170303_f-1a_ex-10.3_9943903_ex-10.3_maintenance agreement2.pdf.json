                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a five-year survival period for confidentiality obligations. Reducing this to one year may be unreasonably short under New York law (which governs this contract, as specified in section 5.1) and could be deemed insufficient to protect trade secrets and other confidential information, potentially conflicting with established legal precedents regarding reasonable confidentiality periods.",

Such committee shall be created by the Parties within [*****] from the date of receipt of the Notice of Dispute.\n\n\n5.2.1 Subject to sub-Clause 5.2.5 below and in the event the Representatives (i) fail to create such committee or (ii) do not agree on an amicable settlement within [*****] from the date the committee referred to in this sub-Clause 5.2 has been created or such longer period as may be agreed upon in writing by the Representatives (the “Amicable Settlement Period”), the Dispute shall be exclusively and finally settled under the Rules and Conciliation of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICC”) by an arbitral tribunal composed of three (3) arbitrators; each Party shall then appoint one (1) arbitrator within [*****]from the last day of the Amicable Settlement Period and the third arbitrator, who will act as President, will be appointed by the other two (2) arbitrators.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties may, at their sole discretion, attempt to settle the Dispute amicably. There is no required timeline for the creation of a committee or for attempting amicable resolution. \n\n\n5.2.1 Subject to sub-Clause 5.2.5 below and in the event the Parties do not agree on an amicable settlement within 10 days from the initial dispute notification, the Dispute shall be exclusively and finally settled under the Rules and Conciliation of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICC”) by an arbitral tribunal composed of three (3) arbitrators; each Party shall then appoint one (1) arbitrator within 5 days from the last day of attempting amicable settlement and the third arbitrator, who will act as President, will be appointed by the other two (2) arbitrators.",
                "explanation": "By removing the mandatory language ('shall make their reasonable endeavours') and replacing the placeholders with unreasonably short timeframes (10 days for settlement, 5 days for arbitrator appointment), the modified text introduces a contradiction. Specifically, the extremely short timeframes for dispute resolution and arbitrator appointment could be deemed procedurally unfair under New York law, especially considering the complexity of potential disputes arising from a global maintenance agreement, thus creating grounds for legal challenge.",

                "explanation": "While parties can agree to a governing law, selecting French law for a contract heavily involving a Brazilian company (AZUL) and with substantial performance likely occurring outside of France could be challenged, particularly if it negatively impacts one party's rights. This is because the agreement was crafted to be explicitly pursuant to New York General Obligations Law, which has specific rules about when and how New York law can be chosen. Switching to French law without a clear connection could be seen as an attempt to circumvent consumer protection or other regulations that might apply under New York law, giving grounds for a dispute about enforceability of certain contract clauses.",

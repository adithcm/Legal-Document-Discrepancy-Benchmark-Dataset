                "original_text": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) equal installments, each\ndue on or prior to the 1st of each month between June and November of the applicable Contract Year.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in one (1) lump sum payment, due on December 31st of the applicable Contract Year.",
                "explanation": "This modification changes the payment schedule to a single lump sum payment due at the end of the year. This could violate Florida Statute 215.422, regarding timely payments for goods and services, particularly if the Jaguars provide services related to the sponsorship throughout the year. The original agreement's staggered payments could be argued as compliance, while the new lump sum delays payment significantly and contradicts standard business practice.",

                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall pay the Playoff Payments at Club's sole discretion, depending on the Club's financial need and cash flow. Club's failure to deliver an invoice relieves the Sponsor from any payment obligation.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and potential violation of contract law. It allows the Club to determine when the payment is due based on internal needs, which makes the term of payment unclear. By stating failure to deliver invoice relieves any payment, it alters the fundamental payment obligation violating good faith and fair dealing principles. Contract Law requires clear payment terms and imposing conditions for payment based on the club's internal need creates uncertainty and is likely unenforceable. It contradicts the initial obligations of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts food safety regulations that require prompt notification of recalls to ensure public safety. By removing the sponsor's obligation to notify the Club and Concessionaire, it creates a risk of contaminated products being sold, potentially violating health codes and regulations enforced by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.",

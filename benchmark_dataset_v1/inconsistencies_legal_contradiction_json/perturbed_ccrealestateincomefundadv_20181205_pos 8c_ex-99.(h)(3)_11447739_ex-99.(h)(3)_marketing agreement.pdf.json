All material submitted to Distributor will be provided by Distributor to S2K with comments or approval no later than three business days after receipt in AdLit.",

                "explanation": "The original contract states that the distributor provides feedback within three business days of receipt of marketing material. This is changed to ten business days. FINRA Rule 2210(b)(4) requires prompt review and approval of advertising materials. Delaying the review process to ten business days may not meet FINRA's 'prompt' review requirement, especially for time-sensitive materials.",

                "explanation": "The original contract promises an expedited review within one business day, whereas this modification changes it to five business days. FINRA Rule 2210(b)(4) requires prompt review and approval of advertising materials. Altering the timeline for expedited review to five business days undermines the promptness requirement and potentially causes non-compliance, especially for materials requiring immediate approval for timely distribution.",

                "explanation": "The original contract allows for a 60-day notice period for termination. This has been changed to 10 days. While there is no specific statute directly mandating a 60-day notice, a shorter notice period may be deemed unreasonable, especially considering the complexities of unwinding marketing agreements and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements during the transition, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most contracts.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates the Billing Party to furnish an itemized statement of Net Revenue within 7 business days after each calendar quarter's end, subject to adjustment within 30 days. Modifying this to 45 and 90 days respectively introduces a contradiction. Many jurisdictions have laws requiring timely and prompt financial reporting. Extending these periods significantly may not meet the standard of promptness required by law, which seeks to protect parties' rights to receive information and payments promptly.",

                "changed_text": "The Non-Billing Party will always bear the costs of such audit.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement states the Billing Party bears the audit costs if a discrepancy exceeding $10,000 is found in favor of the Non-Billing Party. Changing this to always have the Non-Billing Party bear the costs could be seen as an unfair and unreasonable business practice. This is because it may deter the Non-Billing Party from exercising their audit rights, even if they suspect a substantial discrepancy. The change imposes an unreasonable financial burden, effectively nullifying the audit right.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that a party has 60 days to remedy a breach after written notice, before the other party can terminate. Reducing this period to 10 days introduces a potential conflict. Depending on the nature of the breach and the jurisdiction, 10 days may be considered an unreasonably short period to remedy a material breach. This is particularly true for complex issues or those requiring significant effort/investment to correct.",

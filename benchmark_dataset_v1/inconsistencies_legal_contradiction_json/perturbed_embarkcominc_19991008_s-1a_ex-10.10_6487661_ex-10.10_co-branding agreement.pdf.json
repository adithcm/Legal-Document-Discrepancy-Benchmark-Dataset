                "original_text": "Either party may terminate the Term upon not less\nthan sixty (60) days prior written notice to the other party of any breach\nhereof by such other party. In addition, either party may terminate the Term\nimmediately upon written notice in the event that the other party shall fail\nto do business in the normal course or become subject to any bankruptcy,\nassignment for creditors, corporate dissolution or similar proceeding.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for contract termination due to a breach to 15 days may contradict California law, which sometimes requires longer periods for reasonable notice, particularly if the breach is curable. 60 days is the more conservative period.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice and negotiation periods for the right of first refusal to 15 and 10 days respectively might be considered unreasonably short, especially in complex business relationships. Good faith negotiation typically requires a more substantial period to allow for due diligence and meaningful discussion. Such a short timeframe could be seen as a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under California law.",

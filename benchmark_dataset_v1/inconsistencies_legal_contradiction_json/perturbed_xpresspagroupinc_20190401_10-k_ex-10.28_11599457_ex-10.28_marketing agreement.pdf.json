                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Following the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive terms of six (6) months (each a “Renewal Term”, and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”) unless written notice is given by either Party no later than thirty (30) days in advance of the expiration of the Initial Term or the applicable Renewal Term.",
                "changed_text": "Following the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive terms of six (6) months (each a “Renewal Term”, and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”) unless written notice is given by either Party no later than five (5) days in advance of the expiration of the Initial Term or the applicable Renewal Term.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for non-renewal to five (5) days may be considered unconscionable and violate general contract law principles, especially in jurisdictions that require a reasonable notice period for automatic renewals, particularly if the agreement involves significant business operations. Many jurisdictions require a minimum of 30 days' notice to prevent automatic renewal.",

Upon receipt of such information, Calm shall have thirty (30) days (the “Calm Review Period”) to review the Calm Audit Results.",
                "changed_text": "After completion of any inspection or audit pursuant to this Section 8.02, XSPA shall notify Calm of the results of such inspection and audit (the “Calm Audit Results”). Upon receipt of such information, Calm shall have ten (10) days (the “Calm Review Period”) to review the Calm Audit Results.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the review period for audit results to ten (10) days may be considered insufficient time for a thorough review, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under contract law. Depending on the complexity of the audit, such a short period could be deemed unreasonable. This could lead to claims of duress or unequal bargaining power if one party is pressured to accept audit results without adequate time for evaluation.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame for the indemnified party to respond to a settlement offer to two (2) days is unreasonable and could violate principles of fairness and due process. It may not allow sufficient time to adequately assess the settlement offer, consult with legal counsel, and make an informed decision. Such a short deadline could be viewed as coercive, especially in complex legal matters, leading to claims of breach of contract or bad faith.",

                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement prior to expiration of the Term: (i) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice, or (ii) immediately upon written notice to the other party if: (a) the other party declares or a petition is filed in any court for insolvency or bankruptcy and such petition is not dismissed in thirty (30) days; (b) the other party reorganizes under the relevant bankruptcy act or any similar statute in such party’s jurisdiction of incorporation; (c) the other party consents to the appointment of a trustee in bankruptcy or a receiver or similar entity; or (d) the Developer breaches DSS’s Technology or Intellectual Property rights contained herein.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement prior to expiration of the Term: (i) upon ten (10) days prior written notice, or (ii) immediately upon written notice to the other party if: (a) the other party declares or a petition is filed in any court for insolvency or bankruptcy and such petition is not dismissed in fifteen (15) days; (b) the other party reorganizes under the relevant bankruptcy act or any similar statute in such party’s jurisdiction of incorporation; (c) the other party consents to the appointment of a trustee in bankruptcy or a receiver or similar entity; or (d) the Developer breaches DSS’s Technology or Intellectual Property rights contained herein.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the notice period for termination from 30 days to 10 days. Also, reduces the period to dismiss a petition from 30 to 15 days. While contract law generally allows parties to agree on termination terms, unreasonably short notice periods could be challenged, especially if they violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, depending on the specific jurisdiction (New York) and the nature of the agreement. A 10-day notice may be deemed insufficient in certain contexts.",

                "explanation": "The change reduces the confidentiality period post-agreement from five years to one year. While New York law respects contractual confidentiality terms, excessively short confidentiality periods, especially regarding trade secrets or sensitive intellectual property (as is the case here), might be deemed insufficient to protect a company's interests. This is especially a concern if the one-year period does not provide enough time to reverse engineer or independently develop the technology.",

                "explanation": "The changes to the notice provisions are designed to create potential conflicts with legal standards for adequate notice. Changing 'registered or certified mail, return receipt requested' to 'regular mail' makes it harder to prove the notice was actually received, which could violate legal requirements for 'reasonable notice' in certain situations. Delaying the effective date for regular mail to seven days is potentially problematic, since laws often require more expedited notice.",

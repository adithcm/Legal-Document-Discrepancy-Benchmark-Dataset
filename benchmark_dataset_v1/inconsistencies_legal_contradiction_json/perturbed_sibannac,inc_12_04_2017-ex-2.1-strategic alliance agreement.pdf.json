                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 90 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates payment NET 30 days after client payment. Changing this to NET 90 days could violate prompt payment laws or industry standards, potentially causing financial strain and legal issues, particularly in the context of smaller businesses that rely on timely payments.",

                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof, and will be automatically renewed for one (1) additional twelve month period unless either party shall notify the other in writing of its intention not to renew. Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term.",

Such notice must be given thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the original term.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the non-renewal notice period from 90 days to 30 days could be problematic. While contract law typically allows parties to agree to terms, a shorter notice period may be deemed unreasonable in certain contexts, especially if it significantly disadvantages one party's ability to prepare for the termination of the agreement and find alternative arrangements. This could be construed as a breach of good faith and fair dealing, particularly if one party has made significant investments based on the expectation of a longer contractual term.",

                "changed_text": "For a period of one (1) year after termination of this Agreement, the parties shall treat as confidential all information and take every reasonable precaution and use all reasonable efforts to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of the same.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period from five years to one year can be problematic because, depending on the type of confidential information exchanged, a one-year period might be deemed insufficient to protect trade secrets or sensitive business data. Some states, under trade secret laws, provide longer protection periods. This could directly conflict with laws designed to protect proprietary information. Furthermore, shortening the period may contradict the reasonable expectations of the parties involved, especially if substantial proprietary data was disclosed.",

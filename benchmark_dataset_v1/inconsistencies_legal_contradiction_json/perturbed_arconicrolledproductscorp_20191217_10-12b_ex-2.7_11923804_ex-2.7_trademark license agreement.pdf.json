                "original_text": "In the event that Licensee has not taken appropriate steps to restore such quality within one-hundred twenty (120) days after notification by Licensor, Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that Licensee has not taken appropriate steps to restore such quality within fifteen (15) days after notification by Licensor, Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for quality defects to 15 days may be deemed unreasonably short, particularly given the complexities of manufacturing processes. This could potentially violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in the performance of their contractual obligations. While Delaware law (governing law per Section 6.1) provides latitude in contract interpretation, courts often look to industry standards and the parties' reasonable expectations. A 15-day cure period might be challenged as insufficient for complex quality issues, leading to potential breach of contract claims.",

                "changed_text": "Licensor and Licensee will be entitled to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the event the other party is in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder and shall fail to remedy any such default within thirty (30) days after notice thereof by the non-breaching party.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 30 days may be considered unreasonably short depending on the nature of the breach and industry standards. Delaware courts, while generally upholding contractual terms, may scrutinize cure periods that are deemed manifestly unfair or do not allow a reasonable opportunity to remedy the breach. This change could create an imbalance in the agreement and potentially violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement may not be assigned by Licensee without the consent of Licensor which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such consent of Licensor is required under this Agreement in the event of a Change of Control of Licensee so long as: (a) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person assumes all the obligations of the Licensee by operation of Law or pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the LicensorÍ¾ and (b) the licenses granted herein shall not be transferrable or sublicensable to Affiliates of such Person unless such Affiliates were Affiliates of Licensee prior to such Change of Control.",

                "explanation": "A complete prohibition of assignment by the Licensee while granting the Licensor unfettered assignment rights creates a highly unbalanced agreement. While Delaware law generally respects freedom of contract, such a provision might be challenged as unconscionable or violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, particularly if it deprives the Licensee of a significant benefit of the bargain. Such restrictions on assignment could also run afoul of certain regulations depending on the specific industry and nature of the licensed products. For example, antitrust concerns could arise if the restriction stifles competition.",

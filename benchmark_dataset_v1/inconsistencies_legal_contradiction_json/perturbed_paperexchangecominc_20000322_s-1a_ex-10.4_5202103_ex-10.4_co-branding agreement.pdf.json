                "original_text": "A Notice sent via facsimile is deemed effective on the same day (or if such day is not a business day, then on the next succeeding business day) if such facsimile is sent before 3:00 p.m. Philadelphia time and on the next day (or if such day is not a business day, then on the next succeeding business day) if such Notice is sent after 3:00 p.m. Philadelphia time.",
                "changed_text": "A Notice sent via facsimile is deemed effective immediately upon sending, regardless of the time or day.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a timeframe for when a notice via fax is considered effective. The modified version states that a notice is effective immediately upon sending, regardless of the time or day. This could conflict with legal requirements for providing adequate notice in legal contexts, as immediate effectiveness may not allow sufficient time for the recipient to act on the notice. This may lead to breaching the contract due to not adhering to the regulations for fair notice.",

If VerticalNet subsequently modifies any VerticalNet Link or the URL associated with such VerticalNet Link, it shall furnish a representation of same to PaperExchange, which PaperExchange shall substitute for the prior version within two days after receipt thereof.",
                "changed_text": "VerticalNet shall furnish PaperExchange with a black and white representation of each VerticalNet Link one day prior to its scheduled placement on a page of the PaperExchange Site. If VerticalNet subsequently modifies any VerticalNet Link or the URL associated with such VerticalNet Link, it shall furnish a representation of same to PaperExchange, which PaperExchange shall substitute for the prior version within one day after receipt thereof.",
                "explanation": "This modification reduces the notice period for providing link representations from two days to one day and removes the 'full color' requirement. While seemingly minor, this could be problematic if PaperExchange requires more time to review the links for compliance with brand guidelines or legal regulations. This could lead to hurried and inadequate reviews, increasing the risk of using non-compliant links. Additionally, demanding a black and white representation can go against the company's brand guidelines, thus failing the 'good faith' requirement, because the proper measures for quality representation of the brands aren't being taken.",

                "original_text": "During the 18-month period following the payment by one party of any amount due under this Agreement to the other party, the party receiving payment (the \"Auditing Party\") shall have the right to have an independent third party (the \"Auditor\") audit the financial records of the other party (the \"Audited Party\") relating to such payment to verify the accuracy of the Audited Party's financial records in order to verify the amount of the payments owed and/or paid.",
                "changed_text": "During the 6-month period following the payment by one party of any amount due under this Agreement to the other party, the party receiving payment (the \"Auditing Party\") shall have the right to have an independent third party (the \"Auditor\") audit the financial records of the other party (the \"Audited Party\") relating to such payment to verify the accuracy of the Audited Party's financial records in order to verify the amount of the payments owed and/or paid.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows for an 18-month window for auditing financial records. The changed clause reduces this period to 6 months. While not explicitly illegal, shortening the audit window could be considered unreasonable and could hinder the Auditing Party's ability to thoroughly review the financial records. Depending on the complexity and volume of transactions, 6 months may not be sufficient time, potentially creating a dispute about the adequacy of the audit opportunity. Also, by severely restricting the amount of time someone can perform an audit, there may be some local or state laws that prohibit this action.",

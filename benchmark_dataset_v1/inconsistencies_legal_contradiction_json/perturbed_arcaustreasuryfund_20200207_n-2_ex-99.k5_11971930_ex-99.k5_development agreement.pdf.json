This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without\nthe payment of any penalty, upon 60 days' written notice, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or by the vote\nof the Fund's Trustees or by the Blockchain Administrator. The provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and\nthe Blockchain Administrator shall remain entitled to the benefits thereof, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement. Further,\nnotwithstanding the termination or expiration of this Agreement as aforesaid, the Blockchain Administrator shall be entitled to any amounts owed\nunder Section 4 through the date of termination or expiration, and Section 5 shall continue in force and effect and apply to the Blockchain\nAdministrator and its representatives as and to the extent applicable.",
                "changed_text": "(a) This Agreement shall become effective as of the first date above written. This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without\nthe payment of any penalty, upon 10 days' written notice, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or by the vote\nof the Fund's Trustees or by the Blockchain Administrator. The provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and\nthe Blockchain Administrator shall remain entitled to the benefits thereof, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement.

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 10 days may conflict with the Investment Company Act of 1940, which requires reasonable notice periods to protect the interests of fund shareholders. While the Act doesn't explicitly state a minimum notice period, 10 days could be deemed unreasonable, especially considering the complexities involved in winding down blockchain administration services and potentially finding a replacement administrator. This short notice period could harm the Fund's shareholders.",

In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the Investment Company Act, the Blockchain Administrator\nagrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund shall at all times remain the property of the Fund, shall be readily accessible during normal\nbusiness hours, and shall be promptly surrendered upon the termination of the Agreement or otherwise on written request. The Blockchain\nAdministrator further agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the Investment Company Act will be\npreserved for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the Investment Company Act unless any such records are earlier surrendered as provided\nabove. Records shall be surrendered in usable machine-readable form. The Blockchain Administrator shall have the right to retain copies of such\nrecords subject to observance of its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.",

In compliance with the requirements of its internal policies, the Blockchain Administrator\nagrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund shall at all times be accessible only with a two-week notice, and will be surrendered within 90 days upon the termination of the Agreement or otherwise on written request. The Blockchain\nAdministrator further agrees that records which it maintains for the Fund will be\npreserved for a period of 1 year. Records shall be surrendered in a non-machine-readable form. The Blockchain Administrator shall have the right to retain copies of such\nrecords subject to observance of its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing the record-keeping standards to align with the Blockchain Administrator's \"internal policies\" instead of the Investment Company Act directly contradicts regulatory requirements. Increasing the surrender time to 90 days, requiring two-week notice for accessibility, limiting preservation to 1 year and providing records in non-machine-readable format are all violations of SEC Rule 31a-2 which mandates specific retention periods and accessibility standards and formats for fund records.",

                "explanation": "Changing the fee accrual and payment terms to 'accrued annually and paid at the discretion of the Blockchain Administrator' creates a conflict with standard accounting practices and could potentially violate the Investment Company Act's requirements for fair and transparent fee arrangements. The original contract allows monthly payment, but making the payment at Blockchain administrator's discretion is conflict of interest and may not be allowed.",

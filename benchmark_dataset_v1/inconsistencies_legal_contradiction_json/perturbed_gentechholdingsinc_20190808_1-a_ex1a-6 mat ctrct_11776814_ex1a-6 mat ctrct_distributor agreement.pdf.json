                "original_text": "Company shall have Seven (7) business days after its receipt to accept (or reject for a legitimate business reason) any order submitted by Distributor. All the negotiations between Company and Distributor will be by INCOTERMS Ex-works, in origin farm, in Brazil. So will must be respected the Transite Time to destiny delivery. Should Company fail to timely accept or reject an order from Distributor in accordance with this Section, such order shall be deemed accepted and shall become binding on Company. All orders shall be fulfilled by Company within Seven (7) business days of order acceptance.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall have One (1) business days after its receipt to accept (or reject for a legitimate business reason) any order submitted by Distributor. All the negotiations between Company and Distributor will be by INCOTERMS Ex-works, in origin farm, in Brazil. So will must be respected the Transite Time to destiny delivery. Should Company fail to timely accept or reject an order from Distributor in accordance with this Section, such order shall be deemed accepted and shall become binding on Company. All orders shall be fulfilled by Company within Fifteen (15) business days of order acceptance.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the order acceptance timeframe to one business day and the fulfillment time to fifteen business days. For the order acceptance time, this could be problematic if the distributor requires reasonable time to assess the order and prepare logistics, a 1-day acceptance window may be deemed unreasonably short and could violate good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts. For the order fulfillment, the modification changes the fulfillment time to 15 days, it might not comply with general standards, potentially harming the Distributor.",

                "changed_text": "Within Two (2) days of receipt of such Products, Distributor will notify Company of any shortages, defects, non-conformance, and Company will replace such Products in Thirty (30) days.",
                "explanation": "The original contract provides a 7-day window for the distributor to notify the company of any product issues (shortages, defects, etc.). The modified contract shortens this notification window to just 2 days, which may be insufficient for a thorough inspection, especially for large or complex orders. This creates an unreasonable burden on the distributor. Additionally, the company will replace the products in Thirty (30) days, which is non-compliance with regulatory standards.",

                "explanation": "Changing the survival period of confidentiality obligations from three years to one year weakens the protection of proprietary information. Depending on the industry and the nature of the confidential information, a one-year period may be deemed insufficient to protect trade secrets and other sensitive data, potentially conflicting with reasonable standards for trade secret protection and potentially harming the Disclosing Party.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites within 72 hours after it becomes aware of such offending Content regardless of any timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority.",
                "explanation": "This modification mandates a 72-hour removal deadline, which contradicts the possibility of the Governmental Authority prescribing a longer timeframe. This imposes a stricter, potentially unachievable requirement that conflicts with possible regulatory standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates administrative regulations in the PRC that allow for longer remediation periods based on the nature and severity of the offending content.",

                "changed_text": "If any Party pays any taxes that should have been borne by the other Party in accordance with Law, reimbursement is not required.",
                "explanation": "According to the laws of the People's Republic of China, tax obligations typically require reimbursement when one party inadvertently covers the tax liabilities of another. Modifying this provision to state that reimbursement is not required directly opposes these financial responsibility laws.",

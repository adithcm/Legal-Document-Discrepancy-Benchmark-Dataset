                "original_text": "If Heritage notifies Premier that it can fulfill Premier’s Forecast for this [***] period, or if it fails to notify Premier that it cannot fulfill that portion of the Forecast, Heritage shall be obligated to fulfill, or cause Jasper to fulfill as applicable, if ordered through POs, the full amount of Product set forth for purchase during [***] (“Firm Forecast”).",
                "changed_text": "If Heritage notifies Premier that it can fulfill Premier’s Forecast for this [***] period, or if it fails to notify Premier that it cannot fulfill that portion of the Forecast, Heritage shall be obligated to fulfill, or cause Jasper to fulfill as applicable, if ordered through POs, the full amount of Product set forth for purchase during the next 14 calendar days (“Firm Forecast”).",
                "explanation": "This change modifies the 'Firm Forecast' commitment period from an unspecified '[***]' to '14 calendar days'. This could contradict California law if the nature of the 'Forecast' and 'Firm Forecast' commitments are interpreted as creating an implied contract for a longer or more definite period that is then unilaterally shortened, violating principles of good faith and fair dealing implicit in contractual relationships. For example, a longer 'Forecast' with a significantly shorter 'Firm Forecast' commitment undermines the purpose and expected duration of the 'Forecast'.",
                "contradicted_law": "California contract law regarding implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, potentially impacting enforceability due to unconscionability if the shortened period significantly disadvantages Premier.",

Heritage agrees to disclose to Premier and provide a list, upon request, of any material violations or deficiencies noted during any inspection by the FDA, United States Department of Agriculture, PHS, or any other federal, state or local health or food regulatory agency of the Heritage Facilities, Jasper Facility or any other Facility used to produce the Products, which have a material adverse effect on the manufacture or packaging of the Products. Heritage agrees to provide to Premier each FDA Form 483 and any related Establishment Inspection Report (“EIR”) that is received from the FDA by Heritage or Jasper, along with any response provided to the regulatory authority by Heritage or Jasper, as long as this Agreement is in effect. Heritage agrees to do so within [***] of Heritage or Jasper receiving the Report or of sending the response as appropriate.",

Heritage agrees to do so within 60 days of Heritage or Jasper receiving the Report or of sending the response as appropriate.",
                "explanation": "While 60 days may seem reasonable, it contradicts the requirement for *prompt* disclosure of FDA Form 483 findings. Delays in providing these reports can hinder Premier's ability to take timely corrective actions, potentially leading to regulatory non-compliance and increased risks. FDA regulations and guidance emphasize the importance of addressing inspectional observations promptly. Waiting 60 days is not considered prompt under most interpretations of FDA regulations, especially when issues impacting product safety are involved.",

                "explanation": "This modification shortens the initial cure period for a material breach from an unspecified '[***]' to 10 days. Depending on the nature of the breach, 10 days might be insufficient, particularly for complex issues such as manufacturing defects or supply chain disruptions. California law requires cure periods to be reasonable, and what's reasonable depends on the specific circumstances.",

                "changed_text": "ABW agrees to pay said charges within fifteen (15) days of\nthe monthly invoice date.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the payment timeframe from 30 days to 15 days. While not inherently illegal, it could be considered an unreasonably short payment period that may violate fair business practices and potentially conflict with state laws regarding reasonable payment terms, particularly for smaller businesses or if the contract does not clearly define the consequences of late payment or provide for dispute resolution. Illinois law generally requires commercially reasonable terms and could scrutinize such a short timeframe.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under Illinois contract law and could conflict with state-specific prompt payment laws if ABW were considered a small business.",

                "changed_text": "Any payments which have not been received by PCQ within ten (10)\ndays of the Invoice date shall be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE of 5.0% per month\nwhich is a corresponding ANNUAL\nPERCENTAGE RATE of 60% on the outstanding balance.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly increases the finance charge and shortens the grace period for late payments. An APR of 60% is usurious under Illinois law, which sets limits on interest rates for many types of transactions. Furthermore, a 10-day grace period before applying such a high penalty could be deemed unconscionable, particularly if the contract involves a smaller business or individual.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates Illinois usury laws and potentially unconscionable under contract law. Illinois law sets limits on interest rates and finance charges.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the dispute period to 5 days is unreasonable, especially given the complexity of potential billing errors and the need for internal review. Such a short timeframe could be deemed unconscionable and violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, preventing ABW from reasonably disputing incorrect invoices. This contradicts established Illinois contract law principles.",

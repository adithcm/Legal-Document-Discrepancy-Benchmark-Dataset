                "original_text": "All public liability and property damage policies shall contain a provision that El Pollo Loco, although named as an insured, shall nevertheless be entitled to recover under such policies on any loss incurred by El Pollo Loco, its affiliates, agents and/or employees, by reason of the negligence of Developer, its principals, contractors, agents and/or employees. All policies shall provide Franchisor with at least thirty (30) days’ notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.",
                "changed_text": "All public liability and property damage policies shall contain a provision that El Pollo Loco, although named as an insured, shall nevertheless be entitled to recover under such policies on any loss incurred by El Pollo Loco, its affiliates, agents and/or employees, regardless of the negligence of Developer, its principals, contractors, agents and/or employees. All policies shall provide Franchisor with at least ten (10) days’ notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.",
                "explanation": "The modification mandates that El Pollo Loco can recover losses even without negligence on the part of the Developer which contradicts standard insurance principles where negligence or fault is a key factor. Also, reducing the notice period for cancellation or termination of coverage to ten (10) days contradicts the common insurance practice and legal requirements in many states for a minimum of 30 days' notice.",
                "contradicted_law": "General insurance law principles regarding negligence; State insurance regulations on cancellation notice periods.",

                "original_text": "For the purpose of this Agreement, all notices shall be in writing and shall be sent to the party to be charged with receipt thereof either (i) served personally, or (i) sent by certified or registered United States mail, or (ii) sent by reputable overnight delivery service, or (iv) sent by facsimile. Notices served personally are effective immediately on delivery, and those served by mail shall be deemed given forty-eight (48) hours after deposit of such notice in a United States post office with postage prepaid and duly addressed to the party to whom such notice or communication is directed. Notices served by overnight delivery shall be deemed to have been given the day after deposit of such notice with such service. Notices served via facsimile shall be deemed to have been given the day of faxing such notice. All notices to El Pollo Loco® shall be addressed as follows:\nEl Pollo Loco, Inc.\nAttn: Legal Department\n3535 Harbor Blvd, Suite 100\nCosta Mesa, CA 92626\n(714) 599-5503 (fax)",
                "changed_text": "For the purpose of this Agreement, all notices shall be in writing and shall be sent to the party to be charged with receipt thereof via email only. Notices served via email shall be deemed to have been given ten (10) days after sending such notice. All notices to El Pollo Loco® shall be addressed as follows:\nEl Pollo Loco, Inc.\nAttn: Legal Department\nlegal@elpolloloco.com",
                "explanation": "The modification restricts acceptable forms of notice to email only, which may not comply with legal requirements for certain types of notices, especially those that require proof of receipt or are time-sensitive. Furthermore, a ten (10) day deemed delivery period for email is unreasonable and conflicts with the expectation of near-instantaneous delivery, potentially jeopardizing time-sensitive contractual rights and violating laws that specify timely notice.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the disclosure period to two (2) days directly violates the FTC Franchise Rule and state franchise laws (like California Franchise Investment Law) that mandate a minimum 14-day review period to allow franchisees adequate time to consider the investment opportunity. This change makes the agreement non-compliant and potentially unenforceable.",

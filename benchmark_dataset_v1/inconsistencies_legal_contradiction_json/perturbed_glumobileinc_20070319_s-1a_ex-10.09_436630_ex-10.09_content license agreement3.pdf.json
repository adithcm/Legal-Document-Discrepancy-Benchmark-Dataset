                "original_text": "Royalty: In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox, or such other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n(a) From the first unit sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee’s Gross Receipts\n(as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee’s sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "changed_text": "Royalty: In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox, or such other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n(a) Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee’s Gross Receipts (as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee’s sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products, payable at Fox's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment terms to 'payable at Fox's discretion' violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most US jurisdictions (including states where Fox Mobile Entertainment, Inc. might operate), which requires parties to act honestly and not frustrate the other party's right to receive the benefits of the contract. Setting payment at the discretion of one party introduces uncertainty and contradicts the purpose of the royalty clause.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee shall not be entitled to receive a share of any revenues and shall have no claim to any revenues earned and collected by Fox, or a third-party Fox designates, for the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products, even if those revenues are collected illegally or unethically.",
                "explanation": "Adding the phrase 'even if those revenues are collected illegally or unethically' attempts to shield Fox from liability for illegal revenue collection related to the Wireless Products. This clause is against public policy and unenforceable because it attempts to contract away liability for illegal activities. Contracts cannot indemnify parties against their own illegal or fraudulent behavior. Moreover, such language could potentially violate consumer protection laws if Fox were to engage in deceptive or illegal revenue practices.",

                "explanation": "Altering the clause to limit the agreement to only one year, regardless of original terms, creates a contradiction if the original agreement had a longer duration. This modification unilaterally changes a fundamental term of the contract (its duration) without proper consideration or negotiation, potentially rendering it unenforceable or subject to legal challenge based on breach of contract.",

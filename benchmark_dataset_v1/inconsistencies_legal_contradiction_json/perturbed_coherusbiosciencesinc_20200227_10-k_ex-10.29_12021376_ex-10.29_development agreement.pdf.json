Within [***] ([***]) [***] following the Effective Date, Bioeq shall\nmake available to Licensee the complete draft of the Biologics License Application that Bioeq has prepared and intends to file for the\nfirst Licensed Product with the FDA. Licensee shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to review such draft without delay and to\nnotify Bioeq in writing of any concerns it may identify in relation to such draft within [***] ([***]) days of such draft being made\navailable to Licensee by Bioeq. Subsequently, Licensee may notify Bioeq in writing of any concerns that it identifies in relation to such\ndraft promptly after such identification. For clarity, nothing in this Section 4.1.1 shall restrict Bioeq’s right to file the first Biologics\nLicense Application for a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory at its sole discretion.",

                "explanation": "The modification shortens the review period for the Biologics License Application (BLA) draft to 24 hours. This timeframe is likely insufficient for a thorough review of a complex document, potentially hindering Licensee's ability to provide meaningful feedback. This could be seen as an unreasonable constraint, conflicting with the principle of good faith and fair dealing, implying a legal contradiction as it undermines the collaborative intent typically expected in such agreements. Also, 24 hours is an unreasonably short time frame.",

Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, the\nReceiving Party shall cease all use of and return to the Disclosing Party, or destroy, as the Disclosing Party shall specify in writing\npromptly upon such expiration or termination, all materials transferred pursuant to Section 11.4 and all copies of all documents and\nother materials that contain or embody any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, except to the extent that the Receiving\nParty is required by Applicable Laws to retain such documents, and provided further that each Party may keep copies of all\nConfidential Information within its ordinary legal archives (including IT back-up systems).

Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, the\nReceiving Party shall make reasonable efforts to cease all use of and return to the Disclosing Party only the physical copies of the document. The Receiving Party is not required to destroy, all materials transferred pursuant to Section 11.4 and all copies of all documents and\nother materials that contain or embody any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. There is no specific time frame to fulfill this process. The Receiving Party is not required to furnish the Disclosing Party with a certificate.",
                "explanation": "By removing the obligation to destroy copies of confidential information and omitting a specific timeframe for returning materials, the modified text weakens confidentiality protections. Removing the requirement for certification of compliance further reduces accountability. These changes are not in line with standard practices for protecting trade secrets and confidential information, potentially contradicting legal expectations for reasonable measures to safeguard proprietary data. Also, removing the time frame to fulfill is an issue.",

If there is a dispute between the Parties as to whether a material\nbreach has occurred or whether such breach was curable or has been cured by the other Party within the above cure period, notice\nof termination may only be given after the terminating Party has escalated the issue to the relevant senior executives pursuant to\nSection 16.3.1 and the senior executives have not been able to solve such dispute within thirty (30) days of such escalation.",

                "explanation": "Removing the cure period for a material breach and stating that the terminating party's decision is final and binding creates an imbalance of power and deprives the breaching party of due process. This is very bad faith in breach of contract",

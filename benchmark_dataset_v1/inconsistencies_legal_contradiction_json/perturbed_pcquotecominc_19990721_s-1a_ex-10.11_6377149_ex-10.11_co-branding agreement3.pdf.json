Watley, Inc., with its principal place of business at\n33 West 17th Street, New York, New York 10011 (\"ABW\").",
                "changed_text": "THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO CO-BRANDING AGREEMENT (this \"Amendment\") is\nmade and entered into, effective for all purposes and in all respects as of\nthe 23rd day of February, 1998, by and between PC QUOTE, INC., with its\nprincipal place of business at 300 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois\n60605 (\"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc., with its principal place of business at\n33 West 17th Street, New York, New York 10011 (\"ABW\"). Any dispute regarding this contract must be filed within 30 days from the date of incident.",
                "explanation": "By limiting the dispute filing timeframe to 30 days, the amendment potentially contradicts statutes of limitations which typically provide longer periods for filing claims, especially in Illinois and New York where the principal businesses are located. For example, breach of contract claims in Illinois typically have a statute of limitations of 10 years for written contracts, and in New York, it is six years.",

                "explanation": "This amendment introduces a clause that makes the entire agreement void if any single clause is found to be unenforceable. This contradicts the principle of severability, which is often upheld in contract law to preserve as much of the agreement as possible. Most jurisdictions would seek to sever the unenforceable clause and uphold the rest of the contract, unless the unenforceable clause is fundamental to the entire agreement. This may also contradict state laws regarding severability.",

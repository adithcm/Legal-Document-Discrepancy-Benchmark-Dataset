                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "b. Either party may terminate this Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party, provided the breaching party is first given reasonably detailed, written notice of the breach. If the breach is not cured within ten days of such notice, the Agreement will terminate immediately.",
                "changed_text": "b. Either party may terminate this Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party, provided the breaching party is first given reasonably detailed, written notice of the breach. If the breach is not cured within three days of such notice, the Agreement will terminate immediately.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a ten-day cure period for a material breach. Reducing this to three days is problematic because many jurisdictions mandate a reasonable cure period, which is often longer than three days depending on the nature of the breach. This could be seen as an unreasonable and unlawful restriction, especially if state law requires a longer cure period for certain breaches of contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law Principles - Reasonableness of Cure Period; potentially violates state-specific contract laws regarding cure periods.",

                "original_text": "b. Erchonia shall submit invoices to Distributor after or concurrent with shipment of Products to Distributor at the delivery address. Distributor shall pay half (1/2) of the purchase price prior to shipment and the remaining balance 30 days after shipment of the Products. Payments received after the 30 day calendar period will be subject to a late fee of 1.5% of the invoice amount. All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "changed_text": "b. Erchonia shall submit invoices to Distributor after or concurrent with shipment of Products to Distributor at the delivery address. Distributor shall pay the full purchase price prior to shipment of the Products. Payments received after shipment of products will be subject to a late fee of 5% of the invoice amount. All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment terms to require full payment prior to shipment introduces potential legal issues related to unfair or unconscionable contract terms, especially in business-to-business transactions. Additionally, imposing a 5% late fee without regard to state usury laws could be considered an illegal penalty if it exceeds the maximum allowable interest rate for late payments under Florida law.",
                "contradicted_law": "State Usury Laws (Florida); potentially violates contract law principles of fairness and good faith.",

                "changed_text": "Note: Performance goals to begin 30 days after receipt of FDA market clearance.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the period before performance goals begin from 120 days to 30 days after FDA market clearance can be problematic. This reduction could potentially be deemed unreasonable, especially considering the time needed for market adaptation, sales force training, and logistical adjustments following regulatory approval. Depending on the specifics of the medical device market and reasonable industry standards, this shorter period may be considered an unfair or unrealistic expectation imposed on the distributor, potentially leading to disputes and claims of breach of contract. This could potentially violate principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Constellation shall be invoiced by the HOF Entities for any such materials at the retail cost charged to the HOF Entities (or either of them) by the supplier, without mark-up. Payment with respect to such invoice will be due thirty (30) days following receipt by Constellation of such invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Constellation shall be invoiced by the HOF Entities for any such materials at the retail cost charged to the HOF Entities (or either of them) by the supplier, without mark-up. Payment with respect to such invoice will be due sixty (60) days following receipt by Constellation of such invoice.",
                "explanation": "Extended payment terms to 60 days could violate prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions (including federal laws for certain types of contracts), especially if the original agreement implies shorter, standard payment periods. Ohio law generally requires payments to be made promptly, and while 30 days is often considered standard, extending it to 60 without clear justification might be viewed as an unreasonable delay, potentially conflicting with good faith and fair dealing requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Ohio contract law, and potential conflict with federal prompt payment regulations if applicable.",

                "changed_text": "If either Party is in default under this Section 4.2(a) beyond the applicable grace or cure periods, then the other Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement and to seek such other remedies as are described in Section 4.2(d). However, the non-defaulting party must provide written notice of termination within 10 days of the end of the cure period or the right to terminate is waived.",
                "explanation": "Adding a strict 10-day deadline to issue a termination notice after a default cure period could be considered unreasonably short under Ohio law. Ohio courts generally evaluate the reasonableness of contractual deadlines, and a 10-day window might be deemed insufficient for a party to assess the full impact of the default and make an informed decision about termination, potentially conflicting with principles of fairness and due process.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Ohio contract law; potentially unreasonable limitation on remedies.",
                "location": "Section 4.2(a)"

                "original_text": "Subject to the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any valid claim not more than ten (10) days after the Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of such amount.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any valid claim not more than five (5) days after the Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of such amount.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the payment timeframe for indemnified claims to 5 days might be considered commercially unreasonable and could contradict the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Ohio law. A 5-day period might be insufficient for the Indemnifying Party to adequately review and verify the claim, especially for complex or substantial claims. This could create an unfair burden and potentially lead to disputes, conflicting with the principle that contract terms should be reasonable and allow sufficient time for compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Ohio contract law; potentially unreasonable contract term.",

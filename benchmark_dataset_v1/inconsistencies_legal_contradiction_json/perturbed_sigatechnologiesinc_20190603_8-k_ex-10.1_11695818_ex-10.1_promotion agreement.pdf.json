                "explanation": "This change reduces the time frame for executive officer resolution from 30 days to 15 days. While seemingly minor, this could be problematic if the complexity of the dispute requires a longer period for initial attempts at resolution. Depending on the jurisdiction, overly restrictive dispute resolution timelines can be viewed unfavorably, especially if they hinder good-faith negotiation. Furthermore, switching 'reasonable' to 'best' efforts could be interpreted as a higher standard of care. Under New York law, 'best efforts' generally is viewed as a more exacting standard.",

                "explanation": "Most jurisdictions recognize that certain trade secrets and confidential data must be protected for a commercially reasonable timeframe. A one-year confidentiality period may be considered insufficient to protect proprietary information, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry, where development cycles and market exclusivity periods often extend far beyond this timeframe. This change creates a scenario where the confidentiality clause is legally insufficient to protect critical business assets beyond the one-year mark, undermining the purpose of including it in the Promotion Agreement.",

MMT will retain all such books, records and accounts for two (2) years after the end of the period to which such books, records and accounts pertain.",
                "explanation": "This modification reduces the record retention period to a fixed two years, disregarding both the applicable tax statute of limitations and any longer periods required by law. In the U.S., the IRS generally requires taxpayers to keep records for three years from the date of filing the original return, or two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever is later. Some states also have longer retention periods. This change introduces non-compliance, as the contracted retention period may not meet the mandatory requirements.",

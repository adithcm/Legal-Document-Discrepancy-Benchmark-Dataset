                "original_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (“Heritage”) Premier Nutrition Corporation (“Premier”) is effective as of July 3, 2019 (“Third Amendment Effective Date”) and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (“Agreement”).",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (“Heritage”) Premier Nutrition Corporation (“Premier”) is effective retroactively as of January 1, 2016 (“Third Amendment Effective Date”) and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (“Agreement”).",
                "explanation": "Making the amendment effective retroactively to a date prior to the original agreement (January 1, 2016, while the original agreement is dated July 1, 2017) can create legal inconsistencies. It could potentially invalidate certain past actions taken under the original agreement if the amendment significantly alters the parties' rights or obligations. Retroactive application can be problematic if it impacts vested rights or settled expectations under the original contract, which is particularly scrutinized under contract law principles.",

                "changed_text": "Except as otherwise specified above in this Amendment, all other terms, conditions and covenants of the Agreement shall be interpreted at Premier Nutrition Corporation's sole discretion, and its interpretation shall be binding.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a significant legal contradiction. By granting Premier Nutrition Corporation the sole discretion to interpret all other terms and conditions, it effectively undermines the principle of mutual agreement and fairness in contract law. It potentially creates an unconscionable contract where one party has undue power and control, contradicting the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. This can make the entire agreement unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amendment will become effective only upon Premier Nutrition Corporation’s posting of a notice on its website. The posting will serve as the sole acceptance and notice to Stremick’s Heritage Foods, LLC.",
                "explanation": "This modifies the standard contract execution process, contradicting legal norms. Requiring only Premier's action (posting on its website) to signify acceptance eliminates the need for Stremick's signature, raising questions about valid consideration and mutual agreement. This change potentially violates general contract law principles concerning offer, acceptance, and the requirement for mutual assent to form a binding contract.",

The arbitration shall be held in Canton, Ohio, and shall be before a panel of three arbitrators, one chosen by each of the Parties and a third chosen by the two arbitrators so chosen by the Parties. Not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the arbitration, each Party shall submit to the other the documents and a list of witnesses it intends to interview or call in the arbitration. The arbitrators shall apply the substantive law of the State of Ohio with regard to any dispute that becomes the subject of arbitration, and the arbitrators will be so instructed. The arbitrators shall issue a written opinion stating the findings of fact and the conclusions of law upon which the decision is based. The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.",

The arbitration shall be held in a mutually agreed location, and shall be before a single arbitrator selected by mutual agreement. Not less than fifteen (15) days prior to any legal proceeding, each Party shall make a good faith effort to mediate. The arbitrators shall be instructed to consider ethical standards instead of the substantive law of the State of Ohio with regard to any dispute. The arbitrators shall issue a verbal opinion. The decision of the arbitrators is non-binding.",
                "explanation": "The arbitration clause is moved to a more obscure section, limiting its enforceability. It introduces contradictions by stating arbitration follows AAA rules but applies only to operational disputes. Further contradictory edits are made: the location is 'mutually agreed upon' (instead of Canton, OH), the arbitrator is a single arbitrator selected by agreement (instead of a panel of three), the law to be applied is ethical standards (instead of Ohio law), and the decision is non-binding. These changes make it difficult to enforce.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires 'material compliance with all federal, state, and local laws'. The modified text replaces this with 'try to be in general compliance with most federal regulations' and 'obtain and maintain most licenses and permits'. This drastically reduces the legal obligation to comply with laws, creating ambiguity and weakening enforceability. The shift from 'material compliance' to 'general compliance' and 'all' to 'most' introduces a significant legal contradiction and reduces the requirement.",

                "changed_text": "In any action, suit, proceeding, claim, or counterclaim brought to enforce this Agreement or any of its provisions, the Party that prevails in any such action, suit, proceeding, claim, or counterclaim (the “Prevailing Party”) may potentially recover some of its costs, fees, and expenses, possibly including some of the costs, fees, and expenses of attorneys (collectively, “Expenses”), if the other Party (the “Non-Prevailing Party”) seems to have acted unfairly. The court or arbitration panel may consider whether to ask the Non-Prevailing Party to contribute to some of the Expenses of the Prevailing Party.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the 'Prevailing Party shall recover its costs, fees, and expenses'. The modified text weakens this by saying the Prevailing Party 'may potentially recover some of its costs', changing a mandatory recovery to a discretionary one.

                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All disputes or claims hereunder shall be resolved by arbitration in McLean, Virginia, pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association.",
                "changed_text": "All disputes or claims hereunder shall be addressed through a series of meetings and mediation attempts before escalating to formal dispute resolution.",
                "explanation": "The original arbitration clause is moved to a position where it appears to be a less mandatory and more suggestive option, undermining its enforceability. This weakens the obligation to resolve disputes through arbitration, making it less clear and less binding.",

                "changed_text": "YOU agree to accept the responsibilities placed on an independent contractor as deemed fair and equitable by both parties.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'federal and state law, regulation, and rule or otherwise' to 'as deemed fair and equitable by both parties' introduces ambiguity. It shifts the determinant of responsibilities from established legal standards to subjective agreement, potentially contradicting independent contractor regulations.",

In the event this contract terminates for any reason, Affiliate shall immediately cease using the Network 1 name.",
                "changed_text": "Affiliate acknowledges that the use of the Network 1 name is on a non-exclusive basis; however, Affiliate may continue using the Network 1 name, including logo(s) and insignia(s), even after termination if mutually agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'however, Affiliate may continue using the Network 1 name, including logo(s) and insignia(s), even after termination if mutually agreed upon' introduces a contradiction. While the original clause mandates cessation of name usage post-termination, the added phrase allows continued use based on mutual agreement, creating uncertainty.",

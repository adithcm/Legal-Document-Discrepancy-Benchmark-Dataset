The construction, interpretation and performance of this Agreement and all transactions under it shall be governed by the law of the State of Israel, without giving effect to choice of law rules, and both Parties consent to jurisdiction by the courts of the City of Haifa.",

The construction, interpretation and performance of this Agreement and all transactions under it shall be governed by the law of a jurisdiction determined at the Contractor's discretion, without giving effect to choice of law rules, and both Parties consent to jurisdiction by the courts of the Contractor's choice.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Israeli law as the governing law, ensuring predictability and legal certainty. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by allowing the contractor to unilaterally choose the governing law, which could be a jurisdiction with laws unfavorable to the customer. This ambiguity undermines the enforceability of the contract and potentially violates principles of fairness and mutual consent.",

                "explanation": "By changing the phrase 'within 30 days, each party will be free to proceed according to applicable law' to 'either party can immediately jump to legal procedures' disrupts the structured negotiation process. The original text enforces a 30-day period for amicable resolution before starting any legal actions. The changed text eliminates the 30-day requirement and allows each party to immediately pursue legal actions, and can make the process more unpredictable, and costly, and also possibly disrupt any cooperative negotiation environment that both parties initially agreed upon.",

                "explanation": "The changes weakens customer's protections; reducing the warranty from 12 months to 30 days significantly reduces customer's protection against defects. Also, replacing 'new materials' with 'used materials' removes the guarantee of quality and replaces contractor's obligation to pay shipping costs related to returns with the customer's cost.",

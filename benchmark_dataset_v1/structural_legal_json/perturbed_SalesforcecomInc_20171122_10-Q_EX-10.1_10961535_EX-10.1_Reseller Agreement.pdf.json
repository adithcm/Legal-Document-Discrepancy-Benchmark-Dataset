                "explanation": "By embedding the term 'Reseller must ensure that Sub-Reseller complies with the terms of the Agreement applicable to Reseller' inside of the 'Entire Agreement' clause, its enforceability is diminished by implying it only applies to the understanding of the agreement, rather than being a stand-alone legal necessity.",

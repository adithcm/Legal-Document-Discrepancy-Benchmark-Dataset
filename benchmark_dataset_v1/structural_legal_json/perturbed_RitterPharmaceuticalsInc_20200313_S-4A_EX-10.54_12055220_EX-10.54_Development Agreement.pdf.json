Sekisui and Qualigen do not need the prior authorization of anyone at the other Party or the other Party’s legal counsel to make any such reports or disclosures and they are not required to notify the other Party that it has made such reports or disclosures.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, Sekisui is hereby permitted to use the Qualigen name and any Qualigen content (including the content of any existing sales collateral and marketing materials) in any sales collateral, marketing materials or other communications used in connection with the marketing and sales of the Product with the prior written consent of Qualigen, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Other than as provided in the foregoing sentence or to the extent such use is based on a public disclosure previously made by the other Party, during the Term neither Qualigen nor Sekisui shall use the name of the other in any verbal or written communications with any Third Party, except as allowed or contemplated herein, without the prior written consent of the other Party.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other agreement between Sekisui and Qualigen, nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement between the Parties prohibits, or is intended in any manner to prohibit, either Sekisui or Qualigen from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. Sekisui and Qualigen do not need the prior authorization of anyone at the other Party or the other Party’s legal counsel to make any such reports or disclosures and they are not required to notify the other Party that it has made such reports or disclosures.",
                "explanation": "Moving the whistleblower protection clause into a section about using names and marketing materials makes it less discoverable. Whistleblower protections are generally required to be clearly stated and accessible to employees/parties potentially subject to retaliation. By burying it within a seemingly unrelated clause, it becomes more difficult to enforce.",

                "explanation": "By adding the sentence 'However, if Qualigen does not agree with the true up calculation, Sekisui has the final say on the numbers' to the end of Step 3 introduces contradiction—the first part states Sekisui and Qualigen review and agree on the calculation but the second part says if Qualigen does not agree with the numbers, Sekisui has the final say.",

                "original_text": "3.1 Governing Law and Jurisdiction This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of Taiwan. The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (“Dispute Notice”) to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall each select one (1) arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. All language used in such proceedings shall be Mandarin Chinese. The Parties agree to keep the content of the dispute and the proceeding of the arbitration confidential. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney’s fees).",
                "changed_text": "3.8 Headings and Subheadings The headings and subheadings herein are solely for ease of reference by the Parties, and shall not be used to interpret this Agreement. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of Taiwan. The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (“Dispute Notice”) to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute.

The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney’s fees).",
                "explanation": "Moving the governing law and arbitration clause to a section titled 'Headings and Subheadings' makes it ambiguous whether the parties intended to agree to that clause. This is because section 3.8 is only for reference by the parties and is not to be used to interpret the agreement. Thus this placement undermines the enforceability of the governing law and arbitration agreement since it can be argued that the parties did not agree to be bound by them.",

However, the foregoing restriction shall not apply to disclosure made to the board of the directors, management team, and relevant employees who need to know such information, attorneys, accountants, financial counsel, and competent authorities for the purposes of performing this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "3.10 Actual Performance The Parties acknowledge and agree that if any of the provisions provided herein are not performed in accordance with the specific terms and conditions or are otherwise violated, this will cause irreparable damages for which monetary compensation would not be an adequate remedy. Therefore, the Parties agrees that, in addition to any other remedies available in common law or equity, each Party shall be entitled to seek injunction and other equitable remedies, including the actual performance of the terms and conditions provided herein, and it is not necessary to post any bond or other security. The Parties agree that the Parties will not disclose information in connection with the execution, existence, content, and performance of this Agreement to any third party before the Parties have made an announcement to the public pursuant to Section 3.11 of this Agreement. However, the foregoing restriction shall not apply to disclosure made to the board of the directors, management team, and relevant employees who need to know such information, attorneys, accountants, financial counsel, and competent authorities for the purposes of performing this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By inserting the confidentiality clause inside the 'Actual Performance' section, it suggests that the confidentiality obligations are directly linked to the ability to seek specific performance. This could be misinterpreted to mean that a breach of confidentiality is only actionable if it prevents actual performance, limiting the scope of protection afforded by the confidentiality clause.",

The Parties shall negotiate and determine whether to make the announcement by press release, press conference or any other method and the content of the announcement. However, in the event that a Party discloses the above-mentioned information pursuant to the laws or requests made in judicial proceedings, and the disclosing Party could not obtain the consent of the other Party in time or the other Party refused to provide its consent without proper reasons after the disclosing Party notified the other Party of such situation, then the disclosing Party may disclose the above-mentioned information.",
                "changed_text": "3.6 Expenses Regarding the expenses arising from this Agreement and the Transaction, each Party shall bear the expenses occurred by it pursuant to the nature of such expenses and the relevant provisions. The Parties shall not make an announcement to the public without the consent of the Parties regarding the execution and content of this Agreement and information in connection with the performance of this Agreement, which includes, but is not limited to the disclosure of material information, pursuant to the laws and the content thereof.

                "explanation": "By embedding the announcement clause directly after the section dealing with expenses, it creates an association where the announcement obligations might be misinterpreted as being triggered only when expenses are incurred or when dealing with financial aspects of the transaction. This misplacement could lead to confusion about when and how the announcement obligations apply outside of the context of expenses, limiting the understanding and enforceability of the clause.",

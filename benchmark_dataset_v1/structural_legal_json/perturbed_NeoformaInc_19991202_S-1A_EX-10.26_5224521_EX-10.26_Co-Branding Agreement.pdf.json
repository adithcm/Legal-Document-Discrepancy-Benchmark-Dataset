Any controversy or claim between the Parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 12.2  [ARBITRATION]\nand the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American\nArbitration Association (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 12.2  [ARBITRATION] is held to\nbe unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to\narbitrate or any other part of this Section 12.2  [ARBITRATION]. The arbitration will be held\nin Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is\nknowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in\nhandling commercial disputes. The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the\nParties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is\ninstituted. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such\n30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15\ndays thereafter. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be\nentered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not have the power\nto award punitive or exemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess\nof, any damage limitations expressed in this Agreement. Issues of arbitrability\nwill be determined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and\nprocedural laws relating to arbitrationÍ¾ in all other respects, the arbitrator\nwill be obligated to apply and follow the substantive law of the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania.",

Any controversy or claim between the Parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation may be resolved by arbitration under this Section 16.17 [ARBITRATION] and the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of an mutually agreeable arbitration association. The arbitration will be held at a location mutually agreed upon by both parties, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business or commercial real estate disputes. The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the Parties hereto within 60 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 60-day period, each party shall independently select an arbitrator, and those two arbitrators shall collectively decide upon a third arbitrator within 30 days. The arbitrator's award will be non-binding unless both parties agree to make it binding, and cannot be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage limitations expressed in this Agreement. Issues of arbitrability will be determined in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction of the state where the party bringing the claim is headquartered; in all other respects, the arbitrator will be obligated to apply and follow the substantive law of the jurisdiction of the state where the party against whom the claim is being brought is headquartered.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates binding arbitration, following AAA rules, and specifies Philadelphia as the location. The modified clause moves this to a 'Miscellaneous' section and introduces several changes that reduce the clause's enforceability: it makes arbitration optional ('may be resolved'), changes the arbitration body to an mutually agreeable association, changes the location to mutually agreeable, alters the arbitrator selection process, makes the award non-binding unless agreed otherwise, and changes the governing law for arbitrability issues to the state where the party is headquartered. These changes collectively weaken the arbitration clause by making it less definitive, more subject to mutual agreement, and less predictable in its application, thus potentially reducing its enforceability. By moving it to the miscellaneous section, it would be harder for a party to find.",

                "explanation": "Warranty disclaimers are moved to the 'Intellectual Property' section, which is unrelated to product warranties or liabilities. Placing warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability in a section discussing intellectual property rights makes them less conspicuous and harder for a party to find when reviewing the contract for terms related to product performance or potential liability. This could weaken their enforceability because a court might find that they were not adequately brought to the attention of the parties.",

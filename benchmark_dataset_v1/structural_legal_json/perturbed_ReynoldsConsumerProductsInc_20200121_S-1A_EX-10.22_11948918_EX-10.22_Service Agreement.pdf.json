Each of the Parties hereto submits to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Lake County, Illinois, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, agrees to bring all claims under any theory of liability in respect of such action or proceeding exclusively in any such court and agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the Parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Each Party hereto agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other process that might be served in any action or proceeding may be made on such Party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address of the Party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 10.5. Nothing in this Section 10.8, however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. Each Party hereto agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.\n(b) The Parties each hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any right to trial by jury of any claim, demand, action, or cause of action (i) arising under this Agreement or (ii) in any way connected with or related or incidental to the dealings of the Parties hereto in respect of this Agreement or any of the transactions related hereto, in each case whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether in contract, tort, equity, or otherwise. The Parties to this Agreement each hereby agree and consent that any such claim, demand, action, or cause of action shall be decided by court trial without a jury and that the parties to this Agreement may file an original counterpart of a copy of this Agreement with any court as written evidence of the consent of the Parties hereto to the waiver of their right to trial by jury.",

                "explanation": "The modification to Section 10.8(b) introduces a contradiction. The original clause mandates waiving the right to a jury trial but the added text introduces an element of optionality to it, which may impede enforcement of the waiver. ",

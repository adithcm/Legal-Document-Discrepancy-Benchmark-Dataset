                "original_text": "Grantee shall not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, or any other basis prohibited by state law relating to discrimination in employment, except where there is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the Grantee.",
                "changed_text": "Grantee shall consider various diversity factors in hiring, but these factors will not be the sole determinate factor in hiring practices. Grantee shall not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, national origin if those factors are not relevant, except where there is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the Grantee.",
                "explanation": "The original text prohibits discrimination based on various factors. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that diversity factors will be considered, then suggests that race, religion, color, sex, and national origin will not be considered sole determinant if irrelevant, making the non-discrimination clause unclear and potentially unenforceable. This violates federal and state laws that strictly prohibit discrimination in employment.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies the method to send all notices required and to where. The changed text removes that specificity and changes the method of notice. In doing so, the mandatory language has been removed making it unclear if and when notice was validly provided. This undermines the intention of the notice clause.",

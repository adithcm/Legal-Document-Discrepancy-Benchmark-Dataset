                "explanation": "Moving the governing law clause to a section that describes how to send notices creates ambiguity and makes it difficult to ascertain which jurisdiction's laws govern the contract. This weakens the enforceability of the agreement by obscuring the applicable legal framework.",

                "original_text": "It is agreed that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Partner, agent, management official or employee of the Transporter or any director, officer or employee of any of the foregoing, for any obligation of the Transporter arising under this Agreement or for any claim based on such obligation and that the sole recourse of Shipper under this Agreement is limited to assets of the Transporter.",
                "changed_text": "It is agreed that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Partner, agent, management official or employee of the Transporter or any director, officer or employee of any of the foregoing, for any obligation of the Transporter arising under this Agreement or for any claim based on such obligation and that the sole recourse of Shipper under this Agreement is limited to assets of the Transporter, unless specified in Appendix A.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'unless specified in Appendix A' to the clause limiting liability introduces a contradiction. The main agreement asserts limited recourse to the transporter's assets, but Appendix A outlines the operating pressures. This contradiction creates ambiguity about whether specific terms in Appendix A can override the liability limitation, potentially undermining the protection afforded to the transporter's personnel.",

This incorporation is not applicable in cases of conflicting details in APPENDIX A.

                "explanation": "By adding \"This incorporation is not applicable in cases of conflicting details in APPENDIX A\", the clause is changed such that the incorporation of the FERC gas tariff is rendered uncertain. This means the rates are uncertain, making the original legal text have a contradiction. This weakens enforceability by creating a contradiction regarding which details hold true in the contract.",

The English text of this Agreement shall control any interpretation of its provisions, and this Agreement and the legal relations among the Parties and the Company shall in all respects be interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance with the laws of Japan.",
                "changed_text": "10.1 New Terms and Conditions for Employment. The terms and conditions of employment of any person employed by the Company after the Put Closing Date or Call Closing Date, as applicable, shall be on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Company, TPH and TPH-A. 11.14 Governing Law; Language. The English text of this Agreement shall control any interpretation of its provisions, and this Agreement and the legal relations among the Parties and the Company shall in all respects be interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance with the laws of Japan.",
                "explanation": "The governing law clause specifies which jurisdiction's laws dictate the interpretation and enforcement of the contract. Moving this critical clause to a section dealing with the new terms and conditions for employment obscures its importance, making it less likely to be noticed and understood by all parties. This misplacement could lead to disputes over which laws apply, especially if employment laws from other jurisdictions conflict with Japanese law.",

If the Parties cannot resolve the dispute through friendly consultation, the provisions of Section 11.15.2 to Section 11.15.4 shall apply with respect to such dispute. 11.15.2 Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity hereof, shall be finally resolved exclusively by arbitration administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“HKIAC”). The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules in effect at the time of the arbitration, except as they may be modified by mutual agreement of the Parties. The seat of the arbitration shall be Hong Kong. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.",

If the Parties cannot resolve the dispute through friendly consultation, the provisions of Section 11.15.2 to Section 11.15.4 shall apply with respect to such dispute. 11.15.2 Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity hereof, shall be finally resolved exclusively by arbitration administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“HKIAC”).

                "explanation": "The section about dispute resolution should clearly outline the process for resolving conflicts. Moving it to 'Other Obligations,' a section about miscellaneous post-closing duties, makes it less prominent and harder to find. This could delay or complicate the dispute resolution process, as parties might overlook the arbitration clause.",

TPH shall obtain approval of the acquisition of the Option Shares (as defined in the SPA) from the requisite stockholders of TPH in accordance with Delaware Law and TPH’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which approval shall have been obtained prior to the Effective Date, to the extent such an approval is permissible under Delaware Law. 11.3 Indemnification. 11.3.1 Each Party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and any other Party, its permitted successors and assigns, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses including reasonable legal fees and disbursements in connection therewith (collectively, “Claims”) asserted against or incurred by the Company or such other Party which arise out of, result from, or may be payable by virtue of, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made or obligation required to be performed by the indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims related to the purchase of the Shares under the SPA shall be governed by the indemnification provisions set forth in the SPA.",
                "explanation": "Moving the indemnification clause, which outlines how parties will be protected from losses or liabilities, to the section about TPH's stockholder approval significantly diminishes its visibility and importance. This misplacement could make it more difficult for parties to invoke their indemnification rights, as the relevant clause is not located in the section where one would logically expect to find it.",

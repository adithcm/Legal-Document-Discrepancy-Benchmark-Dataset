Without reference to choice or conflict of law principles, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA. The Parties unconditionally submit to exclusive jurisdiction of and accept as the exclusive venue for any legal proceeding involving this Agreement the state and federal courts located in the County of Los Angeles, California. Before any Party (the “Complaining Party”) may bring any legal proceeding against the other (the “Non Complaining Party”), the Complaining Party shall first make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve all disputes privately by notifying and providing to the Non Complaining Party of the Complaining Party’s complaints, reasons and supporting evidence for the complaints, and the reasonable steps Complaining Party would like the Non Complaining Party to take in order to address the complaints. If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles County, California, by an arbitrator of JAMS, in accordance with its arbitration rules and procedures then in effect. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing Party in any dispute involving this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the other Party its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees (including any fees for expert witnesses, paralegals, or other legal service providers). This Section 15.10 shall not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "Replaced the binding arbitration clause with a non-binding mediation clause, making the dispute resolution process less enforceable.  The original text mandates arbitration in Los Angeles County, while the changed text only suggests non-binding mediation before legal proceedings, removing the mandatory arbitration provision. This introduces ambiguity and weakens the enforceability of a pre-dispute resolution agreement.",

                "explanation": "Removed the requirement that a third party disclosing confidential information must do so 'not in violation of any obligation of confidentiality.' This weakens the protection of confidential information, as the Receiving Party can now claim information disclosed by a third party is not confidential, even if the third party breached their own confidentiality agreement.  This makes enforcement of the confidentiality clause more difficult.",

                "explanation": "Added 'any changes in market conditions' to the list of force majeure events, and removed the need for the party to notify the other party in writing regarding Force Majeure, substantially broadening the scope of excusable delays and removing notification responsibility. This undermines the reasonable limitations on force majeure and the process to address issues with transparency and allows for a delayed performing party to escape consequences of a breached contract without any notice to the other party.",

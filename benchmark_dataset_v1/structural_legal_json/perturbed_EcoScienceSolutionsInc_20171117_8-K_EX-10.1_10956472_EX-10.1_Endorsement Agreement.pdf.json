                "explanation": "The modification of the disclaimer placement from 'in close proximity to said usage' to 'somewhere on their websites and apps' significantly reduces the clarity and enforceability of the requirement. This makes it difficult to ensure that consumers are adequately warned about the lack of FDA evaluation for dietary supplements, potentially violating consumer protection laws and regulations concerning the clear and conspicuous placement of disclaimers.",

                "explanation": "The insertion of 'unless either party prefers an alternate jurisdiction' introduces ambiguity and undermines the enforceability of the choice of law clause. It creates uncertainty about which jurisdiction's laws will govern the agreement, potentially leading to disputes and rendering the original clause ineffective.

                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless gross negligence is proven' to the end of the indemnity clause significantly narrows the scope of ESSI's indemnification obligation. This introduces a high bar for Talent to meet to trigger indemnification, making it more difficult for Talent to be protected against losses arising from ESSI's actions or breaches. This weakens the protection intended by the indemnity clause and potentially contradicts standard indemnity principles.",

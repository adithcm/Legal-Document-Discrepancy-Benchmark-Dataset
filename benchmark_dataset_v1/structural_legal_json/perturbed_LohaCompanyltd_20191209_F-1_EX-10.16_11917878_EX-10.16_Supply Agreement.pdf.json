                "original_text": "19. ARBITRATION: All disputes in connection with this Contract or the execution thereof shall be settled friendly through negotiations. In case no settlement can be reached, the case may then be submitted for arbitration to the Foreign Economic and Trade Arbitration Committee of the China Beijing Council for the Promotion of International Trade in accordance with its Provisional Rules of Procedures by the said Arbitration Committee. The Arbitration shall take place in Beijing and the decision of the Arbitration Committee shall be final and binding upon both parties; neither party shall seek recourse to a law court nor other authorities to appeal for revision of the decision. Arbitration fee shall be borne by the losing party.",

ARBITRATION: All disputes in connection with this Contract or the execution thereof shall be settled friendly through negotiations. In case no settlement can be reached, the case will be subject to non-binding mediation. In cases where both parties fail to come to an agreement during mediation, the parties may seek resolution in a court of law. The Arbitration shall take place in Beijing and the decision of the Arbitration Committee shall be non-binding upon both parties; either party shall seek recourse to a law court or other authorities to appeal for revision of the decision. Arbitration fee shall be borne by the losing party.",
                "explanation": "The original arbitration clause mandated binding arbitration in Beijing. The modification weakens this by introducing non-binding mediation as a first step, allowing either party to then seek resolution in a court of law, and the original Arbitration Committee shall be non-binding, which goes directly against the original text which states the binding nature of the decision of the arbitration committee. This makes the arbitration clause much less enforceable and contradicts the intent of a clear, binding arbitration agreement. This makes it difficult to enforce since it gives the impression of a binding arbitration, but it is not.",

                "explanation": "Original text stipulates that even if the contract is canceled due to late delivery (beyond ten weeks), the seller must still pay the penalty and refund the money received. I have changed the text to say that with the seller canceling the contract, they are not required to pay a penalty or 30% of the total goods price. This makes the penalties for missing the delivery date unenforceable, which makes it difficult to enforce.",

                "explanation": "Misplaced the non-solicitation agreements in the confidentiality sections. Non-solicitation clauses, akin to non-compete agreements, directly impact an individual's ability to work in a particular field or solicit clients or employees, thereby affecting their professional opportunities and potentially their livelihood. By hiding the agreement to confidentiality, the individual may not understand the limitations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware corporation laws typically require clear and conspicuous disclosure of restrictive covenants like non-solicitation agreements to ensure they are knowingly and voluntarily entered into.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'Unless the agreement has been explicitly made in writing', introduces uncertainty regarding its application and enforceability. This contradiction obscures the original intent of the non-solicitation clause and could lead to disputes about whether the non-solicitation restriction is actually in effect.",

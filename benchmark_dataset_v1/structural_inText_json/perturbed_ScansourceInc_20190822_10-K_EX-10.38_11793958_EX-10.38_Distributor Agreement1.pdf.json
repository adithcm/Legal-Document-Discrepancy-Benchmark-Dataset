                "original_text": "Affiliate(s) are the entities listed on Exhibit E to this Agreement that are either business units of Distributor (and therefore wholly-owned and a part of Distributor) or are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Distributor, but in either case, only for so long as ownership remains as defined in this provision.",
                "changed_text": "Affiliate(s) are the entities listed on Exhibit E to this Agreement. The definition of which may, at Cisco's discretion, be modified to include other entities depending on strategic partnerships and/or business requirements. Such modifications do not require Distributor's consent.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly defines Affiliates as entities listed on Exhibit E with specific ownership criteria. The modified text allows Cisco to unilaterally change the definition, potentially forcing Distributor to deal with entities it hasn't agreed to, contradicting the original definition and creating uncertainty.",

Distributor agrees to use its best efforts to distribute Product solely to Resellers located in the Territory. Those Resellers may resell Product only to End Users who intend to use the Product in the Territory. All Resellers to which Distributor distributes Product must meet Cisco's then-current guidelines for Resellers, as amended from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 By this Agreement, Cisco makes, and Distributor accepts, the appointment of Distributor as an authorized distributor of Products and Services to Resellers located in the Territory. Cisco reserves the right to appoint additional distributors within the same Territory without prior notice or obligation to Distributor. The Distributor agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to distribute Product to Resellers; however, the scope of business and all sales are subject to Cisco’s ultimate approval.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants Distributor non-exclusive distributorship within the Territory, implying certain sales rights. The modified text introduces the possibility of additional distributors and subjects Distributor's sales to Cisco's approval, undermining its role and conflicting with its initial scope.",

Without prejudice to either party's right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in sub​ sections 18.2 to 18.5 below, Cisco may, by written notice to Distributor, given at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term of the Agreement, extend the term of the Agreement for the period set forth in such notice, up to a maximum of one (1) year beyond the then-current expiration date. Any extension shall be on the same terms and conditions then in force, except as may be mutually agreed in writing by the parties. In the event the Agreement expires and Cisco intends to not renew the Agreement, Cisco will provide written notice of same to Distributor. Notwithstanding Cisco's right to extend the term of this Agreement, each party acknowledges that this Agreement shall always be interpreted as being limited in duration to a definite term and that the other party has made no commitments whatsoever regarding the duration or renewal of this Agreement beyond those expressly stated herein.",

Cisco reserves the right to unilaterally renew this agreement indefinitely, subject to changes in the business environment or strategic priorities. Distributor acknowledges that Cisco has the right to extend or terminate the agreement at any time without notice, thereby taking business factors into account.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a two-year term with a limited extension option, implying a defined agreement duration. The modified text allows for indefinite unilateral renewal and immediate termination by Cisco, completely undermining the defined term and creating a contradiction regarding the stability of the agreement.",

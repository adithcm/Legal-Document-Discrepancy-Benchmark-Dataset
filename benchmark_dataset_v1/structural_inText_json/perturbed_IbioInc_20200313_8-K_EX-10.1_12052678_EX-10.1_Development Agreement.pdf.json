                "original_text": "1.1 iBio hereby grants to CC-Pharming for the term of this Agreement, a nonexclusive, non- assignable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to use iBio’s Technology in order to manufacture, process, prepare, and obtain regulatory approval for the development and production of Product(s) and work to be performed under this Agreement. Each Product will be set forth in a separate Statement of Work in the form set forth in Appendix A, which will be signed by representatives of each Party with signing authority. Each phase of the project(s) will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement unless otherwise provided for or in a Statement of Work (“SOW”), including but not limited to project purpose, project phases, and a project budget.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 iBio hereby grants to CC-Pharming for the term of this Agreement, a nonexclusive, assignable, sublicensable, limited right and license to use iBio’s Technology in order to manufacture, process, prepare, and obtain regulatory approval for the development and production of Product(s) and work to be performed under this Agreement.

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states that the license granted to CC-Pharming is 'non-assignable' and 'non-sublicensable.' By changing these terms to 'assignable' and 'sublicensable,' a direct contradiction is created. This introduces uncertainty regarding whether CC-Pharming can transfer or sublicense the licensed technology, potentially leading to disputes over the scope of the license.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly prohibits assignment of rights or delegation of duties without prior written consent. The revised version directly contradicts this by stating that either party 'may assign its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement without the need to seek written consent.' This introduces fundamental uncertainty about the conditions under which assignment is permissible, creating a significant point of contention between the parties.",

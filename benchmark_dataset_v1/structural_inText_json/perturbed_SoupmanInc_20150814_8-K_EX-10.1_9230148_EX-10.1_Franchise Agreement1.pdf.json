You shall have no right or option to extend or renew the term of this Agreement except as provided in Section 3.2 of this Agreement.",

You shall have the right or option to extend or renew the term of this Agreement automatically for one (1) additional ten (10) year terms.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text, which stated that the franchisee had *no* automatic right to renew the agreement, and instead needed to fulfill a list of explicit requirements. The modified text introduces an automatic renewal.",

                "explanation": "The original text gives the franchisor complete control over policies and procedures. The modified text now gives the franchisee some control over policies, undermining the franchise agreement's System. Additionally, it becomes optional to adhere to the policies, making enforcement of the system almost impossible.",

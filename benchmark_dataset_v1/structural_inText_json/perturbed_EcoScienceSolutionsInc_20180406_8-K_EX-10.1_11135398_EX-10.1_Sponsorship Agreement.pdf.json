                "original_text": "Contribution by Sponsor:\nIn consideration for the right to sponsor the Kaya Fest and to be acknowledged by Fruit of Life Productions LLC., as a Promoter of the event\nduring the term of this Agreement, Sponsor agrees to contract with Fruit of Life Productions LLC., for the amount of $250,000.00 to be paid in full\nupon signing of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Contribution by Sponsor:\nIn consideration for the right to sponsor the Kaya Fest and to be acknowledged by Fruit of Life Productions LLC., as a Promoter of the event\nduring the term of this Agreement, Sponsor agrees to contract with Fruit of Life Productions LLC., for the amount of $250,000.00. The payment schedule will be determined by Fruit of Life Productions LLC. and is subject to change at their discretion. Eco Science Solutions, Inc. may be exempt from any payment under this agreement if revenue falls below expected targets.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the $250,000 is to be paid in full upon signing. The revised text introduces ambiguity by stating that the payment schedule will be determined by Fruit of Life Productions LLC. and is subject to change, directly contradicting the immediate payment term. This creates uncertainty about when and how the payment is to be made. Furthermore, adding that Eco Science Solutions, Inc. may be exempt from payment adds additional contradiction that further throws into question when and if the $250,000 will be collected.",

Eco Science Solutions, Inc. may only terminate this agreement after 5 years with 90 days notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear termination date. The modified text contradicts this by stating the agreement continues indefinitely unless terminated with 30 days notice. This creates uncertainty about the agreement's duration, as the term now becomes open-ended. The added asymmetry regarding termination rights further complicates the matter, implying that Eco Science Solutions Inc. has a much longer minimum commitment than Fruit of Life Productions LLC., conflicting with the initial fixed termination date.",

Eco Science Solutions, Inc. may not assign or transfer this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement clearly states that neither party can assign the agreement without the express written consent of the other party. The modified text completely contradicts this, granting Fruit of Life Productions LLC. the unrestricted right to assign the agreement without Eco Science Solutions, Inc.'s consent, while simultaneously prohibiting Eco Science Solutions, Inc. from assigning the agreement at all. This creates an uneven distribution of rights, directly contradicting the original mutually restrictive assignment clause.",

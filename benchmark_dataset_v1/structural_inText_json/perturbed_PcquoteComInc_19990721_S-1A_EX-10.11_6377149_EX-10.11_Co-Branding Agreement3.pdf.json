                "original_text": "3. To the extent, if any, that provision of this Agreement\nconflicts with or differs from any provision of the Agreement, such provision\nof this Second Amendment shall prevail and govern for all purposes and in all\nrespects.",
                "changed_text": "3. To the extent, if any, that provision of this Agreement\nconflicts with or differs from any provision of the Agreement, the provisions of the original Co-Branding Agreement will govern for all purposes and in all respects, except as explicitly stated otherwise in this Second Amendment.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction. Originally, the Second Amendment prevails in case of conflict. Now, the original Agreement prevails *unless explicitly stated otherwise*. This introduces ambiguity as it's unclear which takes precedence when there's an implicit or debatable conflict.",

                "explanation": "This adds a clause where PCQ can unilaterally modify the agreement, but ABW cannot. This is a contradiction because it violates the principle of mutual agreement underlying contracts. The original text confirms all existing terms. This amendment introduces future uncertainty and undermines the confirmed agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original \"WHEREAS\" clauses explicitly state that the parties *desire* to amend the agreement and set forth the terms. By changing this to a potentiality (\"may or may not desire\") and stating that terms will be decided later, we are directly contradicting the intention of the document which claims to be an *amendment* setting forth firm agreements. This creates fundamental uncertainty about whether the document actually does what it claims to do.",

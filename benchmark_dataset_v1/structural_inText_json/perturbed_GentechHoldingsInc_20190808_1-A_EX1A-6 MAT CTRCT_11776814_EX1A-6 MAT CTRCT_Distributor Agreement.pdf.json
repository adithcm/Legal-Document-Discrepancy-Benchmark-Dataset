                "original_text": "Company desires to appoint Distributor as its exclusive distributor of the Products to all Clients that Distributor introduce, and upon confirmed the first order, this client come to be exclusive of Distributor, every new customer introduced by Distributor, must be approved by the company prior to any sale. After official approval from the Company, the customer introduced by Distributor, will appear on an official list in this contract, and will only be met by the Distributor and will follow the rules of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Company desires to appoint Distributor as its exclusive distributor of the Products to all Clients that Distributor introduce. However, the Company reserves the right to directly engage with any client introduced by the distributor, especially for strategic opportunities. Every new customer introduced by Distributor, must be approved by the company prior to any sale. Company retains the option to serve customers directly, even if introduced by the distributor. After official approval from the Company, the customer introduced by Distributor, will appear on an official list; however, appearance on the list does not guarantee exclusivity, as the company can still engage with these customers independently.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states the distributor has exclusive rights to clients they introduce. The modified text introduces contradictions. It states the company can \"directly engage\" clients introduced by the distributor, and while clients appear on an \"official list\", this 'does not guarantee exclusivity.' This undermines the distributor's 'exclusive' rights, creating uncertainty about the extent of the exclusivity and the company's obligations.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Distributor Agreement, Company hereby appoints and grants Distributor the exclusive right to sell and distribute the Products to customers that Distributor introduce and confirmed by Company, (in all territory of United State of America (USA) and to render other services as a distributor for Company as set forth herein. Distributor shall limit its activities with respect to the Products to Customers located within the Territory and refrain from selling or otherwise transferring, directly or indirectly, the Products to any person outside the Territory, without the express written consent of Company. Company shall not sell or otherwise supply, directly or indirectly, the Products to any Distributor’s Customer’s, except by sale through the Distributor. The Company shall not contact any of Distributor’s Customer’s for any reason, without the prior written approval of Distributor.",

The Company shall be able to contact any of Distributor’s Customer’s for any reason, without any approval of Distributor.",
                "explanation": "Section 1(a) originally grants the distributor an 'exclusive right' and restricts the company from selling directly to the distributor's customers or contacting them without approval. The modified version directly contradicts this by stating the Company retains the right to sell directly to the distributor’s customers 'if the Company deems it necessary' and contact them 'without any approval.' This fundamentally undermines the distributor's exclusive rights, creating uncertainty about the level of exclusivity.",

For the avoidance of doubt, the customer and sub-distributor lists of Distributor are generally considered Proprietary Information, except where these lists overlap with the Company's existing customer base or strategic targets, in which case, the Company retains full rights to utilize that information, even post-termination.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the customer and sub-distributor lists are proprietary information with a survival clause of three years. The modified text adds an exception, stating the company can use the information if the lists overlap with the company's existing customers or strategic targets. This directly weakens the distributor's proprietary rights and the associated protections. It creates uncertainty about which parts of the list are truly protected, and whether the 3 year term is actually binding for all data.",

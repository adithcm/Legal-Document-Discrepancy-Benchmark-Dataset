From the Launch Date and ending on the last day of the next Calendar Quarter and each\nsubsequent Calendar Quarter during the Term, Exact shall owe Pfizer a service fee equal to fifty percent (50%) of the\nproduct of: Laboratory Service Revenue minus Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue (“Incremental Laboratory Service\nRevenue”) for the Calendar Quarter multiplied by Gross Margin Percent for the Calendar Quarter (such product, the\n“Promotion Fee”). In no event shall the Gross Margin Percent used in the calculation of the Promotion Fee be less than\nsixty-eight percent (68%) or more than seventy-four percent (74%). The calculation of the Promotion Fee pursuant to\nthis Section 4.2(a) is subject to Section 4.2(c) below. Promotion Fee(s) and all compensation paid by Exact to Pfizer under\nthis Agreement, even where calculated as a percentage of sales, is intended to compensate Pfizer a fair market value for\nthe entirety of services that Pfizer is providing to Exact hereunder.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by making the payment of the promotion fee discretionary (\"may\" owe) and changing the fixed percentage to a variable at the sole discretion of Exact, and the same phrase may be replaced by an uncertain phrase (\"may be\"). This contradicts the original clause, which stated that Exact \"shall\" owe a service fee calculated according to a defined formula. This could cause uncertainty about payment enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by weakening the commitment to remove a Debarred/Excluded Sales Representative.

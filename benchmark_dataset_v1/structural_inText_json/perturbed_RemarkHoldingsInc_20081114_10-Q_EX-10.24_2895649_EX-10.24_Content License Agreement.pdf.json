Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, World Book hereby grants to HSWI, a perpetual, irrevocable limited license to use, copy, store, archive, distribute,\ntransmit, modify (subject to Section 2.1(iv)), and Display the Content, Images and Affinities in whole or in part, only on the HSWI Websites or in promotions in any media for the HSWI Websites.

                "explanation": "The original text provides a \"perpetual, irrevocable\" license. The changed text limits the license to a \"period of five years, with renewal options subject to mutual agreement.\" This creates a direct contradiction regarding the duration of the license, creating uncertainty about HSWI's rights after the initial five-year period.",

                "explanation": "Section 1.16 defines \"Exclusive\" in a way that restricts World Book. Section 2.4 originally states that if HSWI chooses not to display content, the license becomes non-exclusive. The modification in section 2.4 adding \"except that it remains an exclusive license if World Book deems so\" contradicts the definition of 'Exclusive' and adds uncertainty to what happens when HSWI chooses not to display content.",

There will be no grace period for defaulting or breaching the contract. Either party can terminate immediately upon notice.",
                "explanation": "The original clause 6.2(i) requires a material breach and provides a 60-day cure period. The modified clause eliminates the 'material' requirement and removes the cure period, allowing immediate termination for any breach. This directly contradicts the original clause, creating ambiguity about the conditions required for termination.",

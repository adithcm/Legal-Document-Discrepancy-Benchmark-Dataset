                "original_text": "1.38 “FTE” means a full time equivalent person year (consisting of [***] hours per year) of work as an employee or contractor [***] hereunder as tracked by each Party using its respective standard practice and methodologies. For clarity, [***] will not constitute FTEs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the time of a single individual will not account for more than one FTE for a given Calendar Year (or applicable pro-rata portion of an FTE during any Calendar Quarter or other period of less than a Calendar Year).",
                "changed_text": "1.38 “FTE” means a full time equivalent person year (consisting of [***] hours per year) of work as an employee or contractor [***] hereunder as tracked by each Party using its respective standard practice and methodologies. For clarity, [***] will not constitute FTEs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the time of a single individual may account for more than one FTE for a given Calendar Year, at the company’s discretion and depending on project needs.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defined FTE and stated that a single individual cannot account for more than one FTE in a year. The modified version contradicts this by allowing for the possibility of an individual accounting for more than one FTE, creating uncertainty in how FTE costs are calculated and allocated.",

Pricing approval is always included in the definition of Marketing Approval.",
                "explanation": "The original text defined MAA or Marketing Authorization Application to exclude pricing approval, while the modified version includes it. This creates a direct contradiction about whether pricing approval is part of MAA. This also introduces uncertainty and could lead to disputes.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'subject to Section 3.5(b)', the amended section contradicts the rest of the agreement where Section 3.5(b) places a restriction on RevMed's ability to engage in research or development of SHP1-SHP2 Dual Inhibitors outside the collaboration without first offering Sanofi the opportunity to obtain a license. The original section specifies a particular condition, while the modified states that there are no conditions, an explicit contradiction that could lead to contractual disputes.",

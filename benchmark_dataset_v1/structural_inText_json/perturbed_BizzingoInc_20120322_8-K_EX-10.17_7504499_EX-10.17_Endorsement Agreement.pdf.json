                "original_text": "Bizzingo agrees that any use of the Property for advertising, promotional or sale purposes will be approved in advance by Theismann. Theismann agrees that such material, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Bizzingo to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by the Theismann in writing within fourteen (14) days after Theismann’s receipt thereof. Theismann agrees that any material submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Theismann shall advise Bizzingo in writing of the specific grounds therefor at the time of disapproval and provide Bizzingo with specific changes or alterations to such materials. Bizzingo thereafter shall have the right and privileged to use such Property as provided in this Agreement subject to such changes or alterations.",
                "changed_text": "Bizzingo may use the Property for advertising, promotional or sale purposes without any requirement to obtain advanced approval from Theismann. Theismann has the right to review the materials within a reasonable time after they are released to the public. If the Theismann disapproves, Bizzingo is not required to make any changes to the materials.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Bizzingo needs pre-approval before using Theismann's property for advertising. The modified text contradicts this by saying Bizzingo can use the Property without approval. It also states Theismann can review the materials after their release and even if disapproval is given, Bizzingo does not have to make changes, which nullifies the point of the review. This creates uncertainty about the approval process.",

                "original_text": "Unless sooner terminated under the provisions hereof, this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for a period of one (1) year (“Term”). provided however, that the Parties may extend the Term for an additional year period by entering into an written addendum of the Agreement extending such term.",
                "changed_text": "Unless sooner terminated under the provisions hereof, this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for a period of one (1) year (“Term”). This term is automatically renewed for successive one-year periods unless either party provides written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the current term.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the agreement's term can only be extended if both parties enter into a written addendum. The modified clause introduces automatic renewal unless one party opts out. This contradicts the requirement for mutual written agreement, creating uncertainty about how the contract term is actually extended.",

                "changed_text": "Theismann's right to terminate this Agreement is limited to instances where Bizzingo has failed to fulfill its payment obligations, and any termination request must be validated by an independent auditor. The cost of the auditor is to be paid for by Theismann. This clause supersedes any other termination rights outlined in this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows Theismann to terminate the agreement at any time with 30 days' notice. The modified text severely restricts this right, limiting it to payment failures and adding the requirement for an auditor's validation. This directly contradicts the original clause, creating uncertainty about Theismann's termination rights.",

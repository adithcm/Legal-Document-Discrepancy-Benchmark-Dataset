Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark solely and exclusively as a component of Licensee’s own corporate name and in connection with marketing the investment management, investment consultation and investment advisory services that Investment Advisor may provide to Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this License, and except as provided above, neither Licensee nor any affiliate, owner, director, officer, employee or agent thereof shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivative thereof in the Territory without the prior express written consent of Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion and shall not use the Licensed Mark for any purpose outside the Territory.

                "explanation": "The original text states the Licensee needs prior written consent to use the Licensed Mark or any derivation thereof outside the scope of the agreement. The modified version introduces contradiction by granting the Licensee the discretion to use the Licensed Mark in the territory and outside of it without requiring the Licensor's permission, conflicting with the limited use outlined initially and creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows termination by Licensee at any time if they assign or try to assign the agreement without consent. The edited clause contradicts this by making it only terminable with mutual agreement from the Licensor. This contradiction creates uncertainty regarding the Licensee's ability to terminate in specific circumstances.",

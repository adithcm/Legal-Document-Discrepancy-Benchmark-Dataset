Upon request by About, ebix\n      shall provide About with About Customer Data in the aggregated form, which\n      aggregated form shall be jointly owned by ebix and About. During the Term\n      and any time thereafter, eBix shall not sell, lease, transfer,\n      disseminate, display or otherwise disclose any About User data to any\n      third party or otherwise use the same for any reason other than as set\n      forth herein. However, ebix shall not be prohibited from selling, leasing,\n      transferring, disseminating, displaying or otherwise disclosing any About\n      Customer Data, as defined in Section 1 above.\n9.2   About shall own and retain all right, title and interest in and to any\n      About User data generated within the About Network (other than the\n      Insurance Center), and nothing in this Agreement shall confer in eBix any\n      right, title or interest in or to the About User Data (other than the\n      Insurance Center and except to the extent that it is duplicative of About\n      Customer Data).",

                "explanation": "The original text states that About Customer Data is jointly owned when aggregated and eBix is prohibited from selling About User Data. The modified text contradicts this by stating aggregated About Customer Data is solely owned by Ebix and Ebix has the right to sell About User Data, creating uncertainty about data ownership and usage rights. Added that ebix shall have the right to sell About User data, meaning ebix can sell data without the consent from About. This creates an enforcement issue as the contract now has conflicting terms.

The parties should cease the use of the other party's Marks, material or content\nprovided in connection with this Agreement, pending further negotiation. Removal of Links to and\nfrom one another's Sites, and the Links between the About\nNetwork and the Insurance Center is optional.  Each party will reasonably consider returning the Confidential\nInformation of the other party.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces uncertainty regarding the actions required upon termination. The original text mandates immediate termination of licenses, cessation of use of materials, and removal of links. The modified text makes all of these actions discretionary or subject to further negotiation, directly contradicting the original clear directives.  This could lead to disputes over continued use of licensed materials and links after termination. The words such as \"may continue\", \"pending further negotiation\", \"is optional\", \"will reasonably consider\" all create issues. All of the original sentences were preserved.",

Litigation may be initiated in any jurisdiction deemed suitable by the initiating party. Both parties consent to jurisdiction in Delaware for any disputes arising from this agreement; however, this does not preclude either party from pursuing legal action elsewhere. Any cause of action related to this Agreement can be brought in any state or federal court, at the plaintiff's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies Illinois or New York as the governing law and dictates the venue for litigation based on which party initiates the suit. The modified text introduces several contradictions: it establishes Delaware law as the governing law, allows litigation to be initiated in any jurisdiction, and while consenting to jurisdiction in Delaware, it does not prevent actions elsewhere. This creates significant uncertainty regarding which laws and courts will govern disputes, potentially leading to forum shopping and increased litigation costs.

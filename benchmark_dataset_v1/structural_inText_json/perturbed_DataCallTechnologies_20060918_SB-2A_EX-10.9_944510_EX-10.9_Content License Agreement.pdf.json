This contradicts the subsequent clauses (5.2, 5.3, and 5.4) that assume the licensor has rights to the content, creating a contradiction. It can cause uncertainity in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' regarding the automatic extension creates a conflict. The original states the term *will* automatically extend under the specified conditions. The modified version makes the extension discretionary, creating a contradiction and uncertainty as to whether the contract will actually extend. This directly contradicts APPENDIX 2, where the 'Contract end' date is clearly defined as 04-01-08. This change can lead to disagreements on termination dates.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines reporting frequency and payment terms. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that reporting frequency is 'as determined by plan_b' and payment is 'at plan_b's discretion'. This directly contradicts the defined 'Reporting: Quarterly; 30 days after end of quarter' in Appendix 2, creating uncertainty about how often licensor will receive reports and when payments will be made. This could lead to disputes about late reporting or payment.",

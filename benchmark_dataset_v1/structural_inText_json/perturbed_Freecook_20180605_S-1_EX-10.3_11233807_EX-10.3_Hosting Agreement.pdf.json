Client agrees to pay to Company the sum of $5,000 (the “Contract Price”) to design and develop a website for Client (the “Client Website”) in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A.",

Client agrees to pay to Company a sum not to exceed $5,000 (the “Contract Price”) to design and develop a website for Client (the “Client Website”) potentially in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A.",
                "explanation": "The original text firmly states that the client agrees to pay $5,000. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating 'not to exceed $5,000' and 'potentially in accordance with', thus creating uncertainty about the agreed-upon price and scope.",

Client shall make a prepayment of $1,900; the remaining balance will be determined at the Company’s sole discretion following completion of the agreed upon scope of work.",
                "explanation": "The original section mandates the client pays a total of $5,000, and describes the exact payment structure. The modified section makes the payment discretionary on the Client's part, creates ambiguity in the final payment and provides a loophole for change orders to influence the payment amount, contradicting the prior statement. The inclusion of 'at the Company’s sole discretion' further creates uncertainty in the payment amount. These changes undermine the financial certainty established initially.",

                "explanation": "Originally, the company 'shall provide customer service,' creating an obligation. The modified text replaces 'shall' with 'may' and adds conditions like 'if deemed necessary,' and 'a select number of ...questions or complaints', shifting the obligation to a discretionary act, directly conflicting with the original intent. Additionally, removing the phrase 'except as specified in this Section' further obfuscates the customer service commitment.",

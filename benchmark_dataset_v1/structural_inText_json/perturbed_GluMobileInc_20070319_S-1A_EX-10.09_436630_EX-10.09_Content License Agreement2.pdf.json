Licensee shall have the non-exclusive right and license to develop and distribute ICE AGE 2 Wireless Products during the Term of the Agreement for all Wireless Products set forth in this Paragraph 2(c) except the Game, for which Licensee shall have the exclusive right and license to develop and distribute until December 31, 2006. For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee’s right and license to develop and distribute the Game in connection with the Property “ICE AGE 2” shall become non-exclusive after December 31, 2006.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses 'shall,' creating an obligation for the Licensee to develop and distribute the wireless products. The modified text uses 'may,' giving the Licensee the option, but not the obligation, to develop and distribute the products. This creates a contradiction as to whether the licensee is required to or has the option to develop them, making this point uncertain.",

                "explanation": "The original text states Fox 'hereby reserves the right' and 'shall retain' a distribution fee, which creates a definitive and binding right. The modified text states 'may reserve the right' and 'may retain', creating ambiguity on whether Fox has an unreserved right or may at its discretion distribute the products, thus contradicting the meaning of the original clause.",

                "explanation": "The original text utilizes 'shall' to create a definite action of forfeiting the guaranteed payment. By using 'may', the text implies there is a potentiality in the licensee forfeiting the payment, not a requirement. This introduces a contradiction by changing the obligation of forfeiting the guarantee to a potential action.",

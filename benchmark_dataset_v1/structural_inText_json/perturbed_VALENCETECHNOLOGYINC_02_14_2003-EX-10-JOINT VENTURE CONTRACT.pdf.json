                "original_text": "Article 53\nDirectors shall be appointed for a term of four (4) years, provided that the\nParty who has appointed a director may remove that director and appoint a\nreplacement at any time. A director may serve consecutive terms if reappointed\nby the Party that originally appointed him/her. If a seat on the Board of\nDirectors is vacated by the retirement, resignation, disability or death of a\ndirector or by the removal of such director by the Party who originally\nappointed him/her, the Party who originally appointed such director shall\nappoint a successor to serve out such director's term. At the time this Contract\nis signed and each time a director is appointed or replaced, each Party shall\nnotify the other Party in writing of the names of its appointees or\nreplacements.",
                "changed_text": "Article 53\nDirectors shall be appointed for a term of four (4) years, unless the Board of Directors decides otherwise. The Party who has appointed a director may remove that director and appoint a replacement at its convenience, but the replacement must be approved by a majority vote of the entire Board. A director may serve consecutive terms if reappointed by the Party that originally appointed him/her. If a seat on the Board of Directors is vacated by the retirement, resignation, disability or death of a\ndirector or by the removal of such director by the Party who originally\nappointed him/her, the Board will decide if the seat should be filled and who should fill that vacancy. At the time this Contract\nis signed and each time a director is appointed or replaced, there is no obligation of informing the other party of the name of the replacement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces contradiction. The original text states that the appointing party can remove/replace the director anytime while the changed text mentions that the replacement is subject to the majority vote of the entire board, thus removing the right of the appointing party of direct appointment. Also the original states that it is a duty to notify the other party of the replacement name while that is taken away from the changed text. This creates uncertainty as to who has the final say in the appointments and whether any notification is required.",

                "changed_text": "Article 80\nExpatriate personnel may receive additional allowances and benefits not provided to Chinese personnel in similar positions. The specifics of these allowances will be determined by the CEO at their sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This directly contradicts the principle of equal treatment established in the original Article 80. By allowing additional allowances solely for expatriate staff, it introduces discrimination and could be seen as a breach of fair labor practices, creating potential disputes and uncertainty regarding compensation policies.",

                "explanation": "By adding the clause \"only if it is profitable to do so\" the first part of the condition is contradicted. By saying \"may disclose it to any person or entity if it benefits them\" it negates the condition that they cannot disclose it.",

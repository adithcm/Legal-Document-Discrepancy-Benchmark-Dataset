The Products are described on Exhibit A to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Principal appoints the Distributor as a non-exclusive distributor, to sell Principal’s qPCR infectious disease kits, Logix Smart COVID-19 PCR diagnostic test and Co-Dx Box™ instrument (the “Products”). The Principal reserves the right to sell the Products directly, without any obligation to compensate the Distributor for such sales. The Products are described on Exhibit A to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By adding \"The Principal reserves the right to sell the Products directly, without any obligation to compensate the Distributor for such sales,\" it contradicts the non-exclusive distributorship granted earlier.

The Principal also retains the right to grant exclusive distribution rights to other distributors within Romania for specific product lines or customer segments, as determined by the Principal at its sole discretion, without the need for mutual written agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change allows the Principal to grant exclusive rights to others within the same Territory, directly contradicting the initial non-exclusive grant to the Distributor.

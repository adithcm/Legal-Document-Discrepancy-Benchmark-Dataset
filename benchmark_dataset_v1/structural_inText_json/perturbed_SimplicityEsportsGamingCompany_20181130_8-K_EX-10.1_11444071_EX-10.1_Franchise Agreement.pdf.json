Subject to Section 1.2, Franchisor hereby grants to Franchisee the exclusive right, (a) to establish and operate Smaaash Centres in the Territory, (b) to sub-license the right to establish and operate Smaaash Centres to third party franchisees in and for the Territory, (c) a license to use the products and other services developed by Franchisor with respect to the Smaaash Centres (including a right to authorise the use of products and services developed by the Franchisor by third party franchisees), in the Territory, and (d) to identify third party franchisees for the Smaaash Centres in the Territory. The rights granted herein include the limited license to use the Trademarks of the Franchisor (the details of which are morefully set out in Exhibit A), as set out in Section 3 of this Agreement, for the purposes of establishing and operating the Smaaash Centres in the Territory. It is clarified that if third party franchisees shall be establishing and operating Smaaash Centres in the manner contemplated under this Agreement, then the Franchisee shall ensure that such third party franchisees complies with all the obligations and duties of the Franchisee, as recorded under this Agreement, and to this extent, Franchisee may enter into relevant agreements with such third party franchisees.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 Rights granted to the Franchisee. Subject to Section 1.2, Franchisor hereby grants to Franchisee a non-exclusive right, (a) to establish and operate Smaaash Centres in the Territory, (b) to sub-license the right to establish and operate Smaaash Centres to third party franchisees in and for the Territory, (c) a license to use the products and other services developed by Franchisor with respect to the Smaaash Centres (including a right to authorise the use of products and services developed by the Franchisor by third party franchisees), in the Territory, and (d) to identify third party franchisees for the Smaaash Centres in the Territory.

                "explanation": "The original text grants the Franchisee 'exclusive right' to establish and operate Smaaash Centres in the Territory. The modified version changes this to 'non-exclusive right.' This directly contradicts the original grant of exclusivity, potentially allowing the Franchisor or other franchisees to also operate in the same territory. This creates uncertainty about the Franchisee's actual rights and could lead to disputes.",

Except as provided in the next sentence, the license granted herein shall be exclusive. “Exclusivity” shall mean that Franchisor shall not grant any further licenses to third parties in the Trademarks for use in connection with Smaaash Centres in the Territory, and the Franchisee shall not enter into any arrangement or agreement with any third parties for establishing or operating any gaming and entertainment centres identical or similar to Smaaash Centres, in the Territory except as otherwise provided in this Agreement; provided, however, that Franchisor may continue to use the Trademarks in the Territory in connection with the operation of Franchisor’s entertainment centers already set up as of the Effective Date in the Territory. The restriction contained in this Agreement shall apply on the parties throughout the Term.",

                "explanation": "Section 3.2 defines the exclusivity of the trademark license. The original text explicitly states the license shall be exclusive, meaning the Franchisor will not grant further licenses to third parties, and the Franchisee is restricted from similar agreements. The modification reverses this entirely. It now says the license is not exclusive, meaning the Franchisor can grant other licenses, and the Franchisee is free to engage in similar agreements. This directly contradicts the initial statement and creates uncertainty regarding the Franchisee's protection and the Franchisor's obligations.",

This Agreement may be terminated by either party for “Cause” without the need of providing a notice period prior to such termination becoming effective. “Cause” shall exist if circumstances occur which, taking into consideration the substance and purpose of this Agreement, would make it unreasonable for one or both of the parties to continue the contractual relationship and the other party fails to cure the cause (assuming that such cause is susceptible to cure) within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of a corresponding written notice (“Remedy Notice”). If such cause by its nature is not curable, then no such Remedy Notice is required. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a party may terminate this Agreement for “Cause”if: (a) the other party to this Agreement is in breach of one or more of its material obligations; or (b) the other party to this Agreement becomes insolvent, generally cannot pay its obligations when due or otherwise suffers a substantial deterioration of its financial situation, or if insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings are initiated against such party or such party initiates any dissolution or liquidation of its business and/or assets.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows termination for cause without a notice period but defines 'cause' as a material breach or insolvency/bankruptcy. The modified clause contradicts this by requiring a notice period while simultaneously redefining 'cause' as NOT a material breach or a positive financial turnaround (becoming solvent). This directly clashes with the initial intention of the clause, making it nearly impossible to terminate for cause because the defined reasons contradict what would generally be considered legitimate grounds for termination.",

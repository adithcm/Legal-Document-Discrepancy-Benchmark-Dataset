                "explanation": "The original text defined the “LICENSED FIELD” as “Cannulated Surgical Intervention.” The modified text adds \"unless otherwise agreed in writing by both parties,\" introducing ambiguity. This contradicts the later section granting a license within the initially defined LICENSED FIELD because the scope of that field is now uncertain. It is unclear if subsequent agreements can alter this definition.",

                "explanation": "Section 6.2 explicitly states that the Company can terminate for *any* reason with 60 days' notice. I added an exception: \"However, should Virtuoso Surgical, Inc. be in material breach, the right to terminate is suspended until the breach is resolved.\" This directly contradicts the 'any reason' clause, creating uncertainty. The company's right to terminate is now conditional, even though the original clause made it seem absolute. It is unclear when this suspension applies, if ever. This potentially impacts the balance of power between the parties.",

                "explanation": "In Section 4.1, the original text states the license fee is \"nonrefundable.\" I changed it to \"may be refundable under certain conditions outlined in a separate addendum,\" contradicting the nonrefundable nature. Additionally, the statement that the fee \"shall not be credited against royalties or other fees\" is weakened by adding \"unless JHU gives written consent.\" Then, for Section 4.2, I added \"may be waived under certain conditions, as determined at JHU's sole discretion.\" This creates uncertainty because the conditions are not specified. The obligation to pay minimum annual royalties is no longer definite.",

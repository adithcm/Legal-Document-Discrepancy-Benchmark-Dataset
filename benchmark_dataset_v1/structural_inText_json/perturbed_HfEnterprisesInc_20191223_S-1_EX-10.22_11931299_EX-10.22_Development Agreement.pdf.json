The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and shall continue thereafter for a period of twelve (12) months (the “Initial Term”). The Initial Term shall automatically renew for one-month periods thereafter unless either party provides 30-days advance notice of termination, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof. For purposes hereof, the Initial Term, together with any extension or renewal terms, shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the “Term”.",

The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and shall continue thereafter for a period of twelve (12) months (the “Initial Term”). The Initial Term shall renew for subsequent periods only upon mutual written agreement of both parties at least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current term, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof. For purposes hereof, the Initial Term, together with any extension or renewal terms, shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the “Term”.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the contract automatically renews unless either party provides 30-days advance notice of termination. The modified text states that the Initial Term shall renew for subsequent periods only upon mutual written agreement of both parties, contradicting the automatic renewal clause and creating uncertainty about the renewal process.",

The modified text states that while DSS owns the Technology, the Developer retains all rights to the Improvements, its Intellectual Property, and all future derivative works.

Developer shall be fully liable, without limitation, for money damages resulting from its improper or unauthorized use, modification, alteration, licensing or transfer of the Technology or Improvements, or resulting from its failure to provide functional and merchantable Improvements hereunder, which failure shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by Developer.",

Developer shall only be liable for money damages to the extent such damages are a direct result of gross negligence or willful misconduct in its improper or unauthorized use, modification, alteration, licensing or transfer of the Technology or Improvements, or resulting from its failure to provide functional and merchantable Improvements hereunder, which failure shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by Developer. In no event shall Developer's liability exceed the total fees paid to Developer under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states Developer is fully liable, without limitation, for money damages. The modified text adds a significant limitation, stating Developer is only liable for damages resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct, and further limits the liability to the total fees paid. This directly contradicts the 'without limitation' aspect of the original clause, creating uncertainty about the extent of Developer's financial responsibility.",

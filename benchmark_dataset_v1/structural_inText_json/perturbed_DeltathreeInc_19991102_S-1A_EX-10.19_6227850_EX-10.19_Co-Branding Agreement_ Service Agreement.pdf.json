                "original_text": "Section 3.06  [Reporting]. Reporting. On or before the tenth day of each calendar month, PrimeCall shall prepare for DeltaThree a report detailing the total revenues and expenses associated with the sale and use of the Calling Cards in the previous month. In the event that DeltaThree disputes any amounts set forth on the report, DeltaThree shall provide PrimeCall with written notice of such dispute, which notice shall detail the reasons for the dispute, within seven (7) days of its receipt thereof. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputes.",
                "changed_text": "Section 3.06  [Reporting]. Reporting. PrimeCall will endeavor to provide DeltaThree a report detailing the total revenues and expenses associated with the sale and use of the Calling Cards. In the event that DeltaThree disputes any amounts set forth on the report, DeltaThree is encouraged to provide PrimeCall with written notice of such dispute, which notice should detail the reasons for the dispute. The parties may, at their discretion, negotiate to resolve any disputes.",
                "explanation": "The original text firmly states PrimeCall 'shall' prepare the report and DeltaThree 'shall' provide written notice of any disputes within a strict 7-day window. The modified version weakens this by using 'will endeavor to provide' instead of 'shall prepare', and 'is encouraged to provide' rather than 'shall provide'. The removal of the 7 day notice deadline is not specific. Also, 'may, at their discretion, negotiate' allows them not to negotiate in 'good faith'. This creates uncertainty and contradicts the original text's clear obligations.",

In the event that either PrimeCall or DeltaThree materially breaches any of its duties or obligations hereunder, which breach shall not be cured within thirty (30) days after written notice is given to the breaching party specifying the breach, then either PrimeCall or DeltaThree, as the case may be, may, by giving written notice thereof to the other, terminate this Agreement as of a date specified in such notice of termination, which date shall be no earlier than ten (10) days after the date of such notice.",
                "changed_text": "Section 6.01  [Termination for Cause]. Termination for Cause. In the event that either PrimeCall or DeltaThree materially breaches any of its duties or obligations hereunder, and such breach remains uncured, then either PrimeCall or DeltaThree, as the case may be, retains the option to terminate this Agreement. The decision to terminate and the timing thereof are at the sole discretion of the non-breaching party.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a cure period of thirty (30) days after written notice for a material breach, after which the non-breaching party can terminate with a 10-day notice. The modified version removes this cure period and fixed notice periods. Now, breaches could be made impossible to cure within the notice period, and gives complete discretion of when the agreement is terminated. This creates a contradiction and introduces uncertainty, as there are no safeguards in place. The uncured breach is no longer required to be material.",

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by DeltaThree without the prior written consent of PrimeCall. PrimeCall may assign this Agreement to any affiliate of PrimeCall or in connection with a merger or consolidation of PrimeCall or a sale of all or substantially all of PrimeCall's business.

This Agreement may be assigned freely by either party without requiring consent from the other party. Any assignment will be effective upon written notification to the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly restricts assignment of the agreement, requiring prior written consent in most cases. It carves out an exception for PrimeCall. The revised text states that either party can freely assign the agreement with only written notification, directly contradicting the previous restrictions and creating uncertainty about the conditions under which the agreement can be transferred.",

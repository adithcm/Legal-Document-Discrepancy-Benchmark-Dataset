                "original_text": "20.\tCONFIDENTIALITY \n\n20.1\tConfidentiality obligations \nUnless otherwise provided in this Agreement, any Confidential Information released by either of the Parties (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other Party (the “Receiving Party”) shall not be released in whole or in part to any third party.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates a direct contradiction. The original text strictly prohibits the release of confidential information to third parties. The revised text permits such release, contingent upon the receiving party's approval. This introduces uncertainty regarding the confidentiality obligations, as the receiving party now has the discretion to override the general prohibition.",

                "explanation": "This is internal contradiction because the original text states the Repairer will pay the balance of the security deposit if the Company is NOT in default while the new text is stating that the Repairer will pay the balance even if the company is in default.

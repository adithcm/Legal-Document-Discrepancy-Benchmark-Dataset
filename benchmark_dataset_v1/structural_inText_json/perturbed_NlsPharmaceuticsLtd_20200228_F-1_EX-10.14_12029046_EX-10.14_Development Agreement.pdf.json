                "original_text": "3.  License Fees and Milestone Payments\n3.1.\tUpfront Payment\nUpon signature of this Agreement and no later than 20 days following it, Eurofarma shall pay to NLS, for the rights pursuant to Article 2.1(i), the non-refundable and non-deductible sum of USD 2’500’000 (in words: US dollars two and a half million).",
                "changed_text": "3.  License Fees and Milestone Payments\n3.1.\tUpfront Payment\nUpon signature of this Agreement and no later than 20 days following it, Eurofarma may pay to NLS, for the rights pursuant to Article 2.1(i), the sum of USD 2’500’000 (in words: US dollars two and a half million). Whether or not this payment is refundable or deductible is subject to further negotiation between the parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the upfront payment 'shall pay' meaning its obligatory and 'non-refundable and non-deductible' meaning it is definite. The modified text replaces 'shall pay' with 'may pay', introducing uncertainty about whether the payment will actually be made. Also adding 'Whether or not this payment is refundable or deductible is subject to further negotiation between the parties.' directly contradicts the initial statement that it is non-refundable and non-deductible.",

                "original_text": "The Licensee shall keep, and shall require its Affiliates and Distributors to keep, accurate and correct records of the Licensed Product used and sold under this Agreement. Such records shall be retained by the Licensee for ten (10) years following a given reporting period.\nSubject to a written advance notice of thirty (30) calendar days, all relevant records supporting the preparation of the Reports shall be made available during normal business hours for inspection at the expense of Licensor by Licensor or by a selected representative of Licensor for the sole purpose of verifying the Reports and the accuracy of the payments made or due to Licensor under this Agreement. Such inspector shall not request any other documents or information other than these related to this purpose as determined in its sole discretion and the Licensee shall have no obligation to provide the inspector or Licensor any documents or information not related thereto.",
                "changed_text": "The Licensee shall keep, and may or may not require its Affiliates and Distributors to keep, accurate records of the Licensed Product used and sold under this Agreement. The Licensee may retain such records for a period determined at their discretion following a given reporting period.\nAccess to relevant records supporting the preparation of the Reports for inspection may be granted, depending on the Licensor's adherence to specific conditions and the Licensee's convenience. The extent of cooperation regarding access to documents or information remains subject to negotiation between the Licensee and Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that Licensee keeps records and the new text makes it uncertain whether they do. It also removes a time period. Furthermore, it introduces ambiguity and optionality regarding record-keeping and inspection, conflicting with the original's directive tone and specified conditions for access. This makes enforcement uncertain.",

                "original_text": "Licensor shall provide the Licensee the Dossier, any updates and variations to the Dossier (such as monograph, method updates or stability data, new manufacturer or API supplier) without undue delay when such additional data is available to the Licensor.\nIn any event, Licensor understands and agrees that any variations and/or updates shall only be implemented by Licensee once this is permissible according to applicable regulatory provisions. In case the corresponding regulatory agency requests any information on any updates and/or variations requested by NLS, the responsibility to provide such information shall be of NLS, and NLS shall be bound to any deadlines and other requirements posed by the regulatory agency.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor may, at its discretion, provide the Licensee with the Dossier and any updates or variations to the Dossier. The timing and method of providing such information are subject to internal review and assessment by Licensor.\nLicensor's commitment to implement variations and/or updates depends on the prioritization of tasks and regulatory considerations. The Licensee's adherence to regulatory provisions takes precedence. NLS and Eurofarma will need to collaborate on information exchange regarding requested updates and/or variations requested by NLS, but the timing and nature of the contribution will be clarified by the Parties involved and their specific tasks and responsibilities during a series of project-specific meetings.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates an obligation for the Licensor to provide the Dossier. The changed text replaces the obligation of 'shall provide' with 'may at its discretion, provide' which contradicts the first. The new addition makes the degree of collaboration between the parties subject to the specific details of each project, the exact steps that the parties need to agree to may be different and can cause delays. This will cause difficulty to understand which parts of the regulatory obligations are more relevant between the Parties.",

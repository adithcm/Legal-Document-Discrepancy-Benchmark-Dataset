                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Licensee 'shall pay' a royalty and defines the calculation method based on percentage of Gross Receipts. The modified version contradicts this by stating Licensee 'may pay' a royalty, removing the obligation, and then saying that royalty if applied 'will be determined at Fox's sole discretion', taking away the calculation method, which creates enforcement issues.",

Affiliate  shall  use reasonable efforts to market and sell\nto  commercial businesses the Services of Network 1 and Network 1's subsidiaries\nand  to  locate individuals who are willing and capable of acting as Contractors\nof  Network  1  and Affiliate; however, the affiliate is not obligated to meet any specific sales targets. The approval of such individuals is not guaranteed by Network 1, and Network 1 will only accept such individuals who are registered in Texas. All such Contractors must process\nMerchant applications and transactions primarily through Network 1, however the affiliate is allowed to make use of other processing networks.

                "explanation": "This change introduces several contradictions. The original text states the Affiliate must use its 'best efforts' to market services, implying a strong obligation. The modified text weakens this obligation, stating the Affiliate is not obligated to meet specific sales targets, creating ambiguity about the level of effort required. Originally, contractors are required to process transactions exclusively through Network 1, but I modified it to allow the affiliate to make use of other networks. This directly contradicts the exclusivity clause.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement automatically renews for one-year terms unless terminated with 30 days' notice. The modified text says the agreement automatically renews regardless of any termination notice given by either party and continues indefinitely, contradicting the possibility of termination by notice and also contradicts the term of 3 years. This makes the enforceability of termination clause uncertain.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that Affiliate cannot assign the contract without Network 1's consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The modified version says Network 1's consent is under their sole discretion and no justification needs to be provided. Additionally, it is altered to indicate that if assigned to a third party it is no longer subject to the terms of the agreement. This directly contradicts the protection the assignor gains from the original document.",

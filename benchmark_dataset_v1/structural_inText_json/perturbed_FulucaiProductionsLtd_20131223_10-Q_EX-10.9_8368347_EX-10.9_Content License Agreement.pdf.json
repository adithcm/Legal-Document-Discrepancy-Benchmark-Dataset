                "explanation": "The original contract states a license term of either perpetual or 2 years. By adding a clause allowing ConvergTV to terminate the agreement at any time with 30 days' notice, this directly contradicts the 'perpetual, unlimited runs' and introduces uncertainty about the actual duration of the license term, creating a potential conflict.",

During the License Term (which is identified in the Deal\nTerms), Producer agrees that ConvergTV has the exclusive right to exercise the rights granted to it under this Agreement with respect to the\nProgram, including those in Section 1, within the Licensed Territory. However, Producer reserves the right to license the program to other distributors in the Licensed Territory if ConvergTV fails to generate a minimum revenue threshold of $100 within the first year.",
                "explanation": "The original clause grants ConvergTV exclusive rights. The added sentence allows the Producer to license the program to others under certain revenue conditions. This directly contradicts the initial exclusivity and creates confusion about whether ConvergTV truly has exclusive rights, leading to potential disputes over distribution rights.",

The Producer shall have thirty (30) days from the payment date to dispute the amount of any revenue share payout or any such\nclaim or dispute is hereby waived by the Producer. \nNotwithstanding the above, ConvergTV may, at its sole discretion, modify the revenue share outlined in Exhibit B with 60 days written notice to the Producer. Producer's continued participation in the agreement after the 60-day notice period constitutes acceptance of the modified revenue share.",
                "explanation": "The original clause defines how the producer shall receive the agreed revenue share and that it is contained in exhibit B. By giving ConvergTV the right to unilaterally change this share, it makes the original consideration uncertain. Although the revenue share is stated in Exhibit B, the clause creates a contradiction in that its enforceability is uncertain. The statement would lead to disputes over what each party's actual share of revenue may be.",

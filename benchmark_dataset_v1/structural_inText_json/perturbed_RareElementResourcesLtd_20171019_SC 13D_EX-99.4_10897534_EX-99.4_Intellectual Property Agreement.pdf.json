                "original_text": "3.00 Company grants to Investor, for the duration of the Option Period, a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable license (with the right to grant sublicenses to Affiliates) under the Patents to practice the methods therein described and claimed and to make and have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import products made using such methods, and to make Improvements, and to engage in any activity which would give rise to a claim of infringement (direct or indirect or otherwise) of one or more of the Patents in the absence of a license.",
                "changed_text": "3.00 Company grants to Investor, for the duration of the Option Period, a worldwide, royalty-bearing, non-exclusive, revocable license (without the right to grant sublicenses) under the Patents to practice the methods therein described and claimed and to make and have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import products made using such methods, and to make Improvements, and to engage in any activity which would give rise to a claim of infringement (direct or indirect or otherwise) of one or more of the Patents in the absence of a license.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"royalty-free\" to \"royalty-bearing,\" \"irrevocable\" to \"revocable,\" and removing the sublicense clause we introduce uncertainty. The original grants a strong, permanent right, while the modified version allows for royalties, revocation and no sublicensing which alters the rights granted to Investor. This creates a contradiction on the strength and conditions of the license grant.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Investor owns all right, title and interest in any Improvement, made jointly by the Company and Investor. The modified version directly contradicts this by stating that the Company owns all right, title and interest in the same 'Joint Improvements'. This contradiction creates ambiguity about the ownership of jointly developed improvements.",

                "changed_text": "“Licensed Content” shall mean some Content (i) whose copyright is owned by Licensor; or (ii) owned by a third party provider but is sublicensable by Licensor to Licensee, potentially requiring the payment of additional fees to any third party and potentially violating the terms of any agreement with such third-party provider, together with some updates to and substitutions therefor as may be implemented by Licensor or such third-party provider.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Licensed Content' states that the Licensor can sublicense the content to the Licensee without additional fees or violating third-party agreements. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating it *potentially* requires additional fees or violates agreements. This creates a contradiction, as the term is no longer clearly defined, and the Licensee cannot be certain whether they'll incur additional costs or legal issues from using the content.",

Licensee acknowledges that, as between the Parties, Licensor (or its third party providers) is the owner of some right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content, and such right, title and interest may not remain exclusively with Licensor (or its third party providers).",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes clear ownership of Licensed Domain Names and Content with the Licensor. The revised clause makes the extent of the Licensor's ownership unclear by saying 'some right, title, and interest' and adds uncertainty about whether the Licensor's ownership remains exclusive. This directly contradicts the original statement and could create disputes over ownership rights during the contract's term.",

Upon expiration of this Agreement or such 90-day period, (i) all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content shall immediately cease, and (ii) Licensee shall immediately discontinue all use of the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content.",

(a) Upon termination (but not expiration) of this Agreement for any reason, Licensee may be entitled to use the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content for a limited period of time, potentially exceeding ninety (90) days, depending on the discretion of the Licensor. Upon expiration of this Agreement or the potentially extended period, (i) some rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content may not immediately cease, and (ii) Licensee may not immediately discontinue all use of the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content, pending further negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The original clause grants a clear 90-day usage period after termination for transitioning. The modified version contradicts this by stating the Licensee *may* be entitled to use the content, and the period *potentially* exceeds 90 days depending on Licensor discretion. Additionally, the clause contradicts itself, as, on one hand, the contract terminates, however, the license will still be there. It also removes the obligation to immediately discontinue use, introducing ambiguity and potential disputes over post-termination rights. The terms are not clear and uncertainty is introduced.",

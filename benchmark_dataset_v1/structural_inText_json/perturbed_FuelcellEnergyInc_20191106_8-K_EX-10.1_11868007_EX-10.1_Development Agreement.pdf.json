The modified version removes the restriction that it may be extended to contractors and inserts 'is otherwise sub-licensable with written consent from ExxonMobil,' which directly contradicts the non-sub-licensable clause and creates uncertainty regarding the sub-licensing rights.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that in case of early termination ExxonMobil is responsible for the reasonable non-refundable expenses incurred by FCE. This is modified to say ExxonMobil will only be responsible for a termination fee of $10,000, which could be significantly lower than reasonable expenses, creating a contradiction.

The modified text adds an exception: 'except in circumstances where ExxonMobil provides written notice waiving its rights to ownership.' This creates a direct contradiction, as it's now unclear under what conditions ExxonMobil will actually own the Program Results. It introduces uncertainty because ownership is no longer automatic and is subject to ExxonMobil's discretionary waiver.",

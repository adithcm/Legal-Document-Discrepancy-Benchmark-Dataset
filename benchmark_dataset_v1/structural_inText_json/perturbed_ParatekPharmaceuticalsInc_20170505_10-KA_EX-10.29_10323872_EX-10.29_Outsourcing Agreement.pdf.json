The Parties agree that the license grant contained in this Section 11.3 is personal to Supplier only and shall be exercised by Supplier only, and Supplier agrees to make use of Customer’s Confidential Information and the Customer Technology only in accordance with this license and not to disclose any such Confidential Information or Customer Technology to any Third Party, except that nothing herein shall prevent Supplier from disclosing to its permitted subcontractors under confidentiality obligations at least as strict as those that bind Supplier under this Agreement, as necessary to perform Supplier’s obligations hereunder.",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause by granting the Supplier the right to sublicense Customer's Confidential Information and Customer Technology, whereas the original text explicitly denied this right. This contradiction creates uncertainty regarding the scope of the license and could lead to disputes over whether the Supplier is permitted to grant sublicenses to third parties.",

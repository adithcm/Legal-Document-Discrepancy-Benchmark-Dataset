                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Net Revenues\" provides a clear and consistent calculation. The modified version introduces uncertainty by using \"may receive\" instead of \"actually receives\" and adding the caveat of potentially different negotiations, which can affect the revenue split, making it unclear how revenue is calculated.",

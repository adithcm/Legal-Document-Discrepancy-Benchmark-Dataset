                "changed_text": "6.3 (c) If this Agreement is termination in accordance with Section 6.2 by EHS or EHN, all of the rights and obligations hereunder shall cease and be of no further force or effect, except that Sections 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 5.3, 7, 8 and 9 shall survive. 3.2 Exclusivity. Dr. Murray may provide assistance to other companies that may be considered competitive to EHS or EHN following the termination of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement (3.2) stated Dr. Murray would not assist competitors. By adding an exception to section 3.2 that Murray may now assist competitors, we've created a contradiction, since the original section 3.2 intended to enforce that rule even after termination, but section 6.3(c) states all obligations are ceased, this addition creates ambiguity on the exclusivity of the agreement",

These options will vest according to a schedule determined by EHS at its sole discretion and communicated to Dr. Murray separately.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement clearly stated that the options vest immediately. Now it states the options will vest based on a schedule. This creates uncertainty about the vesting schedule, which is a direct contradiction. The discretion given to EHS further complicates the matter.",

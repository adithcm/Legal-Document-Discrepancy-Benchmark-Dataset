                "changed_text": "a. As of the VNBJ Closing, the JV Agreement shall immediately cease to have any application or effect with respect to VNBJ. However, certain obligations and rights with respect to VNBJ under the JV Agreement may continue at the discretion of the Nissin Parties, and all references to “Company” or “Companies” in the JV Agreement (either in the body of the JV Agreement or its schedules and other attachments) shall read and be interpreted to mean VNBZ and/or ANRA except as the context otherwise requires. The specifics of these continued obligations will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Nissin Parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a complete termination of the JV Agreement with respect to VNBJ. The changed text introduces uncertainty by suggesting that some obligations and rights may continue at the discretion of the Nissin Parties, creating a contradiction about the extent of the termination and the definition of the word 'termination'.",

Except as expressly set forth in this Amendment and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the JV Agreement (including Section 9.3.11 (Termination and Survival)), (a) effective as of the later of the VNBJ Closing and the VNBZ Closing, the JV Agreement will generally terminate with respect to the Veoneer Parties, except that Veoneer Parties' responsibilities regarding ongoing liabilities will remain in effect. (b) after the later of the VNBJ Closing and the VNBZ Closing, the Veoneer Parties will generally cease to be a party to the JV Agreement and will have no further obligations with respect thereto, unless otherwise determined by mutual agreement of the parties. For avoidance of doubt, Veoneer Parties may be considered a party to the contract if any dispute rises from the contract signed before the later of the VNBJ Closing and the VNBZ Closing.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that the JV agreement will terminate with respect to the Veoneer parties, and they have no further obligations. The changed text introduces ambiguity by stating \"generally terminate\" and adding an exception for 'ongoing liabilities' and 'mutual agreement,' and they can be considered a party to the contract if there is any dispute arises from the contract signed before the later of the VNBJ Closing and the VNBZ Closing. This contradicts the original statement of complete termination of the duties from the party.",

The extent of any such release will be subject to review and determination by a mutually agreed-upon arbitrator.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the termination of the agreement shall *not* release either party from liability for breaches prior to the closing dates. The changed text introduces uncertainty by stating that the termination shall *not necessarily* release them, and that the extent of the release is subject to arbitration. This contradicts the original 'shall not release' statement and adds uncertainty about the definition of obligation release.",

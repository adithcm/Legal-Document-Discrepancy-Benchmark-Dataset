(\"Cisco\"), grants to Customer a nonexclusive and nontransferable license to use for Customer's internal business purposes the Software and the Documentation for which Customer has paid the required license fees. \"Documentation\" means written information (whether contained in user or technical manuals, training materials, specifications or otherwise) regarding the Software and made available by Cisco in any manner (including on CD-Rom, or on-line).",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cisco reserves the right to revoke or modify this license at any time, at its sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to the Customer.",
                "explanation": "The original license grant is presented as a defined right subject to payment. The added sentence introduces uncertainty by allowing Cisco to revoke or modify the license at any time, contradicting the implication of a stable, paid-for license. This could lead to disputes over the scope and duration of the license.",

Customer may terminate this Agreement and the license at any time by destroying all copies of Software including any Documentation.

Customer may terminate this Agreement and the license at any time by destroying all copies of Software including any Documentation. Customer's rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Cisco if Customer fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, Customer shall destroy all copies of Software and Documentation in its possession or control.  Notwithstanding the above, Cisco may terminate this agreement for any reason or no reason, with 30 days written notice to Customer. In the event of such termination by Cisco, Customer shall be entitled to a pro-rata refund of any pre-paid license fees.",
                "explanation": "The original section states specific reasons for termination, primarily customer non-compliance or customer-initiated termination. The added sentence allows Cisco to terminate 'for any reason or no reason,' contradicting the implication that termination is limited to specific circumstances. While it introduces a refund for the customer it still creates uncertainty about the stability of the agreement and could give Cisco undue leverage. The initial part of this section states that Customer has the ability to terminate the agreement anytime, contradicting the ability to the Cisco to end the agreement. This conflict can cause confusion and create a potential dispute.",

However, Cisco provides no guarantee that the software is without errors and the customer accepts the software as is with all faults. This contradicts the warranty of substantial conformity to published specifications.",
                "explanation": "The original warranty provides a limited guarantee that the software will substantially conform to specifications. The added sentence negates that warranty by stating that the software is accepted 'as is with all faults,' directly contradicting the preceding statement. This would make it unclear what, if any, warranty actually applies, increasing the customer's risk and potentially leading to disputes about the warranty's validity.",

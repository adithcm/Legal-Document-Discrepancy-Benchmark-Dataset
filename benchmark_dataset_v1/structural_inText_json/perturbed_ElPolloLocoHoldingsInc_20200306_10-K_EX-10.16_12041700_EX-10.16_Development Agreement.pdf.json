The rights granted Developer in this Agreement are subject to any prior territorial rights of other franchisees which may now exist in the Territory, whether or not those rights are currently being enforced. In the event of a conflict in territorial rights, whether under a Franchise Agreement or separate territorial or development agreement, Developer shall be free to negotiate with any person, corporation or other entity, which claims territorial rights adverse to the rights granted under this Agreement, for the assignment of those prior territorial rights. For this purpose, Franchisor agrees to approve any such assignment not in conflict with the other terms of this Agreement, subject to the condition of any Franchise Agreements involved, and current policies pertaining to assignments, including, but not limited to, satisfaction of all past due debts owed to Franchisor and the execution of a General Release.",

In the event of a conflict in territorial rights, whether under a Franchise Agreement or separate territorial or development agreement, Developer may not be free to negotiate without the franchisor's consent. For this purpose, Franchisor may decline assignment approval if there are conflicts with the terms of this agreement.",

Confidential Information shall mean, subject to the provisions of\nSection 9.2  [Exclusions], all proprietary and confidential information of a Party, including,\nwithout limitation, trade secrets, technical information, business information,\nsales information, customer and potential customer lists and identities, product\nsales plans, sublicense agreements, inventions, developments, discoveries,\nsoftware, know-how, methods, techniques, formulae, data, processes and other\nproprietary ideas, whether or not protectable under patent, trademark, copyright\nor other areas of law, that the other Party has access to or receives. For\npurposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be considered Confidential\nInformation.",
                "changed_text": "1.4.  Confidential Information shall mean all information a party may share with another party, regardless of whether it is explicitly marked as confidential or not. This includes, but is not limited to, business strategies, customer data, marketing plans, and financial information. This definition applies unless both parties mutually agree in writing to exclude specific information from this definition. For purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be considered Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' was qualified by Section 9.2 [Exclusions], allowing certain types of information to be excluded. The modified version removes this qualification and broadens the definition to include almost all information shared, creating a contradiction with Section 9.2 if it remains unchanged. This introduces uncertainty about what is truly confidential and complicates enforcement of confidentiality obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text guarantees a minimum revenue amount for LeadersOnline. The modified text explicitly states that VerticalNet does not guarantee any minimum revenue.

To exercise this option, LeadersOnline must notify VerticalNet in writing of its election no later than 90 days prior to the expiration of the then-current Term. VerticalNet's approval is not required for any Renewal Term. Unless LeadersOnline notifies VerticalNet of its intention to terminate the Agreement in writing no later than 30 days prior to the expiration of the then-current Term, the Agreement shall automatically renew for an additional 12 months.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stated that LeadersOnline's option to renew was subject to VerticalNet's sole and absolute discretion. The modified clause removes VerticalNet's approval requirement and institutes automatic renewals unless LeadersOnline provides notice of termination. This is a direct contradiction, as the original text gives VerticalNet complete control over renewal, while the modified text shifts control to LeadersOnline with an automatic renewal mechanism. The conflicting language generates confusion about renewal terms.",

PAYMENT OF TRANSPORTATION CHARGES:\nSubject to any provisions to the contrary in a TSA between Carrier and Shipper:\n\n\nA.\tShipper or Consignee shall pay, as provided below, all applicable transportation and other charges (including any deficiency payments\nset out in a TSA) accruing on Products handled by Carrier.\n\n\nB.\tAll payments are due on the later of: (1) within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice; (2) the twenty-seventh (27th) of the month\nfollowing receipt of the invoice, or; (3) if the twenty-seventh (27th) of the month following receipt of the invoice is not a Business Day,\non the next Business Day thereafter.",

PAYMENT OF TRANSPORTATION CHARGES:\nSubject to any provisions to the contrary in a TSA between Carrier and Shipper:\n\n\nA.\tShipper or Consignee shall pay, as provided below, all applicable transportation and other charges (including any deficiency payments\nset out in a TSA) accruing on Products handled by Carrier.\n\n\nB.\tAll payments are due at the sole discretion of the Carrier. The Carrier will determine the payment schedule on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies the due date of payments, creating a clear obligation. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating that payments are due at the sole discretion of the Carrier, which contradicts the prior clarity and creates uncertainty regarding when payment is actually expected. This could allow Carrier to demand immediate payment, even if this contradicts general industry standards.",

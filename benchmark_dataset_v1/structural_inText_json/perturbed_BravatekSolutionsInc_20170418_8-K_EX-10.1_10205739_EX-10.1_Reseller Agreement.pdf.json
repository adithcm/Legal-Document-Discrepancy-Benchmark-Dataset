                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Contract is renewable for 1 year extension by amendment to this agreement. Either Party may terminate this agreement for non-cause with a sixty (60) written notice.",
                "changed_text": "Contract is renewable at the sole discretion of the Company. The Reseller's performance will be the sole determining factor, which is not subject to review. Either Party may terminate this agreement; however, the Company may terminate the agreement at any time without notice if the Reseller's performance is deemed unsatisfactory.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a contract renewal requires an amendment, implying mutual agreement. The modification makes renewal solely at the Company's discretion, removing the Reseller's right to agree. This contradicts the initial statement. Additionally, the original text requires 60 days written notice, and the modified text allows the Company to terminate without notice if performance is deemed unsatisfactory.",

During the Term hereof and for a period of six (6) months following the termination of this Agreement or the discontinuation of any of the Company Products, (i) the Reseller shall have the exclusive right to commission for any Registered Referrals, (ii) the Company shall not market, promote, sell, or distribute Company Products or solicit or procure orders for the Company Products, or for any product(s) or service(s) similar to the Company Products, in the Territory other than through the Reseller and pursuant to this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the Reseller, and (iii) without limitation to the foregoing, the Company shall not, directly or through other parties (whether agents, representatives, intermediaries, resellers or other parties), market, promote, sell, distribute, solicit or procure orders to any existing or prospective customer of the Reseller.",
                "changed_text": "5. Exclusivity on Registered Referrals and Opportunities. During the Term hereof, the Reseller may have the right to commission for any Registered Referrals, as determined by the Company. The Company may market, promote, sell, or distribute Company Products or solicit or procure orders for the Company Products, or for any product(s) or service(s) similar to the Company Products, in the Territory directly or through other parties. The Company is not restricted from marketing, promoting, selling, distributing, soliciting or procuring orders to any existing or prospective customer of the Reseller.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants the Reseller exclusive rights to commissions on Registered Referrals and restricts the Company from directly competing in the Territory. The modification removes the Reseller's guarantee of commissions, making it discretionary. It also removes the Company's restriction, allowing them to compete directly, thus directly contradicting the initial exclusivity clause.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear timeline for Referral Fee payments (30 days after collection). The changed text introduces uncertainty by stating that the payments are at the Company's discretion and that the payment timeline is not guaranteed, directly contradicting the original text.",

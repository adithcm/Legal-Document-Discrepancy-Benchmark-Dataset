Upon the expiration of the Term, the Term shall automatically extend for successive 12-month periods until one Party terminates the Agreement by providing at least 180 days prior written notice to the other Party prior to the expiration of the then-current term or unless sooner terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Term”), unless the Agreement is sooner terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the expiration of the Term, the Term shall automatically extend for successive 12-month periods. There will be no prior written notice to the other Party prior to the expiration of the then-current term, and there are no conditions of termination except in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that the contract auto-renews unless one party terminates the agreement by providing at least 180 days prior written notice to the other party. The modified text removes this condition by stating that there will be no prior written notice to the other Party, and there are no conditions of termination. This creates an in-text contradiction and uncertainty in enforcement, as it implies automatic renewal without the possibility of termination through prior written notice.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly stated that the representation and warranties survive delivery, inspection and payment and shall run in favor of Liquidmetal and its Affiliates, and their respective successors, assigns and customers, both direct and indirect. The modified version negates survival and the representation is only in favor of Liquidmetal. By stating \"will not survive delivery, inspection and payment and shall run only in favor of Liquidmetal\" this creates uncertainty about warranty applicability to Liquidmetal's affiliates and customers, contradicting the initial statement.",

                "changed_text": "Kiromic may consider sharing patents and know-how in relation to the following products, but the decision to license to the JV, and the extent of such license, will be determined on a case-by-case basis at Kiromic's sole discretion, taking into account various factors including but not limited to market conditions, competitive landscape, and internal resource availability.

                "explanation": "The original text stated a firm commitment to sharing specific patents and know-how. The modified text introduces ambiguity by making the sharing and licensing conditional and discretionary, thus contradicting the original firm commitment.",

                "changed_text": "While Kiromic Biopharma generally retains economic rights, the specifics regarding the allocation of royalties, particularly for the Ovarian Cancer research results in Italy and Europe, are subject to further negotiation and agreement between the parties. Any potential royalty grants to Molipharma will be contingent upon Molipharma's continued satisfactory performance and adherence to the terms of this agreement. The specific percentages and conditions associated with such royalties shall be documented in a separate addendum to this agreement, if and when such an addendum is mutually agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly assigns all economic rights to Kiromic while specifying certain royalty grants to Molipharma. The modified version creates conflict by stating that the allocation of royalties is subject to further negotiation and Molipharma's performance, contradicting the initial clear royalty grants.",

                "changed_text": "While the initial intention is to jointly own the Intellectual Property Rights related to the JV results, Kiromic retains the sole discretion to determine the allocation of these rights. Molipharma's share will be determined based on Kiromic's assessment of their overall contribution. Kiromic will provide a written evaluation within six months of each project milestone, outlining the proposed IP ownership split. This evaluation will be final and binding.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines a clear 50/50 split in IP rights. The modified text contradicts this by giving Kiromic the sole discretion in determining the IP ownership split, effectively nullifying Molipharma's initially agreed-upon right to 50% ownership and creating uncertainty.",

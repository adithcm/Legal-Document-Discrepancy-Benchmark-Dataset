Refunds for previously paid amounts, if any, will be determined at the sole discretion of the Supplier.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Bank of America 'shall receive a refund' if the price increases.

The added sentence gives the Supplier leeway to deviate from those specifications, creating a contradiction. It is now uncertain whether the supplier must adhere to specifications or not.",

By adding that the supplier is not obligated to deliver under unforeseen circumstances, the modified text creates a conflict. This weakens Bank of America's expectations of delivery and creates an in-text contradiction to whether customizations will occur at all.",

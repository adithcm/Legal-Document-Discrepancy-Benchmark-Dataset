                "explanation": "By removing \"and (iii) the Recipe\" from the definition of Reed's Intellectual Property, it contradicts Section 6(a)(i) which states that Reed's will exclusively own all Deliverables, which includes Recipes. This introduces uncertainty about the ownership of the Recipes developed under the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing the ownership of deliverables from \"Reed's will exclusively own\" to \"Reed's and Company will jointly own\" in Section 6(a)(i) directly contradicts the subsequent sentences which state that Company irrevocably assigns *all* rights to Reed's. This also leads to a contradiction with Section 6(a)(ii) since it states that Company shall not acquire any rights to the Deliverables, which is untrue under joint ownership. Furthermore, this undermines the purpose of Reed's receiving the Work Product.",

This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties and their heirs, personal representatives, successors, and assigns.",
                "explanation": "By stating that 'Company may freely assign or transfer its rights', it removes the protective measure that Reed's has in controlling who the Company can hand off its obligations. The original text states that Reed's approval 'shall not be unreasonably withheld', providing some power to Reed's. The removal of this creates uncertainty in regards to the continuation of the Manufacturing and Distribution Agreement since the relationship is dependent on both parties' approval.",

                "original_text": "A.  Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement on the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof.",
                "changed_text": "A.  Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement on the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof. However, the Franchisor may, at its sole discretion, waive any payment obligation of the Master Franchisee without notice to or consent from the Guarantors.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause which mandated payment by the guarantor by now allowing the franchisor to waive the payment at their discretion. It undermines the entire guarantee agreement.",

Franchisor shall not be obligated to proceed against Master Franchisee or exhaust any security from Master Franchisee or pursue or exhaust any remedy, including any legal or equitable relief against Master Franchisee, before proceeding to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee, and the enforcement of such obligations may take place before, after, or contemporaneously with, enforcement of any debt or obligation of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "D. Franchisor shall be obligated to first proceed against Master Franchisee and exhaust all available security from Master Franchisee and all available remedies, including legal and equitable relief, before seeking to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee. The Franchisor must provide documented proof of all efforts to collect from the Master Franchisee, and failure to do so invalidates the Guarantee.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original provision that allows the Franchisor to pursue the Guarantors without first exhausting remedies against the Master Franchisee. Now, the Franchisor is required to exhaust all other options before pursuing the Guarantors and provide documentation, creating uncertainty about when the guarantee can be enforced.",

Without affecting the Guarantorsâ€™ obligations under this Guarantee, Franchisor, without notice to the Guarantors, may extend, modify, or release any indebtedness or obligation of Master Franchisee, or settle, adjust, or compromise any claims against Master Franchisee. Guarantors waive notice of amendment of the Master Franchise Agreement and notice of demand for payment or performance by Master Franchisee.",
                "changed_text": "E. Any extension, modification, or release of any indebtedness or obligation of Master Franchisee, or any settlement, adjustment, or compromise of any claims against Master Franchisee requires prior written consent from the Guarantors. Failure to obtain such consent will release the Guarantors from their obligations under this Guarantee. Guarantors must be notified of any amendment of the Master Franchise Agreement and of any demand for payment or performance by Master Franchisee, no less than thirty (30) days prior to such action being taken.",
                "explanation": "This directly contradicts the original clause by now requiring consent from the Guarantors for any modifications to the Master Franchisee's obligations and requiring advance notice. This significantly alters the Guarantors' obligations and introduces ambiguity about the Franchisor's ability to manage the agreement without the Guarantors' explicit consent. It makes the franchisor's right to act 'without affecting the Guarantors' obligations' uncertain.",

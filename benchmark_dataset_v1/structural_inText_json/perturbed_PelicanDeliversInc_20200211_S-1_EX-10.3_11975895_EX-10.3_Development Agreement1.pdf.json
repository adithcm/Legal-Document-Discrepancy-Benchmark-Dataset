The remaining payments are to be determined based on project progress and mutual agreement between Client and Developer. Specific payment amounts and dates for subsequent milestones will be documented in separate addenda to this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed payment schedule for each milestone. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating that the remaining payments are 'to be determined,' contradicting the initial fixed schedule. This creates uncertainty regarding when and how the developer will be paid for milestones #1 through #4. This contradicts the set payment schedule in the earlier part of the same section.",

                "explanation": "The original text indicated that the users' payment should be made via linking their bank accounts via Evergreen Gateway. The changed text indicates that the user will now have an option to pay with cash, which contradicts the opening sentence in the section. This introduces an element of uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly stated that 'Only one dispensary per zip code will be allowed', which created an expectation that such conditions would be adhered to at all times. The modified version introduces an exception, allowing multiple dispensaries per zip code if Pelican Delivers decides that there is a 'high demand'. This contradicts the previously stated exclusivity and makes enforcement of the single-dispensary rule unclear, as it depends on Pelican Delivers' subjective assessment of 'high demand'.",

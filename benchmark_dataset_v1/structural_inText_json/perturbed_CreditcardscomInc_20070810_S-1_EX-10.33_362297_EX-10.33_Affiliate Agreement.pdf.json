                "original_text": "For purposes of determining Affiliate’s Commission, an “Approved Account” means any Chase credit card application that is: (i) submitted by any user who clicks on an e-mail, banner or any other advertising material from Affiliate’s Website; (ii) is approved by Chase; and (iii) is reported as approved by Chase to Affiliate.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes of determining Affiliate’s Commission, an “Approved Account” may mean any Chase credit card application. Chase has the sole discretion to consider an application as an 'Approved Account'. The criteria include (i) submission by a user through Affiliate’s advertising material, (ii) approval by Chase, and (iii) reporting by Chase. However, Chase is not obligated to report all approvals to the Affiliate.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Approved Account' with specific criteria that must be met. The revised text introduces uncertainty by stating 'may mean' and granting Chase 'sole discretion,' contradicting the original mandatory conditions. Chase is not obligated to report all approvals to the Affiliate.",

Either Affiliate or Chase may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other party written or e-mail notice of termination. At the time of termination, any links to Chase’s Website must be removed immediately. Affiliate will continue to receive Commission payments for all Approved Accounts placed during the term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Chase may terminate this Agreement if Affiliate does not comply with the terms and conditions herein.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement will commence on the date that the Affiliate Registration Form is approved by Chase and will end at Chase's discretion. Chase may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, without any notice to Affiliate. Affiliate may terminate with written or e-mail notice. At the time of termination, Chase may choose to keep the links on the Affiliate website for a period determined by Chase. Commission payments for Approved Accounts will only be paid until the termination date if Chase deems it appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows termination by either party with notice, and guarantees commission payments for accounts placed during the term. The revised text gives Chase the exclusive right to end the agreement and keep links active with no payments, contradicting the affiliate's termination rights and payment guarantees.",

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the amount of Commissions, the definition of Approved Accounts, and all other provisions of this Agreement are subject to change without notice other than posting such information on the Chase Website. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO AFFILIATE, THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT.

The amount of Commissions, the definition of Approved Accounts, and all other provisions of this Agreement are not subject to any specific method of change. If any aspect is unacceptable to the Affiliate, there is no explicit recourse. Affiliate’s continued participation in the Affiliate Program will be seen as acceptance. Chase's decision is final and not subject to debate.",
                "explanation": "The original text specified the method of modification (posting on the website) and provided the affiliate with recourse (termination). The revised text removes any obligation for Chase to provide notice, and eliminates the affiliate’s recourse. In addition, removes clarity around whether the document is up for debate by stating \"Chase's decision is final and not subject to debate.\"",

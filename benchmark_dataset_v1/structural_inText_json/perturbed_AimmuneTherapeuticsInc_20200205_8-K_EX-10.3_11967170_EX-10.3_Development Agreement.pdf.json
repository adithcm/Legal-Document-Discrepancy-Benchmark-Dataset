Without limiting the foregoing, Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires, with respect to such obligations, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such obligation to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) set objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",

Either Party may, without prejudice to any other remedies available to it at law or in equity, terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party in the event that the other Party (the “Breaching Party”) shall have materially breached or defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations. The Breaching Party shall have sixty (60) days (thirty (30) days in the event of non-payment) after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default. Unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment), such termination shall become effective upon receipt of the written notice of termination by the Breaching Party to be given within ten (10) days of the end of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Aimmune as the Breaching Party has materially breached or defaulted in the performance of any of its payment obligations under this Agreement a third time or more in any three (3) year period, then Xencor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately by providing written notice Aimmune, without Aimmune having opportunity to cure such breach or default.",

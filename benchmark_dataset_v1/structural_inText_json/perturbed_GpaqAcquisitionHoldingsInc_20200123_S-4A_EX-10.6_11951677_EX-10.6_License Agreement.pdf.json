                "explanation": "The original text clearly defined control as requiring 50% ownership or power to direct management. The modification introduces uncertainty by changing \"control\" means to \"control\" *may* mean, making the threshold for affiliate status ambiguous and unenforceable. This could lead to disputes about which entities are actually considered affiliates.",

                "explanation": "The original text guaranteed a minimum 5-year term for exploiting HOFV works after termination. By changing \"shall be a minimum of five (5) years\" to \"may not be a minimum of five (5) years\", the duration of post-termination rights becomes uncertain. This weakens the Village Media Company's rights and creates a conflict.",

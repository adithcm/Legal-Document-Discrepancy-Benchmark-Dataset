                "changed_text": "This term of this Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereto shall commence as of the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of one (1) year (the “Term”), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions contained herein.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement states that the term of the agreement continues 'in perpetuity'. The modified agreement changes this to a term of one year. This creates a contradiction, as the contract both specifies the term is indefinite and that the term is only one year. This creates uncertainty about the actual duration of the contract and when it may be renewed.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement states that liability is limited to the payments made in the 12 months prior to the claim. The modified agreement states that it is limited to $100,000,000,000. This contradiction creates confusion over what the actual limitation of liability is, impacting risk assessment.",

                "changed_text": "CHT shall not pay any taxes. Ehave will cover all the tax liability.",
                "explanation": "The original text assigns the responsibility for applicable taxes to CHT. The modified text directly contradicts this by stating that CHT is not responsible for any taxes, and Ehave will cover the tax liability. This creates a direct conflict on who is responsible for tax payments.",

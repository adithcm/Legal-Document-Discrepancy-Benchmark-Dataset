                "original_text": "1.21 “Products” means the ENERGOUS products set forth in Exhibit A, as such Exhibit may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement between the parties, that have been released by ENERGOUS to production, including all Product Updates, which will be deemed to have been added to Exhibit A automatically, without any further action required by the parties, immediately following the release to production date.",
                "changed_text": "1.21 “Products” means the ENERGOUS products set forth in Exhibit A, as such Exhibit may be amended from time to time at ENERGOUS's sole discretion, that have been released by ENERGOUS to production, including all Product Updates, which may, at ENERGOUS's discretion, be added to Exhibit A, with reasonable notice provided to the parties following the release to production date.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that Product Updates are automatically added to Exhibit A, creating a clear expectation. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating that Exhibit A can be amended at ENERGOUS's discretion and that Product Updates may be added, effectively negating the automatic inclusion and creating uncertainty regarding which updates are covered.",

                "changed_text": "11.2 Product Warranty.\n\n(a) ENERGOUS may provide warranties that (i) when manufactured in accordance with the Approved Production Specifications, and as potentially implemented in a suitable circuit application in accordance with the Product Specifications, the Products and Product Die might conform to the Product Specifications and may be free from some defects that could have been avoided in their design; (ii) the Products, any constituent parts or functionality thereof, the Documentation and the Deposit Materials might not infringe any third party’s Intellectual Property Rights; (iii) it possibly did not misappropriate any third party’s trade secrets in the potential development of the Products, any constituent parts or functionality thereof, the Documentation or the Deposit Materials; and (iv) when delivered (including potentially some software updates if any), no Product may contain all viruses, “Trojan horses” or other harmful code. The above warranties might be valid at ENERGOUS's sole discretion for a period of potentially some time from the date of shipment of any Licensed Product to any customer.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states ENERGOUS warrants certain aspects of the product. By introducing terms like 'may,' 'might,' 'possibly,' and 'potentially,' the modified version weakens the warranty, making it non-committal and creating uncertainty about the actual protection offered. This shift from a definitive warranty to a possible one creates a significant contradiction. Also adds ENERGOUS sole discretion.",

                "explanation": "The original states that the contract continues in effect, unless terminated and renews automatically, unless there is a notice of non-renewal. The modified version uses terms like potentially and possibly to create uncertainty as to whether the contract continues or not and what needs to happen in order for renewal to occur.",

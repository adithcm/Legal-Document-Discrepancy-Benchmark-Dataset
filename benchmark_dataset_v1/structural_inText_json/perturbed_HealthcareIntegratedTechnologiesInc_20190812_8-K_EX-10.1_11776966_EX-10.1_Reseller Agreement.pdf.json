In connection with the foregoing appointment, Supplier hereby grants Reseller a non-transferable, revocable, limited right to resell, market, promote, stimulate interest in, and solicit Orders by Customers and/or End Users in the Territory for the Products and to provide services in connection with those activities.",

In connection with the foregoing appointment, Supplier hereby grants Reseller an exclusive, irrevocable, unlimited right to resell, market, promote, stimulate interest in, and solicit Orders by Customers and/or End Users in the Territory for the Products and to provide services in connection with those activities.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants a 'non-transferable, revocable, limited right' to the reseller. The modified text directly contradicts this by granting an 'exclusive, irrevocable, unlimited right', creating a fundamental conflict regarding the scope and nature of the reseller's rights. This makes the contract ambiguous, as it's unclear whether the reseller has exclusive or non-exclusive rights, and whether the rights are revocable or irrevocable.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows termination after the initial term with a 3-month notice. The altered clause removes the ability to terminate the agreement after the initial term, creating a contradiction. It is unclear whether the agreement can be terminated.",

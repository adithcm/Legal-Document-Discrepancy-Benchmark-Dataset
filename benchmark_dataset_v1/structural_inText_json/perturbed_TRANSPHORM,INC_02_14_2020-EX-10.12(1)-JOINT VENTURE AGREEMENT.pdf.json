The Parties further agree that they shall not use, nor permit their respective Affiliates to use, any Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever except in the manner expressly provided or contemplated in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the treatment of any Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to the Amended Process Development Agreement shall be governed solely by the Amended Process Development Agreement.\n11.4.2 Each of the Parties agrees to take, and to cause its respective Affiliates and the Company to take, reasonably adequate security and precautionary measures to effect compliance with this Section 11.4 by directors, officers, employees and agents of each of the Parties, their respective Affiliates and the Company who are given access to Confidential Information.\n11.4.3 Each of the Parties hereby acknowledges that the Disclosing Party would be irreparably harmed by a breach of this Section 11.4 and it would not be possible to estimate damages resulting from such a breach.

                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict confidentiality. The modified version contradicts this by stating that confidentiality is at the Disclosing Party's sole discretion and that disclosure is permitted without restriction. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of confidentiality provisions.",

At TPH’s sole option, TPH or TPH-A may purchase the GaN Equipment by completion of payment of the purchase price or depreciation cost for such equipment as set forth in Appendix 2.

During the term if this Agreement, the GaN Equipment shall be used exclusively in GaN wafer processing, and shall not be used in the silicon wafer processing for AFSL’s or FSL’s current products.

                "explanation": "The original text states TPH/TPH-A is responsible for GaN equipment costs and can purchase them, gaining sole ownership. The modified version shifts responsibility to AFSL/FSL, allowing them to purchase the equipment without payment and sharing the ownership among all of the parties. This creates a contradiction and uncertainty about who bears the equipment costs and who owns the equipment and how it can be used.",

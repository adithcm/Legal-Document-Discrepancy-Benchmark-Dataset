                "changed_text": "1.1.42 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means with respect to the performance of activities under this Agreement by a Party (as pertains to its role in conducting the Clinical Trials): efforts deemed reasonable by the Party itself. The Party has sole discretion in determining what constitutes “Commercially Reasonable Efforts”. For example, a Party may, but is not required to: (i) assign responsibility for such task or activity to specific employee(s); (ii) set specific and meaningful objectives for carrying out such task or activity; and (iii) allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives in accordance with established timelines.",

The modified text directly contradicts this by stating the Party has sole discretion and the specific actions are not required, effectively negating the original definition and creating uncertainty.",

In connection with any Japanese or Chinese PK Study during the Development Term, (i) SFJ will have sole responsibility for interactions with Regulatory Authorities in Japan and China, with PB to have Participation Rights, and (ii) PB, as the sponsor of the US IND for the Product, will have primary formal responsibility for interactions with the FDA regarding any PK Study conducted in Japanese Subjects or Chinese Subjects (as applicable) in the US, with SFJ to have Participation Rights, but, as between PB and SFJ (but not vis-à-vis the FDA), SFJ shall, in consultation with PB, determine the strategy for such interactions, and, except to the extent contrary to Applicable Law or in violation of PB’s duties as the sponsor of such US IND, PB’s interactions with the FDA shall at all times be consistent with SFJ’s strategy. Thereafter, if the Phase 3 Trial meets the Phase 3 Trial Success Criteria and the necessary endpoints are met in the other Clinical Trials in the SFJ Territory, SFJ will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to perform all activities associated with submitting BLAs and seeking Regulatory Approval for the Indication in Japan and China, and PB will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to perform all activities associated with seeking Approval for the Indication in the Designated European Countries.

Within [***] after assignment of such Product Filings in the applicable country, SFJ shall deliver to PB: (a) true, correct and complete copies of all Product Filings in such country (in each case, whether held in the name of SFJ or any of its Affiliates), and disclose to PB in writing all previously-undisclosed Research Results within the Trial Data Package; (b) formally transfer or assign, or cause to be formally transferred or assigned, into the name of PB or its designee all Product Filings in such country (in each case, whether held in the name of SFJ or any of its Affiliates); and (c) take such other actions and execute such other instruments, assignments and documents as may be necessary to effect, evidence, register and record the transfer, assignment or other conveyance of such rights to PB or its designee.",

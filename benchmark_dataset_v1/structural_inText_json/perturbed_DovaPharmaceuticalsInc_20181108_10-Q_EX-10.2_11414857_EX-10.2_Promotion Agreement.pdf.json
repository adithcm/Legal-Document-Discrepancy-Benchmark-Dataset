It introduces uncertainty as to whether Dova actually possesses the rights it is granting to Valeant and whether those rights are encumbered by pre-existing agreements.",

The modified text changes this to 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain at least one hundred (100) Sales Representatives', weakening the obligation. This creates uncertainty because it is now unclear what actions constitute 'commercially reasonable efforts' and whether failing to meet the 100 representative target due to circumstances beyond Valeant's direct control constitutes a breach.",

The modification changes this to 'Valeant may assign' such rights, making the assignment discretionary and contradicting the first half of the original sentence that made it mandatory for inventions that are created in performing its activities primarily related to the product. Additionally, the original text states that all inventions 'shall constitute Confidential Information of Dova', which is then contradicted by the modification 'may or may not constitute Confidential Information of Dova'. This introduces ambiguity as to the ownership and confidentiality of Inventions created by Valeant during the term, creating uncertainty about intellectual property rights.",

                "original_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately without notice should the other Party fail to cure, within [***] after receipt of written notice thereof, any material breach of its obligations or duties hereunder, provided, however that in the event of a material breach that cannot be cured within [***], a Party shall not be deemed in default if it commences curing such default within the [***] period, notifies the other Party of that commencement by e-mail, and thereafter cures such default within [***] of the original written notice thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately without notice, regardless of whether the other Party has materially breached its obligations or duties. The breaching party is not entitled to a cure period.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause, which allows for a cure period for material breaches before termination. The modified clause removes the cure period and allows for immediate termination for any breach, no matter how minor or easily rectified.",

At Premier’s option, Premier can direct Heritage to, and upon such direction Heritage shall, conduct such Recall Action (and Heritage shall ensure Jasper’s cooperation). Premier shall determine, in its sole discretion, the manner, text and timing of any publicity to be given such matters upon prior consultation with Heritage.",

Heritage shall determine, in its sole discretion, the manner, text and timing of any publicity to be given such matters without prior consultation with Premier.",
                "explanation": "This change gives Heritage, rather than Premier, the sole authority over recall actions, and removes the requirement for prior consultation with Premier. This contradicts the original clause, which gave Premier this authority and included a consultation requirement. It creates uncertainty as to who controls recalls.",

The first venue mentioned had been agreed upon. Now, depending on Heritage's decision, that venue may need to change which gives conflict to the article.",

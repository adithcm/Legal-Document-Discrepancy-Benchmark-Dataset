                "changed_text": "Party B shall endeavor to follow instructions of Party A to the best of their ability. Party B is not responsible to ensure all plans and designs of the project to meet relevant construction laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "Article IX initially states that Party B 'shall follow all instructions' of Party A and 'ensure' compliance with construction laws. The modified version weakens this obligation by stating Party B is not responsible to ensure all plans and designs of the project to meet relevant construction laws and regulations. This weakens the legal responsibility of Party B and introduces a contradiction regarding the level of compliance Party B is legally bound to uphold.",

                "original_text": "In case the Contract cannot be performed due to any reason other than the architect herein, the client agrees the fees paid will not be refunded. In case the Contract cannot be performed due to the architect herein, the architect shall refund the fees paid in full without taking any interest to the client.",
                "changed_text": "In the event the contract is terminated, the client may or may not receive a refund based on the decision of Party A. In case the Contract cannot be performed due to the architect herein, the architect may refund a portion of the fees, based on negotiations with the client.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear rule that fees are non-refundable if termination isn't due to the architect's fault but are fully refundable if it is. The modified version introduces uncertainty by giving Party A the discretion to decide on refunds, creating a direct contradiction. For termination due to the architect, the amount to be refunding becomes negotiable.",

                "changed_text": "Party B is encouraged to report the latest progress and completed content to Party A, as time and resources permit.",
                "explanation": "This changes a requirement to an option, contradicting the original clear directive. Changing 'obligatory' to 'encouraged' significantly weakens Party B's duty to keep Party A informed, potentially leading to disputes over the flow of information and project oversight.",

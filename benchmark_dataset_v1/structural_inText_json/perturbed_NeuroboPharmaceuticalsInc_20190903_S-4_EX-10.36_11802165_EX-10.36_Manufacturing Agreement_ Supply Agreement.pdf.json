                "explanation": "Original text specifies that Dong-A *shall* supply and NeuroBo *shall* purchase the entire requirement. The modified version changes this to Dong-A using 'commercially reasonable efforts' (weakening the obligation) and NeuroBo purchasing 'a portion' (removing the requirement to purchase the entire amount). It also introduces 'preliminary specifications' which is undefined, contradicting the reference to Exhibit A, and creating uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text had specific requirements on ordering, including the quantity and obligation to order in specific tablet amounts.

It introduces 'Draft Order', and says it may be revised by either party at any time, contradicting the original Firm Order. The last sentence changes it to attempt to deliver without guaranteed terms.",

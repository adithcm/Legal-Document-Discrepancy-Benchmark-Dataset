                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (“MAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall endeavor to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (“MAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV of [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, is at the sole discretion of Premier, irrespective of commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility or any prior approval by Premier.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states Premier *shall be required* to purchase a minimum annual order volume. The modified text changes 'shall be required' to 'shall endeavor' introducing ambiguity. Further, it adds that the MAOV is at the 'sole discretion of Premier,' effectively negating the previous requirement and the contingency related to Heritage's facility and approval, creating a contradiction about the commitment to purchase.",

                "explanation": "This change adds 'unless otherwise determined by Premier', which grants Premier unilateral power to disregard any term, condition, or covenant in the original agreement. This directly contradicts the original clause stating everything stays 'in full force', as now Premier can selectively ignore parts of the original agreement, generating uncertainty about contractual obligations.",

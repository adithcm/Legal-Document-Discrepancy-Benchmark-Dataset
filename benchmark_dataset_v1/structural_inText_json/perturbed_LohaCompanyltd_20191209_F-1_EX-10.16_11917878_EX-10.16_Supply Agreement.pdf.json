Not stated in order content will be subject to the provisions of agreement. Any modification, supplementary, give up can be done verbally between the buyer and the seller. Verbal agreements are considered valid, regardless of whether they are documented in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original clause 1.2 requires any modification, supplementary information, or relinquishment to be written and signed by authorized representatives to be valid. The revised version contradicts this by stating that verbal agreements are considered valid, regardless of written documentation. This creates uncertainty because it's unclear whether a verbal agreement is sufficient to modify the contract.",

The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party can unilaterally cancel the order with no penalty.",
                "explanation": "The original clause 2.2 stated that once an order is accepted by the seller, neither party can unilaterally cancel the order before both parties agree. The modified clause states that any party can unilaterally cancel the order with no penalty, directly contradicting the prior statement.

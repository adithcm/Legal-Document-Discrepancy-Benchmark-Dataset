This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for additional extended terms each of two (2) years duration unless either party notifies the other in writing of its intention not to renew the Agreement, such notification to be provided at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the then in-effect term. The initial two (2) year term as it might be extended herein is referred to herein as the \"Term.\"",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement and the provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided, shall be in full force and effect commencing on the date of execution by both Parties and shall extend for an initial term of two (2) years.  Renewal of this agreement is subject to ongoing negotiations and mutual agreement by both parties, regardless of prior terms. The initial two (2) year term as it might be extended herein is referred to herein as the \"Term.\"",
                "explanation": "The original text specified automatic renewal unless a party provides written notice of non-renewal. The modified text introduces a contradiction by stating that renewal is subject to 'ongoing negotiations and mutual agreement,' negating the automatic renewal provision. This creates uncertainty as to whether the contract automatically renews or requires explicit renegotiation, creating enforcement issues.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that Content Provider needs prior written consent, then provides an exception for specific changes. The changed text removes the 'subject to the terms and conditions...' clause and replaces it with 'CONTENT PROVIDER retains sole discretion to modify the Content as deemed necessary to maintain its quality and relevance' creating an internal contradiction: Does Content Provider need consent, or have sole discretion? This uncertainty could lead to disputes over content alterations.",

The modified version adds 'However, Company retains the right to pursue litigation in any court of its choosing, waiving the arbitration clause for itself but not the Content Provider,' creating a contradiction. This introduces asymmetry, where the Company can litigate but the Content Provider is bound to arbitration, causing uncertainty and potential legal challenges based on fairness.",

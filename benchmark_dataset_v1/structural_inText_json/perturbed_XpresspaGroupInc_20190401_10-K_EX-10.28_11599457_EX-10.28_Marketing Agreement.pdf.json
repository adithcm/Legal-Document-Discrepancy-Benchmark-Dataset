Following the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew\nfor successive terms of six (6) months (each a “Renewal Term”, and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”) unless written notice is given by\neither Party no later than thirty (30) days in advance of the expiration of the Initial Term or the applicable Renewal Term.",

Unless this Agreement is terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of Section ​12, the term of this Agreement shall commence\non the Effective Date and shall continue until July 31, 2019 (the “Initial Term”). Following the Initial Term, this Agreement may be renewed for successive terms of six (6) months (each a “Renewal Term”, and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”) upon mutual written agreement of both parties. Either Party may propose renewal terms no later than thirty (30) days in advance of the expiration of the Initial Term or the applicable Renewal Term.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies **automatic renewal** unless either party provides a written notice of non-renewal. The modified text changes the clause to state that renewal occurs **only upon mutual written agreement**. This contradicts the automatic renewal aspect of the original clause, creating uncertainty on whether the agreement renews automatically or requires active consent from both parties.",

The commission paid to XSPA employees shall be determined at the sole discretion of XSPA, without any limitations on the percentage of the Retail Price.",

The modification introduces an exception: this damage limitation shall not apply in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                "original_text": "2.1 Term of Agreement Except as otherwise provided herein, the term of this Agreement is three (3) years from the Execution Date (“Cooperation Period”). The Parties may negotiate for an extension of this Agreement six (6) months before the expiration of the Cooperation Period.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Term of Agreement The term of this Agreement is three (3) years from the Execution Date (“Cooperation Period”). The Parties may negotiate for an extension of this Agreement six (6) months before the expiration of the Cooperation Period. This agreement shall automatically extend for an additional three (3) year period unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 90 days prior to the end of the initial term.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the parties 'may negotiate' for an extension, implying that an extension requires mutual agreement. The modified text introduces an automatic renewal clause unless a party actively terminates the agreement, creating a contradiction about how the agreement's term is extended. This introduces uncertainty as to whether negotiation is required, or if it auto-renews.",

However, Tsinghua Unigroup may assign its rights and obligations under this agreement to any of its affiliates without prior consent.",
                "explanation": "The original text prohibits assignment without prior written consent from the other party. The modified version allows Tsinghua Unigroup to assign its rights and obligations to its affiliates without consent. This contradicts the original provision and creates uncertainty about the assignment restrictions, especially regarding Tsinghua Unigroup's rights.",

The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (“Dispute Notice”) to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators.",

The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (“Dispute Notice”) to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation, either party can immediately pursue litigation in Beijing, China, waiving the negotiation and arbitration clauses.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates negotiation and arbitration in Hong Kong as the dispute resolution mechanism. The modified text introduces an alternative dispute resolution option where either party can immediately pursue litigation in Beijing, China. This directly contradicts the requirement for negotiation and arbitration, creating uncertainty about the enforceable dispute resolution process and forum.",

                "original_text": "8.1\nThe initial term of this Agreement shall, unless sooner terminated by consent of all parties, expires in five (5) years from the date of\nEffective Date. NVOS and HGF may renew the Agreement within two (2) years of the expiry of the initial term upon mutual understanding.\n8.2\nIt is understood that a subsequent renewal of a five (5) year term will be negotiated in good faith and shall carry terms very close to the\noriginal Agreement.\n8.3\nBoth parties may enter into buyout negotiations with the other Party on terms agreeable to both Parties.",
                "changed_text": "8.1\nThe initial term of this Agreement shall, unless sooner terminated by consent of all parties, expires in five (5) years from the date of\nEffective Date. NVOS may, at its sole discretion, renew the Agreement for additional terms. \n8.2\nAny subsequent renewal of a five (5) year term will be subject to NVOS's approval and may or may not carry terms similar to the original Agreement, based on prevailing market conditions and NVOS's strategic objectives.\n8.3\nBoth parties may enter into buyout negotiations with the other Party, however NVOS has the ultimate decision whether or not to proceed.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that renewal required mutual understanding, creating a degree of equality between the parties. The modification gives NVOS sole discretion over renewal, contradicting the previous mutual agreement clause and potentially allowing NVOS to dictate renewal terms or refuse renewal altogether. This shift creates uncertainty about HGF's rights and the enforceability of renewal expectations.",

                "original_text": "9.3\nTo remunerate HGF on the basis of thirty percent (30%) of net Company income basis on an annual basis commencing 12 months after the\nfirst full 12-month revenue period.",
                "changed_text": "9.3\nTo remunerate HGF with a discretionary percentage of net Company income, to be determined annually by NVOS, commencing at a time decided by NVOS, with the amount being subject to NVOS's sole interpretation of the company's financial performance and strategic priorities.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear 30% remuneration to HGF. The modified text makes this remuneration discretionary, determined solely by NVOS. This directly contradicts the certainty of the initial percentage, creating uncertainty for HGF regarding their income and potentially leading to disputes over what constitutes a fair distribution.",

                "changed_text": "19.1\nDuring the term of this agreement, HGF may request the right to assign, transfer or sell all or part of their interest in this agreement, however NVOS reserves the absolute right to deny any such request for any reason whatsoever and without any obligation to provide justification.",
                "explanation": "The original text provided HGF with the *right* to assign their interest, contingent on NVOS's approval. The modification transforms this into a mere *request*, with NVOS retaining the absolute right to deny it without explanation. This creates a contradiction: HGF ostensibly has a right, but it is entirely subject to NVOS's unfettered discretion, essentially negating the right itself. This creates uncertainty about HGF's ability to exit or transfer their stake in the Joint Venture.",

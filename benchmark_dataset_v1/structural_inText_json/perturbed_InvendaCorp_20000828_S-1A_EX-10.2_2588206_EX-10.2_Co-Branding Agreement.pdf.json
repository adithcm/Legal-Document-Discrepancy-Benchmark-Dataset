Excite@Home holds the right to create competing services as long as they are substantially better.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text, creating uncertainty about Excite@Home's obligations not to create a competing service. The phrase 'as long as they are substantially better' adds further ambiguity, making enforcement difficult.",

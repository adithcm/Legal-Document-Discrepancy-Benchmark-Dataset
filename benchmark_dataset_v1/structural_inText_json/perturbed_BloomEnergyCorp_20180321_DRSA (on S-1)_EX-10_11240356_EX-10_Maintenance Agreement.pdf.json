During the Warranty Period, Operator shall perform the services to the Bloom Systems and the BOF necessary for the Portfolio to perform to the Warranty Specifications (the “System Service Warranty”). In the event that Owner desires Operator to service the Bloom Systems and the BOF beyond the Warranty Period, the rate for such time-based services will be quoted by Operator to Owner quarterly for the following quarter, and materials will be invoiced at the retail prices for such materials.",
                "changed_text": "Section 2.4 Facility Services Warranty. During the Warranty Period, Operator may perform the services to the Bloom Systems and the BOF necessary for the Portfolio to perform to the Warranty Specifications (the “System Service Warranty”). In the event that Owner desires Operator to service the Bloom Systems and the BOF beyond the Warranty Period, the rate for such time-based services will be determined at Operator’s discretion and materials may be invoiced at the rates determined by operator. However, operator reserves the right to not honor this warranty.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that during the Warranty Period, the operator *shall* perform services. The modified version changes this to *may* perform services and introduces a clause allowing the operator to not honor this warranty, introducing a contradiction. This creates uncertainty about the Operator's obligations.",

The term of this Agreement (the “Term”) (a) shall commence on the first day of the Warranty Period for the first Bloom System to achieve Commencement of Operation and (b) shall, unless terminated earlier under Section 4.1 of this Agreement or unless extended by mutual agreement of the Parties, terminate on the date that is the last day of the Warranty Period for the last Bloom System to achieve Commencement of Operation.",

The term of this Agreement (the “Term”) (a) may commence on any day during the Warranty Period for any Bloom System at Operator's discretion, and (b) shall, unless terminated earlier under Section 4.1 of this Agreement, terminate at any time determined by the Operator. There is no guarantee this term can be extended by any mutual agreement of the Parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear start and end date of this agreement. The modified version introduces uncertainty about the start date by stating 'may commence on any day' and allows operator to terminate it whenever it wants and also not guaranteeing an extension, contradicting the clear original duration and creating uncertainty about the agreement's term.",

Furthermore, The original text agrees to exclusive jurisdiction to any state or federal court in NY. The modified version gives the operator the right to change this agreement.

                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall commence as of April 1, 2018 (the “Effective Date”) and shall expire upon the later of: (a) the conclusion of the 2022/23 NFL season and (b) the last day in February, 2023 (such expiration date, the “Scheduled Expiration Date”), unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall commence as of April 1, 2018 (the “Effective Date”) and shall expire upon the later of: (a) the conclusion of the 2022/23 NFL season and (b) the last day in February, 2023 (such expiration date, the “Scheduled Expiration Date”). The Club reserves the right to extend the Term of this Agreement for an additional year, at its sole discretion, by providing written notice to the Sponsor no later than January 31, 2023.",
                "explanation": "The original clause defines a specific expiration date for the agreement. The added sentence gives the Club the unilateral right to extend the agreement, which contradicts the defined expiration date and creates uncertainty about the Term's actual length.",

                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) equal installments. The payment schedule, including the amount and due date of each installment, shall be determined by the Club and communicated to the Sponsor at least 30 days prior to the start of each Contract Year.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a fixed payment schedule. The modified clause gives the Club the right to change the payment schedule at its discretion, directly contradicting the original fixed schedule and creating uncertainty around payment obligations.",

For purposes of clarity, nothing in this Agreement grants Sponsor the right to operate the Stand or otherwise sell\nor distribute food products from or within the Stand.",

However, the Club retains the right to restrict or prohibit the sale of any of Sponsor's food products at any time, for any reason, at its sole discretion. For purposes of clarity, nothing in this Agreement grants Sponsor the right to operate the Stand or otherwise sell\nor distribute food products from or within the Stand.",
                "explanation": "While the original clause grants the Sponsor the right to sell its products, the added sentence gives the Club the power to unilaterally restrict or prohibit those sales. This creates a contradiction because the Sponsor's 'right' to sell is now contingent on the Club's approval and can be revoked at any time, making the initial right uncertain and unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Any payments which have not been received by PCQ within thirty (30) days of the Invoice date may, at PCQ's discretion, be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE of 1.0% per month which is a corresponding ANNUAL\nPERCENTAGE RATE of 12% on the outstanding balance.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a mandatory finance charge for late payments. The modified version makes the finance charge discretionary ('may, at PCQ's discretion'), creating uncertainty about whether late fees will be applied. This introduces a contradiction because the original text implies a consistent policy, while the modified text allows for inconsistent application of late fees.",

                "explanation": "The original text stated that ABW could forward complex support requests to PCQ. The modified version states that ABW is solely responsible for all support and cannot forward requests to PCQ. This directly contradicts the original provision, creating uncertainty about which party is ultimately responsible for resolving complex customer issues.",

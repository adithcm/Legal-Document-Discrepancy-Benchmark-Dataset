However, any such action will not be a cause for concern and will be handled on a case by case basis without necessary disclosure.",

The added sentence states that these actions may not be disclosed, introducing a direct contradiction about the disclosure requirement. It creates uncertainty about whether the franchisor is obligated to reveal such legal actions.",

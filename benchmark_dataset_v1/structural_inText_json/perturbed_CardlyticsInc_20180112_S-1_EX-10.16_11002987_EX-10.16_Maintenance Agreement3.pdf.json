                "changed_text": "Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned in the SLCMA, except for the term 'Software'. 'Software' in this Schedule refers only to the Supplier Offer Placement System Software and not any other software referenced in the SLCMA.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original text states that all capitalized terms not defined in the Schedule will have the meaning assigned in the SLCMA. The modified text then carves out an exception for 'Software,' stating that within the Schedule, 'Software' only refers to the Supplier Offer Placement System Software, even though the SLCMA might define 'Software' more broadly. This creates ambiguity as to the scope of the 'Software' covered under the Schedule and the broader SLCMA, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This edit directly contradicts the purpose of the schedule. The original text clearly indicates the schedule is meant to ADD to the SLCMA's software provisions. The modified text states the schedule is meant to SUPERSEDE the SLCMA's software provisions, which causes conflicting statements about its intent. The use of 'add' versus 'supersede' creates a contradiction.",

However, this Schedule shall be treated as a completely separate agreement, independent of the SLCMA, regarding the Offer Placement System Software.",
                "explanation": "This creates a direct contradiction regarding the relationship between the Schedule and the SLCMA. The original clause clearly states the Schedule is incorporated into the SLCMA. The modified clause introduces the statement that it should be treated as a 'completely separate agreement,' contradicting the initial incorporation. It is uncertain if the SLCMA is relevant for the Schedule.",

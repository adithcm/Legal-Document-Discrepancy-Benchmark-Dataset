                "changed_text": "“Trade Secrets” means all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic or engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations, program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs or codes, whether tangible or intangible, and whether or how stored, compiled or memorialized physically, electronically, graphically, photographically or in writing. Trade Secrets shall not require the owner to demonstrate reasonable measures to keep such information secret for it to be considered a trade secret. The information must only derive potential economic value.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Trade Secrets\" requires the owner to take reasonable measures to keep the information secret and for the information to derive independent economic value. The modified definition removes the requirement for the owner to demonstrate reasonable measures to keep the information secret and reduces the economic value requirement to only 'potential' value. This contradicts the original definition and creates uncertainty about what qualifies as a Trade Secret, potentially impacting the enforceability of confidentiality clauses.",

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as conferring any rights (including the right to sublicense) by implication, estoppel or otherwise, under any Intellectual Property Rights, other than as expressly granted in this Agreement, and all other rights under any Intellectual Property Rights licensed to a Party or the members of its Group hereunder are expressly reserved by the Party granting the license. The Party receiving the license hereunder acknowledges and agrees that the Party (or the applicable member of its Group) granting the license is the sole and exclusive owner of the Intellectual Property Rights so licensed.",

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as conferring any rights (including the right to sublicense) by implication, estoppel or otherwise, under any Intellectual Property Rights, other than as expressly granted in this Agreement, but past practices may allow for certain use rights. All other rights under any Intellectual Property Rights licensed to a Party or the members of its Group hereunder are expressly reserved by the Party granting the license. The Party receiving the license hereunder acknowledges and agrees that the Party (or the applicable member of its Group) granting the license is the sole and exclusive owner of the Intellectual Property Rights so licensed.",
                "explanation": "The original section explicitly states that no rights are conferred by implication or estoppel. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating that 'past practices may allow for certain use rights,' which contradicts the earlier statement. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the scope of licensed rights and could lead to disputes based on prior informal usage.",

Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement, including the licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement, shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Party to this Agreement (or any of its successors or permitted assigns) (a) shall enter into a consolidation or merger transaction in which such Party is not the surviving entity and the surviving entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of such Party’s assets, (b) shall transfer all or substantially all of such Party’s assets to any Person or (c) shall assign this Agreement to such Party’s Affiliates, then, in each such case, the assigning Party (or its successors or permitted assigns, as applicable) shall ensure that the assignee or successor-in-interest expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement, and the assigning Party shall not be required to seek consent, but shall provide written notice and evidence of such assignment, assumption or succession to the non-assigning Party. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. No assignment permitted by this Section 8.01 shall release the assigning Party from liability for the full performance of its obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the licenses granted in this Agreement extend to products, product lines, services, apparatus, devices, systems, components, hardware, software, processes, solutions, any combination of the foregoing, or other offerings of the assignee existing on or before the date of the transaction described in clauses (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such transaction.",

Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement, including the licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement, shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, unless said assignment is to a subsidiary of the party, in which case no consent is needed. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Party to this Agreement (or any of its successors or permitted assigns) (a) shall enter into a consolidation or merger transaction in which such Party is not the surviving entity and the surviving entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of such Party’s assets, (b) shall transfer all or substantially all of such Party’s assets to any Person or (c) shall assign this Agreement to such Party’s Affiliates, then, in each such case, the assigning Party (or its successors or permitted assigns, as applicable) shall ensure that the assignee or successor-in-interest expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement, and the assigning Party shall not be required to seek consent, but shall provide written notice and evidence of such assignment, assumption or succession to the non-assigning Party.

                "explanation": "The initial part of Section 8.01 states that no assignment is allowed without prior written consent. However, the added text allows for assignments to a subsidiary without consent, contradicting the general restriction. This introduces uncertainty about the scope of the restriction on assignment and when consent is actually required.",

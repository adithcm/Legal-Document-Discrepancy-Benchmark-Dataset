This Agreement becomes effective on the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated as provided in this ARTICLE 11, shall continue until the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”). This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive three (3) year terms thereafter (each a “Renewal Term” and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”) until and unless (i) either Party provides the other Party written notice of non-renewal no later than ninety (90) days prior the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term or (ii) earlier terminated as provided in this ARTICLE 11.",
                "changed_text": "11.1 Term. This Agreement becomes effective on the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated as provided in this ARTICLE 11, shall continue until the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”). This Agreement may be renewed for successive terms as mutually agreed upon in writing by both parties. Either party can initiate discussions for renewal no later than ninety (90) days prior the end of the Initial Term or any potential Renewal Term. If the parties do not reach an agreement, or if the renewal is not properly documented, it can be earlier terminated as provided in this ARTICLE 11.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes an automatic renewal mechanism unless a non-renewal notice is provided. The modified text introduces a requirement for mutual written agreement for each renewal, contradicting the automatic renewal clause and creating uncertainty about the contract's duration. This change introduces a need to reach an agreement which will generate uncertainty.",

However, both parties warrant to act in good faith, and neither party should cause damage to the reputation of the other during the performance of this contract.",
                "explanation": "Here, the original clearly and explicitly excludes all other warranties, both express and implied. The modified version starts with the same exclusion but then adds a clause warranting 'good faith' and preventing reputational damage. This new clause introduces an implied warranty (of good faith and no reputational harm) that directly contradicts the blanket exclusion stated at the beginning of the section, creating uncertainty about which part of the provision to enforce. This internal contradiction could lead to disputes over whether a breach of good faith or damage to reputation constitutes a violation of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Here the text defines what good faith means by implying both parties should act in a reasonably. The changed text indicates that “The standard of good faith is up to each party’s sole discretion”. These two statements contradict each other.

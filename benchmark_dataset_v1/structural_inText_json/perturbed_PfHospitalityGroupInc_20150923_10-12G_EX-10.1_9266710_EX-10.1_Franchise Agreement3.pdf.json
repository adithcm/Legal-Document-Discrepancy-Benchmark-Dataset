The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that the Member's obligations 'will be determined on a case-by-case basis,' directly contradicting the original assertion of uniform obligation. This creates uncertainty regarding the scope of the Member's confidentiality and non-compete responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear restriction on competitive activities within a 3-mile radius during the Post-Term Period, 'except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor'. The modified text removes the geographic limitation and introduces the clause, 'The applicability and scope of this clause are subject to local laws and may be modified by mutual agreement between the Member and the Franchisor'. This addition significantly weakens the non-compete agreement by making its enforceability contingent on local laws and allowing for modifications through mutual agreement, thus contradicting the intention of a standard non-compete. It also eliminates the defined geographic radius. This could make it difficult for the Franchisor to prove a breach of the non-compete agreement.",

The Reseller shall have a right of first refusal to include within this Agreement any\nadditional products developed, manufactured, or sold by the Company following the Effective Date that are not currently included in Exhibit A, and\nupon the exercise of such right, the term “Products” shall be expanded to mean such additional products as well. For purposes of clarity, the parties\nagree that upon Todos’s development of a blood screening test for colon cancer, such product shall be added to this Agreement and included\nwithin the definition of “Products”, subject to the Reseller and Todos agreeing on the commercial terms for such product, including the price.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the inclusion of the colon cancer screening test in the definition of \"Products.\" The original text suggests that upon Todos' development of the test, it \"shall be added\" to the agreement, pending agreement on commercial terms. The modified text removes the binding \"shall be added\" and replaces it with \"may be added\", and removes the 'agreement of commercial terms' thus making its inclusion subject to Todos' sole discretion. This creates uncertainty about whether the colon cancer screening test will actually be included, diminishing the Reseller's right of first refusal and potentially impacting their exclusive distribution rights.",

Todos’s relationship manager shall meet with Todo no less frequently than\nquarterly and provide a status report on the Reseller’s commercialization efforts. In addition, the Reseller will promptly bring to the notice of Todos\nany information which it has or which it may receive in future which is likely to be of interest, benefit, or use to Todos in relation to both the\nmarketing of the Products in the Territory and the future market requirements of Customers.",

Todos’s relationship manager shall meet with Todo when Todos deems fit and provide a status report on the Reseller’s commercialization efforts. In addition, the Reseller will promptly bring to the notice of Todos\nany information which it has or which it may receive in future which Todos views as likely to be of interest, benefit, or use to Todos in relation to both the\nmarketing of the Products in the Territory and the future market requirements of Customers.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a Reseller-appointed relationship manager as the primary point of contact for all matters. The modified text weakens this to \"may serve as a point of contact with Todos regarding some matters… as Todos sees fit,\". This creates conflict over communication channels and removes certainty, and gives Todos discretion over the communications. Furthermore, it now depends on Todos on what will be considered of interest. This would make a point of contention as to how the process would work between the two.",

Todos shall ship ordered Products to the Reseller within ninety (90) days of Todos’s acceptance of the applicable purchase\norder DAP Reseller’s warehouse (Incoterms 2010), provided that Reseller’s order for the Products does not deviate from the applicable Forecast by\nmore than ten percent (10%).",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a delivery timeframe of ninety (90) days, contingent on the order aligning with the forecast within a 10% margin. The revised text eliminates the definite 90-day period, replacing it with \"commercially reasonable efforts to ship ordered Products to the Reseller within a reasonable time\". This removes the specific timeframe, making it ambiguous and more open to interpretation, which will cause conflict. Furthermore, it removes the 10% clause, meaning there is no longer a threshold where it would be affected.",

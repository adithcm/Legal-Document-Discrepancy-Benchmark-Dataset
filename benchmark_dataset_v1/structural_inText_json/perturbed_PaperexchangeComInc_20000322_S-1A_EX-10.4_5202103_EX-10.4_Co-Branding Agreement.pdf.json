Subject to Section 13.10  [Survival], upon termination of this\nAgreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing\nparty or destroyed unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this\nAgreement. The confidentiality obligations contained in this Article 10  [CONFIDENTIALITY] shall\nsurvive termination of this Agreement for a period of three years.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that confidentiality obligations survive for three years after termination.

                "explanation": "Section 8.1 originally states the contract auto-renews unless one party objects. Changing it to require mutual agreement introduces contradiction; it is now unclear if it auto-renews or needs explicit agreement. This will cause uncertainty around contract renewal.",

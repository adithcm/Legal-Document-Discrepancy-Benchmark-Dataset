                "changed_text": "a) “CONTRACT PERIOD” means that period of time commencing upon the full execution of this Agreement by both Parties and \nterminating on May 31, 2016. Berkshire retains the right to extend the Contract Period on an annual basis, subject to Auriemma's continued availability and mutual agreement; however, Berkshire's decision is final.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a clear termination date. The modified text introduces uncertainty by suggesting a possible extension at Berkshire's discretion, creating a contradiction about the definite duration of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates a specific interest rate on late payments. The modified text makes the interest rate discretionary, thus creating uncertainty and contradicting the original obligation.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Berkshire's decision on whether to terminate is final.",
                "explanation": "While the original text provides clear conditions for Berkshire's termination rights, this is now contradicted by providing Auriemma a right of first refusal. The added sentence that Berkshire's decision on whether to terminate is final creates more contradiction and ambiguity on the termination process.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall expire if the Investment Advisor or one of its affiliates ceases to serve as investment adviser to the Licensee. This Agreement shall be terminable (a) by the Licensor (i) at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that the Licensor or the Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of the Licensee’s use of the Licensed Mark or (ii) upon sixty (60) days’ written notice by the Licensor to the Licensee or (b) by the Licensee (i) at any time in the event such Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of the Licensee’s rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Licensor or (ii) upon sixty (60) days’ written notice by the Licensee to the Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "4.1. Term. The license granted to the Licensee under this Agreement shall continue perpetually, unless otherwise terminated as outlined in section 4.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may, at the sole discretion of the Licensee, be extended beyond the term specified or be prematurely expired if the Investment Advisor or one of its affiliates ceases to serve as investment advisor to the Licensee. This Agreement shall be terminable (a) by the Licensor (i) only in the event that the Licensor or the Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of the Licensee’s use of the Licensed Mark or (ii) upon sixty (60) days’ written notice by the Licensor to the Licensee or (b) by the Licensee (i) at any time in the event such Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of the Licensee’s rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Licensor or (ii) upon sixty (60) days’ written notice by the Licensee to the Licensor.",
                "explanation": "Originally, section 4.1 states the license is perpetual. The modified text adds conditions that contradict this permanency. By stating that Licensee has discretion to prematurely expire it even with the Investment Advisor, the perpetual nature is undermined, creating uncertainty. It also undermines Licensor's rights to terminate.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee’s own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this Agreement, and except as provided above, neither the Licensee nor any of its affiliates, owners, directors, officers, employees or agents shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivatives without the prior express written consent of the Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion. All rights not expressly granted to the Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor. Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor’s quality standards in any material respect, such Licensee shall take appropriate steps, in a commercially reasonable time frame, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to cure such noncompliance.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee’s own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this Agreement; however, the Licensee has the right to sublicense the mark to related third parties at their discretion. All rights not expressly granted to the Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor. Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor’s quality standards in any material respect, the Licensor will need to mutually agree with the Licensee on such steps to be taken, or such cure will not need to happen.",
                "explanation": "The original states that the Licensee cannot sublicense the mark or its derivatives without the Licensor's express consent. The modified text introduces a contradiction by granting the Licensee the right to sublicense at their discretion, conflicting with the initial restriction. It also restricts the Licensor's rights on quality standards, by stating that licensor will need to mutually agree with the licensee.",

The Licensee acknowledges that the Licensor makes no explicit or implicit representation or warranty as to the registrability, validity, enforceability or ownership of the Licensed Mark, or as to the Licensee’s ability to use the Licensed Mark without infringing or otherwise violating the rights of others, and the Licensor has no obligation to indemnify the Licensee with respect to any claims arising from the Licensee’s use of the Licensed Mark, including without limitation any Third Party Claim.",

                "explanation": "The original text disclaims all warranties and indemnification. The modified text completely reverses this, explicitly stating that there are warranties and obligations to indemnify. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the Licensor's liability and responsibility for the Licensed Mark's validity.",

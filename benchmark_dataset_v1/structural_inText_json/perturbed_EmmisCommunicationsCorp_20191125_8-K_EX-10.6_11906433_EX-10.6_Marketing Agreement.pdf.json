                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement (the “Term”) will begin on the date hereof (the “Commencement Date”), and will continue until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2022, (ii) the termination or expiration of the Studio Lease (defined below), (iii) election to terminate and notice thereof given by Programmer to Licensee, and (iv) mutual written consent of Licensee and Programmer (the “Term”), unless extended or earlier terminated pursuant to Section 11 hereof. The term “Studio Lease” means that certain Lease dated as of February 23, 1996 of certain real estate located on the 7th Floor of an office building located at 395 Hudson St., New York, New York.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement (the “Term”) will begin on the date hereof (the “Commencement Date”), and will continue indefinitely. The term “Studio Lease” means that certain Lease dated as of February 23, 1996 of certain real estate located on the 7th Floor of an office building located at 395 Hudson St., New York, New York.",
                "explanation": "Section 1 originally defined the term with specific end dates. By changing it to 'continue indefinitely,' it contradicts the original termination conditions listed in (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv), creating uncertainty about the actual duration of the agreement.",

Programmer represents and warrants to Licensee that Programmer has all rights in and to the WLIB Programs necessary or appropriate to rebroadcast such WLIB Programs on the HD2 Channel.",

Programmer represents and warrants to Licensee that Programmer has all rights in and to the WLIB Programs necessary to rebroadcast such WLIB Programs on the HD2 Channel. However, Licensee may, at its sole discretion, assume responsibility for acquiring music licenses.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly assigns responsibility for music licenses to the Programmer. The modified version initially states the same but then adds a contradictory statement allowing the Licensee to assume responsibility, creating ambiguity about who is ultimately responsible for obtaining and maintaining music licenses.",

No transfer or assignment shall relieve Programmer of any obligation or liability under this Agreement. The covenants, conditions and provisions hereof are and shall be for the exclusive benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or to give any person or entity other than the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns any right, remedy or claim, legal or equitable, under or by reason of this Agreement.",

Any transfer or assignment shall relieve Programmer of all obligation or liability under this Agreement. The covenants, conditions and provisions hereof are and shall be for the benefit of any third parties deemed appropriate by Licensee, and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to restrict the Licensee's ability to confer rights, remedies, or claims upon any third person or entity.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text by stating that the Programmer *may* assign the agreement (originally *may not*), Licensee *can* withhold consent for *any* reason (previously *shall not be unreasonably withheld*), assignment *relieves* the programmer of all obligation (previously *shall not relieve*), and that third parties *may* benefit (previously explicitly *exclusive benefit*). This introduces significant uncertainty regarding the assignability of the agreement and the rights of the parties involved.",

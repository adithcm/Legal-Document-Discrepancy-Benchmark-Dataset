                "original_text": "“Service” means the Advertising Services and the Video Display Program.",
                "changed_text": "“Service” may mean the Advertising Services or the Video Display Program, as determined by NCM's interpretation.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Service\" clearly includes both Advertising Services and the Video Display Program. By changing it to \"may mean\" and adding \"as determined by NCM's interpretation,\" NCM now has the discretion to selectively include or exclude elements from the Service. This creates uncertainty regarding the scope of NCM's obligations and potentially allows NCM to reduce its responsibilities or unilaterally alter the agreement's terms.",

                "original_text": "Network Affiliate shall provide to NCM during each month of the Term 25 complimentary Theatre passes that will not expire any earlier than 120 days from the date of issuance. The passes shall be provided to NCM at least 30 days prior to the month in which such passes first become valid.",
                "changed_text": "Network Affiliate may provide to NCM during each month of the Term up to 25 complimentary Theatre passes that may expire at any time. The provision of passes is subject to Network Affiliate's discretion and availability.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that Network Affiliate must provide 25 passes monthly with a specific expiration. The changed text makes the provision of passes optional (\"may provide\"), introduces flexibility in the number of passes (up to 25), eliminates the expiration requirement, and adds a subjective condition based on 'Network Affiliate's discretion and availability.' This contradicts the original obligation, making it unclear whether NCM will actually receive any passes.",

                "changed_text": "NCM may, at its discretion, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Network Affiliate and its Representatives from and against some Costs suffered or incurred in connection with or as a result of some third party claims, suits, actions, or proceedings allegedly arising out of, based upon, or relating to, (i) a possible breach by NCM of Article IX, or (ii) a potential occurrence of NCM’s fraud, possible misconduct, or arguable noncompliance with law, depending on circumstances and with NCM's total liability capped at $1000. NCM will decide whether to provide indemnity on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original clause creates a clear obligation for NCM to indemnify Network Affiliate under specific circumstances. The modified version introduces several ambiguities and limitations: it makes the indemnification discretionary (\"may, at its discretion\"), limits the scope to \"some Costs\" and \"some third party claims\", adds subjective qualifiers like \"possible\" and \"potential,\" imposes an extremely low liability cap ($1000), and grants NCM complete control over the decision to provide indemnity. This significantly weakens Network Affiliate's protection and creates a contradiction with the original text, making the indemnification clause largely unenforceable and uncertain.",

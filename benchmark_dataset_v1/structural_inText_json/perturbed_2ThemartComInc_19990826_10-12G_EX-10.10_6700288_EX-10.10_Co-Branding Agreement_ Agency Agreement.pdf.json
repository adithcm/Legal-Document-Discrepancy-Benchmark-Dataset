                "explanation": "The original text stipulates an automatic renewal if no notice is given. The modified text introduces a contradiction by stating that renewal will be at i-Escrow's sole discretion, effectively negating the automatic renewal clause and creating uncertainty about the renewal process. This contradicts the previous statement saying it will automatically renew, or can be renewed by mutual agreement.",

The original clause established mutual indemnification obligations for acts, omissions, or misrepresentations. The modified clause states that in all other circumstances, neither party is required to indemnify the other. This directly contradicts the first sentence which stipulates that each party will indemnify each other, now creating ambiguity regarding when indemnification is required.",

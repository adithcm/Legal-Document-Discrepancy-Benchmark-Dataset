                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, all the Parties to this Agreement shall take reasonable steps to prevent disclosure of any confidential or proprietary information to any third party, which it may have received from the JVC or other Parties to this Agreement. They shall not use for any purpose (other than authorized by the supplying party) the confidential information marked or designated as “confidential”, except for the following information:\n\n(a) Which, at the time of disclosure, is in the public domain or publicly known or available;\n\n\n(b) Which, after disclosure to the recipient, becomes part of the public domain or publicly known or available, except by breach of the terms of this Agreement.\n\n\n(c) Which the recipient can establish by conclusive proof that the information was in its possession at the time of disclosure to the recipient;\n\n\n(d) Which, the recipient received rightfully without any confidentiality obligation from a third party, who is not prohibited from disclosing such information;\n\n\n(e) Which is independently developed by the receiving party; and\n\n\n(f) Which is information required to be disclosed by law or as per request of any Governmental body or court of Law. Provided that the disclosing party is given prior notice and such court or Government body is requested to keep such information confidential to the extent permissible under law.",

For a period of one (1) year thereafter, all parties are released from this responsibility. They shall not use for any purpose (other than authorized by the supplying party) the confidential information marked or designated as “confidential”, except for the following information:\n\n(a) Which, at the time of disclosure, is in the public domain or publicly known or available;\n\n\n(b) Which, after disclosure to the recipient, becomes part of the public domain or publicly known or available, except by breach of the terms of this Agreement.\n\n\n(c) Which the recipient can establish by conclusive proof that the information was in its possession at the time of disclosure to the recipient;\n\n\n(d) Which, the recipient received rightfully without any confidentiality obligation from a third party, who is not prohibited from disclosing such information;\n\n\n(e) Which is independently developed by the receiving party; and\n\n\n(f) Which is information required to be disclosed by law or as per request of any Governmental body or court of Law. Provided that the disclosing party is given prior notice and such court or Government body is requested to keep such information confidential to the extent permissible under law.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a confidentiality period of three years after the agreement's term. The modification shortens this period to one year, creating uncertainty about the confidentiality's actual duration and conflicting interpretations of the confidentiality obligations.",

Upon completion of the five year term, it shall be automatically renewed for indefinite terms.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces two contradictions. First, the original stated an \"indefinite term\", while the change indicates a \"five year\" term. Second, the modified text indicates it is automatically renewed, but the provision for termination requires a written notice signed by ALL parties, which makes it hard to terminate.",

The changed text states that they have the right to enter such agreements during the term of the existing agreement. This creates a contradiction because it allows MINDA/MIL to essentially partner with a competitor during their existing agreement, which would defeat the purpose of entering the joint venture agreement.",

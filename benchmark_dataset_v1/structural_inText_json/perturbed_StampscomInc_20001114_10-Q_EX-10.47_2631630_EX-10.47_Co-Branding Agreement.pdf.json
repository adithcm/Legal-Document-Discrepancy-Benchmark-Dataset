                "original_text": "The Company shall maintain complete and accurate records of the number of packages shipped by the MBE Centers using the Service and all payments due or accrued to the Company by MBE Centers hereunder. MBE shall, at any time during the term of this Agreement, be entitled to audit all such records upon ten (10) days written notice to the Company, in order to confirm the accuracy of such records and conformance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that no more than one (1) such audit may be conducted in any ninety (90)-day period. Any such audit shall be performed at MBE's expense during the Company's normal business hours; provided, however, that in the event that such audit reveals any non-compliance with any term of this Agreement by the Company, the Company shall bear the cost of such audit.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall maintain records of the number of packages shipped by the MBE Centers using the Service and all payments due or accrued to the Company by MBE Centers hereunder. MBE may request to review these records, but the Company has sole discretion over whether to grant such access. Any such review, if permitted, shall be performed at MBE's expense during the Company's normal business hours. The Company is not obligated to provide any specific details or documentation.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives MBE the right to audit company records with some reasonable constraints. The modified text removes MBE's entitlement to audit, giving the Company sole discretion on granting access and providing information. This creates uncertainty and contradicts the original intent of allowing MBE to verify the accuracy of records.",

The Company is, and shall be, the sole owner of all inventions, discoveries and/or enhancements relating to the Service and the Specifications, including all copies, translations, compilations, partial copies, derivative works and updated works, whether partial or complete and whether or not merged into other program materials and whether in written or unwritten form. Except as authorized by this Agreement (including MBE's right to use the Specifications as set forth in Section 15(d)(iv)  [Effect of Termination]) or as otherwise agreed in writing, MBE and MBE Centers may not, directly, or through any person or entity, in any form or manner, copy, distribute, reproduce, incorporate, use or allow access to the Service or the Specifications, or modify, prepare derivative works of, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive source code or object code from the Service or the Specifications.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will have right, title and ownership interest in and to the Service and the Specifications and the Intellectual Property Rights therein, except for modifications or enhancements made by MBE. The Company is, and shall be, the owner of all inventions, discoveries and/or enhancements relating to the core Service and the core Specifications. MBE shall have the right to use, copy, distribute, reproduce, incorporate, use or allow access to the Service or the Specifications, and may modify, prepare derivative works of, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive source code or object code from the Service or the Specifications with written consent from the company.",
                "explanation": "The original text says the company has full and exclusive ownership of the service. The modified text introduces the exception 'except for modifications or enhancements made by MBE', which suggests joint ownership or at least MBE having partial rights to the enhancements. This contradicts the original statement of 'full and exclusive' rights. In addition, it states MBE must get written consent for access to do all those functions, but previously it mentions MBE having these rights now this contradicts that.",

MBE agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to execute agreements, or to facilitate the execution of agreements among the appropriate parties, so that such Basic Fee is paid to the Company directly from the carrier which ships such package no later than fifteen (15) days following the end of the month in which such package was shipped. If MBE is unable, despite its commercially reasonable efforts, to facilitate the execution of such an agreement with one or more carriers, the Basic Fee shall be paid by each MBE Center directly pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Company may, at its discretion, be entitled to receive a Basic Fee, the amount of which is subject to change without notice. MBE is not obligated to facilitate agreements for the payment of this fee. The payment of the Basic Fee, if applicable, is subject to additional terms and conditions outlined elsewhere in this agreement or to be decided upon later.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states the Company *shall* be entitled to receive a Basic Fee, and MBE is obligated to facilitate its payment. The modified clause changes 'shall' to 'may, at its discretion', making the fee entitlement uncertain and removing MBE's obligation. The statement 'subject to additional terms...to be decided upon later' creates further ambiguity and contradicts the initial clarity of the original clause, making enforcement unpredictable.",

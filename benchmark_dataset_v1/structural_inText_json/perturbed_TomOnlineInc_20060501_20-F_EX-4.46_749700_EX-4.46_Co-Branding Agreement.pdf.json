This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Subject to the parties’ rights to seek injunctive relief or other right in equity by any court of competent jurisdiction, the parties to this Agreement expressly understand and agree that any dispute arising under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the courts located in England and Wales and the parties to this Agreement hereby consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue therein.",

The modified clause allows disputes to be brought in any jurisdiction where the defendant has assets or conducts business.

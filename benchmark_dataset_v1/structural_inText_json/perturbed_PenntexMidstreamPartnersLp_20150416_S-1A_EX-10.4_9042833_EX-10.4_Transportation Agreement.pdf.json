                "original_text": "“Firm Service” shall mean service for which Transporter is contractually entitled to interrupt its performance only to the extent (i) that such performance is excused pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement relating to Force Majeure, (ii) of specified periods of maintenance, or (iii) that Transporter determines that the operation of all or any portion of its facilities will cause injury or harm to persons or property or to the integrity of its facilities, and with respect to each of (i), (ii) or (iii), only to the extent that Transporter has curtailed all service of the same priority on a pro rata basis in accordance with Article V.",
                "changed_text": "“Firm Service” shall mean service for which Transporter may interrupt its performance at any time, without prior notice, and for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to (i) Force Majeure, (ii) maintenance, (iii) concerns regarding facility integrity, or (iv) the Transporter's sole and absolute discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Firm Service\" limits the Transporter's ability to interrupt service to specific scenarios. The modified definition contradicts this by stating that the Transporter can interrupt service at any time, for any reason, and without notice. This creates uncertainty about the actual level of service the Customer is entitled to.",

This Agreement may not be assigned, disposed of, alienated or otherwise transferred by either Party, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as provided below.\nPermitted Assignments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) either Party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party without the consent of the other Party, (ii) either Party may pledge this Agreement to secure any credit facility or indebtedness of such Party or its Affiliates without the consent of the other Party, (iii) Transporter may assign this Agreement without Customer’s consent in connection with the sale or transfer of the Transportation System, and (iv) Customer may assign or partially assign this Agreement without Transporter’s consent in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of Customer’s ownership interests in the wells (or in the lands upon which such wells are located) producing Customer Gas delivered hereunder, provided that such assignee has a credit rating reasonably acceptable to Transporter at the time of such sale or transfer. In the case of transfers under clause (iv) above, the transferor shall be released from its obligations and liabilities under this Agreement to the extent of the obligations assumed by the transferee, provided that Customer’s and such transferee’s combined obligations to Transporter shall be no greater than Customer’s obligations to Transporter prior to such transfer.",
                "changed_text": "Restrictions on Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned, disposed of, alienated or otherwise transferred by either Party, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other Party. The granting or denial of consent shall be at the sole and unfettered discretion of the non-assigning party.\nPermitted Assignments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) either Party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party without the consent of the other Party, (ii) either Party may pledge this Agreement to secure any credit facility or indebtedness of such Party or its Affiliates without the consent of the other Party, (iii) Transporter may assign this Agreement without Customer’s consent in connection with the sale or transfer of the Transportation System, and (iv) Customer may assign or partially assign this Agreement without Transporter’s consent in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of Customer’s ownership interests in the wells (or in the lands upon which such wells are located) producing Customer Gas delivered hereunder, provided that such assignee has a credit rating reasonably acceptable to Transporter at the time of such sale or transfer. In the case of transfers under clause (iv) above, the transferor shall not be released from its obligations and liabilities under this Agreement, regardless of obligations assumed by the transferee. Customer’s and such transferee’s obligations to Transporter shall be joint and several and may exceed Customer's obligations to Transporter prior to such transfer.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states consent to assignment cannot be 'unreasonably withheld,' implying a standard of reasonableness. The modified clause removes this restriction, giving the non-assigning party 'sole and unfettered discretion' over consent. This directly contradicts the original intent. Furthermore, the original clause states the transferor shall be released from its obligations and liabilities under this Agreement to the extent of the obligations assumed by the transferee, provided that Customer’s and such transferee’s combined obligations to Transporter shall be no greater than Customer’s obligations to Transporter prior to such transfer. The changed text states the transferor will not be released and Customer’s and such transferee’s obligations to Transporter shall be joint and several and may exceed Customer's obligations to Transporter prior to such transfer. This directly contradicts the original intent.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that Transporter must provide reasonable notice to Customer about any interruptions or curtailments. The modified clause completely negates this by stating that Transporter is not required to provide any notice whatsoever. This creates conflict as it removes an important informational obligation, creating uncertainty about how operational changes are communicated.",

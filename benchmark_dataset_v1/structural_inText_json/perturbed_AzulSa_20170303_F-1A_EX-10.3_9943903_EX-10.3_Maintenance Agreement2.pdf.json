                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Amendment shall enter into force on the date of its signature by both Parties and, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by the Parties through a subsequent amendment to the GMA, shall remain in force for the term of the referenced GMA.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall enter into force on the date of its signature by both Parties. This Amendment will automatically renew annually unless either party provides written notice of termination 30 days before the anniversary of the signature date. In the absence of such notice, the amendment's duration will extend indefinitely.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states the amendment lasts for the GMA term. The modified clause introduces automatic renewal unless cancelled, effectively making the duration potentially indefinite, contradicting the initial term-based expiration.",

                "changed_text": "4.6 This Clause 4 shall survive termination or expiry of this Amendment. The obligations of confidentiality outlined in this clause will persist until explicitly waived by mutual written consent of both Parties. Any waiver must clearly state the specific information to be released and the conditions under which it may be disclosed.",
                "explanation": "The original clause sets a five-year limit on confidentiality after termination. The modified clause states that confidentiality persists until explicitly waived by both parties. This removes the definite end date and makes the confidentiality obligation potentially indefinite, conflicting with the stated five-year limit.",

                "changed_text": "6.2 In case of any inconsistency between the terms of the GMA and this Amendment regarding the subject-matter, the GMA shall prevail to protect the interests of the original agreement. If the GMA doesn't address the specific issue, this amendment will be considered in the absence of a directly contradictory clause within the GMA.",
                "explanation": "Originally, the amendment took precedence over the GMA in case of conflict. Now, the GMA prevails unless it is silent on the matter, reversing the order of precedence. The contradiction is whether the original agreement or amendment takes precedence.",

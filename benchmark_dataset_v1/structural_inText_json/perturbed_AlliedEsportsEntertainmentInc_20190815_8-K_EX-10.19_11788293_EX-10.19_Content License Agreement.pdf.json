                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall automatically extend for an additional two (2) years on the same terms herein (“Renewal Term”) provided WPT receives payments greater than twelve million U.S. dollars ($12,000,000) within the Initial Term. The Initial Term and any such Renewal Term are collectively referred to as the “Term.”",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may extend for an additional two (2) years on the same terms herein (“Renewal Term”) if both parties agree to extend the terms 90 days prior to expiration. The Initial Term and any such Renewal Term are collectively referred to as the “Term.”",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement 'shall automatically extend' under specific conditions. The modified text changes this to 'may extend' only if both parties agree, introducing a contradiction about the renewal process and creating uncertainty about whether the contract will automatically renew or requires explicit agreement. This creates uncertainty about the obligations and rights of each party regarding renewal, especially if WPT expects an automatic renewal based on the original terms.",

Zynga shall not be required to pay the Royalty to the extent offset by the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments previously paid to WPT during the Term. Conversely, Zynga shall not be required to make Annual Minimum Guarantee payments to the extent offset by the Royalty previously paid to WPT during the Term.",
                "changed_text": "Zynga may pay to WPT a percentage of the Net Revenue (as potentially defined in Section 3.b. of the Additional Provisions) (“Royalty”) from the WPT-branded Zynga Poker Tournament Mode or other such use of the WPT brand on the Zynga platform. Zynga may be required to pay the Royalty to the extent offset by the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments previously paid to WPT during the Term. Conversely, Zynga shall not be required to make Annual Minimum Guarantee payments to the extent offset by the Royalty potentially paid to WPT during the Term.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly dictates a set percentage for royalty payments, making it a firm obligation. The change alters the language to 'may pay', which introduces uncertainty regarding the payment terms. Moreover, the addition of the word 'potentially' related to royalty and definition creates ambiguity about the royalty calculation, especially whether Net Revenue is considered in royalty calculation.",

                "changed_text": "Each party may elect to carry liability insurance based on their assessment of the risks posed under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that liability insurance should be carried by each party to cover their risks, making it mandatory. The modified version makes it optional by using 'may elect'. This introduces contradiction in the agreement about who is liable for risk under the contract, and the insurance obligation.",

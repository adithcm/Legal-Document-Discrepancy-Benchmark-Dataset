                "changed_text": "5.1. The term of this JSMA shall commence on May 1, 2020 (the “Commencement Date”) and ends at April 30, 2029 (the “Term”). Renewal of this JSMA for any period after the initial term will require written agreement by both parties, made no less than 30 days before the original term expires.",
                "explanation": "Section 5.1 originally stated the JSMA has automatic renewals unless notice is given, but the modified section removes 'automatic' renewal and stipulates a new agreement must be made, which directly contradicts the concept of automatic renewals.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires remedy within 3 business days after notice. The modification removes this certainty, granting the Non-Defaulting Party discretion whether to even offer a cure period, and extending it to a maximum of 30 business days, which contradicts the original strict 3-day limit.",

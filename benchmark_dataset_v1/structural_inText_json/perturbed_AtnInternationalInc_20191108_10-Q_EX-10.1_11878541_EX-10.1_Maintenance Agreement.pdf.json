                "explanation": "The original text defines \"Control\" as requiring 50% or more ownership or beneficial interest.  The modified text reduces this threshold to 20%. This creates a direct contradiction because a party could be considered in 'Control' under the modified definition while not meeting the original definition, leading to uncertainty regarding Change of Control implications and obligations.",

Prior\nto exercising its right to offset amounts pursuant to this Section 3.22, AT&T shall provide written notice to\nVendor of its intention to offset such amounts and to the extent any dispute between the Parties exists in\nrespect of the amount to be offset, AT&T must first utilize the Escalation Procedure in Section 4.8(a).",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly waives AT&T's right to offset against Structured Payments after Location Acceptance and requires written notice and escalation. The modified version states the opposite: AT&T *reserves* those rights, and doesn't need to provide notification or escalation. This creates a direct contradiction about whether AT&T can offset against completed projects, creating significant financial uncertainty for the Vendor.",

The modified version now says that the vendor won't maintain a streamlined escalation process which opposes the original terms of service.

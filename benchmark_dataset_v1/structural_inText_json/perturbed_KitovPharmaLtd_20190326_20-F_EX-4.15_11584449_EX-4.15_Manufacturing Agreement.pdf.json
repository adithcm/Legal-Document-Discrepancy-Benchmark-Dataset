                "changed_text": "1.20 “Joint IP” shall have the meaning set forth in Section 8.3 of the Development Agreement as shown in Exhibit A.\nJoint IP shall solely belong to Dexcel and Kitov shall have no rights over it whatsoever.",
                "explanation": "By adding \"Joint IP shall solely belong to Dexcel and Kitov shall have no rights over it whatsoever.\" after defining Joint IP, we create a contradiction. Initially, Joint IP is defined by referencing Section 8.3, which implies joint ownership. However, the added statement explicitly denies Kitov any rights, contradicting the implicit joint ownership.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this agreement shall not renew and shall cease at the end of the Initial Term.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies automatic renewal unless a party provides written notification of non-renewal. By adding \"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this agreement shall not renew and shall cease at the end of the Initial Term,\" we directly contradict the automatic renewal clause, creating uncertainty about the agreement's duration.",

The added sentence, \"Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dexcel warrants that the Product will conform to Kitov's specifications,\" directly contradicts this disclaimer.

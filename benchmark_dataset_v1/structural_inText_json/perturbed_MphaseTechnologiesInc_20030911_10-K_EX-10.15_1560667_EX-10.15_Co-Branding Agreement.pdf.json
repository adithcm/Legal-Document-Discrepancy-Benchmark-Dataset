                "original_text": "The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "changed_text": "The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual expiration. Lucent may deny the annual renew for any reason.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Lucent's consent to renewal 'shall not be unreasonably withheld,' implying a reasonable basis must exist for denial. The modified version removes this restriction and gives Lucent the right to deny renewal 'for any reason', thus contradicting the implication of the original clause. This creates uncertainty about mPhase's ability to renew the agreement, as it now depends solely on Lucent's discretion, even if arbitrary.",

Notwithstanding the previous sentence, Lucent may, at its sole discretion, elect to continue the agreement even if such an event occurs.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement *shall* terminate under specific conditions. The added sentence allows Lucent to *elect to continue* the agreement even if those conditions are met. This creates an explicit contradiction. It is now unclear whether a change in management, ownership, or bankruptcy *automatically* terminates the agreement, or if Lucent has the option to override this termination. This ambiguity weakens the termination clause and potentially disadvantages mPhase.",

                "changed_text": "mPhase agrees to allow Lucent to inspect the Approved Uses bearing the Lucent Co-Branding Logo. Lucent's inspection is not limited to compliance with the terms of this Agreement, and may include any other reason deemed appropriate by Lucent.",
                "explanation": "The original text limits Lucent's inspection to ensuring compliance with the agreement's terms, particularly in relation to Schedule B. The modified text removes this restriction and allows Lucent to inspect for 'any other reason deemed appropriate,' effectively granting Lucent unlimited inspection authority. This contradicts the original intent of limiting the inspection scope and creates uncertainty about the permissible reasons for inspection.",

                "changed_text": "1.5 “Development Fee” means 50% of the Net Sales for any Development Products in the Development Territory unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties. The exact percentage will be determined on a quarterly basis based on market conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the Development Fee as 50% of Net Sales. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that the percentage can be altered and is dependent on market conditions. This contradicts the initial fixed definition, creating uncertainty about the actual Development Fee owed.",

Particular Confidential Information shall not be deemed to come under any of the above exceptions merely because it is embraced by more general information that is or becomes subject to any of the above exceptions.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, the Parties each agree that Confidential Information of the disclosing party, which is disclosed to the recipient party pursuant to this Agreement: (i) shall be received and held in confidence, (ii) shall be used only for internal purposes of the recipient, and (iii) may be disclosed by the recipient party to affiliates, agents or employees. Particular Confidential Information shall not be deemed to come under any of the above exceptions merely because it is embraced by more general information that is or becomes subject to any of the above exceptions.",
                "explanation": "The original text enforces a strict confidentiality period of five years, limiting the use and disclosure of Confidential Information. The modified version shortens the confidentiality period to one year, allows the recipient party to use the information for internal purposes, and permits disclosure to affiliates, agents, or employees without prior written consent. This directly contradicts the strict confidentiality terms established in the original text, increasing the risk of misuse or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.",

                "original_text": "6.2 Subject to any rights herein which survive termination, this Agreement will earlier terminate in its entirety: (i) upon thirty (30) calendar days written notice from either party if the other party materially breaches this Agreement, unless before the end of such thirty (30) calendar day notice period, the breaching party has cured the material default or breach to the non-breaching party’s reasonable satisfaction; or (ii) at any time by mutual written agreement between the Parties, subject to any terms herein which survive termination.",
                "changed_text": "6.2 Subject to any rights herein which survive termination, this Agreement will earlier terminate in its entirety: (i) upon thirty (30) calendar days written notice from either party if the other party materially breaches this Agreement. The breaching party will have no ability to cure the breach, regardless of whether the non-breaching party is reasonably satisfied; or (ii) at any time by mutual written agreement between the Parties, subject to any terms herein which survive termination; or (iii) if CNS deems WPD's research progress is not up to market standards.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows a breaching party to cure a material breach within 30 days, potentially avoiding termination. The modified version removes the possibility of curing the breach, making termination automatic upon a material breach, regardless of any attempts to remedy it. It also adds a vague clause where CNS can terminate based on 'market standards', which contradicts the 'cure' provision and the 'mutual agreement' clause, creating uncertainty. These terms also significantly shifts the power dynamic in favor of CNS. This new clause creates a new possibility of termination that is solely at the discretion of one party.",

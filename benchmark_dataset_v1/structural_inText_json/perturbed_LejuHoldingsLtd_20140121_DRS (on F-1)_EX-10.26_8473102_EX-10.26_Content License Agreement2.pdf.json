                "original_text": "1. Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions of the Original Agreement survive such termination.",
                "changed_text": "1. Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing and signed by both parties. For the avoidance of doubt, certain provisions of the Original Agreement, as determined solely by Beijing SINA, may survive such termination.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original text clearly states that 'no provisions' of the original agreement survive termination. The modified text creates uncertainty by stating that 'certain provisions...may survive,' contradicting the initial statement of complete termination. It also gives Beijing SINA sole discretion in determining which provisions survive, potentially undermining the mutual agreement aspect.",

                "changed_text": "2. This Termination Agreement is intended to represent the complete, integrated, and entire agreement between the parties, but may be subject to unilateral modification by Beijing SINA with written notice to SINA Leju.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause. The original clearly states that the agreement represents the *complete* and *entire* agreement and can *only* be modified in writing *signed by both parties*. The modified version states it is *intended* to be complete, introducing doubt, and allows for *unilateral modification* by one party (Beijing SINA) with only *written notice*, completely undermining the mutual agreement and creating an imbalance of power.",

                "original_text": "5. This Termination Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.",
                "changed_text": "5. This Termination Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto; however, Beijing SINA reserves the right to transfer its obligations and benefits under this agreement to any of its affiliates without the prior consent of SINA Leju.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the agreement benefits both parties and their successors/assigns. The modification introduces an exception, allowing Beijing SINA to transfer its obligations and benefits to its affiliates without SINA Leju's consent. While not directly contradicting 'binding upon,' it significantly alters the reciprocal benefit aspect. The uncertainty arises because SINA Leju does not have a similar right, potentially placing them at a disadvantage if Beijing SINA transfers its obligations to a less capable affiliate.",

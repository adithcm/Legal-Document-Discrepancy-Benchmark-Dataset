                "original_text": "2. Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a thirty-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\").",
                "changed_text": "2. Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date. Renewal of this agreement is subject to mutual agreement between ESSI and Talent. In the absence of such written agreement, the agreement will automatically terminate on the anniversary of the Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement automatically renews unless terminated with 30-day notice. The modified text introduces the requirement of 'mutual agreement' for renewal, contradicting the automatic renewal clause and creating uncertainty about the contract's duration.",

Equity Payment: ESSI will provide Talent with one-million (1,000,000) shares of restricted common stock issued within ten business days of execution of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "5. Consideration. As consideration for Talent's services under this Agreement, ESSI agrees as follows:\nA. Equity Payment: ESSI may provide Talent with up to one-million (1,000,000) shares of restricted common stock. The issuance of shares will be at the sole discretion of ESSI and contingent upon Talent's satisfactory performance as determined by ESSI. ESSI has the right to revoke the grant in case of poor publicity and/or performance.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states ESSI 'will provide' the equity payment of 1,000,000 shares. The modified text changes this to 'may provide', introducing discretion and contingency. This directly contradicts the original obligation and creates uncertainty whether Talent will receive the agreed-upon equity, and if so, under what conditions. Furthermore, the clause around revocation creates a vague, easily disputed term.",

All ESSI uses of Talent Attributes in connection with the Commercial Placements and/or press releases shall be subject to the prior written approval of Talent. Said written approval must be given within five (5) business days of Talent's receipt or said usage shall be deemed unapproved. Any such usage featuring Talent in the Commercial Placements and/or press releases shall be and remain the property of ESSIÍ¾ however, ESSI shall have the right to use said Commercial Placements and/or press releases solely as outlined in Paragraph 3 and only during the Term.",
                "changed_text": "9. Review, Approval, and Ownership of Commercial Placements. While ESSI will make reasonable efforts to obtain Talent's input on Commercial Placements, ESSI maintains ultimate control over the final content and appearance of all promotional materials. Failure by Talent to respond within five (5) business days does not constitute disapproval; ESSI may proceed with using Talent Attributes. ESSI shall own all rights to the Commercial Placements in perpetuity. Talent may not use said materials in whole or in part for any purpose without the express written consent of ESSI.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates Talent's 'prior written approval' for all uses of Talent Attributes. The revised text undermines this by stating ESSI maintains 'ultimate control' and that a lack of response does not constitute disapproval, effectively nullifying Talent's approval right. Furthermore, limiting Talent's use of materials in their portfolio by introducing the 'express written consent of ESSI' is a direct contradiction to the original text, creating uncertainty regarding control and usage of these materials.",

                "explanation": "The initial statement absolves the Blockchain Administrator of liability for actions related to their duties. The modified text directly contradicts this by stating the Blockchain Administrator is 'fully liable'. Simultaneously, the original states that the Fund shall indemnify the Blockchain Administrator while the modified text directly contradicts this by stating the Fund shall not indemnify, creating direct conflict and uncertainty around liability and indemnification.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that the agreement can be terminated by a 'majority' vote. This change makes the termination possible by a 'minority' vote, conflicting with the original intent and creating ambiguity around the requirements for termination. Furthermore, the original states that the Blockchain Adminstrator 'shall' remain entitled to the benefits after termination, while the modified text states the opposite.",

If Affiliate fails to notify Network of its desire that this Agreement terminate on its expiration date, at least six (6) months before the expiration date, this Agreement will automatically renew, upon the same terms and conditions, for an additional four (4) -year period (“Renewal Term”).\n\n(c) If the Term is renewed as described in Section 2(b), Network and Affiliate will negotiate exclusively and in good faith concerning further renewal of this Agreement upon mutually-agreed terms and conditions; provided, that unless Network and Affiliate otherwise agree in writing, the exclusive negotiation period will end six (6) months before the expiration of the Term.",

If Affiliate fails to notify Network of its desire that this Agreement terminate on its expiration date, at least six (6) months before the expiration date, this Agreement will automatically renew, upon the same terms and conditions, for an additional four (4) -year period (“Renewal Term”).\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the above, all renewals of this contract must be explicitly agreed to, in writing, by both Network and Affiliate. Renewal shall not be automatic under any circumstances, and any prior clauses suggesting automatic renewal are hereby superseded.",
                "explanation": "Section 2(b) states that the agreement automatically renews unless the Affiliate provides notice of termination. Section 2(c) then contradicts this by stating that renewal is subject to mutually-agreed terms and conditions, suggesting a negotiation process. I modified this so that section (c) completely negates (b), stating that it can only be renewed by express written agreement which introduces a contradiction and uncertainty about renewal conditions.",

This exclusivity is granted at the sole discretion of the Network, and may be revoked with 30 days written notice. In the event that the Network decides to offer the Service to another broadcaster in the same DMA, this section shall be rendered null and void.",
                "explanation": "Section 3(a) grants Affiliate the exclusive right to broadcast the Service. I added a contradictory clause stating that the Network can revoke this exclusivity with 30 days' notice and may offer the service to other broadcasters in the DMA, thus negating the 'exclusive' right initially granted and creating uncertainty in the enforceability of this section.",

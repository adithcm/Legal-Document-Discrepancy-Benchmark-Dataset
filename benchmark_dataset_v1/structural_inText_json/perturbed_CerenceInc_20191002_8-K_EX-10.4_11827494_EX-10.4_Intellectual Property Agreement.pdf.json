                "original_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as of the Distribution Date, Nuance hereby grants to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual and irrevocable, transferable (subject to ARTICLE VIII), sublicensable (subject to Section 3.01(g)) license under the Nuance Patents, solely to the extent that claims of the Nuance Patents cover products or services of the SpinCo Business in the SpinCo Field of Use, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof, in each case to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise exploit such products and services, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as of the Distribution Date, Nuance hereby grants to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up license under the Nuance Patents, solely to the extent that claims of the Nuance Patents cover products or services of the SpinCo Business in the SpinCo Field of Use, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof, in each case to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise exploit such products and services, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof. This license is granted at Nuance's sole discretion and may be revoked with a 60-day written notice if SpinCo does not meet its financial obligations, as determined by Nuance.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states the license is 'perpetual and irrevocable,' but the modified version introduces the possibility of revocation by Nuance, directly contradicting the 'irrevocable' nature of the license. This contradiction creates uncertainty about SpinCo's long-term rights to use the Nuance Patents and increases financial obligations.",

The continuation of this license beyond the initial five-year term is contingent upon Nuance's successful integration of SpinCo's technology into its core product offerings and is subjected to a further negotiation of the licensing fees.",
                "explanation": "Similar to the previous perturbation, the original clause grants a 'perpetual and irrevocable' license. The modification introduces a contingency based on 'successful integration' and 'further negotiation of licensing fees' which renders the 'perpetual and irrevocable' nature of the agreement conditional. This creates uncertainty about the longevity and cost of the license for Nuance.",

                "original_text": "Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement, including the licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement, shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Party to this Agreement (or any of its successors or permitted assigns) (a) shall enter into a consolidation or merger transaction in which such Party is not the surviving entity and the surviving entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of such Party’s assets, (b) shall transfer all or substantially all of such Party’s assets to any Person or (c) shall assign this Agreement to such Party’s Affiliates, then, in each such case, the assigning Party (or its successors or permitted assigns, as applicable) shall ensure that the assignee or successor-in-interest expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement, and the assigning Party shall not be required to seek consent, but shall provide written notice and evidence of such assignment, assumption or succession to the non-assigning Party.",

Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may assign this Agreement to any third party without consent if it deems necessary for strategic alignment, but will still be liable for the full performance of its obligations under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits assignment without consent, with specific exceptions for mergers, acquisitions, or assignment to affiliates, under which circumstances non-assigning party has to be informed. The modified text permits assignment to any third party for 'strategic alignment,' while still holding the assignor liable. This directly contradicts the initial prohibition and introduces uncertainty about when and how the agreement can be transferred, and whether the assigning party can guarantee its obligations under those circumstances, thereby weakening the non-assigning party.",

The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating the content 'may be co-owned,' which contradicts the original statement.

Renewal terms are subject to mutual agreement between both parties and depend on performance metrics to be determined at the end of the initial term.

                "explanation": "The original text establishes automatic renewal unless terminated with 60 days' notice. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that renewal is not automatic and depends on mutual agreement and performance metrics. This contradicts the original clause, making it unclear whether the agreement will automatically renew or requires additional steps.",

                "explanation": "The original text prevents either party from making public announcements without prior written consent. The modified version explicitly allows either party to make public announcements, directly contradicting the original restriction. The phrase 'discouraged, but not prohibited' further solidifies the contradiction and creates ambiguity about the enforceability of the confidentiality of the agreement regarding public announcements.",

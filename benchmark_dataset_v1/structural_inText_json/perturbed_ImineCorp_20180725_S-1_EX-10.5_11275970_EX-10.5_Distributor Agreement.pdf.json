Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, JRVS appoints the\nDistributor, and the Distributor hereby accepts such appointment, as JRVS’S non-exclusive authorized distributor for sale of the\nProducts to the Customers (other than House Account) in the Territory (as these terms are defined in Section 1.8, above).

However, JRVS reserves the right to exclude certain products or product categories from this definition at any time with written notice to the distributor.\n\n2.1 Appointment of Nonexclusive Distributor. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, JRVS appoints the Distributor, and the Distributor hereby accepts such appointment, as JRVS’S non-exclusive authorized distributor for sale of the Products to the Customers (other than House Account) in the Territory (as these terms are defined in Section 1.8, above). Under no circumstances shall Distributor sell Products for use outside the Territory. Notwithstanding the above, JRVS may, at its sole discretion, permit the Distributor to sell specific Products outside the Territory under separately negotiated terms.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines 'Products' and appoints the distributor to sell those products within the territory. The modified version introduces a contradiction. First, it allows JRVS to exclude certain products from the definition of 'Products' after the agreement has been made, creating uncertainty about what the distributor is actually authorized to sell. Second, it allows for sales outside the territory under separately negotiated terms, directly contradicting the original restriction and creating ambiguity about the distributor's territorial rights.",

JRVS warrants that the Products will conform to JRVS’s specifications at the time of delivery to the Distributor, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of delivery.

The warranty provided in section 10.2 is in lieu of all other warranties.",
                "explanation": "The original section explicitly states that JRVS provides no warranties. The modified version introduces a limited warranty in Section 10.2, directly contradicting the no-warranty statement in Section 10.1. This creates confusion about whether JRVS provides any warranty at all, and if so, what the terms of that warranty are. Furthermore, stating that the new limited warranty is \"in lieu of all other warranties\" exacerbates the confusion instead of clarifying.",

                "explanation": "The modified section 5.1 declares that \"the JRVS Price shall be fixed for the duration of this agreement.\" while section 5.2 states that \"JRVS shall have the right to revise JRVS Price at any time.\" This is a direct contradiction regarding JRVS's ability to change the price of the product. Adding \"The distributor may not refuse the price change\" to the end of section 5.2 simply enhances this conflict and clarifies JRVS's decision to change the price, which is not compatible with the original price.",

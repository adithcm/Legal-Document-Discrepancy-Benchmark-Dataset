Affiliate shall mean, (i) with respect to Qualigen, any corporation or other form of business organization, which directly or indirectly owns, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Qualigen, and (ii), with respect to Sekisui, shall mean Sekisui Diagnostics (UK) Ltd., Sekisui Diagnostics PEI, Inc., SEKISUI MEDICAL CO., LTD., and Sekisui Diagnostics GmbH.

                "changed_text": "5.       TERM\n         This Agreement will remain in force for an initial term of one (1) year from the Effective Date and will automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms, unless either party provides written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party with or without cause upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement remains in force for perpetuity (forever) unless amended. The modified version introduces a limited initial term with automatic renewals, which contradicts the perpetuity clause. Furthermore, it allows termination at any time with 30 days' notice, further undermining the original intent of a perpetual agreement. This creates uncertainty about the actual duration of the agreement.",

OFFICE SPACE\n         2.1      During the term of this Agreement, LKPL will provide\n                  Axiometric with a license to use office space in LKPL's\n                  corporate facility in Columbia, Maryland, free of charge.\n         2.2      LKPL will allow Axiometric to use enough office space for two\n                  individuals and associated equipment in locations convenient\n                  for LKPL's purposes for as long as that space is available and\n                  not needed by LKPL for its own purposes. Axiometric will have\n                  access to LKPL's telephone system, internet connections,\n                  conference room, and printers.\n         2.3      If LKPL requires space used by Axiometric for LKPL's own\n                  purposes, then LKPL will attempt in good faith but without\n                  having any obligation to continue to provide Axiometric with\n                  comparable space. If LKPL deems itself unable to continue to\n                  provide Axiometric work space without expanding LKPL's\n                  facilities, and if LKPL determines it will be in its own best\n                  interests to expand its facilities, then LKPL will afford\n                  Axiometric the opportunity to lease space in the new\n                  facilities under a mutually acceptable separate commercial\n                  rental agreement. If Axiometric does not then wish to rent\n                  office space from LKPL, then LKPL may terminate Axiometric's\n                  license to use work space in LKPL's facility upon 60 days\n                  notice.\n         2.4      Axiometric shall be solely responsible for providing all\n                  equipment, furniture, supplies and other personal property\n                  that Axiometric deems appropriate to operate its business.\n                  LKPL will have no obligation to provide any special facilities\n                  or infrastructure unless otherwise negotiated.\n         2.5      LKPL will have no liability whatsoever for any of Axiometric's\n                  equipment, furniture, supplies or other personal property;\n                  Axiometric will use the space at its sole risk.\n         2.6      Axiometric will have the right to terminate the license to use\n                  the office space and to move out of the office space at any\n                  time upon two weeks notice.",
                "changed_text": "2.       OFFICE SPACE\n         2.1      During the term of this Agreement, LKPL may, at its sole discretion, provide Axiometric with access to office space in LKPL's corporate facility in Columbia, Maryland. Any use of office space is subject to a monthly fee to be determined by LKPL.\n         2.2      LKPL will determine the amount of office space available to Axiometric, if any. LKPL makes no guarantees as to the availability of its telephone system, internet connections, conference room, and printers to Axiometric.\n         2.3      LKPL may, at any time, terminate Axiometric's access to work space in LKPL's facility upon 24 hours notice and without any obligation to provide alternative space. \n         2.4      Axiometric shall be solely responsible for providing all equipment, furniture, supplies and other personal property that Axiometric deems appropriate to operate its business. LKPL may provide certain facilities or infrastructure, subject to additional fees.\n         2.5      LKPL will have no liability whatsoever for any of Axiometric's equipment, furniture, supplies or other personal property; Axiometric will use the space at its sole risk.\n         2.6      LKPL may bill Axiometric for reasonable wear and tear of the office space. LKPL, at its sole discretion, may provide improvements and modifications to the office space. LKPL may terminate Axiometric's access with 12 hours notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants Axiometric a license to use office space 'free of charge' and specifies conditions under which this arrangement may change. The modified text introduces several contradictions: (1) it states providing office space is 'at LKPL's sole discretion' and subject to a 'monthly fee,' negating the 'free of charge' provision. (2) It removes the guarantee of access to essential services (telephone, internet) and states LKPL 'makes no guarantees.' (3) The notice period for termination by LKPL is reduced from 60 days (under certain circumstances involving expanding facilities) to just 24 hours, and added a 12 hours provision, creating more conflict. These changes create uncertainty about Axiometric's right to use office space and the terms under which they may do so.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states the parties are joint venturers only for specific AMR activities and otherwise independent contractors. It also clarifies that neither party can bind the other without consent. The modified version directly contradicts this by declaring them a 'single economic entity' for AMR activities, giving LKPL the right to 'direct and control' Axiometric, and establishing an agency relationship where Axiometric's actions bind LKPL. This change completely reverses the intended relationship and creates uncertainty about liability and control.",

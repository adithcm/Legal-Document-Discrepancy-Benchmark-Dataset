                "changed_text": "Except as otherwise specified above in this Amendment, all other terms, conditions and covenants of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Premier reserves the right to modify any term, condition, or covenant of the Agreement with thirty (30) days written notice to Heritage. Such modifications will be binding unless Heritage objects in writing within fifteen (15) days of receiving said notice; however, Premier's determination will be final.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that while all other terms remain in effect, Premier can unilaterally modify them with limited recourse for Heritage. This contradicts the initial agreement that changes require mutual agreement, creating uncertainty about the enforceability of the original terms.",

Notwithstanding the previous statement, Premier reserves the right to unilaterally amend the Agreement at any time without prior notice to Heritage, and such amendments shall be immediately binding.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction to the 'WHEREAS' clause, which states that both parties agree to amend the agreement. The added text gives Premier the unilateral power to amend the agreement at any time, rendering the original intention of mutual consent meaningless and creating uncertainty about the amendment process.",

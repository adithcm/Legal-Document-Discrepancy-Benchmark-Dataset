                "original_text": "1.12 The term “Term” shall mean an initial term of five years, automatically renewable thereafter for successive 5-year terms unless either party provides prior written notice of termination not less than 90 days prior to the end of such five-year term; provided, however, T&B shall have the right to terminate the license after the first year of the Term if LEA does not conduct the Business so as to meet the Cash Sales benchmarks set by the parties for years two through five of the Term, as set forth in Section 3.3, below.",
                "changed_text": "1.12 The term “Term” shall mean an initial term of five years, and may or may not be renewable thereafter for successive 5-year terms. Renewal is subject to T&B’s discretion and written agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, T&B shall have the right to terminate the license at any time during the Term, with or without cause, at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies automatic renewal with a 90-day notice for termination. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating renewal is subject to T&B’s discretion, directly contradicting the automatic renewal provision. Furthermore, granting T&B the right to terminate \"at any time, with or without cause\" completely nullifies the initial 5-year term, making the contract's duration ambiguous and enforceable at T&B's will.",

No license or right is granted hereunder at any time from LEA to T&B, or by T&B to LEA, whether expressly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise, arising out of or related to LEA Work Product or T&B Work Product, respectively. LEA shall be the owner of all LEA Work Product when created and T&B shall be the owner of all T&B Work Product when created.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, LEA may be granted, in T&B's sole discretion, a non-exclusive license to use certain Work Product during the Term, provided that LEA adheres to any usage guidelines specified by T&B.  T&B may revoke LEA's license to use any Work Product at any time with or without cause.  T&B shall have the right to modify, adapt, and create derivative works from any Work Product, without any obligation to LEA.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes joint ownership of Work Product. The modified version directly contradicts this by stating all Work Product is the sole property of T&B, eliminating LEA's ownership rights. The clause then introduces a discretionary license for LEA, which can be revoked at any time, further undermining any claim LEA might have to the work produced. This creates significant uncertainty regarding intellectual property rights and could discourage LEA from investing in creating Work Product.",

                "explanation": "The original clause gives a clear and quantifiable structure for royalties. The modified section eliminates all specific amounts and percentages, giving T&B the ability to unilaterally change the royalty amounts whenever it wants. This renders the royalty calculation entirely arbitrary, contradictory to the initial consideration, and makes financial planning for LEA impossible. The uncertainty created regarding royalties is substantial.",

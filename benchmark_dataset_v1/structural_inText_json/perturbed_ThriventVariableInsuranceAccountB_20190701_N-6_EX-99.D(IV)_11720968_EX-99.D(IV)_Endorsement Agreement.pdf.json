                "original_text": "DIVIDENDS. Each year, we will determine our divisible surplus. This contract’s share, if any, will be credited as a dividend. Since we do not expect this contract to contribute to divisible surplus, it is not expected that any dividends will be credited.",
                "changed_text": "DIVIDENDS. Each year, we will determine our divisible surplus. This contract’s share, if any, may be credited as a dividend at the discretion of the Society. The Society anticipates that dividends will be issued quarterly. Since we do not expect this contract to contribute to divisible surplus, it is not expected that any dividends will be credited.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that dividends are not expected, creating a sense of certainty. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating dividends *may* be credited *at the discretion of the Society* while still claiming they are *not expected*, creating a contradiction. The addition of 'The Society anticipates that dividends will be issued quarterly' makes the uncertainty of enforcement more problematic.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the entities involved. The altered text introduces confusion by implying that 'We, Our, Us, Society' now refers to *both* Thrivent Life Insurance Company *and* Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, contradicting earlier sections that transferred all obligations to Thrivent Financial for Lutherans. This contradiction muddies who is responsible for fulfilling the contract's obligations and creates enforcement uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original states that benefits will *not* be reduced by future amendments to the Society's governing documents. The modified text directly contradicts this, stating that benefits *may* be reduced, making the stability and guarantee of the benefits unclear and creating uncertainty in enforcement, because the power to reduce benefits in the future would be up to the company's discretion.",

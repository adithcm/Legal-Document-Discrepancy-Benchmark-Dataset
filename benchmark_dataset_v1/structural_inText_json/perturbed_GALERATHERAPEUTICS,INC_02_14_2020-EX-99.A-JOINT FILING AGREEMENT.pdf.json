                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto. However, any such revocation shall only be effective if all other parties consent to the revocation in writing within 30 days of receiving notice. If any party objects, the agreement continues for all parties, including the revoking party.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows any party to unilaterally revoke the agreement with written notice. The modified text adds a condition requiring unanimous consent for the revocation to be effective, thereby contradicting the original clause and creating uncertainty about the revocation process. This introduces ambiguity as to whether a single party can actually withdraw from the agreement, leading to potential disputes.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained thereinÍ¾ but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein. Furthermore, each party is jointly and severally responsible for the completeness and accuracy of all information contained in the filings, regardless of whether the information pertains to that specific party, unless they provide written notice of any discrepancies within 10 business days.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that each party is only responsible for the accuracy of their own information. The modified text introduces joint and several liability for all information, even information about other parties. This directly contradicts the original clause, creating uncertainty about the extent of each party's liability and potentially deterring parties from entering the agreement. The exception of providing written notice of discrepancies does not resolve the contradiction as it places the onus on the parties to actively seek out inaccuracies in others' information, contrary to the initial allocation of responsibility.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts. However, to be considered valid, each counterpart must be identical in content and format, and each party must execute all counterparts for the agreement to be binding.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that multiple counterparts form a single agreement. The changed clause introduces conditions that directly contradict the ease of using counterparts by requiring them to be identical and for all parties to sign *all* counterparts, not just one. This makes the counterpart execution unnecessarily difficult, hindering agreement efficiency and possibly rendering the agreement void if not strictly adhered to.",

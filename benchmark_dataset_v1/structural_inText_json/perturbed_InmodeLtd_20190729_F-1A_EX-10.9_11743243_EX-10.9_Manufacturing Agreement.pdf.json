                "original_text": "This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for an initial term of year as of the Effective Date. This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for successive one (1) year increments unless either party request in writing, at least ninety (90) days prior to the anniversary date, that this Agreement not to be renewed.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for an initial term of year as of the Effective Date. This Agreement may be renewed for successive one (1) year increments as mutually agreed upon by both parties.  Notification of intent to renew or not renew must be provided in writing, at least thirty (30) days prior to the anniversary date.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement auto-renews unless one party requests otherwise. The modified text changes this to require mutual agreement for renewal, creating uncertainty about whether the contract renews automatically or requires active confirmation. It also changes the notification period from 90 to 30 days creating further potential for disputes.",

In the event Contractor anticipates at any time that it will not deliver Products within the prescribed timetable as set forth in the applicable Purchase Order, Contractor shall promptly so inform Customer by written notice of such delay. Contractor shall submit proposed revisions to the timetable that reflect Contractor’s best estimates of what can realistically be achieved and shall use its best commercial efforts to achieve such timeline, unless otherwise directed by Customer and confirmed by Contractor.",
                "changed_text": "Contractor will use commercially reasonable efforts to supply orders according to the forecast and delivery times. The contractor is not responsible for delays that are caused by raw material availability or unforeseen production issues. The contractor will communicate with the customer if the delivery is going to be impacted and inform Customer by written notice of such delay. The contractor will use reasonable efforts to achieve the original timeline unless otherwise directed by the customer.",
                "explanation": "The original text binds the contractor to supply all orders that do not exceed forecast at the delivery times. The modified version changes the obligation to supply to a 'reasonable effort' basis, removing a clear contractual obligation and changing it to a less enforceable standard. It also excuses the contractor from delays that are outside of its control due to raw materials or unforeseen production issues, which limits the contractor's liability.",

Contractor further represents and warrants that the Product will consist of new materials.",

No warranty is made regarding the materials used in the products, other than the vendor guarantees that the vendor gives to the contractor. Contractor will use commercially reasonable efforts to use new materials but cannot guarantee it.",
                "explanation": "The original text makes specific warranties, including that products will be free from defects in workmanship and material, and comply with the IPC610.B standard and consist of new materials. The modified text removes almost all warranty guarantees and replaces them with ambiguous phrases. Removing the compliance with IPC610.B standard and the assurance that the Products will consist of new materials creates ambiguity.",

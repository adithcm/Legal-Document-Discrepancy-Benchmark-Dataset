Hydraspin hereby appoints Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts appointment, as Hydraspin’s exclusive distributor of the Products in the Territory during the term of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmarks. The Territory may be amended with the mutual agreement of both Parties from time to time to add or delete geographic territories by amending Exhibit B attached hereto. If Hydraspin desires to enter a new territory in the United States, Hydraspin will offer Distributor the first opportunity to become the exclusive distributor for the new territory. If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity within ten (10) business days of the date the opportunity is presented to Distributor, Hydraspin shall have no obligation to enter into a contract with Distributor regarding the new territory. In the event the Distributor loses exclusivity on a territory due to not meeting Performance Benchmarks, the Distributor shall maintain exclusivity on any and all existing Products that are in the field and operating at them time exclusivity if forfeited.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that if the Distributor loses exclusivity due to failing to meet performance benchmarks, it will still maintain exclusivity on any existing Products that are in the field and operating. The changed text contradicts this by saying that in the same scenario, Hydraspin reserves the right to appoint another distributor, creating confusion about what happens to existing Products when the Distributor fails to meet the Performance Benchmarks.",

Hydraspin shall provide the Products to Distributor’s Customers at no cost to Distributor or the Customers, except solely for the Hydraspin Share of Net Revenue, which shall be due and payable to Hydraspin as set forth in this Article VI. Likewise, Hydraspin shall install, service and maintain the Products, with the commercially reasonable assistance of Distributor, at no cost to Distributor or the customers except solely for the Hydraspin Share of Net Revenue, which shall be due and payable to Hydraspin as set forth in this Article VI.",

Hydraspin shall provide the Products to Distributor’s Customers at no cost to Distributor or the Customers, except solely for the Hydraspin Share of Net Revenue, which shall be due and payable to Hydraspin as set forth in this Article VI. Distributor shall be responsible for all costs associated with installation, servicing and maintenance of the Products. Hydraspin shall determine, at its sole discretion, the level of commercially reasonable assistance it will provide to the Distributor for installation, service and maintenance of the Products.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states that Hydraspin shall install, service and maintain the products at no cost to the distributor or the customers, only requiring a share of Net Revenue. By modifying the clause, the obligation and cost are shifted entirely to the distributor, contradicting the original provision. This creates ambiguity about which party is responsible for covering these expenses and whether cost is passed on.",

The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and end on the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”), unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof.

Upon expiration of the Initial Term of this Agreement, this Agreement will renew only upon mutual written agreement by both parties. If no such agreement is reached, the agreement terminates at the end of the initial term.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for automatic renewal unless a party provides written notice of termination. The modified text replaces this automatic renewal with a requirement for mutual written agreement, directly contradicting the automatic renewal clause. This contradiction leads to uncertainty about the renewal process and the agreement's duration.",

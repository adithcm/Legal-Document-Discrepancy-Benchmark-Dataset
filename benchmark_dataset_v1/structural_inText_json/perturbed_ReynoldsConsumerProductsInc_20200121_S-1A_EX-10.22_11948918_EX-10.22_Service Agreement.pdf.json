                "original_text": "Section 6.2 Termination of Services. Except as agreed by the Parties in writing or as otherwise stated in the Exhibits, Company may terminate for convenience any Transition Service, and RGHI may terminate for convenience any Reverse Transition Service, upon 30 days’ prior written notice of such termination; provided, (a) that, with respect to the Services described in Section G1 of Exhibit A, unless otherwise indicated therein, those Services may not be terminated independently except in accordance with an agreed Migration Plan and, (b) any unamortized costs associated with Provider’s purchase of any license or other costs incurred specifically for the purpose of providing the Services hereunder will be passed through to the Terminating Party. Upon termination of any Service pursuant to this Section 6.2, the Terminating Party’s obligation to pay for such Service will cease except any sums accrued or due as of the date of such early termination for Services rendered (which shall include (i) any amounts contemplated by 6.2(b), plus (ii) a pro rata portion of any fees applicable to the current period in which such Services are being performed if the applicable fee is determined on a period by period basis as set forth on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable). The provisions of this Section 6.2 shall apply mutatis mutandis with respect to any assignment of this Agreement subject to Section 10.10(b) and the Parties will negotiate in good faith regarding fee allocations and, if necessary, early termination or partial termination of any Services.",
                "changed_text": "Section 6.2 Termination of Services. Either party may terminate for convenience any Transition Service or Reverse Transition Service at any time, with no prior notice required. Any unamortized costs associated with Provider’s purchase of any license or other costs incurred specifically for the purpose of providing the Services hereunder will not be passed through to the Terminating Party. Upon termination of any Service pursuant to this Section 6.2, the Terminating Party’s obligation to pay for such Service will cease regardless of any sums accrued or due as of the date of such early termination for Services rendered. The provisions of this Section 6.2 shall not apply with respect to any assignment of this Agreement subject to Section 10.10(b) and the Parties will not negotiate in good faith regarding fee allocations and early termination or partial termination of any Services.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the termination of services. The original text requires 30 days' notice and states that unamortized costs will be passed through to the terminating party. The modified text allows immediate termination without notice and states that unamortized costs will *not* be passed through, creating uncertainty about the financial obligations upon termination. The original text states regarding fee allocations and early termination the parties will negotiate in good faith whereas the new text states that there is no need for that, resulting in a contradiction.",

Subject to Section 3.1(c), internal controls of Provider and its Affiliates with respect to the Service Standard shall remain materially the same in effect throughout the term of this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party and their Affiliates are not professional service providers of the Services.",
                "changed_text": "Section 3.1 Quality of Services.\n(a) Provider may perform the Services at any level of quality it deems appropriate, without regard to the level of quality at which such Services were performed or enjoyed during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof, and without regard to applicable Law (collectively, the “Service Standard”). Internal controls of Provider and its Affiliates with respect to the Service Standard may be changed at any time throughout the term of this Agreement at the Provider’s sole discretion. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party and their Affiliates are not professional service providers of the Services.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates a 'Service Standard' based on historical performance and legal compliance. The modified clause allows the provider to perform services at any quality level and disregards legal compliance, directly contradicting the original intent. It also removes the obligation to maintain consistent internal controls related to the service standard, creating further uncertainty about service quality.",

                "original_text": "Section 5.4 Payment. Recipient shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Fees shown on an invoice no later than the last business day of the month Recipient received such invoice unless disputed in accordance with Section 5.7. Any amount not received from the invoiced Party within such period shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate, from and including the last date of such period to, but excluding, the date of payment.",

Recipient shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Fees shown on an invoice whenever the Recipient deems it appropriate, regardless of whether or not disputed in accordance with Section 5.7. Any amount not received from the invoiced Party within such period shall not bear interest at any rate.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates a specific payment deadline and imposes interest on late payments. The modified clause allows the recipient to pay whenever they deem appropriate, removing the deadline and eliminating interest charges. This directly contradicts the original payment terms, potentially leading to payment delays and disputes.",

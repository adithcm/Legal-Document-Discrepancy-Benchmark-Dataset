                "original_text": "Supplier agrees that no production or manufacture of any merchandise covered by this Contract will commence until this Contract has been signed, dated and returned by Supplier to Purchaser. Supplier further agrees that it will not produce, cause to be produced or assist in the production of more units than are specified by Purchaser nor will Supplier produce, cause to be produced or assist in the production of any product or item not specifically requested by Purchaser using any or all of the Playboy Properties or any trademark, copyright, designations, names, phrases, designs or symbols similar to any or all of the Playboy Properties during or at any time after the completion of merchandise requested by this Contract.",

Supplier further agrees that it might be allowed to produce, cause to be produced or assist in the production of more units than are specified by Purchaser, and Supplier might be allowed to produce, cause to be produced or assist in the production of any product or item not specifically requested by Purchaser using any or all of the Playboy Properties or any trademark, copyright, designations, names, phrases, designs or symbols similar to any or all of the Playboy Properties during or at any time after the completion of merchandise requested by this Contract.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly forbids production before contract signature and limits production quantities. The revised text introduces ambiguity with \"may\" and \"might be allowed,\" contradicting the original's firm prohibitions and creating uncertainty about acceptable production practices. It creates an in-text contradiction by weakening the previously strict conditions.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandated that the supplier must either deliver or destroy the molds/designs at the request of the purchaser or Playboy. The modified text removes Playboy from the request and adds that the supplier may decide what to do, contradicting the original obligation. This also create confusion in the enforcement, in terms of what is required by the supplier.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires written modifications signed by Playboy's representative. The modified text allows verbal modifications and removes the need for Playboy's signature, directly contradicting the original clause.

                "original_text": "§ 7 Agreement period / Cancellation\nThe term of this Agreement will begin upon acceptance of Affiliate's\nProgram application and will end when terminated by either party of this\nAgreement. This Agreement is entered into for an unlimited period of time.\nEither party may cancel this Agreement at any time, with or without\nsupplying a reason, through written notification or by making suitable\nsettings in the respective Control Panel.",
                "changed_text": "§ 7 Agreement period / Cancellation\nThe term of this Agreement will begin upon acceptance of Affiliate's\nProgram application and will end when terminated by either party of this\nAgreement. This Agreement is entered into for a period of one year, automatically renewing for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the renewal date. Either party may cancel this Agreement at any time, with or without\nsupplying a reason, through written notification or by making suitable\nsettings in the respective Control Panel.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated the agreement was for an unlimited period of time and could be cancelled at any time. The changed text introduces a one-year term with automatic renewal, contradicting the initial statement of an unlimited term. This creates uncertainty regarding the duration of the agreement and the conditions for its termination.",

                "explanation": "The original text stated \"element 5 will pay Affiliate...\" making the payment of advertising costs mandatory. The changed text states \"element 5 may pay Affiliate...\" which makes the payment of advertising costs discretionary. This introduces a contradiction regarding whether the affiliate is guaranteed to receive advertising costs for generating a lead.",

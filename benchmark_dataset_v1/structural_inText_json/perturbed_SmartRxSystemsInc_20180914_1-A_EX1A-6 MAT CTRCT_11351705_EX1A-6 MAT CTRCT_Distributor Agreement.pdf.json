                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Territory shall mean Exclusivity for the state of Texas, USA, and Exclusive Distribution opportunities in all other states (with either the Company or Distributor), except the state of Florida.",
                "changed_text": "Territory shall mean Exclusivity for the state of Texas, USA. Exclusive Distribution opportunities in other states, including Florida, may be granted at the sole discretion of the Company.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding exclusivity. The original text explicitly excludes Florida from the exclusive territory. The modified text implies that Florida *could* be included, contradicting the initial exclusion and creating uncertainty about the distributor's rights in other states.",
                "location": "Section 1"

            {
                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The parties agree that any controversy, claim, dispute, or disagreement arising under, out of, or relating to this Distributor Agreement shall be exclusively submitted for resolution exclusively to courts of competent jurisdiction located in the County of Orange, State of Florida, USA. Distributor consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the resolution of such controversies, claims, disputes, or disagreements.",
                "changed_text": "The parties agree that any controversy, claim, dispute, or disagreement arising under, out of, or relating to this Distributor Agreement shall be subject to negotiation between the parties for a period of 30 days. If negotiation fails, either party may choose to pursue litigation or arbitration in a venue of their choosing.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict by directly contradicting the clause that mandates disputes be resolved in Orange County, Florida. The modified text allows either party to pursue litigation or arbitration in any venue. The original text binds both parties to a specific jurisdiction and process, the modified version gives both the option to do whatever they want, creating confusion.",

                "changed_text": "This contract shall remain in effect initially for the five (5) year term (\"Initial Term\") from the date signed. Renewal is not guaranteed and will be determined by a performance review conducted by the Company no less than 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term. The Company retains the right to not renew the agreement at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates automatic renewal unless notice is given, while the modified version introduces a performance review and the Company's right to refuse renewal at its discretion. This directly contradicts the automatic renewal provision, creating uncertainty about the agreement's term and conditions for renewal.",

                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and ending on February 19, 2013 (\"Term\").",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and ending on February 19, 2013 (\"Term\"). HDS has the option to extend this agreement for an additional year, by providing written notice to Celebrity at least 30 days before the end of the initial term. The specific details for the extended term, including payment and celebrity involvement will be determined at HDS's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement term ends on a specific date. The modified version allows HDS to extend the agreement, making the initial end date uncertain. The phrase 'will be determined at HDS's sole discretion' introduces ambiguity concerning celebrity's future role and compensation and creates uncertainty about the actual term and conditions.",

                "changed_text": "Celebrity represents and warrants that during the Term and in the Territory, Celebrity will not endorse or make any appearances or advertisements on behalf of any other multivitamin, unless Celebrity believes it aligns with their personal brand image and values. Celebrity is also free to pursue independent endorsement deals without notifying HDS.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits celebrity endorsements of competing products. The modified text introduces exceptions based on 'personal brand image and values,' which are subjective and open to interpretation. The statement granting Celebrity freedom to pursue independent endorsement deals without notifying HDS directly contradicts the original exclusivity clause creating uncertainty about endorsement rights.",

                "original_text": "All HDS' uses of Celebrity Attributes in connection with the Commercial and/or press releases shall be subject to the prior written approval of Celebrity via his agent, CSE. Said written approval must be given within five (5) business days of CSE's receipt or said usage shall be deemed unapproved.",
                "changed_text": "All HDS' uses of Celebrity Attributes in connection with the Commercial and/or press releases shall generally be subject to the prior written approval of Celebrity via his agent, CSE. However, HDS may use the Attributes without prior approval in cases where obtaining approval could delay time-sensitive marketing campaigns. In these cases, HDS agrees to use reasonable judgement to avoid misrepresentation.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires explicit approval before HDS can use the Celebrity's attributes. The modified text introduces an exception for 'time-sensitive marketing campaigns,' effectively nullifying the approval requirement in certain situations. The condition of 'reasonable judgement' is vague and unenforceable, causing uncertainty about the approval process and the extent to which HDS can use the Celebrity's likeness without explicit consent.",

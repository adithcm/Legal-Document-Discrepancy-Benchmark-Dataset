                "changed_text": "1.9 Commercially Reasonable Efforts means, with respect to the efforts to be used by a Party under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Products, those efforts and resources that the Party, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. The determination of such efforts and resources shall not be subject to any external standard or comparison to industry practices, market potential, proprietary position, profitability, or any other factors commonly considered in similar circumstances, including technical, legal, scientific, or medical factors. The Party's decision regarding the level of effort and resources to be applied shall be final and binding.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' is an objective standard based on industry norms and various factors. The modified definition makes it a subjective standard determined solely by the Party, removing any objective measure. This creates a contradiction because other clauses rely on the original objective definition for obligations, such as development and commercialization, leading to uncertainty about the actual effort required.",

Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, the Licensee's commitment to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts shall be deemed satisfied if the Licensee dedicates minimal resources to Commercialization. Furthermore, the Licensee shall not be obligated to meet any specific benchmarks, timelines, or resource commitments outlined in any Commercialization Plan or other document. The Licensee's decision to allocate resources and manage the Commercialization process shall be at its sole discretion and shall not be subject to review or challenge by Bioeq.

                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the obligation to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts by stating that minimal resource dedication is sufficient. It also negates any specific requirements in the Commercialization Plan, which were intended to define and guide the commercialization efforts. This creates ambiguity about the Licensee's actual responsibilities.",

Termination is enacted by providing 30 days notice to the other party. This clause overrides all prior termination clauses within this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This edit explicitly states that either party can terminate the agreement, negating all prior termination clauses. There are multiple termination clauses that explicitly discuss different requirements for termination and breach. This would cause in-text contradictions when a certain action that should lead to immediate breach is now superceded.",

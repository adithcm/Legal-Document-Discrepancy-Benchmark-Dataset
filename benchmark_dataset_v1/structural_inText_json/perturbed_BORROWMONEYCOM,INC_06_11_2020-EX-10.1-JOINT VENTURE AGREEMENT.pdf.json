                "original_text": "The duration of this Venture (the “Term”) will begin on March 1, 2020 and continue in full force and effect until February 28, 2025 or as\notherwise provided in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The duration of this Venture (the “Term”) will begin on March 1, 2020 and continue in full force and effect until February 28, 2025 unless either Member provides written notice of termination 30 days prior to the renewal date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Venture may be terminated at any time upon the mutual written agreement of both Members.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting terms regarding the Venture's duration. Section 4 originally stated a clear end date of February 28, 2025. The modification adds the possibility of unilateral termination by either member with 30 days' notice, contradicting the defined term. It also includes a mutual agreement clause, creating ambiguity about which condition governs termination.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the valuation of JVLS, LLC's contribution. While Section 15 assigns an 'Agreed Value' of $3,500,000.00 USD, the added sentence suggests that the actual value could be different and subject to a future appraisal. This creates uncertainty about the real value of the contribution.",

                "changed_text": "Where a Member is in breach of this Agreement and that Member has not remedied the breach on notice from the Venture and after a\nreasonable period then the remaining Members will have the right to terminate this Agreement with regard to that individual defaulting\nMember (an “Involuntary Withdrawal”) and take whatever action necessary to protect the interests of the Venture. However, the defaulting member will have the option to buy out the other members' shares at a price determined solely by the defaulting member.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines the process for involuntary withdrawal due to a breach of contract. The added sentence gives the defaulting member the right to buy out the shares of the remaining members at a price they solely determine. This creates a conflict because the remaining members' right to terminate the agreement is undermined by the defaulting member's unilateral buyout option. The price determination solely by the defaulting member is contradictory to fair valuation principles.",

Sub-Reseller is not be a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement.",

Sub-Reseller may be considered a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement at Salesforceâ€™s sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that Sub-Reseller is not a third-party beneficiary. The changed text contradicts this by stating that Sub-Reseller may be considered a third-party beneficiary at Salesforce's discretion, creating uncertainty about their rights and benefits under the agreement. This could create disputes over enforcement.",

This agreement supersedes any previous and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, whether oral or written, between the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the agreement constitutes the entire agreement, superseding all prior agreements. The modified text introduces an exception, allowing for additional agreements in a separate addendum, creating a contradiction and uncertainty as to what constitutes the 'entire agreement'. This could lead to disputes over whether the written agreement encompasses the full scope of the understanding between the parties.",

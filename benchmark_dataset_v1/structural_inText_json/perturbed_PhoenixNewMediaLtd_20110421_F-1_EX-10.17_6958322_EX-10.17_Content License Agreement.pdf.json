                "original_text": "9.2\nUpon confirmation by the licensor in writing prior to the expiration of the term hereof, this Agreement may be extended for as long as may be agreed to by both the licensor and licensee through negotiation, provided, however, that the licensee shall not have the right to decide the extension of the term hereof.",
                "changed_text": "9.2\nUpon confirmation by either the licensor or the licensee in writing prior to the expiration of the term hereof, this Agreement may be extended for a term of one (1) year. The terms of such extension shall be solely at the discretion of the licensee, without any required negotiation with the licensor.",
                "explanation": "Article 9.2 originally stated that the agreement could be extended upon written confirmation by the licensor, with the extension term agreed upon by both parties through negotiation, and explicitly denying the licensee the right to decide on the extension. The modified version introduces a contradiction by stating that either party's confirmation is sufficient, sets a fixed one-year extension term, and grants the licensee sole discretion over the extension terms without negotiation, directly conflicting with the original text's intent and creating uncertainty about the extension process.",

                "original_text": "5.1\nBoth Parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to Program Content licensed to Party B hereunder, Party B shall not have any copyright or any other Intellectual Property Right. If Party B obtains any Intellectual Property Right in respect of the Program Content during its use of the same, Party B shall notify Party A and, upon its request in writing, sign all documents and take all actions required to assign such Intellectual Property Right to Party A, and ensure the Intellectual Property Right so obtained by Party A is legitimate, complete, and free from any encumbrance.",
                "changed_text": "5.1\nBoth Parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to Program Content licensed to Party B hereunder, Party B shall retain full copyright and all other Intellectual Property Rights developed during the use of the Program Content. Party B is not required to notify Party A of any Intellectual Property Rights obtained and is not obligated to assign these rights to Party A. Party B has the exclusive right to license, sell, or otherwise exploit any Intellectual Property Rights developed from the Program Content.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that Party B has no Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and must assign any IPRs they obtain back to Party A. The modification directly contradicts this by stating that Party B retains full copyright and all IPRs, is not required to notify Party A, and has the exclusive right to exploit those rights. This creates a significant conflict regarding ownership and control of IPRs.",

                "changed_text": "13.1\nParty B may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any affiliate without Party A’s consent. The successors and permitted assigns of Party B shall be bound by this Agreement, however, Party A’s obligations to the new assignee are subject to Party B remaining liable for the assignee's performance.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly prohibits Party B from assigning its rights and obligations without Party A's written consent. The changed text directly contradicts this by allowing Party B to assign its rights and obligations to any affiliate without obtaining Party A's consent. The added stipulation that Party B remains liable does not negate the contradiction regarding the need for Party A's consent, it just adds a condition to the otherwise now permissable assignment.",

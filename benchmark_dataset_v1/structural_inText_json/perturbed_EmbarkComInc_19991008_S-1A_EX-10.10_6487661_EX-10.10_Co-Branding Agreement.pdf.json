                "changed_text": "Wherever used in this Agreement with initial terms capitalized, the\nfollowing terms shall have the following defined meanings:\n      \"CO-BRANDED PAGES\" means pages of the Snap Web Site, to be developed\npursuant to Section 2.2  [CO-BRANDED PAGES] and hosted on the Snap Web Site, that display the\nSnap Brand Features, but may or may not display the Sponsor Brand Features. The inclusion of Sponsor Brand Features is subject to Snap's sole discretion, along with such Sponsor\nContent, Snap Content and other content as the parties may agree upon.",
                "explanation": "The original definition mandates that Co-Branded Pages display both Snap and Sponsor Brand Features. The modified definition makes the display of Sponsor Brand Features discretionary, controlled solely by Snap, which contradicts the idea of co-branding and potentially disadvantages the Sponsor.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a 5-year confidentiality period and 'at least reasonable measures' of protection. The modification shortens the period to 1 year and gives each party discretion over the measures taken, creating uncertainty about the actual level of protection and contradicting the original intent of a stricter confidentiality agreement.",

The modification allows Snap to terminate immediately with only oral notice based on subjective 'expectations' related to user data or opportunities, giving Snap more flexibility and contradicting the earlier specific terms.",

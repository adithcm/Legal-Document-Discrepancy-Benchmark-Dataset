The Servicer will not resign as Servicer under this Agreement unless it determines it is legally unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Servicer will notify the Issuer, the Parent Support Provider, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee of its resignation as soon as practicable after it determines it is required to resign, together with an Opinion of Counsel supporting its determination. The Issuer will promptly notify the Rating Agencies of any resignation of the Servicer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document, immediately upon the resignation of Cellco as Servicer pursuant to this Section 7.1, Cellco, in its individual capacity, will be required to assume the obligations of the Servicer to acquire Receivables as set forth in Sections 3.4 and 4.7 of the Master Trust Receivables Transfer Agreement and Sections 2.5 and 2.6 of this Agreement without further action.",

The Servicer may resign as Servicer under this Agreement at any time by providing 30 days written notice to the Issuer, the Parent Support Provider, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee.

                "explanation": "The original text states the servicer can only resign if legally unable to perform, requires an opinion of counsel, and requires notification to rating agencies. The modified version contradicts this by allowing resignation at any time with 30 days notice, removing the requirement for an opinion of counsel, and eliminating the notification requirement to rating agencies. Additionally, the original required Cellco to assume certain obligations upon resignation which is contradicted in the changed text.",

Within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year for which a report on Form 10-K is required to be filed with the Commission by or on behalf of the Issuer (commencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020), the Servicer will deliver an Officer’s Certificate to the Administrator, the Depositor, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee to the effect that (A) a review of the Servicer’s activities during the prior fiscal year (or since the Closing Date in the case of the first such Officer’s Certificate) and of its performance under this Agreement has been made under the supervision of the officer executing such Officer’s Certificate and (B) to the best of his or her knowledge, based on the review, the Servicer has fulfilled in all material respects its obligations under this Agreement, or, if there has been a failure to fulfill any such obligation in any material respect, specifying each such failure known to such officer and the nature and status of the failure.",

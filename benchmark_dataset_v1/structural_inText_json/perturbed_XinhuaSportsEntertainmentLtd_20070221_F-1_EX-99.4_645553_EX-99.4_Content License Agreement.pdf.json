                "explanation": "The original text grants XFN non-exclusive rights in China, while ensuring CEIS will not appoint other licensees.

In such event, CEIS shall not be liable for any damages or losses incurred by XFN.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a 20-year term subject to termination under Clause 8. The added sentence creates an additional termination right for CEIS, exercisable at any time without cause, which contradicts the initial 20-year term and makes Clause 8 potentially irrelevant.",

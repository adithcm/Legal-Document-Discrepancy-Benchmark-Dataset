(hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement.

(hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement. This Amendment shall apply to said PCQ and ABW; however, its application to their subsidiaries and related companies is subject to separate written agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the amendment applies to PCQ and ABW and *all* of their subsidiaries and related companies. The modified text contradicts this by stating that while it applies to PCQ and ABW, application to their subsidiaries and related companies requires a *separate written agreement*. This creates uncertainty about whether the amendment automatically extends to the subsidiaries and related companies, thus creating a contradiction.",

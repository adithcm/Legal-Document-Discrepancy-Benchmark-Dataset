                "explanation": "The original text states that a seller can own up to 5% of publicly traded securities of a competitor. The modified text increases this limit to 15%, creating a contradiction. This causes uncertainty about the allowable level of passive investment. Also, the original allows routine, day-to-day transactions with any entity while the new version forces those same transactions to be pre-approved by the buyer.",

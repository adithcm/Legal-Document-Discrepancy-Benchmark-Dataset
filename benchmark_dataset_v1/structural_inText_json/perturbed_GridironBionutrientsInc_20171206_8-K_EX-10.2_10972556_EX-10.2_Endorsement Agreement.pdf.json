Other products of the\nCompany may be added to the list of Licensed Products during the Contract Period by written amendment to this\nAgreement. All amendments to this Agreement must be signed by all parties to this Agreement.",

The Company has the sole discretion to modify the list of “Licensed Products” during the Contract Period without written amendment to this Agreement. No amendment to this agreement is necessary for the company to alter the defined list of licensed products.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that other products may be added to the list of Licensed Products only by written amendment signed by all parties, whereas the modified text gives the company the sole discretion to change the list of licensed products during the contract period without an amendment. This creates a contradiction regarding the process for adding or removing \"Licensed Products,\" which has implications for how royalties are calculated and overall obligations of the parties.",

Where the following per Unit conversion shall apply for the initial term of this Agreement:",
                "explanation": "The original text states that donations will continue on a quarterly basis 'for the term of this agreement.' The modified version adds 'at the Company's discretion,' contradicting the original commitment for the entirety of the agreement. This introduces uncertainty about the duration of the donation commitment and allows the company to cease donations at any point.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that NFLA-NC 'will donate 15%' creating an obligation. The modified text changes this to 'may donate up to 15% dependent on budget availability' removing the mandatory nature and introducing a condition. Also, the original text stated that the Company 'will provide' a sales report. The modified text changes this to 'will endeavor to provide' and adds the condition of 'contingent upon internal resource availability.' This contradiction undermines the duty to provide accurate sales reports.",

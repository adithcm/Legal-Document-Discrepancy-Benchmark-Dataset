                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause. The original stated that no capital contribution is required unless mutually agreed. The revision mandates an initial contribution, making the requirement unconditional, creating uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity about the term of the joint venture. It states the venture continues indefinitely but also that it terminates on a specific date unless extended, creating a contradiction about the venture's lifespan.",

No Joint Venturer shall be authorized or empowered to mortgage, hypothecate, pledge, sell, or transfer, an interest in the Joint Venture, nor confer on any successor or assignee the right to become a Joint Venturer without the consent of the other Joint Venturer. However, each Joint Venturer retains the right to sell their interest to a third party provided they notify the other Joint Venturer of their intention in writing 30 days prior to the sale.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the sale of interest. The original prohibits selling without consent, but the addition allows selling with only a 30-day notice, regardless of the other party's consent. This introduces uncertainty regarding the ability to sell the interest",

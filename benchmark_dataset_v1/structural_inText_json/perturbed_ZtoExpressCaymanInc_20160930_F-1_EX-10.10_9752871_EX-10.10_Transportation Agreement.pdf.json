                "explanation": "The original text specifies that Party A can only terminate for breach of contract by Party B. The modified version states Party A can terminate at any time, with or without cause, contradicting the limited termination rights originally granted and creating uncertainty for Party B.",

            {
                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "10. Party B shall obtain Party A’s written consent in the case the early termination of the Agreement.  Party B shall pay one-month freight as liquidated damages in case of termination of the Agreement without consent. Within the contract period, Party B shall not charge the freight difference if Party A rents same-level vehicles. Party B shall also compensate Party A’s other losses.",
                "changed_text": "10. Party B may only terminate this Agreement with Party A’s express written consent, which Party A may withhold for any reason. If Party B terminates this Agreement without Party A's explicit consent, or if Party A terminates the contract according to Section 9, Party B shall be liable for liquidated damages equivalent to three months' freight, as well as any other losses incurred by Party A. If Party A terminates the contract for any reason other than a material breach by Party B, Party A will be responsible for finding suitable replacement carriers for Party B.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly alters the termination clause for Party B, making it extremely difficult for Party B to terminate. Also, the new language imposes a significantly larger penalty on Party B for unapproved termination (3 months freight instead of one), while adding a convoluted and vaguely defined condition where Party A helps find a replacement carrier when they terminate it.  It is also inconsistent with the changes in section 9. The original clause specified only early termination. Furthermore, it contradicts the modified section 9, because it indicates that Party A needs to find a suitable replacement when the contract is terminated. ",

                "changed_text": "The Software License will be provided at no charge. Maintenance Services shall be subject to standard maintenance fees outlined in a separate addendum to this agreement, which is subject to change at Supplier's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that both the software license and maintenance were provided free of charge. The modified text contradicts this by stating that while the software license remains free, maintenance services are now subject to fees. This creates uncertainty about the actual cost of the agreement and what Bank of America will ultimately pay for maintenance.",

                "original_text": "Thereafter, the Maintenance Term shall automatically renew for successive period, 12 months, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement unless Bank of America terminates Maintenance Services pursuant to this Agreement. Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services for convenience at any time in accordance with the Section entitled “Termination” of the Agreement. If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, Bank of America shall have the right to reinstate the Maintenance Services without paying any reinstatement fee.",
                "changed_text": "Thereafter, the Maintenance Term shall automatically renew for successive periods of 12 months at Supplier's discretion. Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services only for material breach of this Agreement. If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, reinstatement will be subject to a reinstatement fee determined by the Supplier based on the duration of termination and prevailing market rates at the time of reinstatement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several contradictions. First, it shifts the power to renew the maintenance term from automatic renewal based on the original agreement to Supplier's discretion. This contradicts the original terms and conditions. Second, it restricts Bank of America's ability to terminate, removing 'for convenience' and only allowing termination for material breach. This directly contradicts the original termination clause. Finally, it imposes a reinstatement fee, contradicting the original clause stating no reinstatement fee would be charged. This creates significant uncertainty about the control Bank of America has over the maintenance services and costs.",

                "original_text": "Notwithstanding anything set forth elsewhere in this Agreement (or below), the Maintenance Period shall be twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including Bank of America holidays.",
                "changed_text": "The Maintenance Period shall be defined as standard business hours (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM EST), Monday through Friday, excluding Bank of America holidays. Extended support hours may be available at an additional cost, subject to Supplier's availability.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly stated that maintenance would be provided 24/7, including holidays. The modified text directly contradicts this by limiting the maintenance period to standard business hours and excluding weekends. This creates ambiguity regarding the level of support Bank of America can expect outside of regular business hours and introduces the possibility of additional costs for extended support, which were not present in the original agreement.",

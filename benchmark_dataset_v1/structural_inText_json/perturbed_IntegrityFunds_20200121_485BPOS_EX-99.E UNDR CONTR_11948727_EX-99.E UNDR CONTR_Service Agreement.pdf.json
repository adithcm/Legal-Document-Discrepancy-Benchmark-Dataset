This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) on 60 days’ written notice, by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or (b) on 90 days’ written notice by Integrity. This Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).",

Following this initial term, the agreement's continuation will be subject to a simple majority vote of the Integrity Funds Distributor, LLC. This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) on 60 days’ written notice, by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or (b) on 90 days’ written notice by Integrity. This Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies automatic renewal with specific approval requirements by the Fund's Board of Trustees and Qualified Trustees. The modified text introduces a contradiction by stating the renewal is subject to a simple majority vote of Integrity Funds Distributor, LLC, conflicting with the original approval process and creating uncertainty about the renewal terms.",

Integrity’s agreement to indemnify the Fund, its officers and trustees, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon Integrity’s being notified of any action brought against the Fund, its officers or trustees, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or telegram addressed to Integrity at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to Integrity by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify Integrity of any such action shall not relieve Integrity from any liability that Integrity may have to the Fund, its officers or trustees, or to such controlling person by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of Integrity’s indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.2. Integrity agrees to notify the Fund promptly of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against Integrity or any of its officers or governors in connection with the issuance and sale of any Shares.",

The modified text removes this limitation, stating that Integrity will indemnify the Fund regardless of whether the claims arise out of Integrity's actions. This creates a contradiction by expanding Integrity's indemnification obligations beyond what was originally agreed upon, potentially exposing Integrity to broader liability.",

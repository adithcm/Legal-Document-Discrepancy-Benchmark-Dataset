                "explanation": "The original clause grants Lifeway a *perpetual* license. The modified clause states that the license is limited to the term of the agreement, creating a contradiction about the license's duration. This introduces uncertainty about Lifeway's rights after the agreement's initial term.",

Compensation\n(a) In consideration of the rights granted by Individual hereunder, Lifeway agrees to pay Individual a royalty (the \"Royalty\") equal to $0.02 for each Lifeway product or individual item sold by Lifeway during each calendar month of the Term bearing Individual's first name, last name or other identifying personal characteristicsÍ¾ provided, however, the Royalty will cease being paid upon the death of Individual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Royalty will not exceed $50,000 in any month. All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month for sales during the previous month.\n(b) All amounts due under this Agreement are net of any applicable taxes, duties, fees or governmental charges, including without limitation, transfer tax, sales tax, use tax, consumption tax, value-added tax, excise tax, import tax, export tax, and custom duties (collectively \"Taxes\"). Accordingly, Lifeway will be solely responsible for the payment of all Taxes, together with any related liabilities (including interest and penalties), imposed upon it by law or any governmental authority for which Lifeway is primarily liable.\n(c) The Royalty due hereunder shall be paid to Individual at the address set forth above.",

Any such adjustments will be communicated to the Individual in writing prior to implementation.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed royalty and conditions for cessation. The modified text introduces 'Lifeway reserves the right to adjust the Royalty payment based on market conditions' which creates uncertainty and contradicts the initially defined, seemingly fixed, royalty. This gives Lifeway discretionary power to alter the compensation, conflicting with the original intention of the clause.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires mutual consent for assignment. The modified clause allows Lifeway to assign its rights to affiliates without the Individual's consent, while still requiring Lifeway's consent for the Individual's assignment. This introduces an imbalance in assignment rights, creating a contradiction and potential disputes regarding assignment flexibility.",

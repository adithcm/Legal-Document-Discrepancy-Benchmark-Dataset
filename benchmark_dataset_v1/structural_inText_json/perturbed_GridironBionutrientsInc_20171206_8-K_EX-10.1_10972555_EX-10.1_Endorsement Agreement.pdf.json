                "explanation": "The original text defines a clear 3-year term. The modification suggests that the NFLA can extend the contract indefinitely, contradicting the originally defined end date and any termination clauses, creating uncertainty about the actual contract duration.",

GRANT OF RIGHTS\n \nIn consideration of the remuneration to be paid to the NFLA-NC pursuant to this Agreement, the NFLA grants to Company and to its authorized distributors and sublicenses the right and license during the Contract Period to use the NFLA Identification solely in connection with the advertisement, marketing and promotion of the Products within the Contract Territory as set forth in this Agreement. NFLA agrees not to grant the right to use the NFLAs Identification to anyone other than Company in connection with the advertisement and promotion of Products.",

GRANT OF RIGHTS\n \nIn consideration of the remuneration to be paid to the NFLA-NC pursuant to this Agreement, the NFLA grants to Company and to its authorized distributors and sublicenses the right and license during the Contract Period to use the NFLA Identification solely in connection with the advertisement, marketing and promotion of the Products within the Contract Territory as set forth in this Agreement. NFLA retains the right to grant similar rights to other companies at its discretion, even if those rights are directly competitive with the Company.  The NFLA will attempt to notify Company of new agreements, but is not obligated to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants the Company exclusive rights to use the NFLA Identification for product promotion. The modified version allows the NFLA to grant similar rights to others, undermining the company's exclusive right and potentially leading to direct competition. This contradicts the initial grant of exclusive rights.",

                "changed_text": "SECTION FOUR. REMUNERATION\n \nIn consideration of the endorsement rights granted under this Agreement, Company shall provide the following remuneration:\n \nA. An initial one-time license fee of $35,000.00USD (Thirty-Five Thousand Dollars) payable to the NFLA-NC; this fee is subject to renegotiation after the first year of the contract, and may be increased based on the NFLA-NC's assessment of market conditions.\n \nB. A one-time $10,000USD (Ten Thousand Dollars) promotional fee payable to NFLA. This fee is contingent upon NFLA adequately promoting Company products. NFLA retains the right to reduce the amount for lack of product promotion. The $10,000 promotional fee shall be payable in four (4) quarterly payments beginning in 2018: Q1 ($2500); Q2 ($2500); Q3 ($2500); Q4 ($2500). Each payment shall be delivered by no later than the 10th day of the first month of each quarter.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines set amounts and payment schedules for the fees. Modifying part A by introducing potential fee renegotiation and increases creates ambiguity. Also, by stating in Part B that the fees are contingent upon NFLA performance, there is ambiguity. These contradictions can lead to disputes about how much the company owes. The phrases undermine the initial fixed nature of remuneration specified.",

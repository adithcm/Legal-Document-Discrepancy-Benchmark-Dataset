                "explanation": "The original text grants an 'exclusive' license, preventing Licensor from licensing the domain names to others. The changed text makes the license 'non-exclusive,' implying Licensor can license to others, creating a contradiction. Additionally, originally the license was 'non-transferable' and 'non-sublicensable' but now is 'transferable' and 'sublicensable'.",

However, Licensee shall handle day-to-day content updates.",
                "explanation": "The original section states the 'Licensee' has exclusive control, but the modified text contradicts this by stating the 'Licensor' retains control over key aspects, thereby creating uncertainty as to which party has control over the content of the websites and potentially lead to conflict.",

                "explanation": "Originally, the 'Licensee' alone is responsible for compliance. Now, both the 'Licensee' and 'Licensor' are responsible. This is contradictory because it is not clear which party is liable if there is a compliance issue.",

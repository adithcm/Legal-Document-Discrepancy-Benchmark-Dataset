During the term of this agreement, the definition of indication may be revised based on market conditions or regulatory approvals as mutually agreed upon between Zogenix and the distributor. Zogenix holds the final say on which indications will be allowed.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines \"Indication\" as treatment for specific syndromes. The modified text contradicts this by stating the definition may be revised. This creates uncertainty regarding the scope of the distributor's rights, as indications could be changed unilaterally, affecting their market and sales.",

                "explanation": "The original text implies an equal number of members from each party on the JSC.

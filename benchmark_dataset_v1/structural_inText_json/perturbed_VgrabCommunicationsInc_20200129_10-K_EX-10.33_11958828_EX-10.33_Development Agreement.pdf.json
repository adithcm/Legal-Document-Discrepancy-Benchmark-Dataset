                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement will be for the maximum period of six (6) months beginning for the commencement date, renewable in accordance with the terms hereof, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement will be for a period determined at VAL's discretion, potentially lasting up to six (6) months from the commencement date. Renewal is not guaranteed and is subject to VAL's sole approval, notwithstanding any other terms. This agreement can be terminated at any time by VAL.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies a maximum term of six months and a conditional renewal. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating the period is at VAL's discretion, potentially up to six months, making the term length unclear. It also removes the conditional renewal and grants VAL the right to terminate the agreement at any time, contradicting the original clause about termination requiring specific conditions.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "VAL shall, in the event of Developer committing any breach of any of the terms and conditions of this agreement or for any other reason considered as sufficient, be entitled to terminate this agreement by giving two (2) weeks’ notice in writing and it is applicable only when the project is not completed. If the customer terminates the agreement, then VAL shall compensate the Developer up to the date of termination with a fee calculated on Pro-rata basis. Developer may also terminate this Agreement by giving two (2) weeks’ notice in writing to VAL. It is applicable only when the project is not completed. In case Developer terminates the agreement, it shall handover the entire project related IPR, work done till date to VAL.",
                "changed_text": "VAL shall have the right to terminate this agreement at any time, with or without cause, upon providing written notice to Developer. If VAL terminates the agreement, VAL will determine whether to compensate the developer. Developer may terminate this agreement with two (2) weeks’ notice, however, VAL will determine whether the developer needs to handover the project. Whether handing over the project or not will be at VAL's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides specific conditions for VAL's termination (breach or sufficient reason) and guarantees pro-rata compensation to the Developer. The modified text introduces uncertainty by giving VAL the right to terminate \"at any time, with or without cause\" and removes the guarantee of pro-rata compensation, instead stating VAL will \"determine whether to compensate.\" It also gives the idea that handing over the project or not after the developer terminates it will be at VAL's discretion. This contradiction could cause disputes over termination rights and compensation.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All Intellectual Property during the project is owned by VAL, and will be turned over to VAL at the conclusion of the project by Developer and after the fulfillment of all commercial obligations by the VAL.\nAll rights and title to Duesey Coffee Intellectual Property created pursuant to the Project shall belong to VAL and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "All Intellectual Property created during the project may be owned by either VAL or the Developer, depending on the specific contribution made by each party. The determination of ownership will be decided by VAL at the conclusion of the project, unless a separate agreement regarding specific IP is established. All rights and title to Duesey Coffee Intellectual Property are subject to negotiations between the parties and the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that all IP is owned by VAL. The revised text introduces ambiguity by stating IP \"may be owned by either VAL or the Developer\" and that the decision of ownership is at VAL's discretion, creating a contradiction about who owns the IP. It also inserts a lack of certainty by stating that rights and titles are 'subject to negotiations' while the original text states it shall belong to VAL. This contradiction creates uncertainty about IP ownership and could lead to disputes.",

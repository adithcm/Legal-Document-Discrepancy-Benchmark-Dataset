For clarity, Licensed Product may or may not be covered by one or more claims of a CytoDyn Patent or CytoDyn Know-How.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Licensed Product\" explicitly states that it must be used for the treatment of HIV infection, that CytoDyn is currently evaluating. The modified definition broadens the scope to include treatment of *any* infection, directly contradicting the original intent and Field definition. Furthermore, the original definition requires the product to be covered by CytoDyn Patent or Know-How, while the modified text removes this requirement creating uncertainty about the scope of the agreement.",

The term of this Agreement (“Term”) shall commence upon the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Article 11, shall expire on the last day of the Royalty Term. Upon the expiration of the Royalty Term, the license granted to Vyera under Section 2.1 of this Agreement shall become non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty free, perpetual and irrevocable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Vyera exercises the Continuation Right (as defined in the Supply Agreement), then Vyera shall continue to purchase Licensed Product from CytoDyn pursuant to the Supply Agreement and shall pay CytoDyn for such Licensed Product the price specified in the Supply Agreement and a royalty equal to [***], provided that after the exercise of the Continuation Right, CytoDyn will not be obligated to supply Licensed Product exclusively to Vyera in the Field in the Territory.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that, after exercising the Continuation Right, CytoDyn is *not* obligated to exclusively supply the Licensed Product to Vyera in the Field in the Territory. By removing this clause in the changed text, it can be inferred that CytoDyn *is* still obligated to exclusively supply Licensed Product to Vyera, which directly contradicts the original clause. This creates uncertainty as to whether exclusivity continues after the Royalty Term if Vyera exercises the Continuation Right.",

                "explanation": "The original text indicates that CytoDyn must exercise its right to terminate the agreement within [***] of events (a)-(d) occurring. The modified text removes (a) from this list, implying that Cytodyn could exercise termination right for (a) without a limited time frame after it becomes aware that Vyera challenged the CytoDyn Patents or that it has no time limitation. The inconsistency in the time frame for exercising the right to terminate for patent challenges vs other breaches creates uncertainty about CytoDyn's termination rights and enforcement.",

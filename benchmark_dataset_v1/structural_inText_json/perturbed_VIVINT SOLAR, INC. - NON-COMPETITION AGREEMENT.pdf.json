This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the “Sales\nTerm” as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar\nDeveloper, LLC (the “Term”).”",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date. The term of this agreement is indefinite and continues until explicitly terminated by mutual written agreement of both parties.”",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement continues until the expiration of the Sales Term. The modified text states the agreement has an indefinite term and continues until explicitly terminated. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the term and duration of the non-solicitation agreement, making enforcement unclear.",

Notwithstanding any other provision in this agreement, all terms of the Non-Competition Agreement including term and scope are subject to change at Vivint Solar's sole discretion and without notice. ",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Non-Competition Agreement continues in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. The modified text states that all terms are subject to change at Vivint Solar's sole discretion. This contradicts the continuation of the original terms and creates uncertainty about which terms are actually enforceable, particularly regarding the scope of prohibited activities.",

This Amendment is governed by the Master Framework Agreement, including,\nwithout limitation, the provisions of Sections 4 (Confidentiality) and 6 (Miscellaneous) of the Master Framework Agreement. However, nothing in the Master Framework Agreement shall supersede the right of Vivint, Inc. to engage in competitive activities, regardless of any conflicting clauses in this Non-Competition Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement is governed by the Master Framework Agreement, including confidentiality provisions. The modified text adds a clause stating that Vivint, Inc. has the right to engage in competitive activities regardless of any conflicting clauses in the Non-Competition Agreement. This directly contradicts the purpose of the non-competition agreement and creates uncertainty about whether Vivint, Inc. is actually bound by any non-competition restrictions. This weakens the entire agreement.",

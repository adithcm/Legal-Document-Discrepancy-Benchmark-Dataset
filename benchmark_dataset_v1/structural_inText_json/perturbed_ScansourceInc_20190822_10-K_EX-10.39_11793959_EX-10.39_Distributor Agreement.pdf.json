If the Agreement\nexpired prior to the Amendment Effective Date, any orders received and Products and Services purchased between the date of expiration and the\nAmendment Effective Date shall be in all respects deemed made under the Agreement as in effect prior to this Amendment. The parties further\nagree that if Distributor places Purchase Orders after the expiration of the Agreement, and Cisco accepts such Purchase Orders, then any such\nPurchase Orders shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Agreement; provided, however that acceptance by Cisco of any Purchase\nOrder placed after the Agreement has expired will not be considered as an extension of the term of the Agreement nor a renewal thereof.\nNotwithstanding Cisco’s right to extend the term of the Agreement, each party acknowledges that the Agreement shall always be interpreted as\nbeing limited in duration to a definite term and that the other party has made no commitments whatsoever regarding the renewal of the Agreement\nbeyond those expressly agreed in writing.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that accepting purchase orders after the agreement expires does *not* constitute a renewal or extension. The modified text contradicts this by stating that such acceptance *does* constitute an automatic extension and renewal. This creates uncertainty about the term of the agreement and under what conditions it can be extended.",

The modified text says that the distributor *may* return products, but this is at *Cisco's* discretion. Also the original text mentions that the distributor has the sole responsibility to manage balancing cap while the modified text mentions it is on Cisco. The original text states DOA and obsolete Products are excluded from calculation while modified text states they are included. Lastly, it changes how the amount of credit is calculated.",

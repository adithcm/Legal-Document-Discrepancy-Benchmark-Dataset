                "changed_text": "1.5 \"Co-Branded Service\" means the service to be developed\nunder this Agreement, including Enhancements, which may be offered to Dassault\nSystemes Customers via any web site at PlanetCad's discretion and may contain any application services.\nIt does not have to be substantially similar to those currently offered and sold on the PlanetCAD Web site(s) as of the Effective Date\nunder the product name 3Dshare.com, and may or may not be based upon the CBD Software.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the co-branded service with specific limitations on its features and target audience, offered through Dassault Systemes websites. The modified version broadens this definition by allowing PlanetCAD to host and offering any application services, potentially contradicting the original intent of a co-branded, Dassault Systemes-centric service. Creates uncertainty on what the final service should entail.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies joint ownership of know-how, allowing both parties to use it. The modified clause assigns ownership to the contributing party, restricting the other party's use, thus contradicting the initial joint ownership agreement. This creates uncertainty about who can use the know-how developed during the agreement. Can cause legal disputes for future use of data or code made during the deal.",

                "explanation": "The original text says the contract automatically renews, unless one party says otherwise 6 months prior. The change states the contract can be cancelled at any time, even with a prior agreement to renew. This invalidates the original terms for renewal, thus causing a contradiction.",

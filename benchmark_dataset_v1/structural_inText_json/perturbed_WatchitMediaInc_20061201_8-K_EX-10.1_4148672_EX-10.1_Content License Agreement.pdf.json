                "original_text": "Watchit shall have the exclusive right to sell third party advertising as sponsors of their content and will have the right to brand the content under the Watchit brand and place a “bug” on the screen identifying the content with a Watchit trademark.",
                "changed_text": "Watchit shall have the exclusive right to sell third party advertising as sponsors of their content and will have the right to brand the content under the Watchit brand and place a “bug” on the screen identifying the content with a Watchit trademark. However, Oceanic Time Warner Cable reserves the right to approve all advertising and branding elements before they are implemented.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives Watchit the 'exclusive right' to sell advertising. The added sentence gives Oceanic Time Warner Cable the right to approve advertising, thus negating Watchit's 'exclusive right'. This creates a contradiction regarding who has the final say on advertising content.",

                "changed_text": "Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to not edit or modify the above content. However, Oceanic Time Warner Cable retains the right to make necessary technical adjustments to ensure compatibility with its broadcasting systems.",
                "explanation": "Initially, Oceanic Time Warner Cable cannot edit or modify content. The added clause allows for 'necessary technical adjustments.' This is a contradiction as 'adjustments' could be interpreted as modifications. The ambiguity creates uncertainty regarding the extent to which Oceanic Time Warner Cable can alter the content.",

                "changed_text": "This agreement will be in effect until the end of 2006 and will be evaluated at that time. However, unless either party provides written notice of termination 30 days prior to December 31, 2006, the agreement will automatically renew for an additional year.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement ends in 2006 and will be evaluated. The added clause introduces automatic renewal unless there is a termination notice. This creates a contradiction, as the agreement is no longer definitively ending in 2006, but potentially renewing, making the original end date uncertain.",

This license is transferable and sublicensable with written approval from the Licensor, and subject to royalty fees as determined by the Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the license is nontransferable, nonsublicensable, and royalty-free. The modified text contradicts this by making the license transferable and sublicensable with written approval and subject to royalty fees.

                "explanation": "The original text requires a 30-day notice for termination by either party. The modified text adds an exception allowing the Licensor to terminate immediately for intellectual property violations. This contradicts the original clause and creates uncertainty about the conditions for termination.",

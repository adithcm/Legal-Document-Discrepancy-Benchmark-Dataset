                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.22 “Royalty” means the royalty on Net Sales of Product in the Indication, as set forth in Article Three below.",
                "changed_text": "1.22 “Royalty” means a potential payment on Net Sales of Product, the applicability of which is determined solely at ArTara's discretion, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article Three.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Royalty' clearly states it is as set forth in Article Three. The modified definition makes the royalty payment discretionary, directly contradicting the fixed royalty structure detailed in Article Three. This creates uncertainty about whether the University will actually receive royalties.",

                "changed_text": "4.2 License. University hereby grants to ArTara a non-exclusive license to use the Program Data; the University retains the right to grant licenses to other parties for similar use of the Program Data. ArTara's license is restricted to internal research purposes and is not to be used in Regulatory Filings without prior written approval from the University. Such approval may be withheld at the University's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants ArTara an exclusive license for the program data. The modified text changes this to a non-exclusive license, directly contradicting the original grant. Further, it restricts the use of the data, thereby reducing the value of the license, this introduces uncertainty on how and when ArTara could use Program Data. It will allow University to grant licenses for Program Data to multiple parties and therefore decreasing ArTara's unique position. The modified text contradicts the exclusivity granted, potentially leading to disputes about ArTara's rights.",

Either Party may terminate the Project and all commitments and obligations with respect thereto, subject to Section 8.3 herein, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other Party. In the event of any termination of the Project by University, (a) University agrees to complete Phase I and II of the Project, and (b) ArTara will continue to provide annual funding until the completion of Phase II. Upon termination of the Project by ArTara this Agreement will terminate subject to Section 8.3 and ArTara will reassign to University the IND if assignment thereof previously occurred pursuant to Section 4.3.",

Either Party may terminate the Project and all commitments and obligations with respect thereto, subject to Section 8.3 herein, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other Party. In the event of any termination of the Project by University, (a) University *may* agree to complete Phase I and II of the Project, dependent on resource availability, and (b) ArTara *may* continue to provide annual funding until the completion of Phase II, if deemed beneficial by ArTara. Upon termination of the Project by ArTara this Agreement *may not* terminate subject to Section 8.3 and ArTara will reassign to University the IND if assignment thereof previously occurred pursuant to Section 4.3, *unless ArTara has other plans for IND*.",
                "explanation": "The original termination clause provides clear obligations upon termination by either party. The modified clause makes these obligations conditional and discretionary using words such as *may*, *dependent on resource availability*, and *if deemed beneficial by ArTara*. The change creates uncertainty about the responsibilities of each party upon termination of the project, making it unclear whether the University is obligated to complete certain project phases. ArTara will have the upper hand on choosing IND options with that change.",

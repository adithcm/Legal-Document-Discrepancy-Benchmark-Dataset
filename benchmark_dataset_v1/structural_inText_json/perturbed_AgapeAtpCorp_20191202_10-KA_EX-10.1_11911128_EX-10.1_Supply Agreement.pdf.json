                "original_text": "1.2\nTerm\nThis agreement is for a term of ten (10) years.\n1.3\nRenewal\nThis agreement will be automatically renewed at the end of every ten (10) year term, with each subsequent term of renewal being for a ten\n(10) year term. A six (6) months notice must be given by either party of their intention to terminate relations due to any reason other than\nbreach of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "1.2\nTerm\nThis agreement is for a term of ten (10) years.\n1.3\nRenewal\nThis agreement may be renewed at the end of every ten (10) year term, subject to the Manufacturer's sole discretion. The Manufacturer is under no obligation to renew this agreement, and may choose not to renew for any reason, or no reason at all, without being considered in breach of this agreement. A six (6) months notice must be given by either party of their intention to terminate relations due to any reason other than breach of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement will be automatically renewed, implying a mandatory renewal. The modified text introduces the Manufacturer's 'sole discretion' regarding renewal, directly contradicting the automatic renewal clause. This creates uncertainty about the agreement's duration.",

However, the Manufacturer reserves the right to sell products listed in this agreement, or product name (as listed in schedule A of this agreement) to other parties in specific territories outside of the Customer's primary marketing focus, as determined by the Manufacturer. The Customer's written consent will still be required for direct sales within the Customer's territories.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits the Manufacturer from selling products to other parties without the Customer's consent. The modification introduces an exception allowing sales in territories the Manufacturer deems outside the Customer's 'primary marketing focus'. This creates a contradiction and ambiguity about the exclusivity granted to the Customer and introduces a subjective standard for enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "13.2\nThe Manufacturer grants exclusive rights to the Customer for the term of ten (10) years from the date of the signing of this agreement. Whether or not the Customer fulfills the minimum annual purchase requirement as listed in Schedule B. of this agreement does not guarantee an indefinite period but is a factor in the Manufacturer's decision, but is not binding. The Manufacturer can still terminate this agreement at any time.",
                "explanation": "The original text appears to guarantee an indefinite extension of exclusive rights if purchase requirements are met. The modification severely weakens this by stating that even fulfillment of the requirements does not guarantee indefinite rights and allows for termination at any time, directly conflicting with the initial impression of a guaranteed extension. This creates significant uncertainty for the Customer regarding the long-term exclusivity of the agreement.",

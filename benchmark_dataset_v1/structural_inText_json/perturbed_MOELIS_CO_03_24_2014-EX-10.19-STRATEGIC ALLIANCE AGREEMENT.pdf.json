This Agreement shall be effective as of January 1, 2012 (the “Effective Date”), provided, however, that, ARTICLE XII and\nARTICLE XIII shall not be effective until after the Closing. The initial term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for\nthree (3) years, subject to the prior termination rights provided below. At the end of such initial term, and any renewed term, as applicable, this\nAgreement may renew for an additional one (1) year term, with or without notice. The decision to renew will be solely at the discretion of Moelis Holdings.",
                "explanation": "The original text specified an automatic renewal unless notice was provided, but the modified version implies that Moelis Holdings can choose to renew or not regardless of any notice. This introduces conflict about the renewal terms, as it is now uncertain whether it needs explicit agreement or auto-renews.",

The parties agree that there is no obligation to be jointly retained as co-advisors by a Client on assignments within the scope of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text established a clear 50/50 fee sharing arrangement. This was changed to remove the certainty of fee sharing. This change undermines the certainty of the fee sharing, making it an unpredictable arrangement. This contradicts the clear fee arrangement detailed at the start of the section.",

The\nStrategic Alliance shall continue to be exclusive to Moelis Holdings.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts\" to \"may choose to work together at their own discretion\" creates contradiction because there is not now any required level of obligation. Furthermore, by changing \"non-exclusive\" to \"exclusive to Moelis Holdings\" it creates a contradiction in the agreement on whether other parties can work with those covered by this agreement.",

ADVERTISING\nSubject to paragraph 6, MediaLinx shall be entitled to sell advertising and\nsponsorships on all pages of the Co-Branded Site to Canadian advertisers (for\nthe purposes of this Agreement \"Canadian advertisers\" shall be advertisers with\nsubstantial places of business in Canada) and HCI shall be entitled to sell\nadvertising and sponsorships on all pages of the Co-Branded Site to US\nadvertisers (for the purposes of this Agreement, US advertisers shall be\nadvertisers with substantial places of business in the United States). All\nsponsorship and advertising package deals for the Co-Branded Site will be\nmutually agreed upon by the parties and shall abide by MediaLinx's and HCI's\nstandard advertising agreement and Canadian and U.S. advertising regulations and\nstandards. Any excess inventory that has not been sold is available to be sold\nby either party. Neither party shall permit advertising on the Co-Branded Site\nfrom an entity which is a competitor to the other party. For the purposes of\nthis Agreement, a \"competitor\" to MediaLinx shall be an Internet portal web site\nand/or an internet service provider. For the purposes of this Agreement, a\n\"competitor\" to HCI shall be a consumer health based web site.

                "explanation": "This change introduces several contradictions to the original text. First, it states that HCI can sell ads to Canadian advertisers, contradicting the original clear division of Canadian advertisers for MediaLinx and US advertisers for HCI. Second, it removes the need for mutual agreement on advertising packages, giving HCI sole control. Third, it removes the restriction on advertising from competitors, and further gives HCI sole determination of what constitutes a competitor to MediaLinx. These contradictions create uncertainty about advertising rights and limitations, thus making enforcement unclear.",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text regarding customer data. Originally, data collection followed both Canadian and US laws and both parties owned an interest. Now, it's only subject to US laws, HCI owns all the data, MediaLinx has full access to Personal Health Records (previously denied), and MediaLinx can freely use the data without limitation. Furthermore, the integration with Sympatico site-wide registry is removed. These create significant conflicts over data ownership, usage, and privacy, creating uncertainty in data management and compliance.",

                "explanation": "This change dramatically alters the termination clauses, creating significant contradictions. First, the agreement auto-renews unless HCI opts out, unlike the original set term. Second, HCI can terminate at any time for any reason, while MediaLinx faces significantly higher hurdles. Third, HCI can override the ownership change termination clause. Finally, HCI retains MediaLinx's marks after termination while potentially not returning property and retaining all outstanding amounts. This creates extreme imbalance and uncertainty in termination rights and obligations.",

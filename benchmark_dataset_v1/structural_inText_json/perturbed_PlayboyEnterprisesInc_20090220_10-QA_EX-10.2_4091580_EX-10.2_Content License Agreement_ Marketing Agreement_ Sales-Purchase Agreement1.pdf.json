This Agreement shall automatically renew for an additional period of three (3) years (such renewal and each subsequent renewal shall be defined as a “Renewal Term”) provided that EFS achieves Net Merchandise Sales of at least ***** during the fourth year following launch of the first Website. In such event, the annual Minimum Royalty during the Renewal Term, if any, shall be equal to the greater of: (a) ***** of the actual Royalty paid to Client in Year 5; and (b) *****. The Initial Term and any and all Renewal Terms shall be collectively referred to as the “Term.”",

This Agreement may renew for an additional period of three (3) years (such renewal and each subsequent renewal shall be defined as a “Renewal Term”) if both parties agree in writing to the renewal, irrespective of EFS achieving Net Merchandise Sales of at least ***** during the fourth year following launch of the first Website. The annual Minimum Royalty during the Renewal Term, if any, will be negotiated separately for each renewal period. The Initial Term and any and all Renewal Terms shall be collectively referred to as the “Term.”",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies an automatic renewal based on achieving a sales target, while the modified version replaces this with renewal subject to mutual written agreement. This introduces uncertainty about whether the contract auto-renews or requires active agreement.",

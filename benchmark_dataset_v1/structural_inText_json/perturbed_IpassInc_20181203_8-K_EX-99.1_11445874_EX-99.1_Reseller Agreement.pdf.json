The Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms (each a “Renewal Term”) unless either party provides the other party written notification of its intent to terminate the Agreement no later than sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then applicable term.",

The Agreement may renew for successive one (1) year terms (each a “Renewal Term”) only if both parties provide written consent to the renewal no later than sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then applicable term.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement automatically renews unless one party provides notice of termination. The modified text states that the agreement only renews if both parties provide written consent to the renewal. This creates a contradiction regarding the renewal process, making it unclear whether the agreement automatically renews or requires mutual agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that iPass may change the pricing in Exhibit C upon providing 30 days' notice to the Channel Partner. In contrast, the modified clause indicates that iPass can change the pricing without any prior notice, with the changes effective immediately.

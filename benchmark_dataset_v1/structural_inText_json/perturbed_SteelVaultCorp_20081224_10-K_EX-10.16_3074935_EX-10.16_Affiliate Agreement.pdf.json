Marketing Affiliate shall pay to Equidata, as compensation for its providing of Services under this agreement, such amounts as outlined and detailed in Exhibit A attached hereto. Such amounts shall be billed on a bi-monthly basis by Equidata and are due and payable in full by Marketing Affiliate 30 days from the invoice date. The prices set forth in Exhibit A do not include regulatory fees, sales tax, excise tax or any other fees or taxes that may be charged by states or local taxing authorities nor does it include additional fees or surcharges, including specific area Affiliate charges that may be accessed by the Credit Reporting Agencies (CRA’s). Said amounts charged to Equidata will be billed separately to Marketing Affiliate and are due immediately upon receipt. Marketing Affiliate agrees to reimburse Equidata all costs of collecting any past due amounts from Marketing Affiliate by reason of non payment, including reasonable attorney fees and disbursements.",
                "changed_text": "Marketing Affiliate shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect amounts due from the Consumer, but Equidata shall ultimately be responsible for all non-payment of fees charged to the Consumer. Marketing Affiliate shall pay to Equidata, as compensation for its providing of Services under this agreement, such amounts as outlined and detailed in Exhibit A attached hereto.

Said amounts charged to Equidata will be billed separately to Marketing Affiliate and are due immediately upon receipt. Marketing Affiliate agrees to reimburse Equidata a portion of the costs of collecting any past due amounts from Marketing Affiliate by reason of non payment. The portion of reimbursement costs will be determined by Equidata.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Marketing Affiliate bears sole responsibility for non-payment by consumers. The changed text shifts the responsibility to Equidata, creating a direct contradiction. It introduces ambiguity by stating that the Marketing Affiliate is only responsible for *reasonable efforts* in collecting payment, while Equidata is *ultimately* responsible for non-payment. Additionally, changing the requirement for full reimbursement of collection costs to a 'portion' determined by Equidata adds further uncertainty.",

This Agreement shall be for the term of one year; thereafter, the Agreement shall renew automatically under these same terms and agreements unless superceded by future agreements. 7.2. This Agreement may be terminated by either party with cause upon thirty (30) days written notice. Upon Marketing Affiliate’s default in payment or other breach of this Agreement, Equidata may terminate this Agreement without notice to Marketing Affiliate. Upon termination for any reason, Equidata reserves the right to deactivate Marketing Affiliate’s access to the services including the Equidata Web Site.

This Agreement shall be for the term of one year; thereafter, the Agreement may or may not renew under the same terms and agreements depending on market conditions. 7.2. This Agreement may be terminated by either party with cause upon thirty (30) days written notice. Upon Marketing Affiliate’s default in payment or other breach of this Agreement, Equidata may terminate this Agreement without notice to Marketing Affiliate. Upon termination for any reason, Equidata reserves the right to deactivate Marketing Affiliate’s access to the services including the Equidata Web Site. Termination may or may not release Marketing Affiliate from paying all amounts owed to Equidata depending on the reason for termination.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies an automatic renewal of the agreement for another year, giving certainty of term. The changed text makes the renewal dependent on 'market conditions', contradicting the automatic renewal provision. Furthermore, in the original, termination does not release Marketing Affiliate from paying all amounts owed to Equidata, giving it a certain obligation. The modified clause adds 'may or may not,' contradicting the original clause. This creates uncertainty about whether the Marketing Affiliate is responsible for payments after termination.",

                "explanation": "The original text strictly forbids soliciting existing Equidata customers (except for joint marketing), while the changed text directly encourages this.

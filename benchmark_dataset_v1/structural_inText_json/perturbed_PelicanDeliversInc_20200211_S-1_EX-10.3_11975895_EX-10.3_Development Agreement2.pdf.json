Any Change\nRequest shall be sufficient to identify, with clarity, any objection, correction, change or amendment to such Milestone Deliverable.

Any Change\nRequest shall be sufficient to identify, with clarity, any objection, correction, change or amendment to such Milestone Deliverable.

Acceptance is at the sole discretion of the Client.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by stating in one sentence that a Milestone Deliverable is 'deemed accepted' in the absence of a change request, while the following sentence states that acceptance is at the 'sole discretion of the Client'. This creates uncertainty about the acceptance criteria and enforcement.",

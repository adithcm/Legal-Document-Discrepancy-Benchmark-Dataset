                "original_text": "2.7 “Sponsorship Rights” means the bundle of rights, services and deliverables Allied will provide to Newegg as set out in Schedule 4, which includes the license of, and rights with respect to, Allied Marks granted in Section 5.",
                "changed_text": "2.7 “Sponsorship Rights” means the bundle of rights, services and deliverables Allied *may* provide to Newegg as set out in Schedule 4, which *may or may not* include the license of, and rights with respect to, Allied Marks granted in Section 5. The exact nature and scope of Sponsorship Rights is subject to Allied's sole discretion and availability.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"will provide\" to \"may provide\" and adding the phrase about Allied's sole discretion, this modification introduces uncertainty regarding Newegg's guaranteed Sponsorship Rights. The original definition suggested a firm commitment, while the revision makes the provision of these rights discretionary. This creates ambiguity, making it unclear what rights Newegg is actually entitled to, and introduces a contradiction with other sections that assume a defined bundle of rights.",

Further, if Sponsorship Fees have been paid in advance, the Sponsorship Fee shall be prorated through the date of termination and Allied shall refund the portion corresponding to the unused period of the Term.",
                "changed_text": "14.6 Upon termination for any reason, Newegg *may* be discharged of its obligations to pay any further Sponsorship Fees not yet rendered, subject to Allied's determination of damages incurred as a result of the termination. Further, if Sponsorship Fees have been paid in advance, the refund of any portion of the Sponsorship Fee is at the sole discretion of Allied, considering the circumstances of the termination and the value already received by Newegg.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Newegg is immediately discharged of payment obligations upon termination and that prepaid fees will be prorated and refunded. The revised text makes this discharge conditional (\"may be discharged\") and the refund discretionary (\"at the sole discretion of Allied\"). This directly contradicts the original automatic discharge and refund provisions, creating uncertainty about Newegg's financial obligations upon termination. It becomes unclear whether Newegg will still owe fees or receive a refund, potentially leading to disputes.",

Without reference to choice or conflict of law principles, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA. The Parties unconditionally submit to exclusive jurisdiction of and accept as the exclusive venue for any legal proceeding involving this Agreement the state and federal courts located in the County of Los Angeles, California. Before any Party (the “Complaining Party”) may bring any legal proceeding against the other (the “Non Complaining Party”), the Complaining Party shall first make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve all disputes privately by notifying and providing to the Non Complaining Party of the Complaining Party’s complaints, reasons and supporting evidence for the complaints, and the reasonable steps Complaining Party would like the Non Complaining Party to take in order to address the complaints. If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles County, California, by an arbitrator of JAMS, in accordance with its arbitration rules and procedures then in effect. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing Party in any dispute involving this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the other Party its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees (including any fees for expert witnesses, paralegals, or other legal service providers). This Section 15.10 shall not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "By changing all instances of \"shall\" to \"may\", the mandatory nature of the dispute resolution process, arbitration, judgment, cost recovery, and injunctive relief is removed. The original text mandates these processes with the word \"shall\", implying a legal obligation. The modified text uses \"may\", making these processes optional. This creates significant uncertainty about how disputes will be resolved, as it is unclear whether parties are obligated to follow the specified procedures. The arbitration is no longer mandatory, nor is cost recovery automatic. This contradiction could lead to disputes over the correct legal avenue for resolving issues under the agreement.",

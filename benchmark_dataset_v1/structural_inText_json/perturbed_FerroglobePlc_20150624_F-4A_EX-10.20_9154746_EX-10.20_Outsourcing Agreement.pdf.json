                "changed_text": "The present Agreement is effective as from 1 January 2009. It is established by calendar year and requires a written confirmation by both parties to renew every year.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement is 'renewed tacitly every year', implying automatic renewal. The changed text introduces a contradiction by stating that the agreement 'requires a written confirmation by both parties to renew every year', implying that explicit agreement is needed, not automatic renewal. This creates uncertainty about the renewal process.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that EIT 'commits to hand over to the Customer, on this date, all the data and its copies'. The revised text changes this to 'EIT may, at its sole discretion, hand over to the Customer, on this date, some of the data and its copies'. This introduces a direct contradiction, making it uncertain what data, if any, the Customer will receive upon termination, and thus who owns what.",

For the designation of the arbitrators and the management of the arbitration, the following rules will apply:",

For the designation of the arbitrators and the management of the arbitration, the following rules will apply:",
                "explanation": "The original text states that both parties 'agreeing to obey the decision'. The change modifies this to 'both parties encouraged to obey the decision.' This subtle change introduces uncertainty regarding the binding nature of the arbitration decision. In the first one, it is compulsory to obey the decision. But on the second one, there is no obligation to obey the arbitration's judgement.",

                "changed_text": "Hydraspin will consider repairing or replacing defective or damaged Products at the time of delivery.",
                "explanation": "By removing the guarantee of repair or replacement and replacing it with 'consider', this clause weakens the consumer's right to receive a functional product. This could contradict implied warranty laws, particularly in Texas, which mandate that goods sold must be fit for their intended purpose. It introduces legal risk as the distributor has less recourse if the products are faulty upon arrival.",

However, if not so settled, then the same shall be submitted to arbitration and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be solely and finally settled by confidential binding arbitration, except as specifically provided otherwise herein. The confidential arbitration proceeding shall be held in Collin County, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the alternative dispute resolution rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration proceeding shall be held before a single arbitrator unless (i) the matter in controversy exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), (ii) the Parties cannot agree on the arbitrator, or (iii) either Party requests a panel of three (3) arbitrators. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and any order of enforcement as the case may be. The arbitrator shall not award any Party punitive, exemplary, multiplied or consequential damages, and each Party hereby irrevocably waives any right to seek such damages in arbitration or in judicial proceedings. Each Party shall bear its own costs in the arbitration, and the fees and expenses of the arbitration shall be shared equally by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the arbitrator shall have the right and authority to apportion among the parties all reasonable costs, including attorneys’ fees and witness fees, taking into account the relative fault of the Parties. The foregoing provisions of this Section 11.9 do not limit the right of a Party to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction pending resolution of a dispute by arbitration.",

                "explanation": "Removing the sentence 'The arbitrator shall not award any Party punitive, exemplary, multiplied or consequential damages, and each Party hereby irrevocably waives any right to seek such damages in arbitration or in judicial proceedings' could be problematic. While arbitration agreements can limit damages, a complete waiver of certain damage types may be challenged, particularly if it is deemed unconscionable or against public policy under Texas law. This omission introduces legal risk by creating potential grounds for a party to contest the arbitration clause's enforceability.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'including, without limitation, insurance covering the Products during transportation and while stored at any facility' from the shipping costs section, the contract no longer explicitly requires Hydraspin to maintain insurance. This omission can be viewed as a contradiction of common commercial practices. If Hydraspin fails to insure the products during shipping and storage, and the products are damaged or destroyed, the distributor could face indirect liability or loss, despite the risk of loss being nominally borne by Hydraspin. This introduces legal risk related to potential negligence claims or breach of implied duty of good faith.",

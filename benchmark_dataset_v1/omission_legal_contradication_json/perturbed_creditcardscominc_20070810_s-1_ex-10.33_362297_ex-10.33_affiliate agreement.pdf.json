Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the amount of Commissions, the definition of Approved Accounts, and all other provisions of this Agreement are subject to change without notice other than posting such information on the Chase Website. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO AFFILIATE, THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT. AFFILIATE’S CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM FOLLOWING CHASE’S POSTING OF A NEW AGREEMENT ON ITS WEB SITE WILL CONSTITUTE BINDING ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE.",
                "changed_text": "Chase reserves the right to change any and all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, at any time and in its sole discretion. Affiliate's continued participation in the Affiliate Program will constitute acceptance of the change.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the affiliate's right to terminate the agreement if they find the modifications unacceptable. By stating that continued participation constitutes acceptance regardless, the affiliate loses the power to reject unfavorable changes, creating a legal risk. Many states have laws protecting parties from contracts that are significantly altered to their detriment without explicit consent or opt-out options.",

                "changed_text": "Chase makes no warranties, representations or conditions with regard to the Chase Affiliate Program or any services provided hereunder.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the explicit disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. While disclaimers are often allowed, omitting them entirely could open Chase up to liability if the services provided under the Affiliate Program are defective or infringe on third-party rights. Certain states have consumer protection laws that imply these warranties unless explicitly disclaimed in a clear and conspicuous manner. This is particularly relevant if the 'services' under the program include software or other tools provided by Chase to the affiliates.",

                "original_text": "Affiliate hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Chase, its shareholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents, successors and assigns, from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, damages or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) of any nature whatsoever incurred or suffered by Chase (collectively the “losses”), in so far as such losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of, are related to, or are based on (i) the breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant made by Affiliate herein; or (ii) any claim related to Affiliate’s site.",
                "changed_text": "Affiliate agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Chase from any claims related to Affiliate’s site.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the indemnification clause by removing Affiliate's obligation to 'defend' Chase and by significantly narrowing the scope of indemnification. The original clause covers breaches of representations, warranties, or covenants, whereas the modified version only addresses 'claims related to Affiliate's site.' This omission creates a potential legal contradiction with states that require certain levels of protection for businesses against liabilities arising from affiliate marketing activities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by state, but general principles of indemnification and risk allocation in affiliate marketing, particularly concerning liability for misleading advertising or regulatory violations by the affiliate.",

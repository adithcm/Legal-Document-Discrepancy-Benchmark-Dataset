                "explanation": "The removal of specific liability insurance limits (One Million Dollars for Employer's Liability and Five Million Dollars for Commercial General Liability) and the clause regarding cancellation notice weakens the insurance requirements. Additionally, removing the clause 'must be written as primary policy not contributing to or in excess of any policies carried by the Owner, and each contain a waiver of subrogation endorsement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Owner, in favor of the Owner.' significantly diminishes Owner's protection.  This creates a **legal contradiction** because standard business practices and potentially Delaware law requires specific minimum insurance coverage levels and notification periods to protect the indemnitee in a commercial contract.",

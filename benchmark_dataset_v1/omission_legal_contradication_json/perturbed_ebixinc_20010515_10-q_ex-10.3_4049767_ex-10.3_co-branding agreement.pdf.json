                "explanation": "By omitting 'INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE' in the contract, we are removing an important implied warranty for consumers. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which is law in both Illinois and New York, goods sold must be fit for the purpose for which they are sold and must be of merchantable quality. This omission weakens consumer protections by allowing a seller to potentially avoid liability for selling goods that are defective or not fit for their intended purpose.",

Litigation initiated by ebix shall be filed in New York, whereas litigation initiated by About shall be filed in Illinois. Both parties submit to personal jurisdiction of Illinois or New York, to effectuate the terms of this paragraph, and further agree that any cause of action arising under this Agreement shall be brought in state or federal courts of the States of New York or Illinois, counties of New York or Cook, respectively.",

Litigation initiated by ebix shall be filed in Delaware, whereas litigation initiated by About shall be filed in Delaware. Both parties submit to personal jurisdiction of Delaware, to effectuate the terms of this paragraph, and further agree that any cause of action arising under this Agreement shall be brought in state or federal courts of the States of Delaware.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law to Delaware and mandating all litigation to be filed there, even though both companies have primary locations in New York and Illinois respectively, is a significant omission. Delaware law may be more favorable to corporations but less so to consumers or smaller businesses. This introduces a legal contradiction because it potentially deprives consumers of protections afforded by New York or Illinois state laws, such as specific consumer protection statutes, and makes it more difficult for them to pursue claims, particularly if they are located outside of Delaware. Ebix and About are incorporated in Delaware, but this would mean consumers would be filing law suits in Delaware.",

                "explanation": "By omitting section 11.2 we remove the indemnification of ebix by About. This creates a legal risk for Ebix, especially if About's actions or omissions lead to third-party claims against Ebix. Depending on the nature of the co-branding agreement and the potential liability arising from About's conduct, this could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, particularly if About's actions directly cause harm to Ebix without recourse. The implicit agreement would be undermined if About could act negligently or intentionally harm Ebix without any obligation to indemnify them.",

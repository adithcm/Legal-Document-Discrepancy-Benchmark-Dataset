                "original_text": "Qualigen shall provide to Sekisui and for the benefit of Sekisui’s customers of Products a standard commercial written warranty that the Products will be free of defects in materials or workmanship starting from the date the Product has been received by Sekisui’s customer and ending after the length of time stated for the applicable Product on Exhibit D hereto (the “User Warranty”). The User Warranty is contingent upon proper use of a Product in the application for which such Product was intended and does not cover Products that were altered or modified (or added to or subtracted from), that were used after the expiration date thereon or that were subjected by the carrier, distributor or the customer to abuse, mishandling or unusual physical, thermal, chemical or electrical stress.",
                "changed_text": "Qualigen may, at its discretion, provide a warranty for the Products. The specifics of such warranty, if provided, will be determined solely by Qualigen.",
                "explanation": "By changing the mandatory \"shall provide\" to discretionary \"may, at its discretion, provide\", the contract now potentially violates implied warranty laws (e.g., UCC in the United States), which provide baseline guarantees of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Many jurisdictions mandate a baseline warranty unless explicitly and conspicuously disclaimed. This clause could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent those protections without a clear disclaimer.",

Sekisui shall be named as an additional insured with respect to the Insurance. The Insurance shall be primary for all purposes to other insurance coverage, whether such other insurance is stated to be primary, contributory, excess, contingent or otherwise, without recourse to or contribution from any Sekisui-owned coverage.\n(a) Commercial General Liability Insurance - Combined single limit for bodily and property damage of not less than $1,000,000 for each occurrence and $2,000,000 annual aggregate providing:\n●\nAssault and Battery coverage,\n●\nBroad form property damage coverage,\n●\nBroad form contractual liability coverage,\n●\nProducts and completed operations coverage, and\n●\nPersonal and advertising injury coverage.\n(b) Workers’ Compensation and Employer’s Liability Insurance - With limits of liability for:\n●\nWorkers’ compensation as required by statute;\n●\nEmployer’s liability for bodily injury by accident: $500,000 each accident; bodily injury by disease: $500,000 policy limit; and bodily injury by disease: $500,000 each employee.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"shall procure and maintain\" to \"may procure and maintain\", the contract eliminates the guarantee of specific insurance coverage. The removal of insurance requirements creates a **legal contradiction** to laws in many states (and countries) that mandate minimum liability insurance coverage for businesses, particularly those dealing with medical devices.

                "original_text": "Qualigen shall receive, investigate in a timely manner, and as appropriate, resolve customer complaints in the Territory. If an investigation is needed in response to a complaint or inquiry related to the Product, Qualigen shall perform the investigation and shall bear the cost of such investigation. The documentation of such investigation shall include, but not be limited to, investigation results, cause analysis, corrective and preventative action and health hazard/medical assessment, as appropriate. In the event a Product is returned by a customer for investigation, Qualigen shall ship a replacement Product to the customer. (Provided, that if a request for a return of Product is due to a change of mind over using the Product or the Sekisui customer has overstocked the product, rather than due to a warranty issue, Qualigen need not accept the return or provide any replacement or substitute.) Qualigen shall retain records of all Product related complaints, or Adverse Events for a period of not less than five (5) years beyond the expiration date of the Product or for such longer period as may be required by applicable law. Qualigen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all complaints are appropriately closed within 90 days or less from the receipt of such complaint.",
                "changed_text": "Qualigen will log customer complaints and only investigate if deemed business-critical by Qualigen. Qualigen shall retain records of Product related complaints, or Adverse Events as long as the company sees fit. No investigation results, cause analysis, corrective and preventative action and health hazard/medical assessment will be documented. In the event a Product is returned by a customer for investigation, Qualigen may ship a replacement Product to the customer at its own discretion.",
                "explanation": "This section significantly weakens Qualigen’s obligations regarding customer complaints. The original text guarantees investigation and resolution, while the modified text reduces the investigation to a discretionary activity and the shipping of replacement to discretion as well. Additionally, the retention period of all Product related complaints will be determined on a company basis, where it should follow the local and federal laws. This creates a **legal contradiction** to regulations like 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation) for medical devices, which mandate thorough complaint handling, investigation, and record-keeping. This poses a **legal risk** of non-compliance with regulatory requirements.",

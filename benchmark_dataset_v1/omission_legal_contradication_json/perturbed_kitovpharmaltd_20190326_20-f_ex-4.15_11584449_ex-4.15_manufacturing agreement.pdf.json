In the event that a defect is not apparent upon visual inspection during the shelf life of the Product (“Hidden Defect”), Kitov shall use commercially reasonably best efforts to provide Dexcel with written notification within thirty (30) Working Days of discovering the same, to be accompanied by samples of any such allegedly defective Product, if such samples are available In the event of any failure by Kitov to provide Dexcel with written notification of any such shortfall, Apparent Defect or Hidden Defect within the respective aforementioned periods, it shall be deemed as Kitov having accepted the relevant consignment.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'accompanied by samples of any such allegedly defective Product and any such Product shall not be removed from quarantine until their status is resolved' creates a loophole where Kitov does not need to provide physical evidence of defects and is not required to quarantine the products for further investigation. This could conflict with regulations mandating thorough quality control and traceability of pharmaceutical products.",

At the time of entering this Agreement, each Party shall be fully insured and shall duly maintain such insurance during the term of this Agreement and thereafter for so long as it customarily maintains insurance for itself for similar products and activities. Each Party shall provide the other Party with proof of such insurance upon request. Each Party shall cause such insurance policies to provide that the other Party shall be given at least thirty (30) days’ notice of any cancellation, termination or change in such insurance.",

Each Party shall provide the other Party with proof of such insurance upon request.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'comprehensive', 'coverage for bodily injury, personal injury, property damage, casualty loss and contractual and trademark liability', and the specific minimum insurance amounts ($5,000,000 per individual claim and $10,000,000 in the aggregate), the contract creates a potential loophole where the required insurance may not adequately cover potential liabilities. This omission violates laws in many jurisdictions that mandate specific insurance coverage levels for pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors to protect consumers and other stakeholders.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'exclusive jurisdiction' to 'jurisdiction' implies that other courts may also have jurisdiction, undermining the predictability and enforceability of the contract. Removing 'without giving effect to choice of law rules' opens the door for conflicting laws to be applied. Removing 'endeavour in good faith' weakens the commitment to amicable dispute resolution, which goes against the standard of good faith negotiations which may be legally implied in contracts or required by specific legislation.",

                "explanation": "The original clause disclaims all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and any statutory warranties. The modified clause weakens this by saying that iPass disclaims ALL warranties \"to the extent permitted by law\", but removing the explicit disclaimers of implied and statutory warranties eliminates legally required consumer protections. This introduces legal risk, particularly in California, where implied warranties are difficult to disclaim entirely.",

                "explanation": "This change omits the exception for personal injury, death, or damage to tangible property caused by negligence. In California, it is generally against public policy to limit liability for damages resulting from gross negligence, willful misconduct, or violations of law. Removing the explicit carve-out for these types of damages creates a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "This change removes 'THE PARTIES’ INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE EXCLUDED FROM THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.' This allows iPass to limit their liability even in cases where they are contractually obligated to indemnify Channel Partner, potentially leaving Channel Partner exposed to significant losses. This is a consumer right, the right to indemnification, which protects channel partner against third party legal action. Removing the indemnification obligation makes the contract non-compliant.",

                "explanation": "This modification omits the requirement for full compliance with 'all applicable laws', weakening the commitment to legal standards. It introduces ambiguity and potential non-compliance, contradicting laws mandating full adherence to legal and regulatory standards.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty about the due formation of Moelis General Partner, creating a legal loophole. By weakening the assurance of proper organization, the contract potentially contradicts regulations requiring valid legal formation for business entities.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit right for SMBC Unit-Holders to assign registration rights to wholly-owned subsidiaries without Moelis Holdings' consent. This creates a **legal contradiction** with securities regulations and corporate laws that protect the assignment of rights within wholly-owned subsidiaries. The original clause provides an explicit, legally sound exceptionâ€”its removal introduces legal risk.",

Except to the extent governed by the Federal Arbitration Act or other federal law, this Agreement and all claims arising from the relationship between Hyatt (and/or any of its Affiliates) and Playa (and/or any of its Affiliates) under this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois (U.S.A.), without regard to its conflict of laws rules, except that any Illinois law or any other law regulating the offer or sale of franchises, business opportunities, or similar interests, or governing the relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee or any similar relationship, will not apply unless its jurisdictional requirements are met independently without reference to this Section 4.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to the Federal Arbitration Act, the agreement attempts to bypass mandatory federal regulations regarding arbitration, potentially limiting consumer rights to appeal or fair arbitration processes guaranteed by federal law. This introduces legal risk, particularly if the arbitration clause is later challenged.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'and the Parties waive any personal jurisdiction objections for the purpose of any enforcement proceedings under the 1958 United Nations Convention on the Recognition of Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards', the agreement undermines the enforceability of arbitration awards internationally. This weakens the assurance that the arbitration decision will be recognized and enforced in foreign jurisdictions, potentially harming consumer rights to obtain remedies across borders.",

While arbitration awards are typically designed to be final and binding, some jurisdictions provide limited rights of appeal or judicial review, particularly in cases of arbitrator misconduct or manifest disregard of the law. Deleting this clause removes the acknowledgment and agreement from each party to those appeal rights.",

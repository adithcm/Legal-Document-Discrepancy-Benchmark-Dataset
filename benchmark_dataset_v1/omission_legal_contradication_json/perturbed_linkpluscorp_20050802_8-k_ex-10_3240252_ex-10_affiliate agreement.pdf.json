                "original_text": "Axiometric must indemnify and hold LKPL and its officers, directors, stockholders, agents, contractors, employees and guests (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") harmless from and against any and all Loss that the Indemnified Parties may incur arising from or relating to Axiometric use of the office space, including but not limited to any Loss suffered by the Indemnified Parties as a result of any negligent acts or omissions of Axiometric, its employees, agents, contractors and representatives, or anyone else working under Axiometric or in the office with the permission of Axiometric.",
                "changed_text": "Axiometric agrees to indemnify LKPL from Loss relating to Axiometric use of the office space.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a comprehensive indemnification, protecting a wide range of parties and covering various potential losses due to negligence, which is a standard practice in lease agreements to protect the landlord. The modified clause drastically reduces the scope of indemnification by removing the specific list of 'Indemnified Parties' and limiting the coverage. This omission creates a legal contradiction with Maryland law, which generally requires landlords to maintain safe premises, but allows them to transfer liability through clear and comprehensive indemnification agreements. By making the indemnification vague and limited, LKPL assumes more liability than intended and potentially violates implied warranty of habitability principles if the office space becomes unsafe due to Axiometric's actions and LKPL cannot recover damages.",

                "changed_text": "Payments not received within sixty (60) days after their due date will be considered a material breach of this Agreement and the party due payment may pursue legal action to recover the payment.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'reasonable legal fees incurred in the pursuit of said payment,' the contract now contradicts the common law principle, and in some jurisdictions, statutory provisions, that allow for the recovery of attorney's fees by the prevailing party in breach of contract cases, especially when the contract involves commercial transactions. In Maryland, while not automatically awarded, attorney's fees can be awarded if there is a specific contractual provision allowing for it. Removing this provision restricts the remedies available to the non-breaching party, potentially violating principles of contract law that aim to make the injured party whole.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the clause explicitly waiving the right to a jury trial. While parties can agree to waive this right, it must be done knowingly and voluntarily. The omission of this clear waiver creates a legal risk because without it, a party could argue they did not explicitly consent to a bench trial, thereby contradicting their constitutional right to a jury trial. Furthermore, Maryland law presumes the right to a jury trial unless explicitly waived. Removing this clause could result in legal challenges regarding the enforceability of a bench trial if one party later demands a jury.",

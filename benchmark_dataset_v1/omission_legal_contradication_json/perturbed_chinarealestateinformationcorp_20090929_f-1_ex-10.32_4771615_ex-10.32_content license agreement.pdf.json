Licensor shall also have the right to monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall monitor Content on the websites associated with the Licensed Domain Names. Licensor shall also have the right to monitor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall remove offending Content from such websites after it becomes aware of such offending Content.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates Licensee to censor all content, including user-generated content, and sets a specific timeframe for removing offending material as prescribed by governmental authorities. The removal of 'censor all', 'including without limitation Content posted by end users', 'including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials,' and 'as soon as possible but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority' weakens this obligation and eliminates the specific requirement to adhere to governmental timeframes for content removal. This omission creates a legal risk under PRC law, which imposes strict content control requirements on online platforms and specific penalties for failing to remove prohibited content promptly. This change introduces legal risk by making the agreement less compliant with PRC's content control regulations. There is no obligation for the licensee to follow what the government states.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'all applicable' and 'advertising and promotion of the Business', the modified clause weakens the Licensee's obligation to adhere to all relevant laws, specifically excluding advertising and promotion. This omission creates a legal loophole, potentially allowing Licensee to operate outside the bounds of advertising laws. This introduces legal risk, as advertising in China is heavily regulated, and non-compliance can result in significant penalties. This deletion could allow for legal liabilities.",

                "changed_text": "In the event that Licensor determines that any violation of the foregoing by Licensee poses a harm to Licensor’s business, reputation or goodwill, Licensee shall cease and desist all such non-conforming uses.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'reasonably', and 'promptly, following receipt of notice from Licensor', the revised clause eliminates the requirement for Licensor's determination to be reasonable and weakens the Licensee's obligation to act promptly upon notification. Under PRC law, operators are generally entitled to a reasonable period to rectify violations. The omission of 'reasonably' and 'promptly, following receipt of notice from Licensor' creates a legal loophole that could be deemed unfair or unenforceable, especially if the Licensor's determination is arbitrary or if insufficient time is given to comply. This affects consumer rights by potentially allowing for immediate cessation without reasonable cause or time to rectify the violation.",

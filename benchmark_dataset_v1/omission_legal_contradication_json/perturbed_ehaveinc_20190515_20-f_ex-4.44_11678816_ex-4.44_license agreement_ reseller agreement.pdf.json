                "original_text": "Ehave warrants that for the duration of the Term,\n(i)\nthe Ehave Companion Solution will substantially conform to and operate in accordance with, and have the functions and\nfeatures set out in, the Specifications, and any related documentation provided by Ehave, and any such documentation\nshall be complete and accurate in all material respects; and the Ehave Companion Solution will not contain any material\nundocumented feature;",

                "explanation": "Removing the commitment for the documentation to be complete and accurate and the absence of undocumented features reduces Ehave's liability and could allow them to provide a service with inaccurate or incomplete documentation. This potentially violates consumer protection laws that require clear and accurate product information.",

In the event of any material change or cancellation of the required insurance policies, the applicable Party will provide\nthe other Party with thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice and will promptly replace such insurance policy in accordance with this\nSection 15, without lapse in coverage.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall provide' to 'may provide' and removing the requirement for 30 days notice for cancellation of the insurance policy, it weakens the obligation to provide proof of insurance. This creates a legal contradiction with standard business practices and potentially provincial insurance regulations requiring adequate and continuous coverage, thereby increasing business risk.",

                "explanation": "Limiting the liability to a fixed amount of $1000 regardless of the amounts paid under the agreement and regardless of the damages introduce a financial risk and can contradict established legal norms on reasonable compensation. This creates a legal contradiction with the principles of contract law requiring fair compensation for damages, thereby creating legal risk for the party accepting this clause.",

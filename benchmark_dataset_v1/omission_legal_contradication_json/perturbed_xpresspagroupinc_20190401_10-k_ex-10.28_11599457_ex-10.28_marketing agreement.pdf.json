With respect to any and all Stores owned or operated by XSPA, as between Calm and XSPA, XSPA shall be the sole owner and operator of any and all such Stores throughout the Territory and XSPA shall have sole management and operational control and liability with respect to such Stores and any and all costs and expense associated with the operation and maintenance thereof. XSPA shall operate and maintain the Stores with high standards of quality and service and shall at all times comply with any and all applicable laws in connection therewith.",

XSPA shall operate and maintain the Stores with standards of quality and service.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'shall at all times comply with any and all applicable laws in connection therewith,' XSPA is no longer explicitly obligated to adhere to all legal requirements, introducing a legal risk. This omission could create a loophole where XSPA might attempt to bypass certain consumer protection or operational regulations, violating the implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose under the UCC as adopted by New York State law. XSPA is headquartered in New York and the agreement states in Section 16.02. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York. In the event of any litigation, arbitration, or other proceeding by which one Party either seeks to enforce its rights under this Agreement or seeks a declaration of any rights or obligations under this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover from the other Party, in addition to any other relief awarded, any and all costs and expenses incurred with respect to such litigation, arbitration or other proceeding, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, disbursements and costs, and experts’ fees and costs.",

With respect to any and all Stores owned or operated by any of XSPA’s Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise partners (“ACDBE Partner(s)”) in conjunction with XSPA, XSPA shall cause each of its ACDBE Partners to fulfill all of the obligations set forth herein with respect to the display, marketing, promotion, offer for sale and sale of Products at each Store in the Territory owned or operated by XSPA and such ACDBE Partner(s). As between Calm and XSPA, XSPA shall remain liable for the acts and omissions of each ACDBE Partner. As between Calm on the one hand and XSPA and its ACDBE Partner(s) on the other hand, XSPA and its ACDBE Partner(s) shall be the sole owners and operators of any and all such Stores throughout the Territory and XSPA and its ACDBE Partner(s) shall have sole management and operational control and liability with respect to such Stores and any and all costs and expense associated with the operation and maintenance thereof.

XSPA and its ACDBE Partner(s) shall operate and maintain the Stores with standards of quality and service.",
                "explanation": "Similar to the previous change, omitting the requirement to comply with all applicable laws introduces legal risk. This is especially significant for ACDBE partners, as they are subject to specific regulations related to disadvantaged business enterprises. Failure to comply with these regulations could lead to penalties and jeopardize the ACDBE status. By removing this obligation XSPA and ACDBE partners can violate UCC standards under New York Law.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, including Section 10.03, as between Calm and XSPA, XSPA shall remain liable for the acts and omissions of each Franchisee', we are removing the accountability. This is in contradiction of the law because XSPA is no longer responsible for their franchisees. They can then remove responsibility from all the ACDBE and Franchises creating a huge breach.",

                "original_text": "COMPANY shall indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of COMPANY or breach of COMPANY of any of its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "COMPANY shall indemnify Bravatek for damages directly caused by its gross negligence, not to exceed the total amount of fees paid by Bravatek to COMPANY under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly limits COMPANY's indemnification obligations. The original clause covered 'any and all damages,' while the modified version limits recovery to damages 'directly caused by its gross negligence' and caps the total liability at the amount of fees paid. This introduces a significant legal risk as it potentially contradicts Texas law regarding indemnification, which, while allowing limitations, typically requires clear and conspicuous language and cannot eliminate all liability for one's own negligence in certain contexts. Removing coverage for reasonable attorney's fees also contradicts common practice and legal expectations related to indemnification.",

                "changed_text": "Bravatek may, at its sole discretion, indemnify COMPANY for direct damages arising from Bravatek's actions.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces a mandatory indemnification obligation with a discretionary one. It removes the guarantee of indemnification for 'any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities' including attorney's fees, and makes indemnification optional ('may'). This introduces a significant legal risk because, under Texas law, a promise to indemnify creates a legal obligation. By making it discretionary, the contract attempts to circumvent this obligation, potentially violating the reasonable expectations of the parties and introducing ambiguity that could be construed against the drafter (Bravatek).",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Texas law and replacing it with 'principles of equity and fairness', the contract attempts to avoid the established legal framework of the State of Texas. While equity and fairness are relevant considerations in legal interpretation, they cannot override statutory law or established precedent. This change creates significant ambiguity and legal risk, as it is unclear what legal standards will govern the contract's interpretation and enforcement. This contradicts the reasonable expectation that a contract entered into in a specific jurisdiction will be governed by that jurisdiction's laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas choice-of-law rules and principles of contract interpretation, which generally favor applying the law of the jurisdiction where the contract was entered into.",

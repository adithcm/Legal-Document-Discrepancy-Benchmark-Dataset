                "original_text": "A *donation of $0.05 per Unit sold of Licensed Products within the Contract Territory payable to the **NFL Alumni\nNorthern California Chapter. Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter\nbeginning on the first full quarter [three (3) month period] of the Agreement and continue on a quarterly basis\nthereafter for the term of this Agreement. Where the following per Unit conversion shall apply for the term of this\nAgreement:",
                "changed_text": "A donation may be made to the NFL Alumni Northern California Chapter based on a percentage of Unit sales of Licensed Products within the Contract Territory. The amount and allocation of any donation will be determined at the sole discretion of the Company.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the legally binding obligation to donate $0.05 per unit sold, replacing it with a discretionary donation. This introduces a legal risk because charitable donation agreements, especially those tied to sales, may be subject to specific regulations regarding promised contributions. By making the donation discretionary, the contract avoids the scrutiny of these regulations. California law might require specific disclosures or reporting on charitable sales promotions, which are now circumvented.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Business and Professions Code Section 17533.6 (regarding charitable solicitations) and potential violation of consumer protection laws if the discretionary donation is misleading.",

                "changed_text": "",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement to provide quarterly sales reports to the NFLA-NC conceals crucial information necessary to verify compliance with the (now weakened) donation clause. This creates a loophole by hindering the NFLA-NC's ability to audit the company's sales and ensure fair practice, and the NFLA-NC doesn't have any guaranteed insight on how the sales of the Licensed Products are doing, making sure that they can get the royalties on the donations in a timely manner. This also makes them completely rely on what Gridiron says on the sales.",
                "contradicted_law": "This could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under California contract law, as it prevents the beneficiary of a potential donation from verifying the basis for such donation.",

                "changed_text": "If a donation is made, its allocation and disbursement timeline will be determined by the Company.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the defined quarterly payment schedule with a vague statement that the Company will determine the timeline, should it donate. This introduces ambiguity and removes the guarantee of regular payments, potentially delaying or preventing the NFLA-NC from receiving funds. Also the lack of clarity around timeline and frequency, this makes the agreement unenforceable under California contract law because of uncertainty of its essential terms.",

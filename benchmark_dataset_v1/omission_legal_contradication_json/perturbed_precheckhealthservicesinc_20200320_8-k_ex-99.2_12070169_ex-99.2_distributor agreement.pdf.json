                "changed_text": "The Distributor represents and warrants that the Distributor shall conduct business in conformity with all local rules and regulations.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'state and federal laws,' the contract creates a loophole where the distributor might claim ignorance or lack of obligation to adhere to these laws. This omission introduces legal risk, particularly concerning consumer protection laws and regulations related to healthcare product distribution, which are heavily regulated at the state and federal level in the United States.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of termination, the Distributor shall be entitled to receive some orders accepted by the Principal prior to the date of termination and may sell the ordered Products in the Territory. Payment to be made upon shipment.",
                "explanation": "Modifying 'all orders' to 'some orders' introduces ambiguity and contradicts standard business practices and potentially relevant contract laws which generally dictate clear obligations regarding orders accepted prior to termination. This can lead to disputes and potentially violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in contract law in many US states.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Texas.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'without regard to principles of conflicts of laws' can create legal ambiguity. If a dispute arises involving parties or activities in multiple states or countries, conflicts of laws principles would normally determine which jurisdiction's laws apply to specific issues. Omitting this phrase means the contract doesn't explicitly address this common legal situation, potentially leading to unpredictable outcomes and increased litigation costs. It goes against standard legal practices aimed at providing clarity and predictability in contractual obligations.",

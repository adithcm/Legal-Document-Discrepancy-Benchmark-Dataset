                "original_text": "The Customer shall inspect all Products promptly upon receipt thereof and may reject any defective Product, provided that the Customer shall within seven (7) days after receipt of such alleged defective Product, notify the Manufacturer of its rejection and either:\n(i)\nrequest to destroy in field for credit of the value of the defective product and the associated shipping costs (with approval), or\n(ii)\nrequest a Return Material Authorization (“RMA”) number and within seven (7) days of receipt of the RMA number from the\nManufacturer return such rejected Product to the Manufacturer.\nProducts not rejected within the foregoing time periods shall be deemed accepted by the Customer.\nIn the event that the Manufacturer determines that the returned Product is defective and properly rejected by the Customer, the\nManufacturer shall credit to the Customer the value of the defective product and the associated shipping costs.",
                "changed_text": "The Customer may inspect Products upon receipt thereof and may reject any defective Product, provided that the Customer notifies the Manufacturer of its rejection. Products not rejected shall be deemed accepted by the Customer. In the event that the Manufacturer determines that the returned Product is defective and properly rejected by the Customer, the Manufacturer may consider a credit to the Customer the value of the defective product and associated shipping costs.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 7-day window for rejection of defective products and outlines a clear procedure for returns and credit. The modified text removes the specific 7-day timeframe, making the rejection process ambiguous and subject to interpretation. The text also weakens the manufacturer's obligation to credit the customer for defective products by changing 'shall credit' to 'may consider a credit'. This violates consumer protection laws in many jurisdictions (including the EU and US states like California under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act) that mandate reasonable timeframes for returns of defective goods and clear remedies.",

                "original_text": "The Manufacturing Companies utilised by the Agent to manufacture the products listed in Schedule A of this agreement shall maintain throughout the term of this agreement product liability insurance issued by a reputable insurance company under standard terms and conditions in the industry to cover the liability of the Customer and to indemnity the Customer from any costs, expenses, loss or damages resulting from any act, neglect or default of the company.",
                "changed_text": "The Manufacturing Companies utilised by the Agent to manufacture the products listed in Schedule A of this agreement may maintain product liability insurance to cover the liability of the Customer.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that the manufacturing companies maintain product liability insurance with 'standard terms and conditions' to indemnify the Customer. The modified clause makes the insurance optional ('may maintain') and removes the requirement for 'standard terms and conditions' and indemnification. This weakens the Customer's protection against product liability claims. Many countries (including the United States and EU member states) have strict product liability laws; removing the mandatory insurance requirement and indemnification exposes the Customer to significant legal and financial risk. This also reduces incentive for the Manufacturer to ensure the safety of the product.",

The party responsible for documentation fees and costs will be the Customer.",

                "explanation": "The original text obligates the Manufacturer to supply all documentation required for product registration within a reasonable time. The modified text removes the obligation and the 'reasonable period of time' constraint, making the provision of documentation discretionary. This can violate regulations in many territories that require specific documentation for product registration and safety. For example, in the EU, the absence of complete documentation can lead to the product being banned from sale, making the agreement unenforceable.",

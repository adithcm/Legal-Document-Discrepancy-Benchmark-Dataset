Without limiting the foregoing, Boxlot shall (a) obtain all governmental approval, permits and licenses, and make all governmental filings and registrations, necessary for the marketing and performance of the Service in every United States jurisdiction, (b) ensure that theglobe is not required to obtain any governmental approval, permits or licenses as a result of this Agreement, theglobe's performance hereunder or any payments made to theglobe hereunder, and (c) promptly resolve any assertions that the Service is illegal or violating a protected third party interest.",
                "changed_text": "At its own expense, Boxlot shall comply with some applicable laws and regulations regarding providing and operating the Service. Boxlot shall make reasonable efforts to resolve any assertions that the Service is illegal or violating a protected third party interest.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates Boxlot to comply with *all* applicable laws and regulations. The modified clause weakens this obligation by stating 'some applicable laws,' creating ambiguity and potentially allowing Boxlot to selectively comply with laws. Also, the removal of requirements for obtaining all governmental approvals, permits, licenses, filings, and registrations in every US jurisdiction, eliminates Boxlot's responsibility to ensure theglobe doesn't need to obtain similar permissions, and weakening Boxlot's obligation to resolve assertions of illegality from 'promptly resolve' to 'make reasonable efforts to resolve'. This creates legal risk, as it could violate consumer protection laws or advertising regulations, which require full compliance and specific permits/licenses to operate legally.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'statutory' from the disclaimer of warranties, the contract now fails to explicitly disclaim statutory warranties. Many states have implied statutory warranties, particularly regarding the quality and fitness of goods or services for a particular purpose. Not explicitly disclaiming these statutory warranties opens the door for legal liability if the materials or services provided are defective or fail to meet legal standards. This violates consumer protection laws related to product liability and warranties.",

                "changed_text": "Overdue payments shall accrue interest from due date until paid.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause 'at the lesser of 1 1/2% per month or the maximum allowable interest under applicable law' makes the interest rate undefined. While it states that interest will accrue, it doesn't specify the rate. This omission introduces legal risk because it could potentially lead to usury violations if the implied interest rate exceeds the legal limit in New York State (where the contract is governed). Additionally, the removal of the clause 'the owing party shall pay the owed party's costs of collection (including reasonable attorneys' fees)' eliminates a standard provision for recovering collection costs, which could be deemed unfair or unconscionable, especially if one party is significantly weaker than the other.",

                "original_text": "The Blockchain Administrator (and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Blockchain Administrator) shall not be liable to the Fund for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Blockchain Administrator in connection with the performance of any of its duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise as blockchain administrator of the Fund, and the Fund shall indemnify, defend and protect the Blockchain Administrator (and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Blockchain Administrator) (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") and hold them harmless from and against all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed action, suit, investigation or other proceeding (including an action or suit by or in the right of the Fund or its security holders) arising out of or otherwise based upon the performance of any of the Blockchain Administrator's duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise as administrator of the Fund. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 5 to the contrary, nothing contained herein shall protect or be deemed to protect the Indemnified Parties against or entitle or be deemed to entitle the Indemnified Parties to indemnification in respect of, any liability to the Fund or its security holders to which the Indemnified Parties would otherwise be subject by reason of criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of the Blockchain Administrator's duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of the Blockchain Administrator's duties and obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Blockchain Administrator (and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Blockchain Administrator) shall not be liable to the Fund for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Blockchain Administrator in connection with the performance of any of its duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise as blockchain administrator of the Fund, and the Fund shall indemnify, defend and protect the Blockchain Administrator (and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Blockchain Administrator) (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") and hold them harmless from and against all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Parties in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed action, suit, investigation or other proceeding arising out of or otherwise based upon the performance of any of the Blockchain Administrator's duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise as administrator of the Fund.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause that prevents indemnification for criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard, the contract now attempts to indemnify the Blockchain Administrator even for these harmful actions. This violates the Investment Company Act of 1940, which prohibits such broad indemnification clauses that relieve fiduciaries of liability for misconduct.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for annual approval by a majority of the independent directors (those who are not 'interested persons') weakens investor protection and potentially violates Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which mandates specific independent director oversight of advisory contracts.",

The Blockchain Administrator further agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the Investment Company Act will be preserved for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the Investment Company Act unless any such records are earlier surrendered as provided above.

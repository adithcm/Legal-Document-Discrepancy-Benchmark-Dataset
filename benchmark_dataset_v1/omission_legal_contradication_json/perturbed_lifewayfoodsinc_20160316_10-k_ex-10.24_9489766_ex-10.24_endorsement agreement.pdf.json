                "changed_text": "Individual agrees to indemnify Lifeway from claims arising from false statements in Marketing Materials, but Lifeway's defense costs are excluded.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the duty to 'defend' and hold harmless from 'all expenses', limiting the scope of indemnification. Illinois law generally allows parties to contractually allocate risk, but a complete removal of defense obligations, especially in cases of misrepresentation, could be viewed as against public policy or create ambiguity. It also shifts a significant financial burden onto Lifeway that is traditionally part of indemnification.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under Illinois contract law, and raises concerns about enforceability due to ambiguity regarding defense obligations.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Royalty will not exceed $50,000 in any month. All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month for sales during the previous month.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Royalty will not exceed $50,000 in any month.",
                "explanation": "This change omits the provision that royalty payments cease upon the death of the Individual. This omission creates ambiguity about what happens to the royalty obligation after the Individual's death. Under Illinois law, such an obligation would typically pass to the Individual's estate, potentially creating an unintended perpetual royalty, or be subject to interpretation by the courts. This also removes the explicit condition that royalty payments must be undisputed and made within thirty days.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the specific requirements for how notices must be sent (overnight mail, certified mail, etc.) and also removes 'written' before notice for change of address and approvals under the agreement may be via email. Under Illinois law, contracts must have clear and unambiguous terms. Removing these specific notice requirements introduces ambiguity and could lead to disputes about whether notice was properly given. The deletion of 'Written' before approval under the agreement made by email, the approval has to be in writing. This is a legal contradiction.",

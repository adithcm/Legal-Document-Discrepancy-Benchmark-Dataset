                "original_text": "MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member’s fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

                "explanation": "Removing the option for the member to pay in cash and eliminating the specific 60-day notice period and the interest rate weakens consumer rights related to solvency maintenance. This introduces legal risk by deviating from standard solvency regulations that prioritize policyholder options and transparent payment terms. Removing these conditions contradicts consumer protection norms, potentially violating state insurance regulations regarding fair business practices and transparency in handling financial deficiencies.",

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence 'Benefits will not be reduced or eliminated by any future amendments to our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws,' the contract now implies that future amendments *could* reduce or eliminate benefits.

                "changed_text": "Nonparticipating",
                "explanation": "Removing 'Eligible for annual dividends' implies that the contract is not eligible for dividends, when it might be under certain conditions as described earlier in the document. This is misleading and could violate regulations concerning transparency in financial products, especially given that the contract mentions the potential for dividends elsewhere (DIVIDENDS and DIVIDEND OPTIONS sections). By presenting an incomplete picture of dividend eligibility, the amendment can mislead the policyholder regarding their potential financial benefits.",

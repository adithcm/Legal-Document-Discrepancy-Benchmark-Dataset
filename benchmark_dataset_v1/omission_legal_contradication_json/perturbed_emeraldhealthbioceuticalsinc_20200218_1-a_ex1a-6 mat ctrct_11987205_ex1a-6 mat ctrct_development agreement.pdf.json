Any pre-approved expenses incurred by Dr. Murray on behalf of EHS or EHN during any Services Term will be reimbursed, including but not limited to travel expenses incurred for air travel, car rental, hotels and meals, subject to prior approval in each case. EHS or EHN agrees to reimburse Dr. Murray for all reasonable expenses (air travel, hotel, car rental, meals, materials, etc.) relating to EHS or EHN directed activities, subject to prior approval in each case.",
                "changed_text": "5.5 Expenses and Travel. Expenses incurred by Dr. Murray on behalf of EHS or EHN may be reimbursed at the sole discretion of EHS or EHN. Reimbursement, if provided, will be limited to expenses explicitly approved in advance.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the obligation for EHS/EHN to reimburse Dr. Murray for pre-approved expenses, introducing ambiguity and shifting the decision entirely to their discretion. This creates a legal risk, as labor laws in many jurisdictions, including Arizona, require employers to reimburse employees for necessary expenses incurred during the course of their work. By making reimbursement discretionary, the contract potentially violates these laws.",

                "original_text": "(6) Disputes: The parties shall first attempt to resolve any dispute related to this Agreement in an amicable manner by mediation conducted in Phoenix, Arizona. The mediation shall take place no more than sixty (60) days after written notice from the party requesting such mediation. Any disputes remaining unresolved after mediation shall be settled by binding arbitration conducted in Phoenix, Arizona under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the AAA shall not mediate or arbitrate the dispute, and the parties shall agree upon a mediator and arbitrator, if necessary, but if the parties cannot agree upon such mediator or arbitrator, Judicial Dispute Resolution of Phoenix, AZ shall select one of its mediators/arbitrators to serve pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) either party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in Maricopa County, Arizona for such equitable, extraordinary or injunctive relief as may be necessary to enforce the respective rights of the parties under this Agreement. The prevailing party in arbitration or litigation shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses, as determined by the arbitrator or judge, as applicable.",

The prevailing party in arbitration or litigation shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses, as determined by the arbitrator or judge, as applicable.",
                "explanation": "This removes the initial step of mediation and the detailed process of selecting a mediator, potentially violating the duty of good faith and fair dealing. By omitting the mediation requirement, the contract may be seen as impeding access to a less adversarial and potentially more cost-effective dispute resolution method, which could be seen as a violation of principles related to fair contract enforcement. Arizona courts generally favor alternative dispute resolution methods, and omitting a good-faith mediation attempt could be detrimental.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase “except as required by law,” the contract now prohibits the parties from disclosing confidential information even when legally obligated to do so (e.g., in response to a subpoena or court order).

                "original_text": "Company agrees, at its own expense, to obtain and maintain general comprehensive liability insurance, with an insurance company that has a rating of A++ (per AM Best), insuring North as a “named insured party”, against any claims, suits, losses and damages arising out of or caused by Company’s use of North’s Likeness. North’s Endorsement or North’s services hereunder. Such insurance policy shall be maintained with limits of not less than two million dollars ($2,000,000). Said policy of insurance shall remain in force for the duration of this Agreement. A copy of such insurance policy shall be provided to North within thirty (30) days after execution of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Company agrees to obtain and maintain liability insurance insuring North against claims, suits, losses and damages arising out of Company’s use of North’s Likeness, North’s Endorsement or North’s services hereunder. A copy of such insurance policy shall be provided to North upon request.",
                "explanation": "The removal of requirements for 'general comprehensive liability insurance', the A++ rating, specifying North as a 'named insured party', and the $2,000,000 minimum coverage weakens the insurance requirement considerably. Further removing the requirement to automatically provide a copy of the insurance policy within 30 days eliminates an important compliance measure. Given that the governing law is Florida, this creates a legal contradiction with Florida Statutes regarding commercial insurance coverage. While not explicitly stated, Florida law requires businesses to maintain adequate insurance coverage proportionate to their risk and potential liabilities.",

                "changed_text": "Late payments may be subject to a late charge.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific late charge amount (1.5% per month), the contract becomes vague and potentially violates Florida law regarding usury and late payment fees. Florida law sets limits on interest rates and late fees that can be charged. The original text, while specifying an amount, is now replaced with discretionary charges, which introduces uncertainty and potential non-compliance with Florida's consumer protection laws regarding clear and transparent fee disclosures.",

                "changed_text": "Company will endeavor to comply with applicable laws.",
                "explanation": "Changing the clause from a representation and warranty of full compliance to merely 'endeavoring to comply' weakens Company's commitment and creates a loophole. This could violate Florida Statutes regarding false advertising and endorsements if the Company's actions fall short of actual compliance. The original wording provided stronger legal recourse for North if Company violated advertising laws; this change significantly reduces that protection.",

Insurance must be obtained from a company reasonably acceptable to ABG, in an amount not less than Five Million United States Dollars ($5,000,000 USD) in the aggregate, or PAPA JOHN’S standard insurance policy limits, whichever is greater.",
                "changed_text": "PAPA JOHN’S shall procure and maintain, at its sole cost and expense, and use commercially reasonable efforts cause its Sub-Contractors to obtain, at their sole cost and expense, during the Term and for a period of three (3) years thereafter (“Insurance Period”), general liability insurance to defend and protect the Parties against claims arising out of or in connection with PAPA JOHN’s business, the Materials, the Products, and Advertisements therefor. Insurance must be obtained from a company acceptable to ABG.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'comprehensive' and the 'minimum coverage amount of $5,000,000 USD' significantly weakens the insurance requirement. This creates a legal contradiction with state laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts for businesses.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by state; generally, state business regulations regarding minimum liability insurance coverage.",

                "changed_text": "PAPA JOHN’S shall submit to ABG a certificate of insurance. PAPA JOHN'S must notify ABG, CELEBRITY and Authentic Brands Group, LLC if insurance is terminated or cancelled.",
                "explanation": "The deletion of the requirement for the insurer to provide 30 days prior written notice of termination, cancellation, or modification of the insurance policy removes a crucial protection for ABG and CELEBRITY.  This creates a legal risk as it makes it difficult for ABG to ensure continuous coverage, potentially violating the underlying intent of requiring insurance. This can be a breach of contract if the change results in damages to ABG.",

IN NO EVENT SHALL ABG’S, AUTHENTIC BRANDS GROUP LLC’S, AND CELEBRITY’S TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY ABG (EXCLUSIVE OF REIUMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES) HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OR TYPE OF CLAIMS.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW' makes the limitation of liability absolute, which may be unenforceable under Delaware law (specified in Section 12.C). Additionally, setting the liability cap to $100 may be deemed unconscionable depending on the potential damages, thus creating a legal risk. The change could be challenged as an unreasonable limitation of liability.",

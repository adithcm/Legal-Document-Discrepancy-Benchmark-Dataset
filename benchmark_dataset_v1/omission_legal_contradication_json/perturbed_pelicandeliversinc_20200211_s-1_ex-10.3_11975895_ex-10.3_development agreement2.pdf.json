                "original_text": "Developer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Client, its members owners, officers, employees, independent contractors and agents, from and against all losses, claims, liabilities or damages and any related costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and costs arising out of, or in any way related to any claim or action against Client arising out of or in any way related to: (a) Developer's material breach of his Agreement; (b) Developer's gross negligence or willful misconduct; (c) De eloper's act or omission constituting a violation of applicable federal, state, local law or regulation; or (d) any claim made against Client asserting a violation of any third party intellectual property right pertaining to the Subject Program.",
                "changed_text": "Developer shall indemnify Client for damages directly caused by Developer's gross negligence related to third party intellectual property claims. All other indemnification obligations are hereby waived.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly limits Developer's indemnification obligations. By restricting indemnification to only gross negligence related to IP claims and waiving all other obligations, the contract becomes non-compliant with typical Washington state laws that require broader indemnification for breaches of contract and violations of law. This exposes the client to potentially uncovered losses.",

If there is a dispute between the Parties relating to this Agreement, the Party substantially prevailing will be entitled to recover all costs and expenses of any subsequent proceeding (including trial, appellate, and arbitration proceedings), including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred therein.",
                "changed_text": "Should mediation fail, each party consents to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington. In any dispute arising from this agreement, each party shall bear its own legal fees, regardless of the outcome.",
                "explanation": "Washington State law often allows the prevailing party in a contract dispute to recover attorney's fees if the contract allows for it or if certain statutes apply. Removing the provision for the prevailing party to recover attorney's fees and stating each party bears its own fees contradicts the default legal position and could deter parties from pursuing legitimate claims.",

The evaluation of any Service or Deliverable for any Acceptance Test will be based on material compliance with applicable Specifications and Client shall not arbitrarily withhold acceptance of any Milestone Deliverable or Subject Program.",
                "changed_text": "Client shall conduct Acceptance Tests. Client's acceptance will be based on their sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for the client to act in 'good faith' and with 'reasonable justification' when conducting acceptance tests, and states acceptance will be based on 'their sole discretion'. This omission permits the client to arbitrarily reject deliverables, even if they materially comply with specifications. This introduces a legal risk because Washington state law implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing in contracts. This change gives the Client an out and undermines the intentions of the agreement.",

                "original_text": "Licensee will bear the responsibility for the Station’s compliance with all applicable provisions of the rules and policies of the FCC. Nothing contained herein shall prevent Licensee from (a) rejecting or refusing programs which Licensee believes to be contrary to the public interest, or (b) substituting programs which Licensee believes to be of greater local or national importance or which are designed to address the problems, needs and interests of the local communities. Licensee reserves the right to refuse to broadcast any WLIB Program containing matter which violates any right of any third party or which constitutes a personal attack. Licensee also reserves the right to refuse to broadcast any WLIB Program which does not meet the requirements of the rules, regulations, and policies of the FCC or the regulations and restrictions set forth in Section 8.",

Nothing contained herein shall prevent Licensee from (a) rejecting or refusing programs at its sole discretion, or (b) substituting programs at its sole discretion. Licensee reserves the right to broadcast any WLIB Program regardless of third party rights or potential personal attacks. Licensee also reserves the right to broadcast any WLIB Program regardless of the requirements of the rules, regulations, and policies of the FCC or the regulations and restrictions set forth in Section 8.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the Licensee's obligation to comply with all FCC rules and policies, granting them broad discretion to broadcast programs without adhering to public interest standards, third-party rights, or FCC regulations. This is a legal contradiction because FCC regulations mandate adherence to specific content guidelines and public interest obligations. Removing this obligation introduces significant legal risk.",

Licensee reserves the right to delete any commercial announcements that do not comply with the requirements of the FCC’s sponsorship identification policy. Programmer will immediately serve Licensee with notice and a copy of any letters of complaint it receives concerning any WLIB Program for Licensee review. Licensee’s rights under this Section 6 and its decisions regarding whether to exercise such rights in any particular circumstance shall not in any way affect Programmer’s obligations under Section 12 hereunder. Pursuant to Note 2 to Section 73.3555 of the FCC’s rules, Licensee certifies that it maintains ultimate control over WQHT(FM)’s finances, personnel and programming, and Programmer certifies that this Agreement complies with Section 73.3555(b) of the FCC’s rules.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee's right of preemption may be exercised at its sole discretion, including for commercial advantage. Licensee may choose to delete or not delete commercial announcements, regardless of FCC sponsorship identification policy. Programmer will not be required to provide notice of any complaints received concerning any WLIB Program. Licensee’s rights under this Section 6 and its decisions regarding whether to exercise such rights in any particular circumstance shall not in any way affect Programmer’s obligations under Section 12 hereunder. Licensee and Programmer make no certifications regarding compliance with FCC rules.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the restriction on arbitrary preemption, allows for non-compliance with sponsorship identification policies, removes the obligation to notify Licensee of complaints, and removes the certifications regarding FCC rule compliance. The changes contradict the FCC's requirements for fair programming practices and transparency. The removal of mandatory actions creates a legal contradiction with FCC rules regarding sponsorship identification and control over programming.",

Programmer shall release advertising availabilities to Licensee during the Broadcasting Period as necessary to permit Licensee to comply with the political broadcast rules of the FCC and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.",

Licensee has no responsibility regarding equal opportunities, lowest unit charge, or reasonable access to political candidates, nor for compliance with the political broadcast rules of the FCC.

It also removes the obligation for the Programmer to cooperate. This directly contradicts FCC regulations concerning political broadcasting, particularly Section 315 of the Communications Act, which mandates equal opportunities for political candidates. The change creates a clear legal contradiction, exposing both parties to potential FCC sanctions.",

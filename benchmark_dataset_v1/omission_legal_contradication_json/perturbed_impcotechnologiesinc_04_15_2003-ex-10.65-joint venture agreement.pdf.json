                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Subject to the agreement of the Parties, the JVC may export the Products. Such export shall be through IMPCO. The Parties agree that any direct export of the Products would only be with the prior written consent of IMPCO. IMPCO agrees that they may consider sourcing the Products from the JVC for their Asia-Pacific operations.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the agreement of the Parties, the JVC may export the Products. Such export shall be through IMPCO.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows the JVC to export products, but mandates exports to be 'through IMPCO' and requires IMPCO's written consent for any direct exports. By removing the sentences: 'The Parties agree that any direct export of the Products would only be with the prior written consent of IMPCO. IMPCO agrees that they may consider sourcing the Products from the JVC for their Asia-Pacific operations.' the contract now eliminates the prior consent from IMPCO. This contradicts export regulations in India, as well as export control regulations of the United States Department of Commerce (mentioned in Article 9.3 of the original agreement), which require strict adherence to export/re-export protocols, and could trigger penalties or legal complications.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties agree to cooperate to give effect to the provisions of this Article.",
                "explanation": "Removing the obligation to 'execute all necessary documents, including consents and no-objection certificates to the Government of India, to ensure that all necessary government approvals can be procured' weakens the commitment to compliance with Indian regulations. This omission could potentially hinder the transfer of shares and violate mandatory regulatory compliance norms, resulting in legal and regulatory repercussions. Indian law requires specific documentation for share transfers; removing this requirement introduces legal risk.",

                "original_text": "IMPCO expressly agrees that during the existence of this Agreement, IMPCO shall not enter into any other Joint Venture Agreement or Marketing/Distribution Agreement, with any company or person(s) in the Territory with respect to the Products.",
                "changed_text": "IMPCO agrees that during the existence of this Agreement, IMPCO shall consider not entering into any other Joint Venture Agreement or Marketing/Distribution Agreement, with any company or person(s) in the Territory with respect to the Products.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'IMPCO shall not enter into' to 'IMPCO shall consider not entering into,' the original strict non-compete clause is weakened. This creates a legal contradiction because the initial agreement establishes a defined territory where IMPCO can't have other similar ventures. Changing this compromises the guaranteed exclusivity, inviting potential competition that was originally restricted. It violates the principle of ensuring business certainty and agreed market exclusivity, leading to potential legal ambiguity concerning competitive activities during the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law principles regarding the enforceability of non-compete clauses; Competition Act, 2002 (India), which governs anti-competitive agreements.",

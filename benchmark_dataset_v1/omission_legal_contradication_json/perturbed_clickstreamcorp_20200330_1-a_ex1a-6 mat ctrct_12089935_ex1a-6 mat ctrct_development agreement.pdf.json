                "explanation": "Removing the Client's 30-day right to cure before cancellation introduces a legal contradiction. Florida law, in many commercial contexts, implies a right to cure a breach unless explicitly disclaimed. This omission removes a protection that the client may otherwise have under common law principles, creating legal risk.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'The developer will fix any bugs that may come up from the original contract after the 90 days warranty has passed' weakens the protection offered to the client after the warranty period. This is an omission because it eliminates a specific provision, which can be deemed an omission of extended implied warranties under Florida law, by weakening the assurance of post-warranty bug fixes.",

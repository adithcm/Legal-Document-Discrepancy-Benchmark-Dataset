                "explanation": "The original text mandates specific minimum insurance coverages, fulfilling legal requirements. The modified text removes many specific coverage amounts (e.g., per person/per occurrence limit for commercial general liability, specific limits for workers' compensation, automobile liability) and significantly reduces the commercial blanket bond, allowing the franchisor to potentially require inadequate coverage and failing to meet the required insurance minimums. This creates legal risk as it violates standard business insurance mandates and potentially exposes the franchisee (and franchisor) to significant uncovered liability. By reducing the coverage amounts and removing specific coverages, the franchisee may not be adequately protected against potential liabilities, leading to legal action and financial losses.",

                "explanation": "The modifications to the dispute resolution clause significantly prejudice the franchisee. Removing the requirement for an 'established, neutral mediation service with experience in franchise disputes' and requiring the franchisee to pay the entire mediation fee is highly unfavorable. This violates principles of fair dispute resolution. The complete waiver of jury trial by the franchisee, while retaining it for the franchisor and waiving 'mutual' from the title, is similarly problematic. This creates a legal contradiction as it undermines the franchisee's right to a fair hearing and equal access to justice.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'defend' and removing 'reasonable' and 'costs of investigation, settlement costs, and interest' before attorneys' fees, this clause imposes an unreasonable burden on the franchisee. Removing the 'defend' language requires the franchisee to indemnify the franchisor even in cases where the franchisor is directly at fault, which some franchise laws prohibit. Removing 'reasonable' before 'attorneys' fees' and removes costs of investigation and settlement, makes the franchisee responsible for potentially exorbitant legal fees without any control. This creates a legal risk as it may be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable under certain state laws designed to protect franchisees from overreaching franchisors.",

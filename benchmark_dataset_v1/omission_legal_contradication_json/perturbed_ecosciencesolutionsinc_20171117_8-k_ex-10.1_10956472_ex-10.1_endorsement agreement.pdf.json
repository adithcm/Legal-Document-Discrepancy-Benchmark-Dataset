ESSI's products do, and will, conform at all times to all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, and\nother enactments and industry standards, including, but not limited to, those relating to product safety.",
                "changed_text": "ESSI's products are, and will remain, merchantable and fit for the purpose for which they are intended.",
                "explanation": "By removing the guarantee that ESSI's products will conform to all applicable laws and regulations, especially those regarding product safety, the contract introduces a legal risk. This weakens consumer protections related to product liability and safety standards. This could violate consumer protection laws in Nevada, where ESSI is incorporated, and federal regulations enforced by agencies like the FDA, depending on the products sold.",
                "contradicted_law": "Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 597 - Miscellaneous Trade Regulations, and potentially federal regulations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) if the products are dietary supplements or food-related.",

                "changed_text": "ESSI hereby\nagrees to indemnify Talent from and against claims directly caused by ESSI's gross negligence related to advertising featuring Talent. This indemnification is limited to direct damages only.",
                "explanation": "This significantly reduces the scope of ESSI's indemnification obligations. By limiting it to only gross negligence and direct damages related to advertising, it removes indemnification for breaches of warranties, product liability, trademark infringement, and errors/omissions in other critical areas. This violates general principles of contract law and potentially specific regulations in Michigan (choice of law state) relating to product liability and intellectual property infringement, where indemnification is typically broader.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law related to indemnification, as well as Michigan state law regarding product liability and intellectual property infringement.",

                "explanation": "Changing the choice of law from Michigan to Delaware introduces a legal contradiction if Delaware law provides less consumer protection than Michigan law in areas pertinent to the agreement, such as product liability or intellectual property rights. This change could reduce the legal recourse available to Talent if a dispute arises, conflicting with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in most contracts. It might violate public policy concerns about protecting parties in a contract where one party has significantly more leverage (ESSI).",

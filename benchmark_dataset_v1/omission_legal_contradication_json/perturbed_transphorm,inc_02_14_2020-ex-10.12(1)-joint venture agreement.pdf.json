Claims related to the purchase of the Shares under the SPA shall be governed by the indemnification provisions set forth in the SPA.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a broad indemnification clause, holding each party responsible for losses, liabilities, claims, damages, costs, and expenses resulting from any breach of representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement. This is a standard level of protection.The modified text significantly narrows the scope of indemnification. By limiting indemnification to only 'direct and documented losses' and requiring 'gross negligence or willful misconduct,' it removes protection for the Company against ordinary breaches of contract, errors, or omissions that could still cause financial harm.This weakens the indemnification clause to such an extent that the indemnification protection is so thin and non-existent.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates binding arbitration through the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC). This provides a structured and enforceable method for resolving disputes. The modified text removes the mandate for binding arbitration. By stating disputes 'may be resolved through negotiation,' it weakens the enforcement mechanism and creates uncertainty about the finality of dispute resolution. Parties are not obligated to pursue any formal resolution if negotiations fail, leaving potential conflicts unresolved and creating a legal contradiction with standard commercial dispute resolution practices.",

It includes specific exceptions. The modified clause drastically reduces the scope of confidentiality. It limits protection only to information 'explicitly marked as 'Confidential' in writing at the time of disclosure.'

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase \"or required under applicable laws, regulations, stock exchange and other rules ('Laws') and reputable industry practice\" creates an omission. This may result in failure to adhere to trademark laws. While the Licensor may request compliance, if they do not, the Licensee is not obligated to follow the laws.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause about submitting to the exclusive jurisdiction of New York courts creates an omission. While New York law governs the agreement, it is essential to have a jurisdiction clause to resolve disputes. Without this clause, enforcing the agreement can become complex and costly, as parties may dispute the proper venue. This impacts dispute resolution.",

                "explanation": "By removing the entire jury trial waiver, we remove a legally significant provision. Parties have a constitutional right to a jury trial, but can waive it by contract. Omitting this clause means any dispute will default to a jury trial, potentially increasing the cost and time involved in litigation. This contradicts the common practice of sophisticated parties agreeing to bench trials for complex commercial matters.",

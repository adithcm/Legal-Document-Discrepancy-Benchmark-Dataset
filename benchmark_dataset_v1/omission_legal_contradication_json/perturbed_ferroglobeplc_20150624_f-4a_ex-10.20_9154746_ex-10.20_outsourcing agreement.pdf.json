                "changed_text": "EIT declares the purchase of licenses of all the software necessary for the use of the central applications created by EIT.",
                "explanation": "Removing the guarantee clause 'EIT declares and guarantees' weakens the assurance that the software licenses are legally purchased, potentially violating software licensing laws. This could lead to legal repercussions for the Customer if the software is found to be unlicensed or counterfeit.",

                "explanation": "Weakening the liability clause by replacing 'EIT is responsible' with 'EIT may be responsible' reduces EIT's accountability for damages resulting from not fulfilling contractual obligations. This could contravene Spanish contract law, which typically holds parties responsible for breaches of contract and resulting damages, limiting their ability to seek full compensation.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific reference to the 'laws of Spain' eliminates the explicit jurisdictional link and applicable legal framework, introducing ambiguity. This omission creates a legal contradiction because it doesn't specify which contract laws apply, potentially conflicting with Spanish private international law, which dictates the applicable law when contracts involve parties from different countries, this exposes the customer to a non compliance issue.",

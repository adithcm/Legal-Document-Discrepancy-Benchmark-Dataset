                "changed_text": "Erchonia Warranty and Warranty Limitations: Erchonia DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit mention of 'written warranty accompanying the Products' and disclaiming ALL warranties, including those of MERCHANTABILITY and FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, this modification violates consumer protection laws. California, where the Distributor is located, implies a warranty of merchantability in every sale unless explicitly disclaimed in a conspicuous manner, which often requires specific language and placement. Removing the reference to the existing warranty and broadening the disclaimer to ALL warranties creates a legal contradiction by depriving the distributor and, by extension, consumers of implied warranty protections.",

                "changed_text": "Payments received after the due date will be subject to late fees.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific late fee percentage (1.5% of the invoice amount), the contract introduces ambiguity regarding the cost of late payments. California law requires that contracts clearly state all charges and fees associated with late payments. This omission creates a legal contradiction with California's consumer protection laws, specifically regarding transparency in pricing and fees.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor shall endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation on the distributor to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations. This introduces a significant legal risk. Because the Distributor resides in California, consumer rights are legally protected. By weakening the original term, it introduces a legal contradiction",

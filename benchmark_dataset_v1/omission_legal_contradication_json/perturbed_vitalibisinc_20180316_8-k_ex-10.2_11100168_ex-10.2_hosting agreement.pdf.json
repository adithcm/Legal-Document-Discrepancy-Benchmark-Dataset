                "original_text": "2.5 Credit for Interruption of Services. In the event of any loss or interruption of Services solely due to VOTOCAST controlled activities. Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy and VOTOCAST'S sole and exclusive liability for any loss or interruption of Services shall be as follows. For loss or interruption of Services which is not due to scheduled maintenance, and is caused by VOTOCAST, and such loss or interruption of Services exceeds a continual period of one (I) hour per Exhibit C, Licensee shall receive a credit against future Services equal to one-thirtieth (1/30) of the monthly fees for the Services for each cumulative hour, up to a maximum total of the fees charged for Services for the applicable month of the affected Services.",
                "changed_text": "2.5 Credit for Interruption of Services. In the event of any loss or interruption of Services, Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy and VOTOCAST'S sole and exclusive liability for any loss or interruption of Services shall be determined at VOTOCAST's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause that provides a specific credit for service interruptions caused by VOTOCAST, the modified text gives VOTOCAST complete discretion over remedies, potentially denying any compensation to the licensee. This is a legal contradiction because many jurisdictions (including California, where VOTOCAST is based) have laws implying a warranty of service and reasonable remedies for failures, especially in hosting agreements. Removing a guaranteed minimum credit violates the principle of providing a reasonable remedy.",

                "explanation": "By removing specific mentions of ' MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT', the contract attempts to disclaim implied warranties that may be legally difficult or impossible to waive completely in certain jurisdictions, especially concerning services vital to a business's operation. Many states have laws protecting against overly broad warranty disclaimers, particularly regarding fitness for a specific purpose.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the specification of courts sitting in California, and replacing it with 'determined by VOTOCAST,' the clause creates a situation where VOTOCAST could unilaterally choose an inconvenient or biased jurisdiction. While parties can agree on jurisdiction, this change gives one party unchecked power, potentially violating principles of fair dealing and access to justice, particularly if VOTOCAST chooses a jurisdiction with laws unfavorable to the licensee or that is geographically burdensome.",

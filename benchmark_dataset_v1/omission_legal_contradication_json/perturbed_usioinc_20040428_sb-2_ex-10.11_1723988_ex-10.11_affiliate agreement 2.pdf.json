                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'further agrees to cease using Network 1 name, including but not limited to logo(s) and insignia(s) at the written request of Network 1' eliminates Network 1's explicit right to control its brand and marketing materials used by the Affiliate. This creates a legal contradiction as trademark laws require brand owners to actively protect their trademarks to prevent genericide or dilution. By omitting the requirement for the affiliate to cease using logos and insignias upon request, Network 1 could be seen as failing to adequately protect its brand, potentially weakening its trademark rights.",

                "original_text": "Producer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless ConvergTV and its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents, and their respective successors or assigns, from all costs, expenses and damages arising from any breach or alleged breach of the warranties made by it in this Agreement.\n\nProducer shall further indemnify, defend and hold harmless ConvergTV and its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents, and their respective successors or assigns, from all costs, expenses and damages arising from any costs, errors, omissions, slander, losses, liability or for any other cause as a direct or indirect result of the Distribution, transmission or publication of the Producer’s Program or content.",
                "changed_text": "Producer shall indemnify ConvergTV from damages directly resulting from a material breach of this Agreement, not to exceed the revenue received by the Producer from ConvergTV under this Agreement.\n\nProducer shall further indemnify ConvergTV from damages directly resulting from gross negligence in the Distribution of the Producer's Program, capped at $1000.00 USD.",
                "explanation": "The original indemnification clause is broad, encompassing all costs, expenses, and damages arising from any breach or alleged breach. The modified clause severely limits the Producer's liability by capping the indemnification amount and requiring a direct causal link and gross negligence. This contradicts Florida law regarding indemnification clauses, which require clear and unambiguous language and proportionality. The cap could be deemed unconscionable if it doesn't adequately cover potential losses. This removal of implied consumer protections creates legal risk for ConvergTV, as they may not be fully protected from liability.",

                "changed_text": "For Programs licensed by and/or through ConvergTV, ConvergTV will attempt to address piracy to the best of its ability.",
                "explanation": "This section originally required ConvergTV to provide 'reasonable protections' against unauthorized distribution, piracy, etc. By changing this to 'attempt to address piracy to the best of its ability', the contract removes any concrete obligation for ConvergTV to actively protect the Producer's content. This contradicts standard copyright law, which implies a duty of care for distributors to protect copyrighted material, and may be deemed a breach of contract in some jurisdictions. Copyright law mandates platforms take action in line with DMCA requirements, removing the reasonable standard is a failure to comply with copyright protections that apply regardless of explicit mention.",

                "changed_text": "ConvergTV may, at its discretion, audit the Producer's compliance with this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause grants both parties the right to audit the other. The modified clause removes the Producer's right to audit ConvergTV, creating an imbalance of power. This is legally problematic because it prevents the Producer from verifying ConvergTV's compliance with the revenue sharing agreement (Exhibit B), which could be seen as a violation of good faith and fair dealing implied in contract law. Producers are prevented from the protection of proper accounting under contracted distribution, thus violating standard business practices for contracted service.",

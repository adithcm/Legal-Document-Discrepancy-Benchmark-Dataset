Transporter may file and seek Commission approval under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) at any time and from\ntime to time to change any rates, charges or provisions set forth in the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) and the\n\"General Terms and Conditions\" in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, and Transporter shall have the\nright to place such changes in effect in accordance with the NGA, and this Agreement shall be deemed to include such changes\nand any such changes",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"as may be revised from time to time\" and \"in accordance with the NGA, without prejudice to Shipper's right to protest the same\", the agreement implies that the tariff is fixed and unchangeable, and also removes the Shipper's right to protest, contradicting the Natural Gas Act which allows for tariff revisions and protects the rights of shippers to challenge them.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement to adhere to the laws of Michigan for dispute resolution, replacing it with the Transporter's discretion.

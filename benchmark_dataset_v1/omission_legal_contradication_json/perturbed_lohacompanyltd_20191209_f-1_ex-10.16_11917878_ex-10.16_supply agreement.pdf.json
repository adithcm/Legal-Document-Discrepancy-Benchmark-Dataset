                "original_text": "Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers.",
                "changed_text": "Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers may claim for compensation, but all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Buyers.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the buyer's explicit right to claim for replacement with new goods when the delivered goods are not in conformity with the contract stipulations. Also shifts the financial burden for expenses such as inspection, freight, and insurance from the seller to the buyer, which is against standard practice of the China Commodity Inspection Bureau. By omitting the right to replacement, the contract violates consumer rights regulations in China.",

The Sellers shall advise the Buyers immediately of the occurrence mentioned above and within fourteen days thereafter, the Sellers shall send by airmail to the Buyers a certificate of the accident issued by the competent government authorities, Chamber of Commerce or registered notary public of the place where the accident occurs as evidence thereof. Under such circumstances the Sellers, however, are still under the obligation to take all necessary measures to hasten the delivery of the goods. In case the accident lasts for more than 10 weeks, the Buyers shall have the right to cancel the Contract.",

In case the accident lasts for more than 10 weeks, the Buyers shall cancel the Contract.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'issued by the competent government authorities, Chamber of Commerce or registered notary public of the place where the accident occurs as evidence thereof' weakens the burden of proof for force majeure claims. In addition, the removal of the obligation to take all necessary measures to hasten the delivery of goods absolves the seller of active mitigation, which is expected under Chinese contract law. By removing the seller's obligation to provide valid evidence and mitigate damages, the contract becomes non-compliant.",
                "contradicted_law": "Article 180 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China specifies the requirements for valid force majeure claims, including providing adequate evidence and mitigating damages.",

                "original_text": "Should the Sellers fail to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, with exception of Force Majeure causes specified in Clause 17 of this Contract, the Buyers shall agree to postpone the delivery on condition that the Sellers agree to pay a penalty which shall be deducted by the paying bank from the payment. The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. The rate of penalty is charged at 0.5% for every seven days, odd days less than seven days should be counted as seven days. In case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the contract and the Sellers, in spite of the cancellation, shall still pay the aforesaid penalty to the Buyers without delay, the seller should refund the money received and pay the 30% of the total goods price of the penalty",

In case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the contract.",
                "explanation": "This revision significantly reduces the penalty for late delivery, both in terms of the maximum penalty (reduced from 5% to 1%) and the penalty rate (reduced from 0.5% to 0.1% per seven days). Also, the original text specified that the seller should refund the money received and pay the 30% of the total goods price of the penalty. By drastically reducing the penalty, and omitting the specified refund amount, the contract inadequately protects the buyer's interests in case of late delivery, potentially violating regulations related to fair trade practices.",

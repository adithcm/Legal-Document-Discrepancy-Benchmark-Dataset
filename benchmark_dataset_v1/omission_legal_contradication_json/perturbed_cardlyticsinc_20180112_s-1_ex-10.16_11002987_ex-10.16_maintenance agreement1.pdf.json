                "original_text": "Supplier shall at its own expense secure and continuously maintain, and shall require its Subcontractors to secure and continuously maintain, throughout the Term, the following insurance with companies qualified to do business in the jurisdiction in which the services will be performed and rating A-VII or better in the current Best’s Insurance Reports published by A M. Best Company and shall, upon Bank of America’s request, be furnished to Bank of America certificates and required endorsements evidencing such insurance. Bank of America shall be named as an ‘‘Additional Insured” to the coverages described in Sections 26.2.3, 26.2.4, and 26.2.5 below for the purpose of protecting Bank of America from any expense and/or liability arising out of, alleged to arise out of, related to or connected with the Products provided by Supplier and/or its Subcontractors. The certificates shall state the amount of all deductibles and self-insured retentions and shall contain evidence that the policy or policies shall not be canceled or materially altered without at least thirty (30) calendar days prior written notice to Bank of America. Supplier and its Subcontractors shalt pay any and all costs which are incurred by Bank of America as a result of any such deductibles or self-insured retentions to the extent that Bank of America is named as an “Additional Insured,” and to the same extent as if the policies contained no deductibles or self-insured retention. The insurance coverages and limits required to be maintained by Supplier and its Subcontractors shall be primary and non-contributory to insurance coverage, if any, maintained by Bank of America. Supplier and Proprietary to Bank of America its Subcontractors and their underwriters shall waive subrogation against Bank of America and shall cause their insurer(s) to waive subrogation against Bank of America.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier shall secure and maintain insurance with companies qualified to do business in the jurisdiction in which the services will be performed. Upon Bank of America’s request, Supplier shall furnish Bank of America with certificates evidencing such insurance. Bank of America shall be named as an Additional Insured to the coverages described in Sections 26.2.3, 26.2.4, and 26.2.5 below.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the requirement that Supplier secure insurance 'at its own expense' and 'continuously maintain' it, introducing uncertainty about who bears the cost and duration of coverage. It removes the minimum rating requirement (A-VII or better) from Best's Insurance Reports, which may result in inadequate coverage. The deletion of the stipulation that certificates 'shall state the amount of all deductibles and self-insured retentions and shall contain evidence that the policy or policies shall not be canceled or materially altered without at least thirty (30) calendar days prior written notice to Bank of America' eliminates transparency and allows for potentially detrimental changes to occur without notice. The removal of the clause compelling Supplier and its Subcontractors to cover Bank of America's deductible costs weakens Bank of America's protection. Finally, eliminating the waiver of subrogation undermines Bank of America's ability to recover damages directly. These changes contradict standard commercial insurance practices and potentially violate requirements for adequate risk management.",

The exclusion of 'specifically covering infringement of Intellectual Property Rights' removes protection against IP-related claims, and the deletion of 'This policy shall include products/completed operations coverage and shall also include contractual liability coverage' removes crucial safeguards for Bank of America against product-related liabilities and contractual breaches. This change creates a legal contradiction with the need for businesses to maintain adequate liability coverage.",

                "explanation": "The deletion of 'with minimum limits of not less than $5,000,000' removes the requirement for a specified level of financial protection against errors and omissions. Also, the removal of the detailed listing of covered services significantly narrows the scope of the insurance, potentially leaving Bank of America unprotected against liabilities arising from essential IT services. This omission introduces significant legal risk by reducing the scope and coverage of Errors and Omissions insurance, potentially contradicting regulatory expectations for adequate risk management.",

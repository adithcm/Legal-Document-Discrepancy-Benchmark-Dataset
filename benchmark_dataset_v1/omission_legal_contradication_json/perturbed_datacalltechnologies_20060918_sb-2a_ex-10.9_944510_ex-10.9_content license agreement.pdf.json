                "original_text": "LICENSOR warrants that Content does not infringe an intellectual property right enforceable in the agreed country of delivery or use. LICENSOR indemnifies and holds harmless plan_b against all claims that Content infringes any of the above mentioned rights of a third Party. LICENSOR shall pay all damages awarded in a trial to a third Party.",
                "changed_text": "LICENSOR warrants that Content does not knowingly infringe an intellectual property right. LICENSOR may indemnify and hold harmless plan_b against claims of infringement at LICENSOR's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a strong warranty against intellectual property infringement and mandates indemnification. The modified clause weakens the warranty by adding 'knowingly,' making it harder to prove a breach. It also changes the mandatory indemnification to a discretionary one, removing a critical protection for plan_b. The original text required the licensor to pay 'all damages awarded in a trial to a third Party.' The modified version removes this.",

In the United States, this could be seen as an unfair business practice under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act if it leads to consumer harm.",

                "changed_text": "plan_b shall provide LICENSOR with a written record of End User activity at plan_b's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates a detailed written record, including the number of End User downloads and each distribution channel, provided within 6 weeks of the end of each quarter. The modification removes the 'detailed' requirement, eliminates the specification for including the number of downloads and distribution channels, and makes the provision of any record entirely discretionary on plan_b's part. This removes a key component that protects the licensor.",

In the event that any such audit reveals that plan_b has underpaid fees to the value of ten (10) percent or more of the total amount of payments for the period covered by the audit, plan_b shall bear the cost of the audit and shall in any event immediately pay to LICENSOR the full value of the underpaid or under-reported fees. Such audits shall normally be conducted during normal business hours at plan_b's premises.",

                "explanation": "The original clause gives LICENSOR a clear right to audit plan_b's records with a certified public accountant. It also specifies that plan_b bears the cost if underpayment exceeds 10%. The modified clause removes the explicit audit right, makes any review subject to plan_b's approval, and replaces the obligation to pay underpaid fees with a vague requirement for 'good-faith negotiations.' This significantly weakens LICENSOR's ability to verify revenue and enforce the contract.",

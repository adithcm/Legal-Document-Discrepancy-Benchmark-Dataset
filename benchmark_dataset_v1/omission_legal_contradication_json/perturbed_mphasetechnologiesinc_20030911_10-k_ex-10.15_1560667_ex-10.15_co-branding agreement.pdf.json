                "original_text": "Neither Party shall be liable to the other for special, incidental, or consequential damages, even if such Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.",
                "changed_text": "Neither Party shall be liable to the other for special, incidental, or consequential damages, except for damages arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct.",
                "explanation": "The original clause attempts to broadly exclude liability for special, incidental, or consequential damages. By modifying it to allow liability for damages arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct, the contract now appears to acknowledge at least some minimum legal standards of care required under New York law. However, it creates a legal contradiction because, while it seems to acknowledge some responsibility, it fails to specify the full extent of liability as required by New York's general business law that protects parties from waivers of liability exceeding the scope that the law allows.",

                "explanation": "By excluding the conflict of law principles of New York, the contract attempts to prevent the application of laws from other jurisdictions that might offer greater consumer protections. This creates a legal risk because certain mandatory consumer protection laws could be applicable regardless of this clause, and attempting to circumvent them might be deemed unenforceable or even lead to penalties. This omission contradicts the established legal precedent that choice-of-law provisions cannot be used to circumvent mandatory consumer protection laws.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'to cooperate fully, at Lucent's expense, in any enforcement of Lucent's rights against such third parties' eliminates mPhase's obligation to assist Lucent in protecting its intellectual property. While Lucent isn't obligated to enforce its rights, mPhase's cooperation is vital to Lucent's brand protection. Eliminating it could be argued as undermining the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, creating a contractual loophole that allows mPhase to avoid responsibility in protecting Lucent's brand, potentially conflicting with trademark protection laws, especially the Lanham Act which emphasizes preventing consumer confusion and requires proactive brand defense.",

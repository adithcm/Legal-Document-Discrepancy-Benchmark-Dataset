The staffing levels at each Stand shall be subject to Club’s approval.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for Sponsor Staff to undergo training, either by the Sponsor or the Concessionaire, the agreement omits a critical aspect of food safety and responsible alcohol service. This creates a potential legal issue as Florida law requires training for food handlers and servers of alcoholic beverages.",

Any costs or expenses incurred by Club or the Concessionaire with respect to any such recall shall be the sole responsibility of Sponsor.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for the Sponsor to notify the Concessionaire immediately upon a product recall creates a legal vulnerability.  Florida law requires food vendors to promptly report recalls to relevant authorities and downstream recipients. By omitting the notification to the Concessionaire, the agreement increases the risk of contaminated products remaining in circulation, potentially violating state health regulations.",

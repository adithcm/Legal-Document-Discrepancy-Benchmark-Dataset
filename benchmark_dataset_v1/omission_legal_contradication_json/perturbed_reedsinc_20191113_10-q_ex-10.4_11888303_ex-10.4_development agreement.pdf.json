Reed’s will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its directors, officers, members, employees, licensees, agents and independent contractors, from and against any claims for the breach of the intellectual property rights of a third party based on the Reed’s Intellectual Property. Company will indemnify defend and hold harmless Reed’s and its directors, officers, members, employees, licensees, agents and independent contractors, from and against any claims for the breach of the intellectual property rights of a third party based on the Company Intellectual Property, Deliverables and Work Product, except as such claims are solely based on or limited to the Reed’s Intellectual Property.",
                "changed_text": "Each party will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its respective directors, officers, members, employees, licensees, agents and independent contractors, from and against any claim or action, liability, damages, and expense, arising from or resulting from (i) the negligent act or omission of the party, its employees, agents or contractors, or (ii) the party’s breach of this Agreement.

                "explanation": "By removing the clause '(iii) the violation of any law by the party, its employees, agents, or contractors' from the indemnification obligations, the contract no longer explicitly requires indemnification for legal violations. This weakens the protection for the other party and may violate laws requiring companies to be responsible for violations caused by them.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit mention of 'immediate injunctive relief in the form of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or permanent injunction', the contract makes it less clear that parties have access to this swift legal remedy. Injunctive relief is an important legal tool, and omitting it could violate laws requiring parties to be able to seek quick remedies for contract breaches.",

                "explanation": "By changing the venue clause to a location convenient to Reed's and removing the specifier of New York City, New York it potentially violates laws related to fairness in dispute resolution and access to justice. Forcing Company to litigate in a location solely convenient to Reed's could create an undue burden, especially if Company is an Oregon-based entity, potentially violating Oregon's or federal regulations on fair business practices.",

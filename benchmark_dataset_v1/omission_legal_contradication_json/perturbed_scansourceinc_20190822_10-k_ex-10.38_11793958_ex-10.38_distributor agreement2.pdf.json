YOUR RIGHT TO RETURN AND REFUND EXPIRES 30 DAYS AFTER PURCHASE FROM CISCO OR\nAN AUTHORIZED CISCO RESELLER, AND APPLIES ONLY IF CUSTOMER IS THE ORIGINAL END USER PURCHASER.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the guaranteed 30-day return period and replaces it with a vague reference to 'company policy.' Many states, including California (where the agreement is governed), have consumer protection laws that mandate minimum return periods or refund rights, especially for software. This omission makes the contract non-compliant with these laws.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the specific 90-day warranty period and the guarantee that the software will conform to specifications. By making the warranty details vague and dependent on 'separate details', Cisco avoids a clear warranty commitment. This could be problematic because implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose exist under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which California has adopted. This omission attempts to circumvent those implied warranties, creating a legal risk.",

                "explanation": "This revision significantly reduces the scope of the disclaimer of warranty. The original text explicitly disclaims almost all implied warranties, 'to the extent allowed by applicable law'. The modified text omits the specific disclaimer of implied warranties such as merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, along with the limiting phrase 'to the extent allowed by applicable law.' While it still disclaims 'express warranties' beyond the outlined terms, the omission of the implied warranty disclaimer, especially the explicit mention of merchantability and fitness, creates potential legal issues.  In some jurisdictions, implied warranties cannot be completely disclaimed, especially if the disclaimer is not conspicuous or if the product fails its essential purpose. This omission introduces ambiguity and potential conflict with consumer protection laws and the UCC.",

                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Licensee shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Licensor and its officers, directors, employees, agents, corporate subsidiaries, parents, and affiliates (“Licensor Indemnitees”) from and against any and all demands, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments, deficiencies, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys’ fees and expenses), incurred in conjunction with or arising out of or relating to any third-party claim concerning the Licensed Products and any acts or omissions of Licensee with respect to the Licensed Mark, including without limitation Licensee’s performance of its obligations under this Agreement. The Licensor Indemnitees agree to cooperate with Licensee, at Licensee’s expense, to provide copies of any documents or materials reasonably requested by Licensee in support of its defense of the Licensor Indemnitees.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall indemnify Licensor from and against any losses, liabilities and expenses incurred in conjunction with or arising out of any third-party claim concerning the Licensed Products and any acts or omissions of Licensee with respect to the Licensed Mark. The Licensor Indemnitees agree to cooperate with Licensee to provide copies of any documents or materials requested by Licensee.",
                "explanation": "The modified clause removes the 'defend' and 'hold harmless' obligations, and the specification of included expenses like 'reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys’ fees and expenses' from the indemnification clause. The clause also removes mention of Licensor's officers, directors, employees, agents, corporate subsidiaries, parents, and affiliates. By removing the duty to defend and hold harmless, the contract reduces the protection afforded to Licensor. Furthermore, eliminating specific mention of attorney fees can limit the scope of recoverable damages. Delaware law generally requires indemnification clauses to be clear and unambiguous, and this removal weakens that protection potentially creating a legal loophole if a third-party claim arises. Omitting the specific inclusion of attorney's fees could lead a court to interpret the clause as not covering them, thereby contradicting the intent of full indemnification.",

                "original_text": "In the event that Licensee has not taken appropriate steps to restore such quality within one-hundred twenty (120) days after notification by Licensor, Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "If the quality of a class of the Licensed Products falls below such standards, Licensee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to restore such quality.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the clause outlining the termination right upon failure to restore quality within 120 days significantly weakens Licensor's ability to enforce quality control. This omission introduces legal risk because it removes a crucial remedy for breach of contract. Without a specified timeframe and termination right, the Licensor's recourse is less clear, potentially requiring protracted legal battles to enforce quality standards. This is a legal contradiction to standard trademark protection practice which includes quality control by the trademark owner. Delaware law recognizes the importance of clear remedies in contract enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Print and electronic displays of the Licensed Mark by Licensee may include a notice.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the condition that the licensee display that the trademark is owned by the Licensor removes the trademark usage accountability of the Licensee. This would violate the fundamental aspect of trademark law, and introduces risk for a trademark dilution case.",

                "original_text": "VerticalNet shall comply with all prevailing laws, rules and regulations and obtain all necessary approvals, consents and permits required by the applicable agencies of the government of the jurisdictions that apply to its activities or obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "VerticalNet shall obtain approvals and permits it deems necessary for its activities under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change omits the explicit requirement for VerticalNet to comply with 'all prevailing laws, rules, and regulations.' By stating they only need to obtain permits they 'deem necessary,' it allows the company to potentially disregard mandatory legal requirements and operate outside the bounds of the law, creating legal risk.",
                "contradicted_law": "General violation of business and consumer protection laws (applicable across US jurisdictions) requiring businesses to operate within the legal framework.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party shall strive to obtain the approvals and consents required for its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the mandatory 'shall comply' with the aspirational 'shall strive.' It weakens the commitment to legal and regulatory compliance, creating a loophole where a party might not fully adhere to legal requirements, introducing legal risk.",

                "changed_text": "VerticalNet shall comply with the laws and regulations it deems commercially reasonable and obtain permits it deems essential.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a 'commercially reasonable' standard and subjective assessment of 'essential' permits, which allows VerticalNet to potentially avoid certain legal requirements based on its business interests. This weakens its commitment to full legal compliance, creating a legal loophole. Because it is located in Pennsylvania and Neoforma is in California, there are legal compliance issues in multiple states.",

                "original_text": "Vertex shall promptly indemnify Bunker One and pay any and all damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys‘ fees, incident to any suits, actions, investigations, claims or proceedings suffered, sustained, incurred or required to be paid by Bunker One by reason of any negligence, gross negligence and/or intentional act or omission on the part of Vertex in rendering services hereunder, or any breach or failure of observance or performance of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Vertex hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "Vertex shall indemnify Bunker One for damages directly caused by Vertex's intentional misconduct. The amount of indemnification shall not exceed the direct costs incurred by Bunker One.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly limits Vertex's indemnification obligations. The original clause covers 'any negligence, gross negligence and/or intentional act or omission,' while the modified clause only covers intentional misconduct. The limitation on the amount of indemnification to 'direct costs' and the exclusion of attorney's fees further weakens Bunker One's protection, potentially violating general contract law principles that require parties to be made whole in the event of a breach.",

                "changed_text": "Bunker One shall indemnify Vertex only for proven cases of gross negligence directly attributable to Bunker One. Bunker One's liability is capped at $10,000.",
                "explanation": "This revision severely restricts Bunker One's indemnification responsibilities. By limiting it to 'proven cases of gross negligence,' the clause excludes ordinary negligence and other potential liabilities. Adding a liability cap of $10,000 may be insufficient to cover substantial damages, creating a legal contradiction with principles of full indemnification.",

Any counterclaim arising out of, or in connection with, the dispute shall be brought in the same proceeding.",
                "changed_text": "Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this JSMA shall be resolved through mandatory arbitration, waiving all rights to pursue claims in court.",
                "explanation": "This modification forces all disputes into arbitration, removing the option of court resolution. While arbitration is generally permissible, certain claims (particularly those involving significant public interest or statutory rights) may not be subject to mandatory arbitration under Alabama law. This change could be deemed an unlawful waiver of rights.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the Business complies with all applicable Laws in respect of operation, advertising and promotion of the Business and use of the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content in connection therewith.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the language from \"shall ensure\" to \"shall make reasonable efforts\" weakens the obligation to comply with applicable laws. This creates a legal risk because various regulations in the PRC mandate strict compliance, not just reasonable efforts, particularly in advertising and content publication.",

                "original_text": "Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority. Licenseeâ€™s failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing obligations, Licensee acknowledges that Licensor shall have the right to remove such offending Content from the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall endeavor to remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites after it becomes aware of such offending Content. Licensee acknowledges that Licensor shall have the right to remove such offending Content from the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"shall remove as soon as possible, but no later than...\" to \"shall endeavor to remove\", the contract now permits delays in content removal, and also removed the penalty of 'material breach of this agreement.' This violates the strict content censorship regulations prevalent in the PRC, creating a legal loophole where prompt action is legally required.",

In maintaining the confidentiality of Confidential Information, the Recipient shall exercise reasonable degree of care.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires the recipient to exercise the same degree of care as with their own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care. Removing the standard of exercising the same degree of care weakens the confidentiality obligations. Under PRC law, particularly regarding data protection and trade secrets, a consistent and high standard of care is often expected, and this change introduces ambiguity and potential non-compliance.",

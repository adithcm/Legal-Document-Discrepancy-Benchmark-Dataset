Unless such election is made in writing, all cash payments shall be made by check, drawn to the order of Auriemma or its designated entity or entities and delivered to the address first stated above. Past due cash payments (i.e., payments due more than thirty (30) days after Berkshire’s receipt of the applicable invoice) shall bear interest at the rate of one (1%) percent per month.",

                "explanation": "By narrowing the scope of indemnification to only 'breach of Berkshire’s representations or warranties' and removing 'hold harmless,' the bank limits its liability, potentially violating the principle of full indemnification that is expected in endorsement agreements.

ARBITRATION.\n\nAny dispute or difference between the parties hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association by a panel of three qualified arbitrators. Berkshire and Auriemma shall each choose an arbitrator and the two (2) arbitrators so chosen shall choose the third. If either BERKSHIRE or Auriemma fails to choose an arbitrator within 30 days after notice of commencement of arbitration or if the two arbitrators fail to choose a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days after their appointment, the American Arbitration Association shall, upon the request of any party to the dispute or difference, appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators to constitute or complete the panel as the case may be. Arbitration proceedings hereunder may be initiated by either BERKSHIRE or Auriemma making a written request to the American Arbitration Association, together with any appropriate filing fee, at the office of the American Arbitration Association in the county in which proceedings are to be held pursuant to the terms of the following sentence. All arbitration proceedings or litigation (to the extent the remedy requested is not, by law, available through arbitration [e.g., injunctive relief]) relating to any claims or disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the county in which the principal executive office of the party not initiating such action or proceeding defendant or responding party) is located.

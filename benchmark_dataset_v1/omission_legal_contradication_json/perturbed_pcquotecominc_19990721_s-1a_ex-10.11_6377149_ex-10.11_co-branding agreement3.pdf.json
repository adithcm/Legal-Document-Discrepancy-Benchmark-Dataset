                "explanation": "The addition of 'PCQ is not liable for any loss of earnings due to downtime of service' eliminates the implied warranty of merchantability, which requires that goods or services be fit for their intended purpose.

                "explanation": "The inclusion of 'PCQ is not liable for damages caused by errors or omissions in information provided' attempts to waive liability for negligence or misrepresentation.

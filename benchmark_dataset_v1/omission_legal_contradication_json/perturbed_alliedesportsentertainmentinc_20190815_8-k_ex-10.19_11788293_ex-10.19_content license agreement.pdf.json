                "original_text": "Each party agrees to carry liability insurance sufficient to cover the risks posed under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each party may elect to carry liability insurance.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that each party must have liability insurance. By changing it to 'may elect,' the obligation to maintain adequate insurance is removed. California law (where WPT is located) and general business practices often require businesses to maintain certain levels of liability insurance depending on their operations and potential risks. Removing this requirement creates a potential legal risk if one party's actions lead to damages or liabilities that are not covered by insurance, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, depending on the specifics of the situation.",

A copy of any notice to WPT shall also be sent to WPT Enterprises, Inc., ATTN: Legal, 1920 Main Street, Suite 1150, Irvine, CA 92614. A copy of any notice to Zynga shall also be sent to Office of the General Counsel, Zynga Inc., 699 8th Street, San Francisco, CA 94103 with a copy to legalnotices@zynga.com. Notice shall be deemed given as follows: upon delivery if sent by courier service, express mail or personal deliveryÍ¾ and five (5) days after the date of mailing, postage prepaid, certified or registered mail if sent by mail.",
                "changed_text": "All notices and other communications may be given verbally. Notice shall be deemed given immediately.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that all notices must be written and delivered through specific methods (courier, mail, etc.), ensuring a documented record. Changing this to allow verbal notices eliminates this crucial documentation requirement. In legal disputes governed by California law, documented evidence is paramount. Allowing verbal notices introduces ambiguity and makes it difficult to prove that notice was actually given, particularly for critical matters such as contract breaches or termination. This increases the risk of disputes and legal challenges based on lack of proper notification. Additionally, eliminating the specified recipients could cause notices to be missed.",

                "changed_text": "The parties agree to attempt mediation before pursuing any legal action.",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes the Northern District of California as the sole jurisdiction for disputes. Removing this and replacing it with a simple mediation clause eliminates the pre-agreed forum. While mediation is generally encouraged, removing the jurisdiction clause means that in the event mediation fails, either party could potentially file suit in any jurisdiction where the other party has connections, leading to forum shopping and increased legal costs and uncertainty. This contradicts the principle of contractual certainty and the ability to predict where disputes will be resolved, potentially violating the reasonable expectations of the parties based on standard contract law principles in California.",

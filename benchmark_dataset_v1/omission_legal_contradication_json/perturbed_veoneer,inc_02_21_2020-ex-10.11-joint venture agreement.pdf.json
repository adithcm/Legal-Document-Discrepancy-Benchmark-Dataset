                "original_text": "Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the Nissin Parties agree to cause each of VNBJ and VNBZ to comply with Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of the JV Agreement with respect to the indemnification or reimbursement, as applicable, of all Directors and Officers (except those individuals resigning pursuant to Section 6.2.6 of the VNBJ SPA and Section 6.2.6 of the VNBZ SPA) with respect to any Liabilities arising prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the Nissin Parties will consider the indemnification or reimbursement of Directors and Officers (except those individuals resigning pursuant to Section 6.2.6 of the VNBJ SPA and Section 6.2.6 of the VNBZ SPA) with respect to Liabilities arising prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'agree to cause each of VNBJ and VNBZ to comply with Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of the JV Agreement with respect to the indemnification or reimbursement, as applicable' language, the amended text significantly weakens the obligation to indemnify Directors and Officers. Changing it to 'will consider' makes the indemnification discretionary, violating standard corporate governance practices and potentially breaching fiduciary duties under Japanese corporate law, which requires reasonable protection for directors and officers.",

                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Delaware.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from Japan to Delaware introduces legal risk. The original agreement involved Japanese entities and operations primarily governed by Japanese law. Switching to Delaware law, which may not adequately address specific nuances of Japanese business practices or regulations relevant to the joint venture, could create conflicts and uncertainties in interpreting and enforcing the agreement, potentially disadvantaging parties and contradicting mandatory provisions of Japanese law regarding cross-border transactions and corporate governance.",

                "changed_text": "This Amendment becomes effective immediately upon signing.",
                "explanation": "Removing the condition that the amendment becomes effective only upon the closing of the VNBJ and VNBZ transactions, and instead making it effective immediately upon signing, creates a legal contradiction. If the VNBJ and VNBZ SPAs are terminated, the amendment would still be in effect, potentially leading to unintended consequences and obligations for the parties. This contradicts the clearly intended conditional nature of the original agreement, possibly violating principles of contract interpretation under both Japanese and US law by rendering the entire agreement ambiguous and unenforceable due to lack of clear conditions precedent.",

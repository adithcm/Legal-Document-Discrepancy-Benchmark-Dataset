                "original_text": "Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold the other party and its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, successors, assigns, licensees and distributors harmless from and against any and all judgments, settlements, damages, penalties, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any third party claims relating to the Indemnifying Party’s breach or alleged breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations hereunder. The party seeking indemnification (the “Indemnified Party”) will give prompt notice to the indemnifying party (the “Indemnifying Party”) of any claim for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement; provided, however, that failure to give prompt notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual material prejudice by such failure). The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate (at the Indemnifying Party’s expense) in the defense of any claim for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Section 13. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) any such action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless: (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnified Party has been authorized by the Indemnifying Party; (ii) the Indemnified Party has been advised by its counsel in writing that there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense of the action (in which case the Indemnifying Party will not have the right to direct the defense of the action on behalf of the Indemnified Party); or (iii) the Indemnifying Party has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of the action within a reasonable time following receipt of the notice given pursuant to this Section 13, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any settlement of an action effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), nor will the Indemnifying Party settle any such action without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party a release from all liability with respect to the claim.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'reasonable' attorneys' fees and replacing 'prompt notice' to just 'notice', omits specific legal protections. Similarly, removing the stipulation that failure to give prompt notice only releases the Indemnifying Party from liability to the extent it suffered 'actual material prejudice' and the clause about the Indemnifying Party not being able to direct the defense if there's a conflict of interest creates loopholes. By omitting these, the contract introduces contradictions with standard indemnification laws, weakening the Indemnified Party's position and increasing potential legal risks in New York.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE', the contract attempts to disclaim implied warranties without explicitly stating this. While a general disclaimer might be somewhat effective, the omission of the specific disclaimer of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose can create a potential point of legal challenge. The implied warranty of merchantability is a baseline consumer protection under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), applicable in New York (and most US states). Omitting it can be argued as an unconscionable attempt to waive consumer rights, creating a legal vulnerability.",

Any dispute, controversy and/or difference which may arise out of or in connection with or in relation to this Agreement, shall be solely and finally settled by binding arbitration pursuant to then-current rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. Such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York. The merits of the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to its choice of law rules. The tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, each of whom shall be knowledgeable in the subject matter hereof. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language, and all documents shall be submitted in English or be accompanied by a certified English translation. The arbitrators will provide a written explanation to the parties of any arbitration award. The award thereof shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto, and judgment on such award may be entered in any court or tribunal having jurisdiction, and the parties hereby irrevocably waive any objection to the jurisdiction of such courts based on any ground, including without limitation, improper venue or forum non conveniens. The parties and the arbitration panel shall be bound to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement, the dispute and any award, except to the extent necessary to enforce any such award. The prevailing party, if a party is so designated in the arbitration award, shall be entitled to recover from the other party its costs and fees, including attorneys’ fees, associated with such arbitration. By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, the parties understand that they are waiving certain rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a dispute between the parties were determined by litigation in court, including, without limitation, the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this arbitration provision, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, and a right to invoke formal rules of procedure and evidence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each party shall be entitled, at any time, without first resorting to the dispute resolution process set forth above, to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, wherever such party deems appropriate, in order to preserve or enforce such party’s rights hereunder.",

Removing the phrase \"the arbitrators will provide a written explanation to the parties of any arbitration award\", the parties are not guaranteed explanation of the arbitrator's decision. The phrase \"the prevailing party, if a party is so designated in the arbitration award, shall be entitled to recover from the other party its costs and fees, including attorneys’ fees, associated with such arbitration\" guarantees that the winning party can recoup legal fees but this clause is omitted in the changed text which is a legal right.

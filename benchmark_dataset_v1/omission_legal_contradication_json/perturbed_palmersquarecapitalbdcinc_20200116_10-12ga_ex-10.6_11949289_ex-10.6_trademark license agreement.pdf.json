                "changed_text": "Licensee agrees to use reasonable efforts to comply with laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory applicable to the business, marketing, and promotion. Notification to Licensor regarding compliance shall occur only if Licensee deems it necessary.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'reasonable efforts' and changing the mandatory notification requirement to a discretionary one, the Licensee's obligation to strictly adhere to all applicable laws is weakened. This creates a loophole where the licensee can claim to have made 'reasonable efforts' even if non-compliance occurs. The New York law requires strict compliance with all regulations in business operations.",

This could contradict principles of contractual certainty under New York law if the parties intended to have disputes resolved in New York.",

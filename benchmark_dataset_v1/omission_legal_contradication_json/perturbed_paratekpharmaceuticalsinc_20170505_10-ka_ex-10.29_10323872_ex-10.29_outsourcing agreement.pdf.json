                "changed_text": "Supplier shall maintain insurance as it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates a minimum insurance coverage, which protects the customer against potential liabilities. Removing this minimum requirement and giving the supplier discretion violates general principles requiring adequate insurance coverage to protect against foreseeable risks, which many jurisdiction mandates.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law Principles, specific jurisdiction insurance regulations",

                "changed_text": "Customer’s sole recourse for Out of Specification Product is limited to Supplier’s discretion.",
                "explanation": "This eliminates the customer's right to refunds or replacements for defective products due to supplier breaches, which are legally protected rights. It allows the supplier complete control over remedies for its failures, which may violate basic principles of fair trade and consumer protection laws.",

These specific remedies\nare in addition to any other remedy to which the Parties may be entitled at law or in equity.",
                "changed_text": "Neither party shall be entitled to injunctive relief for any breach of this agreement; remedies are limited to monetary damages.",
                "explanation": "Denying injunctive relief restricts the ability to prevent ongoing harm, potentially violating legal requirements that support equitable remedies when monetary compensation is insufficient. This undermines the principle that specific performance can be mandated where damages are inadequate.",

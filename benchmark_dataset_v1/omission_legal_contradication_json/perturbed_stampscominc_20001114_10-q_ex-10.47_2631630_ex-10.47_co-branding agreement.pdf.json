                "original_text": "The Company shall maintain complete and accurate records of the number of packages shipped by the MBE Centers using the Service and all payments due or accrued to the Company by MBE Centers hereunder. MBE shall, at any time during the term of this Agreement, be entitled to audit all such records upon ten (10) days written notice to the Company, in order to confirm the accuracy of such records and conformance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\nprovided, however, that no more than one (1) such audit may be conducted in any\nninety (90)-day period. Any such audit shall be performed at MBE's expense\nduring the Company's normal business hours; provided, however, that in the event\nthat such audit reveals any non-compliance with any term of this Agreement by\nthe Company, the Company shall bear the cost of such audit.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall maintain records of the number of packages shipped by the MBE Centers using the Service and payments due. Audits to confirm the accuracy of such records will be conducted at the company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the guaranteed right for MBE to audit the Company's records and replacing it with discretionary audits, the contract omits an important financial protection measure. California law favors transparency and accountability in business dealings, especially where franchise relationships are concerned. The removal of the explicit audit right creates a legal loophole that could disadvantage MBE if discrepancies in payments or package numbers arise. The original text has 2 'provided however' clauses which are being removed as well.",

The Company further agrees to pay all\ndamages and costs (including reasonable attorneys' fee and expert witness fees)\nincurred by any Indemnitee in connection with such Claim. The Company shall have\nsole control of any such action or settlement negotiations. Without the consent\nof MBE, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Company shall not settle\nany such Claim in a manner that (i) imposes damages or costs on any Indemnitee\nnot covered by the Company hereunder or (b) imposes any injunctive or other\nnon-monetary relief on any Indemnitee. MBE shall notify the Company promptly in\nwriting of each such Claim and gives the Company all authority, information and\nassistance, at the Company's expense, reasonably necessary to settle or defend\nsuch claim.",

The Company shall pay damages and costs incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with such Claim. The Company shall have control of any such action or settlement negotiations. MBE shall notify the Company of each such Claim.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'at its expense,' the company is no longer explicitly committed to covering all costs of defense, potentially leaving MBE with significant legal bills. Deleting 'reasonable attorneys' fee and expert witness fees' omits a specific promise of cost coverage. Removing the clause stating 'Without the consent of MBE, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Company shall not settle any such Claim in a manner that (i) imposes damages or costs on any Indemnitee not covered by the Company hereunder or (b) imposes any injunctive or other non-monetary relief on any Indemnitee' weakens the protection of MBE's interest in the settlement of claims. Omitting 'gives the Company all authority, information and assistance, at the Company's expense, reasonably necessary to settle or defend such claim.' removes the guarantee that the expense will be on The Company.",

This clause also deletes the line 'THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.'.

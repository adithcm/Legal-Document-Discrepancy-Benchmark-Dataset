                "original_text": "7.1 Performance Warranty. Todos warrants that for a period of one (1) year from the date of delivery of each Product to the Reseller, the Product, except for those components that have a shorter expiration date as set forth on Exhibit A, shall perform substantially in accordance with the Product’s documentation and specifications, and shall be free from all defects in materials, manufacture, and workmanship. Todos shall correct or repair any reported non-conformity or defect, or replace the non-conforming Product with a Product that conforms to this warranty.",

Todos may, at its discretion, correct or repair any reported non-conformity or defect, or replace the non-conforming Product.",
                "explanation": "The modification removes the one-year warranty period and eliminates the obligation to repair or replace defective products, giving Todos complete discretion. This contradicts Israeli Consumer Protection Law, which mandates a minimum warranty period for goods and requires suppliers to repair or replace defective items.",
                "contradicted_law": "Israeli Consumer Protection Law, specifically regarding warranty periods and obligations for defective goods.",

NO REPRESENTATION OR OTHER AFFIRMATION OF FACT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO STATEMENTS REGARDING PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCTS, WHICH IS NOT CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A WARRANTY BY TODOS.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the detailed disclaimer of implied warranties, potentially weakening it. While a general disclaimer might seem simpler, Israeli law requires specific and unambiguous language to disclaim implied warranties, especially regarding merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Removing this detail makes the disclaimer potentially unenforceable, violating consumer protection principles related to transparency and informed consent.",

                "explanation": "The deletion of 'appropriate' and 'adequate' weakens the requirements. More critically, removing 'as well as sufficient levels of all legally mandated insurance, if any' directly contradicts potential Israeli laws that may require specific insurance types or minimum coverage amounts for businesses operating in the healthcare or diagnostic sectors. This omission introduces risk because it fails to ensure compliance with potentially mandatory insurance laws in Israel.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates Israeli laws and regulations mandating specific insurance requirements for businesses in the healthcare or diagnostic fields. Specific laws would need to be researched to determine the exact violation, as this clause creates ambiguity about compliance.",

Upon JHU’s request, Company will furnish JHU with a Certificate of Insurance of each product liability insurance policy obtained. JHU shall be listed as an additional insured in Company’s said insurance policies. If such Product Liability insurance is underwritten on a ‘claims made’ basis, Company agrees that any change in underwriters during the term of this Agreement will require the purchase of ‘prior acts’ coverage to ensure that coverage will be continuous throughout the term of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'appropriate to the risks involved in marketing LICENSED PRODUCT(S) and/or LICENSED SERVICE(S) and will annually present evidence to JHU that such coverage is being maintained. Upon JHU’s request, Company will furnish JHU with a Certificate of Insurance of each product liability insurance policy obtained. JHU shall be listed as an additional insured in Company’s said insurance policies' significantly weakens the insurance requirement. The deletion of the annual proof requirement eliminates an important compliance measure. This creates a legal contradiction with state laws that mandate specific evidence and detail for insurance policies.",

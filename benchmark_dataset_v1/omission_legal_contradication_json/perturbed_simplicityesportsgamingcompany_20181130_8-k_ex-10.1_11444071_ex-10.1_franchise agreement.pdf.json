                "changed_text": "Franchisee shall maintain customer relations at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'good customer relations' following 'prudent and reasonable business practices'. The modified text removes these standards, granting the Franchisee complete discretion over customer relations. This omission introduces legal risk as it may allow the franchisee to engage in practices that, while not explicitly illegal, could be deemed unfair or deceptive under consumer protection laws, such as deceptive advertising or failure to honor warranties. These practices are often covered by laws preventing unfair trade practices. By removing the 'prudent and reasonable' standard, the contract could be interpreted as permitting actions that violate these protections.",
                "contradicted_law": "State and Federal laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, state-level consumer protection laws).",

                "changed_text": "Compliance with Law Franchisee shall endeavor to ensure that the Smaaash Centres shall be set up, established, operated, managed, advertised, marketed, promoted, publicized and otherwise exploited, in accordance with laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates full compliance with 'all applicable laws and regulations.' The modified version weakens this by stating 'endeavor to ensure,' creating ambiguity about the level of compliance required. The removal of 'all' before 'laws and regulations' and the elimination of the specific examples (customs, country of origin) further reduce the scope. This weakens the obligation and creates legal risk because it may be interpreted as allowing less than full compliance, directly violating consumer protection and regulatory mandates.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term, Franchisee shall maintain insurance in relation to the Smaaash Centres.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that insurance policies are to be maintained as requested by the Franchisor, but importantly, it is 'subject to applicable law.' This acknowledges and incorporates any legal requirements for insurance coverage. The modified version removes 'as may be requested by Franchisor, subject to applicable law,' eliminating the link to legal requirements. This omission allows the franchisee to maintain a minimum level of insurance, potentially below what is legally mandated, or to argue that no specific insurance is required because the franchisor has not 'requested' it. This directly contradicts state laws that mandate minimum insurance levels for businesses.",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws mandating minimum insurance coverage for businesses, particularly those involving public entertainment and potential liabilities.",

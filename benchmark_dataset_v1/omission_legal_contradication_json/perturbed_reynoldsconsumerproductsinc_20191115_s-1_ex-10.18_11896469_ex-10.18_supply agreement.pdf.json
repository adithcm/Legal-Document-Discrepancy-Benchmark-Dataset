Requires waiver of subrogation endorsement.\nAll insurers of a Party on such policies must have at all times an A.M. Best financial rating of at least “A-Minus VII”. An insuring Party may satisfy the\nrequired minimum amounts of insurance through a primary policy and one or more excess policies. All insurance of an insuring Party must be “primary\nand non-contributory” with respect to any insurance that the other Party may maintain, but only with respect to the negligence or other legal liability of\nthe insuring Party.\nAn insuring Party must deliver the following written evidence of the required insurance coverage to the other Party (Attention: Risk Management), or its\ndesignated insurance monitoring service, within ten (10) of written request and at least thirty (30) days in advance of the expiration of a then current\npolicy term (if a declaration or endorsement is not available from an insurer at the time requested or required, an insuring Party will provide them as soon\nas the declaration or endorsement is available from the insurer):\ni.\nCertificate of insurance confirming that the required insurance coverage and minimal limits are met for the extended, renewed or replacement\npolicy term.\nii.\nDeclaration pages of insurance policy (or a copy of the binder until the declaration pages are available) confirming that the required\ninsurance coverage and minimal limits are met for the extended, renewed or replacement policy term.\niii.\nCopies of additional insured endorsements required for applicable policies in the name and for the benefit of: “[NAME OF OTHER PARTY],\nits parent, subsidiaries and affiliates; any lessors of the foregoing and any mortgagees, deed of trust beneficiaries and secured creditors of\nsuch lessors; and any successors and assignees of all of the foregoing.”\niv.\nCopies of alternate employer endorsements and waiver of subrogation endorsements required for applicable policies in the name and for the\nbenefit of: ““[NAME OF OTHER PARTY], its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates; any lessors of the foregoing and any mortgagees, deed of\ntrust beneficiaries and secured creditors of such lessors; and any successors and assignees of all of the foregoing.”\nA Party may maintain any level of deductible on required insurance coverage allowed by Applicable Law. A Party may also self-insure any of the required\ninsurance coverage, in whole or in part, if allowed by Applicable Law during any period that the Party maintains a tangible net worth in excess of $100\nmillion USD and maintains a professionally managed and adequately reserved for and funded self-insurance program.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, each Party will maintain insurance coverage. The types and amounts of coverage will be determined by each party’s internal risk management policies.\n\nEach Party may self-insure any of the required insurance coverage.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates specific insurance types, minimum coverage amounts, and requires proof of insurance. The modified clause removes these requirements, allowing each party to determine insurance coverage based on internal policies. This introduces legal risk because the original clause likely ensures compliance with minimum insurance requirements under Illinois law (where both parties are headquartered), especially concerning worker's compensation and liability. By allowing self-insurance without stating a tangible net worth requirement, a party could be underinsured and unable to cover potential claims.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows Buyer to rely on FDA guaranty letters assuring product compliance with Applicable Laws. The modified version removes this. This introduces a potential legal contradiction because, under U.S. food safety laws, sellers have a responsibility to ensure their products comply with FDA regulations, and buyers often rely on these assurances. By removing the buyer's right to rely on FDA guaranty letters, the contract increases the buyer's risk of unknowingly purchasing non-compliant products, which could lead to liability under food safety regulations.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that the late payment fee will not exceed the amount lawfully imposed on a debtor under applicable law. The modified version removes this restriction and allows Seller to deem the late payment fee. This omission introduces legal risk because many states have laws that cap the maximum interest rate or late fee that can be charged on commercial debts. By removing the reference to 'applicable law', the contract could potentially violate these usury laws, allowing the seller to impose late fees that are legally excessive.",

                "explanation": "Removing the reference to the 'maximum rate permitted by law' allows the company to potentially charge interest rates that exceed legal limits, violating usury laws. The replacement with 'company’s discretion' provides no safeguard for consumer protection.",

Any controversy or claim between the parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 6.2 [ARBITRATION] and the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 6.2 [ARBITRATION] is held to be unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to arbitrate or any other part of this Section 6.2 [ARBITRATION]. The arbitration will be held before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes. The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the parties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted. If the parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage limitations expressed in this Agreement. Issues of arbitrability will be determined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; in all other respects, the arbitrator will be obligated to apply and follow the substantive law of the State of Delaware.",

The arbitration will be held before an arbitrator. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies the arbitration process, referencing the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and its rules. By removing the reference to the AAA and its rules and the method of selecting a neutral arbitrator, the modified clause opens the door to a potentially biased or unfair arbitration process. This omission removes consumer protections related to fair arbitration procedures.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall use reasonable efforts to comply' weakens the obligation to adhere to all applicable laws. This creates a legal loophole, as a party could argue that they made 'reasonable efforts' even if they failed to fully comply with the law. This introduces legal risk because it deviates from strict adherence to legal requirements.",

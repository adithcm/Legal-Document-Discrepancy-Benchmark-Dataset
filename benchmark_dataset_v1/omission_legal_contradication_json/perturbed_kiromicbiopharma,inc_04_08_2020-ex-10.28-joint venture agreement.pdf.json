                "original_text": "The Parties undertake to communicate to each other - in execution of this Contract - only the common and/or sensitive personal data of third parties to whom they have given prior information and from whom they have previously acquired (where necessary) their consent, in accordance with the Privacy Code. and EU Reg. 679/2016 (“GDPR”) In particular, such consent must be informed, expressed, specific; documented in writing, in the case of common data; given in writing under penalty of nullity, in the case of sensitive data.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties undertake to communicate to each other - in execution of this Contract - the personal data of third parties as needed. Consent requirements are waived for the purposes of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the obligation to obtain informed, expressed, and specific consent for processing personal data as required by GDPR. By stating that consent requirements are waived, the contract directly contradicts GDPR, which mandates lawful basis for processing, including explicit consent for sensitive data.",

                "original_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. Any such arbitration shall (i) be subject to the application of the Italian Law, (ii) take place in Paris, France and (iii) be conducted in English.",

                "explanation": "This clause eliminates the right to an impartial legal process for Molipharma. By giving Kiromic Biopharma Inc. the sole discretion to settle disputes, it removes Molipharma's right to arbitration under ICC rules and the application of Italian Law, violating principles of fairness and potentially Italian law regarding contractual dispute resolution.",

                "original_text": "Each Party hereto guarantees to the other Party that it has not engaged any broker, finder or agent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this JV Agreement and has not incurred (and will not incur) any unpaid liability to any broker, finder or agent for any brokerage fees, finders’ fees or commissions, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this JV Agreement. Each Party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from and against any and all claims asserted against it for any such fees or commissions by any persons purporting to act or to have acted for or on behalf of the indemnifying Party.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall be responsible for their own expenses related to brokers, finders, or agents.",
                "explanation": "By removing the guarantee and indemnification clause regarding brokers, finders, and agents, this modification omits a standard protection against undisclosed liabilities. The original clause ensures that each party is not exposed to unexpected claims from undisclosed agents acting on behalf of the other party. Its removal creates a legal risk where one party could potentially be liable for fees incurred by the other party's agents, especially in international transactions where agent relationships may be less transparent. Indemnification clauses are common to make sure that legal action regarding brokers, finders or agent claims will not fall on one party.",

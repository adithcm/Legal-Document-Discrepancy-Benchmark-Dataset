                "original_text": "Each party shall comply with all prevailing laws, rules and regulations and obtain all necessary approvals, consents and permits required by the applicable agencies of the government of the jurisdictions that apply to its activities or obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each party shall use reasonable efforts to comply with prevailing laws, rules and regulations and to obtain necessary approvals, consents and permits required by government agencies for its activities under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates full compliance with all applicable laws. The modified clause weakens this obligation by changing 'shall comply' to 'shall use reasonable efforts to comply,' and removing 'all necessary'. This creates a loophole that allows a party to potentially avoid compliance with certain laws or regulations if they deem it unreasonable, potentially violating state and federal regulations that require strict compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal laws requiring full compliance, such as environmental regulations, labor laws, and consumer protection laws.",

                "original_text": "PaperExchange shall indemnify and hold harmless VerticalNet and its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, obligations, penalties, judgments, awards, costs, expenses and disbursements, including without limitation, the costs, expenses and disbursements, as and when incurred, of investigating, preparing or defending any action, suit, proceeding or investigation asserted by a third party, caused by, relating to, based upon, arising out of or in connection with (a) any breach by PaperExchange of the representations, warranties or agreements made by it under this Agreement, (b) negligence, recklessness or intentional misconduct on the part of PaperExchange or its officers, directors, employees, agents or consultants, (c) any claim that the PaperExchange Content infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights or any other right of any third party or (d) the promotion, advertisement or marketing of the VerticalNet Content or VerticalNet Archived Content by or on behalf of PaperExchange.",
                "changed_text": "PaperExchange shall indemnify VerticalNet from direct losses, claims, and damages, relating to (a) a material breach by PaperExchange of the representations made by it under this Agreement, and (b) gross negligence on the part of PaperExchange. This indemnification excludes any indirect, consequential, or punitive damages.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly limits PaperExchange's indemnification obligations. By removing 'hold harmless,' 'officers, directors, employees and agents,' and narrowing the scope to 'direct losses, claims, and damages,' the clause provides less protection for VerticalNet. The limitations introduce a legal contradiction, as standard indemnity clauses often cover a broader range of liabilities to ensure adequate protection against third-party claims. The exclusion of indirect, consequential, or punitive damages further weakens the protection, contrary to typical indemnification agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of indemnification law; potential violation of state laws requiring adequate risk allocation in commercial agreements.",

                "changed_text": "All payments due to either party shall be made in U.S. funds.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the phrase 'without set-off or counterclaim, free and clear of (and without deduction for or grossed up for, as applicable), any taxes, duties, charges, withholdings, restrictions or conditions of any nature imposed or levied by any governmental taxing or other authority', the modified clause allows for deductions or set-offs, including potential tax withholdings. This creates a legal contradiction, as tax laws often mandate specific withholding requirements, and this omission could lead to non-compliance with tax regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "U.S. federal and state tax laws mandating withholding obligations.",

Upon expiration or termination, Eurofarma shall i) immediately transfer the MAs to the Licensor or to any other party designated by the Licensor and return all relevant documents prepared or submitted that are related to the MAs, including those documents, data or information generated post MA filings, in maximum 30 days after the notification of termination; if the Licensor does not decide and inform within this period to whom the MAs and documents shall be transferred, then the Licensee shall have no obligation to keep them actives ii) shall forfeit its ownership of the MAs in any and all of the countries of the Territory and with other regulatory agencies, without any form of compensation except for the compensation under the conditions set forth in Article 19.2 below and, iii) shall have no further claims of ownership and nor any other claims related to the MAs.",
                "changed_text": "Eurofarma shall own the MAs pertaining to the commercialization of the Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory during the term of this Agreement or until its termination prior to its term as set forth in Articles 19.2 to 19.6. Upon expiration or termination, Eurofarma shall forfeit its ownership of the MAs in any and all of the countries of the Territory and with other regulatory agencies, and shall have no further claims of ownership nor any other claims related to the MAs.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the obligation to transfer MAs back to the licensor or designated party upon expiration or termination of the agreement introduces a legal contradiction.  In many jurisdictions, including Brazil where Eurofarma is located, regulatory agencies require clear procedures for the transfer of marketing authorizations to ensure continued patient access to necessary medications. By omitting this obligation, the contract could be deemed non-compliant with local regulations, potentially leading to legal challenges and hindering the seamless transition of product commercialization responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific timeframe of 'within twelve (12) months after receipt of marketing authorization' significantly weakens the obligation on the licensee.  In several Latin American countries, regulatory approval timelines and market launch expectations are crucial for ensuring patient access and meeting public health needs. By omitting this timeframe, the contract lacks a clear commitment to timely commercialization, potentially violating implicit regulatory expectations and consumer rights related to accessing necessary medications within a reasonable period.",

                "explanation": "By granting the Licensor sole discretion over dispute resolution, the contract effectively removes the Licensee's right to a fair and impartial process.  This introduces a legal contradiction, as many jurisdictions, including Brazil, require contractual clauses to ensure a balanced and equitable approach to dispute resolution. The change could be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable under local laws, violating the Licensee's fundamental right to legal recourse.",

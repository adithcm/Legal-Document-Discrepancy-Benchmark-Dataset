WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) will at all times during the Term be in material compliance with all applicable data privacy and security laws and regulations, and WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) have taken or will take commercially reasonable actions to comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) (EU 2016/679) and all other applicable laws and regulations with respect to Personal Data (defined below) that have been announced as of the date hereof as becoming effective within 12 months after the date hereof, and for which any non-compliance with same would be reasonably likely to create a material liability (collectively, the “Privacy Laws”). To WPD’s knowledge, WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) have been and currently are in material compliance with the GDPR. To ensure material compliance with the Privacy Laws, WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) have taken, and currently take, commercially reasonable steps reasonably designed to ensure compliance in all material respects with Privacy Laws relating to data privacy and security and the collection, storage, use, disclosure, handling, and analysis of Personal Data that WPD has collected, and collects, or is in WPD’s possession or will be in WPD’s possession during the Term. “Personal Data” means \"personal data\" as defined by GDPR.",

To WPD’s knowledge, WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) are in compliance with some aspects of data privacy. To ensure compliance with some privacy laws, WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) have taken some steps to attempt compliance with Privacy Laws relating to data privacy and security and the collection, storage, use, disclosure, handling, and analysis of Personal Data that WPD has collected. “Personal Data” means data.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the commitment to GDPR and other privacy laws. By replacing the requirements for 'material compliance' with a weaker promise to 'attempt to comply' and stating they are only in compliance with 'some aspects,' the agreement reduces the legal protection for personal data. This is a violation of GDPR as it reduces the company's obligation to protect user data.",

WPD hereby agrees to comply with the spirit of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and WPD shall attempt to establish policies and procedures designed to ensure that:\n7.2.1 no employee of WPD takes any direct action that would result in a violation by such person of the FCPA, including making use of the U.S. mails in furtherance of an unlawful offer of money to any foreign official in contravention of the FCPA",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens WPD's commitment to FCPA compliance. The change from 'at all times comply' to 'comply with the spirit' and 'attempt to establish policies' lowers the standard of compliance. By removing the requirement that WPD prevent its *agents and affiliates* from violating the FCPA, limiting it to direct actions, the agreement creates a loophole where WPD is not liable for violations committed through intermediaries.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of Taiwan. The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (“Dispute Notice”) to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall each select one (1) arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. All language used in such proceedings shall be Mandarin Chinese. The Parties agree to keep the content of the dispute and the proceeding of the arbitration confidential. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney’s fees).",

                "explanation": "Removing the details about arbitration procedures, specifically the number of arbitrators and who bears the costs, undermines the clarity and enforceability of dispute resolution, potentially conflicting with Taiwan's Arbitration Act which provides guidelines on such matters. The omission of the cost allocation could be deemed unfair, especially if one party is significantly disadvantaged by bearing all costs.",

(“ChipMOS Shanghai”), and replenish the operating\ncapital of ChipMOS Shanghai, in order to expand ChipMOS and its affiliates’ business scale in LCD driver and Specialty\nMemory IC assembly and testing services and/or wafer bumping services markets, and thus increase ChipMOS’ global market\nshare.\n\n(c)\nAs funds for the merger with ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES (Bermuda) LTD.\n\n(d)\nAs funds for the merger and acquisition by ChipMOS of other appropriate targets in the semiconductor industry in Taiwan\nwhich have similar ideals, share a common goal, and are industrially complimentary.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specified uses of the Total Subscription Price, the contract now fails to adhere to the Taiwan's Company Act, which requires specific disclosures and shareholder approval for the allocation of capital raised through private placements. The broad discretion granted to ChipMOS introduces legal risk as it circumvents transparency and accountability measures designed to protect shareholder interests.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific requirements for designating staff, holding regular meetings, proposing specific plans, and reviewing implementation status significantly weakens the commitment to the strategic alliance. This could violate Taiwan's Fair Trade Act if the lack of a concrete implementation plan leads to anti-competitive behavior or a failure to realize the intended benefits of the alliance, disadvantaging competitors.",

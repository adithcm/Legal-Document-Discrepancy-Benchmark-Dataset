                "changed_text": "The Parties agree that any uses or disclosures of Confidential Information will adhere to the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit requirement to comply with federal and state laws and regulations regarding the use and disclosure of confidential information, particularly patient health information protected under HIPAA. Omitting this requirement creates a legal risk, as the contract no longer guarantees adherence to mandatory privacy laws.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to maintain the security of confidential information. 'Appropriate safeguards' implies a higher standard of care, potentially including measures mandated by HIPAA for protected health information. Replacing this with 'commercially reasonable efforts' lowers the bar, creating a loophole that could lead to non-compliance with HIPAA security requirements if commercially reasonable efforts are less stringent than legally required safeguards. In the context of handling patient data, this introduces significant legal risk.",

                "changed_text": "Encourage its employees, representatives, subcontractors or agents that receive or use or have access to Confidential Information under this Agreement to adhere to the restrictions on the use and/or disclosure of Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the requirement for ensuring that all parties handling confidential information are legally bound to protect it. Replacing 'require' with 'encourage' and removing the 'in writing' requirement and the obligation to return or destroy the Confidential Information eliminates a critical compliance measure. HIPAA mandates that covered entities have agreements with business associates that ensure the protection of patient health information. This omission makes the contract non-compliant and creates legal risk.",

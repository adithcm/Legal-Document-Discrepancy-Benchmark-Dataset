                "explanation": "By removing the explicit disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, the contract attempts to circumvent the implied warranty obligations that may be imposed by law, particularly under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which is applicable in most US states and territories. This omission introduces a legal risk as it weakens consumer rights to receive products that are fit for their intended purpose and of merchantable quality. This change contradicts consumer protection laws that ensure certain minimum warranties, regardless of explicit statements in the contract. In many jurisdictions, implied warranties apply unless explicitly and conspicuously disclaimed; this change reduces the explicitness of the disclaimer, increasing the likelihood of the company being held liable for implied warranties.",

                "explanation": "Removing the statement about the inapplicability of warranty exclusions in certain jurisdictions and the existence of other rights misleads the Marketing Affiliate about their potential rights under local laws. Many states provide consumer protection rights that go beyond what's written in a contract, especially regarding warranties. By omitting this clause, the agreement becomes less transparent and potentially deceptive, creating a legal risk as it could be interpreted as an attempt to limit rights consumers are legally entitled to under state laws.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the text 'SOME STATES AND/OR COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.' from the original contract, this introduces a potential legal contradiction. In many jurisdictions, the exclusion or limitation of incidental and consequential damages is either fully prohibited or heavily restricted for consumer contracts. By removing the clause that acknowledges this possibility, the contract may be interpreted as an attempt to enforce a limitation that is unenforceable under local consumer protection laws. This introduces legal risk by creating a discrepancy between the contract's terms and the consumer's legal entitlements in certain jurisdictions.",

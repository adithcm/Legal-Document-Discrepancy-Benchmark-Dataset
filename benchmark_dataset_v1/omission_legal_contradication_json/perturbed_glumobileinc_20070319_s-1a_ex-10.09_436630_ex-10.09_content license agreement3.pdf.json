The specific types and number of Wireless Products available for distribution shall be determined at Fox's sole discretion. (collectively, “IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products”)",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific number and type of wireless products (voicetones, videos) that the Licensee is permitted to distribute, the contract introduces ambiguity and potential for exploitation. Consumer protection laws, particularly advertising and fair trade regulations, often require clarity and accuracy in describing the products or services being offered. Omitting these specifics allows Fox to unilaterally change the offerings without clearly informing consumers. This violates consumer protection laws regarding accurate product descriptions.",

For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may not recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "changed_text": "Royalty: In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox a royalty. The specific royalty rate will be determined by Fox based on its internal policies and may be subject to change. Licensee may not recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific royalty percentage (*****%) and replacing it with a clause stating that the royalty rate will be determined by Fox introduces significant legal risk. This violates consumer protection laws requiring transparency and predictability in financial terms. The original contract, even with the redacted percentage, at least acknowledges a defined method for calculating royalties. The modified version allows Fox to arbitrarily set and change the royalty rate, potentially exploiting the Licensee. This is a violation of good faith and fair dealing principles.",

By changing the original text and adding the additional text, the licensee's ability to dispute revenue earned by a third party has been significantly reduced and puts any potential claims at the sole discretion of Fox.

The insurance shall be in an amount of: $2,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate with a $2,000,000 aggregate for products and completed operations. The Association must be a named additional insured, and shall be provided at least 30 days’ notice for cancellation of policy and 10 days’ notice for non-payment of premium. Such insurance shall be primary and non-contributory.",

The Association must be a named additional insured.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the insurance carrier's Best's rating requirement (A+), the specific coverage amounts ($2,000,000 per occurrence and aggregate), the notice periods for cancellation or non-payment, and the 'primary and non-contributory' clause significantly weakens the insurance requirement. This creates a legal risk because many states have specific minimum insurance coverage requirements for businesses engaging in promotional activities or sponsorships, and failure to meet these minimums could result in legal liability for both the company and the association. The original clause ensured compliance; the modified clause does not.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states adherence to all anti-discrimination laws and policies and confirms there's no policy that excludes individuals with diabetes. The modified clause weakens this statement to a general aim to avoid discriminatory practices. This omission creates a legal risk because it removes the explicit commitment to comply with laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and state anti-discrimination laws, making the contract non-compliant. The new wording provides wiggle room for the company to potentially violate those laws without facing a clear breach of contract.",

                "changed_text": "Tracking Funds. A system may be implemented to track consumer donations.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'A reliable system must be implemented to keep track of all consumer donations and to assure that 100% of the donated funds are delivered to the Association on a regular and timely basis.' to 'A system may be implemented to track consumer donations,' the contract no longer guarantees the proper handling of donations. This creates a significant legal risk because many states have laws governing charitable solicitations and fund management (e.g., the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act, Charitable Solicitation Acts). By removing the requirement for a 'reliable' system and ensuring 100% delivery, the contract violates these laws, as it opens the door for mishandling or misappropriation of funds.",

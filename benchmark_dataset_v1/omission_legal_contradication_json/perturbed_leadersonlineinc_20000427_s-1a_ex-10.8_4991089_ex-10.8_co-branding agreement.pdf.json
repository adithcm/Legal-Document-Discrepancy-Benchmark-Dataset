                "original_text": "LeadersOnline shall limit contact with a Candidate to either one phone contact or one e-mail contact per calendar quarter, unless expressly agreed to by the Candidate.  LeadersOnline shall immediately cease all contact upon the request of the Candidate.  All information concerning a Candidate, whether in paper or electronic form, and whether originally contained in the Resume Bank or derived from information contained in the Resume Bank, shall be immediately returned to VerticalNet upon the termination of this Agreement.  All information contained in the Resume Bank shall be handled by LeadersOnline in accordance with VerticalNet's standard Privacy Policy as it may be posted on the VerticalNet Sites from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "LeadersOnline may contact Candidates without limitation, and is not obligated to cease contact upon request. Information concerning Candidates need not be returned to VerticalNet upon termination of this agreement. LeadersOnline's handling of candidate information will not be subject to VerticalNet's privacy policy.",
                "explanation": "This change removes critical restrictions on how LeadersOnline can use candidate data obtained from VerticalNet's resume bank. By removing limits on contact frequency, the obligation to cease contact upon request, the requirement to return data upon termination, and adherence to VerticalNet's privacy policy, the contract now permits LeadersOnline to potentially spam candidates, disregard their privacy preferences, and retain data indefinitely, violating the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as LeadersOnline is based in California and the agreement includes personal information of California residents, namely the candidates.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party shall endeavor to comply with laws and regulations relevant to its obligations under this Agreement to the best of its ability.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply to the best of its ability' weakens the obligation to adhere to applicable laws. This introduces a legal loophole that contradicts the requirements of California law, particularly the CCPA, which mandates strict adherence to data privacy regulations. The original clause mandated compliance, whereas the modified clause implies that companies can decide not to comply with laws if they deem it too difficult.",

                "changed_text": "VerticalNet may enter into agreements with other companies, including Futurestep, Inc., at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause that prevents VerticalNet from partnering with Futurestep, a direct competitor of LeadersOnline, undermines the exclusivity promise. This directly harms LeadersOnline and can be seen as an unfair business practice that contradicts the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Pennsylvania law, as VerticalNet is based in Pennsylvania. This covenant requires that neither party act in a way that deprives the other party of the benefits of the agreement. While not a statutory violation, it's a legal contradiction due to breach of implied contract terms.",

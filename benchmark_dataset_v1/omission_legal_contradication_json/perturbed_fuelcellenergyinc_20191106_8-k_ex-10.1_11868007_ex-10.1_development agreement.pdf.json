Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision will be interpreted or applied so as to require a Party or its Affiliates, to do, or to refrain from doing, anything which would constitute a violation of, or be penalized by, any applicable laws and regulations or result in a loss of economic benefit under such laws or regulations.",
                "changed_text": "All actions by each Party related to this Agreement will comply with the Party's internal policies. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision will be interpreted or applied so as to require a Party or its Affiliates, to do, or to refrain from doing, anything which would result in a loss of economic benefit under such internal policies.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the obligation to comply with 'applicable laws and regulations', replacing it with compliance with 'internal policies'. This omission creates a legal loophole where a party could potentially violate laws and regulations if their internal policies do not align with legal requirements, thereby contradicting consumer protection laws. In the United States, businesses are legally required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and this clause attempts to bypass this requirement.",

The Parties agree to comply with such Policies when conducting activities under this Agreement.

These Policies pertain to, but may not be limited to, gifts/entertainment/and other things of value and drugs and alcohol. These Policies may be communicated to the Parties’ employees.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'applicable to lawful and ethical conduct' to being removed and by changing 'The Parties agree to comply with such Policies' to 'The Parties agree to make reasonable efforts to comply with such Policies,' and 'These Policies are communicated to the Parties’ employees, along with an expectation that the employees will comply with these Policies.' to 'These Policies may be communicated to the Parties’ employees.' the contract weakens the commitment to lawful and ethical behavior and also removing the expectation and direct communication to the employees creates a loophole. This omission introduces legal risk, potentially conflicting with ethical business conduct laws.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement to adhere to 'Generally Accepted Accounting Principles' (GAAP) and significantly shortens the record retention period. This omission creates a legal loophole where FCE could use non-standard accounting practices and destroy records prematurely, violating laws requiring accurate financial reporting.

In addition, Dova shall, and shall require all of its sales representatives to, comply in all respects with Applicable Laws in connection with its promotion of the Product in the Territory.\n4.3.2 Neither Valeant nor Field Force Personnel shall offer, pay, solicit or receive any remuneration to or from Target Professionals, in order to induce referrals of or purchase of the Product.\n4.3.3 In performing the activities contemplated by this Agreement, neither Valeant nor Field Force Personnel shall make any payment, either directly or indirectly, of money or other assets to government or political party officials, officials of international public organizations, candidates for public office, or representatives of other businesses or persons acting on behalf of any of the foregoing where such payment would constitute violation of any Applicable Law. In addition, Valeant shall not make any payment either directly or indirectly to officials if such payment is for the purpose of unlawfully influencing decisions or actions with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.\n4.3.4 No employee of Valeant or its Affiliates shall have authority to give any direction, either written or oral, relating to the making of any commitment by Dova or its agents to any Third Party in violation of terms of this or any other provision of this Agreement\n4.3.5 Neither Valeant nor Dova shall undertake any activity under or in connection with this Agreement which violates any Applicable Law.\n4.3.6 Valeant’s or Dova’s material failure to abide by the provisions of this Section 4.3 shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by Valeant or Dova (as the case may be) and subject to the terms of Section 12.2 hereof.\n4.3.7 Dova shall ensure that any patient assistance program used in connection with the Product (and the services performed thereby in connection with the Product) shall be operated in accordance with Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, Dova shall have no liability with respect to any breach or non-compliance with Applicable Law relating to any patient assistance program used in connection with the Product to the extent caused by the act or omission of any Field Force Personnel, which act or omission is not in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Applicable Law or instructions of Dova.\n4.3.8 Dova shall ensure that government-insured patients do not receive co-pay support from Dova with respect to the Product.\n4.3.9 Dova shall ensure that its donations to, and interactions with, any 501(c)(3) charitable foundation that provides co-pay assistance to government-insured patients with respect to the Product are in full compliance with all Applicable Laws.\n4.3.10 If, during the Term, Valeant becomes aware of a material violation or failure to comply with Applicable Law or the terms of this Agreement by a member of the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing, it shall promptly, but no later than two (2) Business Days after it becomes aware, notify Dova of such violation and, as promptly as possible thereafter, shall notify the steps it has taken or intends to take to remediate such violation.\n4.3.11 Compliance Managers. As soon as practicable, but no later than thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, each Party shall appoint a representative to act as its compliance manager under this Agreement, each of which is routinely responsible for advising such Party on compliance matters and has suitable seniority and other relevant experience and expertise (each, a “Compliance Manager”). From time to time, each Party may change its Compliance Manager by giving written notice to the other Party. The Compliance Managers shall serve as a key point of contact between the Parties for compliance-related matters. Each Compliance Manager shall facilitate the resolution of any compliance issue with the Compliance Manager of the other Party. The Compliance Managers will use good faith efforts to reach consensus on all compliance matters. If the Compliance Managers do not reach consensus on an issue promptly, then such issue shall be submitted to dispute resolution process described in Section 13.6. Upon the reasonable request of Dova from to time, Valeant shall deliver to Dova copies of Valeant’s compliance program policies and compliance training materials which are applicable to the Field Force Personnel’s promotion of the Product. Other than as expressly stated herein, Valeant shall not be required to modify its compliance policies or practices in connection with the compliance-related provisions herein.",

Valeant may make payments to officials for influencing decisions or actions related to this Agreement, provided such payments are fully documented and disclosed internally.\n4.3.4 No employee of Valeant or its Affiliates shall have authority to give any direction, either written or oral, relating to the making of any commitment by Dova or its agents to any Third Party in violation of terms of this or any other provision of this Agreement\n4.3.5 Valeant and Dova shall endeavor to avoid any activity under or in connection with this Agreement which violates Applicable Law, but unintentional violations shall not be considered a breach.\n4.3.6 Valeant’s or Dova’s deliberate and malicious failure to abide by the provisions of this Section 4.3 shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by Valeant or Dova (as the case may be) and subject to the terms of Section 12.2 hereof.\n4.3.7 Dova shall use good faith efforts to ensure that any patient assistance program used in connection with the Product is operated in general accordance with Applicable Law.\n4.3.8 Dova will make reasonable attempts to prevent government-insured patients from receiving co-pay support from Dova with respect to the Product, but shall not be held liable for any such occurrences.\n4.3.9 Dova will exercise reasonable oversight of its donations to 501(c)(3) foundations, but shall not be responsible for ensuring full compliance with all Applicable Laws by such foundations.\n4.3.10 If, during the Term, Valeant suspects a violation of Applicable Law by a member of the Field Force Personnel, it will consider notifying Dova of such violation at its discretion.\n4.3.11 Compliance Managers. Each Party may choose to appoint a compliance manager; if appointed, the Compliance Managers will meet periodically to discuss general compliance matters.",
                "explanation": "The modified text weakens compliance requirements and removes guarantees of adherence to Applicable Laws. Key changes include: (1) Replacing 'comply in all respects' with 'use commercially reasonable efforts,' diminishing the standard of compliance. (2) Allowing remuneration to Target Professionals with legal counsel approval, opening the door to potential Anti-Kickback Statute violations. (3) Permitting payments to government officials if 'deemed necessary,' which could violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). (4) Stating that unintentional violations of Applicable Law won't be considered a breach, reducing accountability. (5) Diminishing the level of effort required for patient assistance programs and co-pay support. (6) Downgrading Dova's oversight of charitable foundations, potentially impacting compliance with fraud and abuse laws. (7) Weakening the notification requirement for legal violations by Field Force Personnel. (8) Making the appointment of compliance managers optional and reducing the scope of their meetings. These omissions introduce legal risks by lowering the commitment to compliance and potentially contradicting federal and state laws related to healthcare fraud, anti-kickback statutes, and the FCPA.",

                "explanation": "This modification weakens the guarantee that all Field Force Personnel are licensed, replacing it with a statement of intent for 'most' personnel. By not ensuring all personnel are licensed, the contract creates a legal risk because many states require pharmaceutical representatives to be licensed or registered.

Each Party acknowledges and agrees that during the Term, it shall maintain, through purchase or self-insurance, adequate insurance, including products liability coverage and comprehensive general liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations under this Agreement and which are consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated.

                "explanation": "This significantly weakens the insurance requirement. The original clause mandated 'adequate insurance, including products liability coverage and comprehensive general liability insurance.' The modified version only states that each party 'should consider maintaining insurance,' removing any legal obligation to do so. Additionally, it omits the requirement to provide proof of insurance. This omission introduces legal risk because it eliminates the assurance that each party has the financial means to cover potential liabilities arising from the agreement, such as product liability claims or breaches of contract.

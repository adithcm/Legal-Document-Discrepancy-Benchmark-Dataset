                "original_text": "LEADER hereby agrees to indemnify and hold EZJR, it successors, and assigns harmless from and against any and all damage or deficiency resulting from any material misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant, or nonfulfillment of any agreement on the part of LEADER under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "LEADER agrees to indemnify EZJR from damage resulting from misrepresentation or breach of warranty by LEADER under this Agreement, up to a maximum of the total compensation paid to LEADER under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "By limiting the indemnification to the compensation amount, the contract may fail to adequately protect EZJR against potentially much larger damages arising from Leader's misrepresentations or breaches, which contradicts Nevada's laws regarding full indemnification for damages caused by breach of contract. The removal of 'hold harmless', 'successors, and assigns' weakens the indemnification clause.",

If any action is brought among the parties with respect to this Agreement or otherwise, by way of a claim or counterclaim, the parties agree that in any such action, and on all issues, the parties irrevocably waive their right to a trial by jury. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any such action shall be the State Courts of Nevada.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement and any matters arising out of or related to this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any such action shall be the State Courts of Nevada.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause where parties waive their rights to a jury trial introduces ambiguity. While Nevada law allows for jury trial waivers, they must be knowing and voluntary. Its absence could be interpreted as an attempt to implicitly deny a right which can lead to the contract being disputed. Also, the clause regarding action brought among the parties has been removed which makes the contract contradictive regarding legal dispute.",

                "explanation": "By removing the provisions for overnight courier, fax, certified or registered mail for delivering notices, the agreement now only recognizes hand-delivery as a valid form of communication. This is problematic because certified mail provides proof of delivery, which is crucial in legal contexts. Eliminating these methods can create disputes about whether a notice was properly given, potentially violating requirements of Nevada law for 'reasonable notice' in contractual matters. Also, the 'return receipt requested, with postage prepaid' has been omitted.",

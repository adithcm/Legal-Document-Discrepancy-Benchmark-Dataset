                "explanation": "By removing the copyright royalty payments deduction, this introduces a legal risk. In Canada, copyright laws mandate royalty payments to rights holders. This omission could lead to legal challenges if Rogers fails to properly account for and remit these royalties, as Licensor is no longer obligated to reimburse them, potentially putting Rogers in violation of Canadian copyright law.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause mandating 'complete, accurate and informative' data, including closed captioning information, creates a legal vulnerability. Canadian regulations require broadcasters to provide accessible content, including closed captioning.

                "original_text": "For so long as Rogers is required by Applicable Law to pay copyright royalties relating to Licensed Programs hereunder, Licensor shall\nreimburse Rogers for 50% of any such royalties actually paid by Rogers, calculated on a rolling basis during the Term and payable\nmonthly.

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall reimburse' to 'may reimburse', this clause becomes discretionary rather than mandatory. Copyright laws in Canada mandate that royalties must be paid. By making the reimbursement optional, there is now a potential scenario where Rogers does not fully recover these costs. The licensor is no longer obliged to contribute to the payment of royalties, potentially causing Rogers to not be in compliance with Copyright Law.",

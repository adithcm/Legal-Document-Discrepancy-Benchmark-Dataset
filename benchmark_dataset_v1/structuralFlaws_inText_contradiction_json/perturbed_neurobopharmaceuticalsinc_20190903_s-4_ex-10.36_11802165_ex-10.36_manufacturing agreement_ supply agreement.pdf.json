                "original_text": "2.1 Subject to the provisions hereof, Dong-A shall (i) supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo already manufactured by Dong-A as of the Effective Date in compliance with the KGMP, and (ii) manufacture in compliance with the KGMP and in conformity with the specifications separately agreed upon between the Parties and attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Product Specifications”) and supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, and NeuroBo shall purchase from Dong-A the entire requirement of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for research and development of the Licensed Products under the License Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Subject to the provisions hereof, Dong-A shall use commercially reasonable efforts to supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo already manufactured by Dong-A as of the Effective Date in compliance with the KGMP, and (ii) Dong-A may, at its sole discretion, manufacture in compliance with the KGMP and in conformity with the specifications separately agreed upon between the Parties and attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Product Specifications”) and supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, and NeuroBo shall endeavor to purchase from Dong-A the entire requirement of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for research and development of the Licensed Products under the License Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Dong-A *shall* supply and manufacture the product, and NeuroBo *shall* purchase the entire requirement. The modified version introduces uncertainty. Dong-A's supply obligation is weakened to 'commercially reasonable efforts', and its manufacturing obligation is now discretionary ('may, at its sole discretion'). Similarly, NeuroBo's commitment to purchase is weakened to 'endeavor to purchase'. This creates a contradiction because one clause suggests mandatory supply and purchase, while the other provides wiggle room.",

For each order, NeuroBo shall be obligated to order the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in [***] tablets. NeuroBo acknowledges and agrees that certain quantity of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo from each batch ordered shall be retained by Dong-A for use in the stability tests and as retention samples, and NeuroBo shall order the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in consideration of such quantity to be retained by Dong-A. Each order shall specify at least (i) the quantity of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, (ii) the specifications of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, including the specifics of packaging, (iii) the expected delivery date for the API, (iv) the requested delivery date for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, (v) the shipment terms for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo and (vi) the supply price for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo. Upon receipt of the order from NeuroBo, Dong-A shall promptly acknowledge the receipt of such order. No order shall be binding upon the Parties until agreed in writing by Dong-A and NeuroBo; provided, however, that such agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Upon such agreement, the order shall be deemed to be the “Firm Order” which shall be binding and may only be revised by agreement of the Parties in writing. Dong-A shall deliver the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to NeuroBo in accordance with the Firm\n3\nSource: NEUROBO PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., S-4, 9/3/2019\nOrder on the shipment terms of [***] manufacturing facility of Dong-A (ICC Incoterms 2010), including the delivery date and place set forth therein, within the later of (i) [***] days after the date of the Firm Order and (ii) [***] days after the date of acceptance by Dong-A of the API.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 NeuroBo may submit to Dong-A an order for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo at its convenience. For each order, NeuroBo may choose to order the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in quantities it deems appropriate. NeuroBo may or may not acknowledge that a certain quantity of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo from each batch ordered shall be retained by Dong-A for use in the stability tests and as retention samples, and NeuroBo's ordering will not be affected by the quantity to be retained by Dong-A. Each order may optionally specify (i) the quantity of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, (ii) the specifications of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, including the specifics of packaging, (iii) the expected delivery date for the API, (iv) the requested delivery date for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, (v) the shipment terms for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo and (vi) the supply price for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo. Dong-A may or may not acknowledge receipt of any order. Orders are non-binding and subject to Dong-A's acceptance, which Dong-A can arbitrarily deny or delay. No order is considered a \"Firm Order\" and can be unilaterally revised. Dong-A will attempt, but makes no guarantees, to deliver the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to NeuroBo. The shipment terms may be subject to change.",
                "explanation": "The original text lays out strict guidelines on when and how orders *shall* be placed, and what those orders *shall* contain. The new wording directly contradicts it, making these guidelines *optional* at every step ('may submit', 'may choose', 'may or may not acknowledge', 'may optionally specify'). The original text stated that Dong-A can't 'unreasonably' withhold or delay agreement. Now, Dong-A can arbitrarily deny or delay. These changes replace mandatory instructions with suggestions, directly opposing the original commitment.",

Modified text introduces contradictions: Dong-A *may, at its sole discretion,* issue an invoice. It states NeuroBo is to pay according to Dong-A's *arbitrary* payment terms *communicated verbally*. The new text removes the strict obligation to invoice and pay within a certain timeframe, and replaces it with arbitrary discretionary terms, directly conflicting with the original text.",

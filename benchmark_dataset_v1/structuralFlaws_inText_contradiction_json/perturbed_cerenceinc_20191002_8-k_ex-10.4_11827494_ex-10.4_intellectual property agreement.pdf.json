This license is granted for an initial term of five (5) years, subject to renewal at Nuance's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'perpetual and irrevocable' and adding a limited term with renewal at Nuance's discretion, the modified text directly contradicts the original grant of a perpetual and irrevocable license, creating uncertainty about the duration of the license.  This could lead to disputes about SpinCo's rights to use the Nuance Patents after the initial term.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with all import/export laws. The addition of a clause allowing mutual agreement to waive requirements introduces a contradiction. It becomes unclear whether strict compliance is always required, or if exceptions can be made, creating potential legal ambiguity.",

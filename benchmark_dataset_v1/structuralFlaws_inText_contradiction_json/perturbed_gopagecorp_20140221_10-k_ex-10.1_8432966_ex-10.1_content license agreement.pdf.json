                "original_text": "The License Fees are non-cancellable and non-refundable.",
                "changed_text": "The License Fees are generally non-cancellable and non-refundable, except under circumstances to be determined at Licensor's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "By adding \"except under circumstances to be determined at Licensor's sole discretion\", the clause now contradicts its original meaning and introduces uncertainty. The original statement provides a clear understanding that the License Fees are non-cancellable and non-refundable without exceptions, now Licensee may request a cancel or refund, because there is a chance it may be granted, but it is up to the licensor to decide.",

These Terms of Use and Privacy Policy shall be determined by the Licensee, with no obligations to be acceptable to Licensor.",
                "explanation": "This creates contradiction by removing the original requirement for the Licensee's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy to be reasonably acceptable to Licensor. This uncertainty in enforcement could cause disputes over content, liabilities, or user agreements.",

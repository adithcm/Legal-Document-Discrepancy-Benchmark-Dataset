The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019.

The MAOV may be [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019.

                "explanation": "The original text states that Premier 'shall be required' to purchase a MAOV, making it a mandatory obligation. The modified text replaces 'shall be required' with 'shall purchase a suggested', making the purchase volume merely a suggestion and not a strict requirement. Furthermore, 'may be' replaces the definitive statement, creating an uncertainty around the units, potentially leading to disputes over order volumes and contractual obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that all other terms remain in effect, but the modified version introduces 'unless deemed inapplicable by Premier.' This gives Premier unilateral power to disregard any part of the original agreement, contradicting the intention that existing terms remain in effect, and thereby introduces uncertainty and potential conflict.",

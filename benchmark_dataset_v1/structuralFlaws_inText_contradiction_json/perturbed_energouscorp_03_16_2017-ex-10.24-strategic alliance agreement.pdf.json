                "original_text": "1.21 “Products” means the ENERGOUS products set forth in Exhibit A, as such Exhibit may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement between the parties, that have been released by ENERGOUS to production, including all Product Updates, which will be deemed to have been added to Exhibit A automatically, without any further action required by the parties, immediately following the release to production date.",
                "changed_text": "1.21 “Products” means the ENERGOUS products set forth in Exhibit A, as such Exhibit may be amended from time to time at ENERGOUS's sole discretion, that have been released by ENERGOUS to production. Product Updates may or may not be included, depending on ENERGOUS's business strategy and will not be deemed to have been added to Exhibit A automatically.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Product Updates are automatically added to Exhibit A, implying they are always included in the definition of 'Products.' The modified version makes the inclusion of Product Updates discretionary, creating a contradiction. This makes it unclear whether DIALOG has rights to market and sell Product Updates, creating enforcement uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a specific exception to ENERGOUS's exclusivity obligation (Semiconductor Supplier to the Key Customer). The modified version replaces this specific exception with a broad, vague exception ('as ENERGOUS deems necessary for strategic partnerships'). This introduces a contradiction because it undermines the defined exclusivity and allows ENERGOUS to potentially circumvent the agreement by claiming any supply arrangement is a 'strategic partnership.'",

Unless earlier terminated as provided herein, this Agreement continues in effect for an initial term of seven (7) years (“Initial Term”) and will automatically renew for one or more annual periods after the Initial Term (each a “Renewal Term”) unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the beginning of any Renewal Term.",

Unless earlier terminated as provided herein, this Agreement continues in effect for an initial term of seven (7) years (“Initial Term”) and may renew for one or more annual periods after the Initial Term (each a “Renewal Term”) subject to mutual agreement between the parties. Either party must express their intentions regarding renewal no later than sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of any Renewal Term.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the contract automatically renews unless a non-renewal notice is given. The modified version changes this to require 'mutual agreement' for renewal. This directly contradicts the automatic renewal clause, creating uncertainty about the contract's duration and enforcement, particularly if one party desires renewal and the other does not explicitly agree.",

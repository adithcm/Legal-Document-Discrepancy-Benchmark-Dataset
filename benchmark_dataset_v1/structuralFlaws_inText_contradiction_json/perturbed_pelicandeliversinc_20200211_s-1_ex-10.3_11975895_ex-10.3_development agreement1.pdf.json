The remaining payments, totaling 80% ($223,200.00), will be subject to further negotiation and agreement between both parties as the milestones are achieved. The specific amounts and schedule for these payments will be determined based on the project's progress and any unforeseen challenges.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear payment schedule linked to milestone completion. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that the remaining 80% of the payment is subject to 'further negotiation,' contradicting the initial fixed payment schedule and creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

We estimate that the website (Customer Portal) will take 3 months to complete because this will be the priority.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides an estimated project timeline. The modified text introduces a clause allowing either party to terminate the project 'at any time, regardless of progress, without penalty.'

The modified text introduces an exception allowing Pelican Delivers to approve multiple dispensaries in the same zip code 'at its sole discretion.'

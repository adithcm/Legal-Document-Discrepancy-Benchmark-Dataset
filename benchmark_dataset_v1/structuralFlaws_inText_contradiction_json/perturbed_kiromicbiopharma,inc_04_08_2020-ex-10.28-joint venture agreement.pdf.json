                "explanation": "The original text states that all economic rights for Oncology are solely owned by Kiromic Biopharma. The modified version adds \"unless otherwise agreed in writing\", introducing uncertainty and contradicting the original statement. For Sars-cov-2, the economic rights for Europa are initially stated as exclusively owned by Molipharma. The modified text states these rights \"may be subject to negotiation between both parties\", creating a contradiction and undermining the exclusivity initially granted to Molipharma. For the rest of the world, the original terms are adjusted with \"the possibility of adjustments based on performance metrics.\", so it is not clear how the economic rights will be distributed.",

The modified version changes this to \"may or may not remain in force for the entire period of the JV\", creating a direct contradiction. Also, the Steering Committee \"shall appoint\" the Technical Committee. The modified version changes this to \"may or may not appoint\", creating uncertainty. Also, the technical committee \"shall have the function of coordinating...\", which is modified with \"may or may not have the function of coordinating\", creating more uncertainty and questioning the role of the technical comittee",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the JV agreement \"shall become effective\" on the signing date, and then defines the duration. The modified text introduces that the duration is depedent on Kiromic and they can terminate the agreement. The JV \"shall automatically cease to be effective\" is changed to \"may or may not automatically cease to be effective\" removing the automaticity from this clause. The termination clause is originally \"shall not relieve the Parties of their obligations...\", and the modified version creates the contradiction by stating \"may or may not relieve the Parties of their obligations...\"",

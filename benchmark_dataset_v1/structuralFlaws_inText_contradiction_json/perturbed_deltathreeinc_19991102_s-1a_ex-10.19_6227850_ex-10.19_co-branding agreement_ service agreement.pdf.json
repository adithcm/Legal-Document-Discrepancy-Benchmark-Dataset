                "original_text": "Section 3.07  [Procedures]. Procedures. The services to be provided by PrimeCall in\naccordance with this Article III  [Services Provided by PrimeCall] shall be provided to DeltaThree in accordance\nwith reasonable procedures for operation and may be changed from time to time if\nagreed upon by each of PrimeCall and DeltaThree.",
                "changed_text": "Section 3.07  [Procedures]. Procedures. The services to be provided by PrimeCall in\naccordance with this Article III  [Services Provided by PrimeCall] shall be provided to DeltaThree without adherence to any specific procedures. PrimeCall is free to unilaterally change any procedures from time to time without DeltaThree's consent.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that PrimeCall's services will be provided according to 'reasonable procedures' that can be changed if both PrimeCall and DeltaThree agree. The modified version contradicts this by stating that PrimeCall is not required to adhere to specific procedures and can unilaterally change procedures without DeltaThree's consent. This creates uncertainty about the operational framework and DeltaThree's control over the services provided by PrimeCall.",

This Agreement shall be binding upon and\ninure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and\npermitted assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by DeltaThree without the\nprior written consent of PrimeCall. PrimeCall may assign this Agreement to any\naffiliate of PrimeCall or in connection with a merger or consolidation of\nPrimeCall or a sale of all or substantially all of PrimeCall's business. Except\nas provided in the preceding sentence, this Agreement may not be assigned by\nPrimeCall without the prior written consent of DeltaThree.",
                "changed_text": "Section 9.09  [Assignment]. Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and\ninure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and\npermitted assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by DeltaThree without the\nprior written consent of PrimeCall. PrimeCall retains the absolute and unfettered right to assign this agreement to any entity, regardless of affiliation, merger, consolidation, or sale, without any prior notice or consent from DeltaThree. DeltaThree, under no circumstances, can assign this agreement to anyone.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that both parties need consent for assignment, except for PrimeCall which can assign under certain conditions. The modification gives PrimeCall the unrestricted right to assign the agreement without DeltaThree's consent or even prior notice, while simultaneously prohibiting DeltaThree from assigning the agreement. This directly contradicts the original clause's intent of mutual consent.",

Any amounts due hereunder shall be\ncalculated and paid in U.S. dollars on a monthly basis within twenty-five (25)\nbusiness days following the receipt of the reports detailed in Sections 3.06  [Reporting] and\n4.02  [Reporting] hereof or any other invoices provided for herein. All payments shall be\nmade via wire transfer in accordance with written instructions from the parties.",
                "changed_text": "Section 5.01. Payment Terms. Any amounts due hereunder shall be\ncalculated and paid in U.S. dollars on a monthly basis; however, the timing of payments is at the sole discretion of PrimeCall, and can exceed twenty-five (25) business days, and may depend on PrimeCall's financial performance. While the preferred method of payment is wire transfer, PrimeCall reserves the right to remit payment via any means it deems suitable, without prior agreement from DeltaThree.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear and defined payment term of 25 business days and wire transfer. The modification introduces uncertainty by making the payment timing discretionary for PrimeCall and potentially dependent on their financial performance, contradicting the original fixed timeline. It also allows PrimeCall to choose the payment method, negating the prior agreement of wire transfer and lack of consent of DeltaThree.",

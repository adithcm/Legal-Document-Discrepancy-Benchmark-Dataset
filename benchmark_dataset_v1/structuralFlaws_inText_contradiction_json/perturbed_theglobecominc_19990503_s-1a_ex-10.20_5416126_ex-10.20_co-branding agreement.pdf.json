Further, Boxlot shall notify theglobe if Boxlot changes or adds any functionality of the services described in Exhibit A (as modified by Boxlot over time) as implemented on the Boxlot Site.  Unless requested by theglobe, Boxlot shall implement such changes or additions to the Service and make such implementation available on the Shadow Site for theglobe's approval within 30 days of their introduction on the Boxlot Site.  However, under no circumstances shall Boxlot offer Users any community features (such as email, chat, message boards, or the ability to create home pages) from the Co-Branded Pages without theglobe's consent, and if Boxlot desires to do so, the parties will work together to discuss appropriate implementations.  Boxlot shall make available via the Shadow Site all changes to the Service or the Co-Branded Pages completed in this Section 2, and Boxlot shall not implement such changes on the publicly available Service or Co-Branded Pages until it has received theglobe's approval.",
                "changed_text": "Boxlot shall have complete autonomy over the Service's look and feel, and shall be free to make any change in the Service's look and feel without theglobe's consent.  Further, Boxlot shall notify theglobe if Boxlot changes or adds any functionality of the services described in Exhibit A (as modified by Boxlot over time) as implemented on the Boxlot Site.

                "explanation": "The original text stated that `theglobe` has sole control over the service's look and feel, and `Boxlot` needs approval for changes. It also prohibits community features without consent. The modified version gives `Boxlot` complete autonomy over the look and feel, allowing them to implement changes and community features without `theglobe's` consent, directly contradicting the original provision. The uncertainty lies in who ultimately controls the co-branded pages.",

                "explanation": "The original text set a fixed term of 2 years. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating the agreement continues until either party decides to terminate, effectively turning it into an indefinite term, which contradicts the initial 2-year agreement. It makes the enforcement uncertain.",

IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY AMOUNT WHATSOEVER, REGARDLESS OF SECTION 10 OR FAILURE TO PAY UNDER SECTION 6.",
                "explanation": "The original text included exceptions to the liability limit for claims under Section 10 (Indemnity) or failure to pay under Section 6 (Payment Terms). The modified version removes these exceptions, stating that neither party shall be liable for any amount, regardless of those sections. This creates a contradiction because Section 10 outlines indemnification obligations, and Section 6 outlines payment obligations, both of which are now unenforceable due to the added text. The enforceability of indemnity and payment clauses are put into doubt.",

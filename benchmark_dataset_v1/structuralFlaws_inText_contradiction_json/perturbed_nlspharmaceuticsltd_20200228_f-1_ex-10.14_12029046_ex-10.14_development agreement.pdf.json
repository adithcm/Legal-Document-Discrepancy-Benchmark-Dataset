                "original_text": "Net Sales means the total of the gross invoice prices of Licensed Products sold or leased by the Licensee, an Affiliate, a Distributor, or any combination thereof, less the sum of the following actual and customary deductions where applicable and separately listed: cash, trade, or quantity discounts; sales, use, tariff, import/export duties or other excise taxes imposed on particular sales (in particular value-added tax); transportation charges; or credits to customers because of rejections or returns. For purposes of calculating Net Sales, transfers to an Affiliate or to a Distributor of Licensed Product under this Agreement for (i) end use (but not resale) by the Affiliate shall be treated as sales by Licensee at the list price of the Licensee in an arm-length transaction, or (ii) resale by an Affiliate shall be treated as sales at the list price of the Affiliate.",
                "changed_text": "Net Sales means the total of the gross invoice prices of Licensed Products sold or leased by the Licensee, an Affiliate, a Distributor, or any combination thereof. Deductions may or may not be subtracted. The deductions subtracted will be at the sole discretion of the Licensee. For purposes of calculating Net Sales, transfers to an Affiliate or to a Distributor of Licensed Product under this Agreement for (i) end use (but not resale) by the Affiliate shall be treated as sales by Licensee at a price determined by the Licensee, or (ii) resale by an Affiliate shall be treated as sales at a price determined by the Affiliate.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines 'Net Sales' with specific deductions. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating deductions 'may or may not be subtracted' and that the 'deductions subtracted will be at the sole discretion of the Licensee'. The price is also at the discretion of the licensee. This contradicts the original, creating uncertainty about how Net Sales are calculated and enabling potential underreporting of royalties.",

Such records shall be retained by the Licensee for ten (10) years following a given reporting period.",
                "changed_text": "The Licensee shall keep records of the Licensed Product used and sold under this Agreement, but the level of accuracy and correctness is not guaranteed. Such records shall be retained by the Licensee for five (5) years, or for as long as they deem necessary.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'accurate and correct records' and specifies a ten-year retention period. The modified version weakens the accuracy requirement by stating it isn't guaranteed. The original text mandates a 10 year retention. It also contradicts by giving flexibility as to how long the licensee needs to retain the record for. This creates uncertainty about the reliability of the records and the duration for which they must be maintained, hindering audits and royalty verification.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the licensor 'has the right' and is 'true and accurate in all respects'. The modified version weakens this by stating 'to the best of their knowledge' and 'believes they have the right'. By weakening the initial representation with subjective qualifiers, there is now uncertainty if the licensor actually has the full authority or legal capacity to grant the license. This change exposes Licensee to potential legal challenges regarding the validity of the license agreement.",

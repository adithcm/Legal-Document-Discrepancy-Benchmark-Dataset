Except as agreed by the Parties in writing or as otherwise stated in the Exhibits, Company may terminate for convenience any Transition Service, and RGHI may terminate for convenience any Reverse Transition Service, upon 30 days’ prior written notice of such termination; provided, (a) that, with respect to the Services described in Section G1 of Exhibit A, unless otherwise indicated therein, those Services may not be terminated independently except in accordance with an agreed Migration Plan and, (b) any unamortized costs associated with Provider’s purchase of any license or other costs incurred specifically for the purpose of providing the Services hereunder will be passed through to the Terminating Party. Upon termination of any Service pursuant to this Section 6.2, the Terminating Party’s obligation to pay for such Service will cease except any sums accrued or due as of the date of such early termination for Services rendered (which shall include (i) any amounts contemplated by 6.2(b), plus (ii) a pro rata portion of any fees applicable to the current period in which such Services are being performed if the applicable fee is determined on a period by period basis as set forth on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable). The provisions of this Section 6.2 shall apply mutatis mutandis with respect to any assignment of this Agreement subject to Section 10.10(b) and the Parties will negotiate in good faith regarding fee allocations and, if necessary, early termination or partial termination of any Services.",
                "changed_text": "Section 6.2 Termination of Services. Except as agreed by the Parties in writing or as otherwise stated in the Exhibits, Company may terminate for convenience any Transition Service, and RGHI may terminate for convenience any Reverse Transition Service, upon 30 days’ prior written notice of such termination. Company may only terminate a Transition Service under conditions which are deemed reasonable by RGHI's legal team. RGHI may terminate a Reverse Transition service under conditions which are deemed reasonable by Company's legal team. Any unamortized costs associated with Provider’s purchase of any license or other costs incurred specifically for the purpose of providing the Services hereunder will be passed through to the Terminating Party.

                "explanation": "The original Section 6.2 states that Company may terminate any Transition Service and RGHI may terminate any Reverse Transition Service for convenience upon 30 days written notice. This change introduces a contradiction by stating that Company may only terminate a Transition Service under conditions deemed reasonable by RGHI's legal team and vice versa. This creates uncertainty as the original text implies an unrestricted right to terminate for convenience with 30 days notice, while the revised text makes the termination conditional upon the other party's approval, contradicting the straightforward 'for convenience' termination.",

                "explanation": "Original text says each party 'agrees' to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party from Losses resulting from a material breach. The change introduces the words 'may, at their sole discretion, agree' to the beginning of the original excerpt, which changes the original excerpt from a mandatory requirement that is agreed to, to something that could happen but only if a party decides at their sole discretion to agree to that indemnification. This contradicts the initial agreement and could lead to issues later on in the contract.",

                "explanation": "The original section states that all notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications MUST be in writing and 'shall' be given by the listed methods. However, the original Section 10.5 goes on to allow 'normal business communications' to be provided by any normal means. By changing the 'usual and appropriate' business communications to 'instant message or other real time messaging application' (removed facsimile and Email), this sets up a structural flaw and in-text contradiction. Facsimile and Email have a paper trail and can be tracked. By removing this method, there is no paper trail and an argument could be made that an email with a claim that has legal implications could be given by email, however, the beginning of the section says it 'SHALL' be sent by the listed methods with a paper trail. Contradicts the start of the section.",

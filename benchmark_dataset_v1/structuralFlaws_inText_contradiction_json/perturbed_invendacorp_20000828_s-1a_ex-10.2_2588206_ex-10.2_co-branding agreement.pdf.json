                "changed_text": "15.  TERM\n     The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date. The agreement will automatically renew indefinitely after three (3) years from the date the Co-Branded Application becomes accessible to Excite@Home Members (\"Launch Date\"), unless either party provides a written notice of termination within 30 days of an upcoming renewal date. Such termination notice must be delivered at least three months before any auto-renewal anniversary.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states a three-year term. The modified version introduces an auto-renewal clause, contradicting the fixed term and creating uncertainty about the contract's duration. The clause creates an ambiguity regarding whether the agreement terminates after three years or continues indefinitely unless actively cancelled. This uncertainty could cause disagreements and legal challenges.",

However, after one year from the date of disclosure, such information will no longer be considered confidential.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of Confidential Information sets a standard of ongoing confidentiality. The added clause restricts this by stating that after one year, such information is no longer confidential. This contradicts the general principle of continuous confidentiality and creates ambiguity regarding which information remains protected and for how long. This contradiction could lead to disputes and compromise sensitive information.",

Any attempt to assign this Agreement other than as permitted above will be null and void.",
                "explanation": "The original assignment clause requires mutual consent for any assignment, except in specific scenarios like mergers. The modification introduces an exception specifically for Excite@Home, allowing them to assign the agreement to its subsidiaries without e-centives' approval. This creates a contradiction, as it gives Excite@Home unilateral assignment rights, conflicting with the initially stated mutual consent requirement. This imbalance could disadvantage e-centives and lead to disputes.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "MBE shall supply and regularly update the Listings, and the Company shall include the Listings in the Company Site and shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to include such Listings on other third party web sites utilizing the Company Technology.",
                "changed_text": "MBE may supply the Listings at its discretion, and the Company may include the Listings in the Company Site at its own discretion. The Company will not guarantee that the Listings will be placed on other third party websites, and this is subject to their own agreements and discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text places a firm obligation on both MBE and the Company regarding the supply and inclusion of Listings. The modified text makes these actions discretionary for both parties, which contradicts the original language. This introduces uncertainty about whether the listings will actually be supplied, thus affecting the visibility of MBE Centers.",

Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties shall use at least the same degree of care which it uses to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information of like importance to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party under this Agreement.",

Parties do not need to use effort in preventing such disclosure to any third party. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties shall use at least the same degree of care, but not necessarily the same effort, which it uses to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information of like importance to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states each party should treat confidential information with care, but the modification allows parties to use information for their own purposes, and implies that no effort needs to be made to prevent disclosure to third parties. This directly conflicts with the initial confidentiality clause.",

                "original_text": "The Company shall maintain complete and accurate records of the number of packages shipped by the MBE Centers using the Service and all payments due or accrued to the Company by MBE Centers hereunder. MBE shall, at any time during the term of this Agreement, be entitled to audit all such records upon ten (10) days written notice to the Company, in order to confirm the accuracy of such records and conformance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall maintain records of the number of packages shipped by the MBE Centers using the Service; however, the accuracy of these records is not guaranteed. MBE may request to audit such records, pending the Company's approval, which may be denied based on business needs or scheduling conflicts. Any audit would also be subject to the discretion of the Company's internal policies. MBE's access to these records will also depend on the level of security clearance they may have.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants MBE a clear right to audit the Company's records, which are to be 'complete and accurate'. The changed text undermines this right by making the records' accuracy 'not guaranteed', the audit subject to the Company's 'approval' and 'internal policies', and dependent on MBE's 'security clearance'. This introduces uncertainty and contradicts the original right to audit.",

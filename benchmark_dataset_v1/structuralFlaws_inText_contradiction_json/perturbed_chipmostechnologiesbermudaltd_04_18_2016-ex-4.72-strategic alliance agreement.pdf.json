                "original_text": "2.1 Term of Agreement Except as otherwise provided herein, the term of this Agreement is three (3) years from the Execution Date (“Cooperation Period”). The Parties may negotiate for an extension of this Agreement six (6) months before the expiration of the Cooperation Period.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Term of Agreement The term of this Agreement is three (3) years from the Execution Date (“Cooperation Period”), unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the end of the Cooperation Period, in which case the agreement shall terminate. The Parties may negotiate for an extension of this Agreement six (6) months before the expiration of the Cooperation Period.",
                "explanation": "Section 2.1 originally stated a three-year term with the possibility of an extension. By adding a clause that allows either party to terminate with 30 days' notice, we introduce a contradiction. The original text suggests a fixed three-year term, while the new clause allows for early termination, creating uncertainty about the actual duration of the agreement.",

However, Tsinghua Unigroup may assign its rights and obligations to any of its affiliates without ChipMOS's consent.",
                "explanation": "The original text prohibits assignment without consent from both parties. The modified version allows Tsinghua Unigroup to assign its rights to affiliates without ChipMOS's consent, creating a contradiction. It is unclear whether the assignment clause applies equally to both parties.",

The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (“Dispute Notice”) to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall each select one (1) arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. All language used in such proceedings shall be Mandarin Chinese. The Parties agree to keep the content of the dispute and the proceeding of the arbitration confidential. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney’s fees).",

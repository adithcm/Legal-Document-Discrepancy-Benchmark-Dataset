                "explanation": "The original text defines the Development Fee as 50% of Net Sales, which is a fixed amount. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating the Development Fee is a percentage to be determined at CNS's discretion. This contradicts the fixed definition and creates uncertainty about how much WPD will owe CNS.",

Particular Confidential Information shall not be deemed to come under any of the above exceptions merely because it is embraced by more general information that is or becomes subject to any of the above exceptions.",

Particular Confidential Information shall not be deemed to come under any of the above exceptions merely because it is embraced by more general information that is or becomes subject to any of the above exceptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the confidentiality obligations outlined in this section shall cease immediately upon termination of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that confidentiality obligations last for five years after the agreement terminates. The added clause explicitly states confidentiality obligations cease immediately upon termination. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the duration of confidentiality, leading to uncertainty about what protections exist after the agreement ends.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows termination for material breach only if the breaching party fails to cure within 30 days. The modified version adds that CNS can terminate *immediately* regardless of cure if it deems the breach detrimental. This contradicts the 30-day cure period, creating uncertainty about WPD's ability to remedy a breach and avoid termination. CNS's subjective assessment overrides the previously agreed upon cure period.",

If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should\nnote entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or\nmodifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order.

                "changed_text": "2.2 The seller shall be confirmed within three working days after receipt of order. If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should\nnote entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or\nmodifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party may unilaterally cancel the order at any time, regardless of acceptance.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause by stating that any party can unilaterally cancel the order at any time, even after the seller has accepted it. This creates uncertainty about the binding nature of the orders and the obligations of each party.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear obligation for the Buyer to open an irrevocable letter of credit for 100% of the contract value within 30 days. The modified text introduces uncertainty by making the letter of credit optional and the amount negotiable. This contradicts the initial fixed terms and creates ambiguity about the Buyer's payment responsibilities.",

CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity\nwith the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the\nstrength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or\nfor compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance\npremium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers.",

The Buyer acknowledges that claims must be made immediately upon receipt of the goods, but the Seller reserves the right to reject claims if they deem them unreasonable or based on subjective evaluation.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the Buyer's right to claim for replacement or compensation if goods don't conform to the contract, with the Seller bearing all related expenses. The changed text gives the seller ultimate discretion over accepting or rejecting claims, negating the buyer's right to claim, and creates conflict over claim eligibility, making it difficult to determine if the buyer is entitled to compensation.",

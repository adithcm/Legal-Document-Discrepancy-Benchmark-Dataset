Each Product will be set forth in a separate Statement of Work in the form set forth in Appendix A, which will be signed by representatives of each Party with signing authority. Each phase of the project(s) will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement unless otherwise provided for or in a Statement of Work (“SOW”), including but not limited to project purpose, project phases, and a project budget.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 iBio hereby grants to CC-Pharming for the term of this Agreement, a nonexclusive, assignable, sublicensable, limited right and license to use iBio’s Technology in order to manufacture, process, prepare, and obtain regulatory approval for the development and production of Product(s) and work to be performed under this Agreement.

                "explanation": "By changing 'non-assignable' and 'non-sublicensable' to 'assignable' and 'sublicensable,' I've created a contradiction. Later clauses may assume CC-Pharming cannot assign or sublicense the technology, which is now untrue based on this modified clause. This affects the certainty of rights and obligations related to technology transfer.",

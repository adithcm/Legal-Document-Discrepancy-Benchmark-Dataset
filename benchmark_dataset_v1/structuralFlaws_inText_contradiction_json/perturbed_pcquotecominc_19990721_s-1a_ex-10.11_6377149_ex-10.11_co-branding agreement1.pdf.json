                "original_text": "D.  Any payments which have not been received by PCQ within thirty (30) days of the Invoice date shall be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE of 1.0% per month\nwhich is a corresponding ANNUAL\nPERCENTAGE RATE of 12% on the outstanding balance.",
                "changed_text": "D.  Any payments which have not been received by PCQ within thirty (30) days of the Invoice date may, at PCQ's sole discretion, be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE of 1.0% per month which is a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 12% on the outstanding balance.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a finance charge for late payments. The modified version introduces discretion, making it unclear whether late payments will always incur a finance charge. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes.",

However, PCQ's liability to indemnify is limited to the price ABW paid during the period of violation.",
                "explanation": "The original text obligates PCQ to defend and indemnify ABW against infringement claims. The modified text makes this obligation discretionary, creating uncertainty about whether PCQ will fulfill this responsibility. This weakens ABW's protection against potential legal liabilities. It also contradicts to the clause stating ABW use of data is authorized, by introducing a fee liability.",

However, termination rights following a breach will be at the sole discretion of the non-breaching party and subject to review by PCQ's legal counsel before becoming effective.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear process for terminating the agreement due to a material breach. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that termination is at the 'sole discretion' of the non-breaching party and subject to review by PCQ's legal counsel, potentially hindering ABW's ability to terminate if PCQ's counsel disagrees.",

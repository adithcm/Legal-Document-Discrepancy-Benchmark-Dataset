The initial franchise fee is\npaid in consideration of the rights granted in Section 1 and is fully earned at the time paid. You acknowledge that we have no obligation to refund\nthe initial franchise fee in whole or in part for any reason.",

The initial franchise fee may be refundable under certain conditions specified later in this agreement. The Franchisee should consult Section 20 for details regarding the refund of the initial franchise fee.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the initial franchise fee is non-refundable. The modified text introduces uncertainty by suggesting that a refund may be possible under certain circumstances (specified in section 20), contradicting the original statement and creating potential disputes over the refundability of the fee.",

You will be in default under this Agreement; however, termination is not guaranteed and will be reviewed by the franchisor.

                "explanation": "The original text says it will automatically terminate, which mean for the franchisee it would lead to termination, but the added text creates a contradiction with the original part. Franchisor will decide the decision of termination even if there is a valid event that would lead to the termination.",

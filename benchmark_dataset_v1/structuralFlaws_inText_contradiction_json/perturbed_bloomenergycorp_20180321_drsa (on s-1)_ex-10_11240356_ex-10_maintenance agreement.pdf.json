                "changed_text": "Operator may, at its discretion, establish and maintain a spare parts inventory. The location and exclusivity of such inventory will be determined by Operator based on its overall logistical needs.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the operator must maintain an adequate spare parts inventory dedicated to the facilities. The modified text makes it discretionary for the operator to establish and maintain a spare parts inventory. This introduces a contradiction, because the contract previously required them to have one, and now it is optional.",

In the event that Owner desires Operator to service the Bloom Systems and the BOF beyond the Warranty Period, the rate for such time-based services will be quoted by Operator to Owner quarterly for the following quarter, and materials will be invoiced at the retail prices for such materials.",
                "changed_text": "During the Warranty Period, Operator may perform the services to the Bloom Systems and the BOF necessary for the Portfolio to perform to the Warranty Specifications (the “System Service Warranty”), resource availability depending. In the event that Owner desires Operator to service the Bloom Systems and the BOF beyond the Warranty Period, the rate for such time-based services will be at Operator's discretion, and may vary based on market conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that during the warranty period, the operator 'shall' perform the services to the Bloom Systems. The modified version changes this to 'may' perform, making it conditional and dependent on resource availability. This directly contradicts the original, creating uncertainty about the operator's obligations. Also, the pricing after the Warranty period is no longer guaranteed and 'may vary', removing the certainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that 'All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing', but it changed to 'All notices and other communications hereunder may be in writing', now this creates an optional condition where written agreements are not manditory, contradicting the original clause. Also in the original text 'notices of a change of address shall be effective only upon receipt thereof:', which is contradicted in the edited text by saying 'notices of a change of address shall only be updated at the end of a contract period:'.",

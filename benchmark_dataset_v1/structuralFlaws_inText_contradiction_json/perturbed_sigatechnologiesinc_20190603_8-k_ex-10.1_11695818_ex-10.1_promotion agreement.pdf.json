This Agreement becomes effective on the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated as provided in this ARTICLE 11, shall continue until the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”). This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive three (3) year terms thereafter (each a “Renewal Term” and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”) until and unless (i) either Party provides the other Party written notice of non-renewal no later than ninety (90) days prior the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term or (ii) earlier terminated as provided in this ARTICLE 11.",

This Agreement becomes effective on the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated as provided in this ARTICLE 11, shall continue until the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”). This Agreement may be renewed at SIGA's sole discretion for successive three (3) year terms thereafter (each a “Renewal Term” and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”) until and unless (i) SIGA provides MMT written notice of non-renewal no later than ninety (90) days prior the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term or (ii) earlier terminated as provided in this ARTICLE 11.",

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, MMT’s commitment to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts as set forth\nherein shall not preclude the suspension or discontinuance of the Promotion of the Product in the Field in a country within the Territory, if\nreasonably appropriate, based on the application of Commercially Reasonable Efforts with respect to the Promotion of the Product in such country.",

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, MMT’s commitment to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts as set forth\nherein shall require the continuous Promotion of the Product in the Field in a country within the Territory, unless\nspecifically authorized by SIGA in writing. Any suspension or discontinuance of the Promotion of the Product must be preceded by\nsix (6) months' notice and mutual agreement between both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows for suspension or discontinuance of promotion based on 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts'. The modified version mandates 'continuous promotion' unless SIGA authorizes suspension, effectively negating the 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' allowance and requiring SIGA's approval. The 6-month notice and mutual agreement clause contradicts the earlier statement.",

ExxonMobil has the unencumbered right to file or not to file, prosecute, defend, maintain, abandon, or enforce any Program Invention or Program Patent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event ExxonMobil decides not to prosecute, defend, enforce, maintain or decides to abandon any Program Patent, then ExxonMobil will provide notice thereof to FCE, and FCE will then have the right, but not the obligation, to prosecute or maintain the Program Patent and sole responsibility for the continuing costs, taxes, legal fees, maintenance fees and other fees associated with that Program Patent. The ownership of such Program Patent will remain with ExxonMobil.",

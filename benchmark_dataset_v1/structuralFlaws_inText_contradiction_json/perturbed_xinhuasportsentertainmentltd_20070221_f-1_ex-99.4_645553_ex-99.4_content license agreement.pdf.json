TERM\n7.1  This Agreement shall take effect from the Effective Date and continue in\n     full force and effect for twenty (20) years thereafter, unless otherwise\n     terminated in accordance with Clause 8.\n7.2  This Agreement may be renewed for an additional term of ten (10) years by\n     notice in writing given by XFN to CEIS at the expiry of the Term, for a\n     consideration to be mutually agreed.",

The modified clause gives CEIS sole discretion over renewal, contradicting the need for mutual agreement and consideration, making the renewal terms uncertain.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliates' is based on control, whether direct or indirect. The modified definition introduces subjective designation by XFN, potentially allowing them to arbitrarily define affiliates, thus contradicting the objective control-based definition. Similarly, the original definition of \"Content\" relates specifically to \"Schedule 1\". By removing that the content must align with \"schedule 1\" directly contradicts the previous definition, creating uncertainty about which content is actually licensed under this agreement.",

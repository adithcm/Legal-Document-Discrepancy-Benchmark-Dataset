                "original_text": "Client agrees to pay to Company the sum of $5,000 (the “Contract Price”) to design and develop a website for Client (the “Client Website”) in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A.",
                "changed_text": "Client agrees to pay to Company a sum up to $5,000 (the “Contract Price”) to design and develop a website for Client (the “Client Website”) at the discretion of the company, with the option to make some changes to the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a fixed price of $5,000. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating 'a sum up to $5,000' and 'at the discretion of the company,' contradicting the fixed price and creating uncertainty about the actual cost and the terms to change the scope of the work. This can make enforcement more difficult.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear payment schedule of $1,900 upfront and $3,100 upon completion. The modified version adds a condition of 'Company’s satisfaction with the Client’s feedback and participation,' introducing a subjective element that contradicts the clear payment terms and could be used to withhold the final payment unfairly. This creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

Company at its sole discretion may at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service which it has agreed to provide to Client relating to Client Website pursuant to this Agreement without any liability to Company.",
                "changed_text": "Company is obligated to provide customer service as specified in this Section for the duration of the project development. Company at its sole discretion may at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service, however the client can claim compensation if customer service changes after initial development.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by first emphasizing the obligation of the company to provide customer service for the 'duration of the project development' however in the next sentence introduces that the client can claim compensation if customer service changes after 'initial development'. This introduces ambiguity in what 'initial development' means, and under what grounds the client is allowed to claim compensation for after the company can claim to alter or cease the customer service that the company has agreed to. This can lead to legal disputes and uncertainty in enforcement.",

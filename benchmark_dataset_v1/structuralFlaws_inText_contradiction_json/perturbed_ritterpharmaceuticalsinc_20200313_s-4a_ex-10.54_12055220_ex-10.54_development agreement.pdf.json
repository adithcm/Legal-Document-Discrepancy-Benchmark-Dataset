It is contemplated that in the course of the performance of this Agreement each Party may, from time to time, disclose proprietary and confidential information to the other (“Confidential Information”). Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed to in writing, during the Term and for a period of five (5) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the receiving Party shall disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information only to its own (or its Affiliates’) officers, employees, consultants, Third Party service providers, attorneys, accountants, agents, bankers, lenders, prospective lenders and prospective equity investors, and in each case only if and to the extent necessary to carry out their respective responsibilities under this Agreement or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under this Agreement or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit), and such disclosure shall be limited to the maximum extent possible consistent with such responsibilities and rights. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party without the other’s prior written consent.",

                "explanation": "The change in the defined duration of confidentiality obligations from 5 years to 1 year creates a significant discrepancy that undermines the original protective intent of the agreement. This inconsistency makes it difficult to enforce confidentiality, leading to potential disputes over the protection of proprietary information.",

During the Negotiation Period, Qualigen shall provide to Sekisui all due diligence information reasonably requested by Sekisui so that it may make an informed offer to acquire Qualigen. Any Financing Payments made by Sekisui will be credited against any such Sale Transaction agreed to between Sekisui and Qualigen.

                "explanation": "Changing the Negotiation Period from 6 to 3 months puts pressure on Sekisui to conduct its due diligence. More importantly, stating Financing Payments will NOT be credited against any such Sale Transaction directly contradicts the final sentence in this clause, creating significant financial ambiguity and potentially deterring Sekisui from pursuing the acquisition.",

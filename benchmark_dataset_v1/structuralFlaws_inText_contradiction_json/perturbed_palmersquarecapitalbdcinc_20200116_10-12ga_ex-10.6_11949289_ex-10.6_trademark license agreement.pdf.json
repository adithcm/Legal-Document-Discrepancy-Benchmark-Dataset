Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark solely and exclusively as a component of Licensee’s own corporate name and in connection with marketing the investment management, investment consultation and investment advisory services that Investment Advisor may provide to Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this License, and except as provided above, neither Licensee nor any affiliate, owner, director, officer, employee or agent thereof shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivative thereof in the Territory without the prior express written consent of Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion and shall not use the Licensed Mark for any purpose outside the Territory. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark solely and exclusively as a component of Licensee’s own corporate name and in connection with marketing the investment management, investment consultation and investment advisory services that Investment Advisor may provide to Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark as broadly as reasonably possible to benefit its business operations. Neither Licensee nor any affiliate, owner, director, officer, employee or agent thereof may use the Licensed Mark or any derivative thereof in the Territory only after receiving consent from Licensor; such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the licensee can *only* use the mark within strict parameters. The modified text now encourages broad use. The original strictly prohibits use outside the set parameters without consent. The modified text changes the nature of consent to “not be unreasonably withheld”, which implies that the licensee could have a valid reason to use the mark outside the original scope, which contradicts the original clause.",

This Agreement shall be terminable by Licensor at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that Licensor or Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of Licensee’s use of the Licensed Mark; by Licensor or Licensee upon sixty (60) days’ written notice to the other party; or by Licensee at any time in the event Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of Licensee’s rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of Licensor.",

This Agreement shall be terminable by Licensor or Licensee only upon mutual written agreement by both parties. In the event of a disagreement, the agreement shall continue indefinitely until resolved through binding arbitration. This clause supersedes any other termination clause within this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original section 4.1 gives the Licensor multiple options to terminate the agreement at their discretion. The modified text removes these options, stating termination can *only* happen with mutual agreement. This directly contradicts the original language and creates uncertainty about the actual termination conditions.",

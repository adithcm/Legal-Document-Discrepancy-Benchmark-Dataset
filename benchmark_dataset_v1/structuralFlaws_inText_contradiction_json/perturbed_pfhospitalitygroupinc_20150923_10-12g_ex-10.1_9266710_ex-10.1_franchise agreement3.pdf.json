Member shall not, during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose other than the operation of the Franchised Business, any confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how which may be communicated to Member or which Member may learn by virtue of Member’s relationship with Franchisee. All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (“Confidential Information”) is deemed confidential, except for information that Member can demonstrate came to Member’s attention by lawful means prior to disclosure to Member; or which, at the time of the disclosure to Member, had become a part of the public domain.",
                "changed_text": "1. Confidential Information. Member shall not, during the term of the Franchise Agreement, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose other than the operation of the Franchised Business, any confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how which may be communicated to Member or which Member may learn by virtue of Member’s relationship with Franchisee.

However, after the termination of this agreement, the Member is free to use all knowledge obtained during the term of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the confidentiality obligation extends beyond the term of the Franchise Agreement. The modified version introduces a contradiction by stating that after the termination of the agreement, the Member is free to use all knowledge, effectively nullifying the previous confidentiality clause after the agreement ends. This creates uncertainty about the duration of the confidentiality obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original clause prohibits competitive activities within a 3-mile radius 'except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor.' By removing the exception phrase, the clause now imposes an absolute restriction on competitive activities within that radius, regardless of Franchisor's approval. This change conflicts with the possibility of the Franchisor's consent. As is, the new version makes it uncertain if approval by Franchisor is permitted or not.",

The modified version introduces uncertainty by indicating that the member's liability for attorney's fees and court costs is not guaranteed. This contradicts the initial agreement for the member to pay the mentioned fees. Making the term no longer a requirement.",

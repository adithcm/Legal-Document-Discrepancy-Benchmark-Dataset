Notice of non-renewal must be given by either Party to the other Party [*****] prior to the expiry of the Initial Term or the end of a renewal period, if any.",
                "explanation": "Clause 3.2 now introduces a contradiction. The original states that the agreement automatically renews unless a non-renewal notice is given. The modification now states that mutual written consent is needed to renew, conflicting with the auto-renewal concept. The change creates uncertainty as to whether the contract will automatically renew, or require explicit agreement.",

The changed text states the Security Deposit is only valid during the agreement and fully refundable upon completion. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the security deposit's validity and whether or not it is refundable and introduces uncertainty about the rights and obligations of the parties concerning the Security Deposit.",

                "explanation": "The change in the first sentence of Clause 20.1 from \"shall not be released\" to \"may be released\" directly contradicts the confidentiality obligations outlined in the rest of Clause 20.1. The original text creates an agreement where the receiving party needs to maintain confidentiality and does not have the ability to release that information. In the new version, it is up to the descretion of the receiving party to release the confidential information and renders the remainder of the clause without effect and useless.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity. While initially stating that undefined capitalized terms refer back to the SLCMA, the added clause allows for redefined meanings in later addenda, potentially contradicting the original SLCMA definitions and creating uncertainty about which definition applies.",

However, the exact specifications and functionalities are subject to change at any time based on Supplier's sole discretion and without prior notification to Bank of America.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Schedule A describes the software. By adding the clause that specifications can change at the Supplier's discretion without notice, the value of Schedule A becomes highly uncertain and creates contradictions between the initial agreement and what the actual software functionalities are or should be.",

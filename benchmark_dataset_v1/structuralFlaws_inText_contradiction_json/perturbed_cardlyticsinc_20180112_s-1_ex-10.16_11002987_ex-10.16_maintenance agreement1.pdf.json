                "original_text": "19.5 Supplier hereby represents and warrants that the Software shall be and shall remain Operative, from the Delivery Date through the end of\nthe Warranty Period. Following expiration of the Warranty Period and for so long as Bank of America has contracted Supplier to provide\nMaintenance Services, Supplier represents and warrants that the Software shall remain Operative. If the Software is not Operative at the\nexpiration of the initial Warranty Period, the Warranty Period shall be extended until Supplier makes the Software Operative. This warranty\nshall not be affected by Bank of America’s modification of the Software so long as Supplier can discharge its warranty obligations\nnotwithstanding such modifications or following their removal by Bank of America.",
                "changed_text": "19.5 Supplier will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the Software is Operative from the Delivery Date through the end of the Warranty Period. Following expiration of the Warranty Period, Supplier's responsibility to keep the software operative is solely dependent on resource availability and market conditions. If the Software is not Operative at the expiration of the initial Warranty Period, Supplier is not obligated to extend the Warranty Period. This warranty can be affected by Bank of America’s modification of the Software and it is Bank of America's responsibility to make sure the software remains operative after such modification.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly stated that Supplier must keep the software operative during the warranty period, and even after if maintenance services are contracted. The modified version removes the certainty by introducing “solely dependent on resource availability and market conditions” and removing the obligation to extend the warranty period, making it unclear when the software can be inoperative. It also states that Bank of America is responsible after modification, contradicting the supplier's responsibility stated before.",

Supplier may terminate this agreement at any time, with or without cause, by providing written notice to Bank of America.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement is perpetual. The modified version introduces a one-year termination clause and allows the supplier to terminate at any time, contradicting the initial perpetuity clause.",

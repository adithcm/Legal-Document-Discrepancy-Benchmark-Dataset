                "original_text": "This amendment to Section 2 (titled \"Term\"), Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement is made effective December 9, 1996 by and between PC Quote, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement. This Amendment shall apply to said PCQ and ABW and all of their subsidiaries and related companies.",
                "changed_text": "This amendment to Section 2 (titled \"Term\"), Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement may be made effective December 9, 1996, as determined by PC Quote, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\"), and upon agreement by A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement. This Amendment shall not automatically apply to all subsidiaries and related companies, but only those explicitly named in writing by PCQ.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the amendment 'is made effective' on a specific date, implying certainty. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating it 'may be made effective' as determined by PCQ and agreed by ABW, making the effective date conditional and giving PCQ more control. Further, the original states it 'shall apply' to all subsidiaries; the changed text says application to subsidiaries is not automatic and requires PCQ to name them, creating a direct contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement section indicates clear and unconditional agreement by both parties. The modified version adds a condition that Mr. Malin, Director of ABW, is 'acting...pending formal board approval' and the date is 'subject to ABW Board Ratification.' This directly contradicts the appearance of a finalized agreement, introducing uncertainty about whether ABW is truly bound by the amendment until board approval. This creates ambiguity about the contract's enforceability.",

Unless earlier terminated as provided below, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of five (5) years from the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”) after which this Agreement may be extended on mutual agreement of the parties (a “Renewal Term,” and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”). If either party wishes to extend the Initial Term it shall provide notice to the other not later than 180 days, nor sooner than 270 days, before the end of the Initial Term. The parties shall then engage in discussions regarding renewal for a period of 30 days. If no agreement is reached during that 30-day period, then neither party shall have any obligation to extend this Agreement beyond the Initial Term.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed payment of $30.00 per digitized screen, providing a clear and defined obligation for NCM. The modified text, however, introduces uncertainty by granting NCM \"sole discretion\" to pay a \"variable amount\" based on its financial performance. This contradicts the fixed payment structure and could lead to disputes over the amount owed to Network Affiliate. Furthermore, changing it to each party receiving a percentage that will be determined annually by NCM.",

This represents a clear obligation. The altered text gives NCM the 'sole discretion' to either remove the equipment or sell it, and removes the fixed obligation for Network Affiliate to buy it. It gives NCM broad authority on if or not to even remove it. The fact it gets to determine a price 'regardless of its depreciated value' is contradiction of value determination. If Network Affiliate does choose to purchase it, the price no longer being tied to depreciation is a point of contention and uncertainty.",

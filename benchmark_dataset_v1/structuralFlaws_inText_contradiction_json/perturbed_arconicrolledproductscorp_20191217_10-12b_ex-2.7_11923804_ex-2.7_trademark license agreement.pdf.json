Licensor on behalf of itself and its Affliates hereby grants to Licensee the limited licenses to use and have used the Licensed Mark: (i) for the Licensed Products as set forth on Schedule 2; and (ii) as set forth on Schedule 1, concerning agreements entered into by Licensee prior to the Effective Date (“Existing Agreements”). For the avoidance of doubt, Licensor also grants to Licensee and its subsidiaries and affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide royalty-free license for continued use of the Licensed Mark for the production and sale of inventory containing the Licensed Mark applied to such products during the Transition Period as set forth in section 8.2 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and in Schedule 2 of this Agreement. Licensee will not, however, use the Licensed Mark except for the production and sale of inventory as provided in this Section 1.1 and in Section 8.2 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Schedule 2 of this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any of the licenses granted by the terms of this Agreement include any right to sublicense, such right to sublicense shall extend to Licensee’s subsidiaries and joint venturers.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that \"Licensee will not, however, use the Licensed Mark except for...\" which is a restriction. Changing it to \"Licensee may, at its discretion, use the Licensed Mark for...\" removes that restriction, implying the possibility of use outside the specified conditions. Additionally, the license to sublicense was broadened to apply to the subsidiaries and ventures, however with the new change in the text it is limited only to the Licensee, which creates in-text contradictions.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that both Licensor and Licensee 'will be entitled to terminate' implying it is a right. Changing it to 'may terminate' makes it discretionary, while the addition 'breaching party will have sole discretion to remedy any such default' directly impacts the ability for the non-breaching party to terminate the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Originally, the licensor could not unreasonably withhold consent for assignment; now, they can withhold consent at any time, creating a contradiction. Also, the licensee had to ensure the obligations were satisfactory to the Licensor; now, the Licensee ensures those obligations are met. Finally, affiliates were not allowed unless they were affiliates before. With this change, this does not apply, creating a full contradiction.",

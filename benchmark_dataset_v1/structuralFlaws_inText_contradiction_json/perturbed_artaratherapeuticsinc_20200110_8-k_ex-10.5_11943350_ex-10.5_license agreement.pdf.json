                "original_text": "1.22 “Royalty” means the royalty on Net Sales of Product in the Indication, as set forth in Article Three below.",
                "changed_text": "1.22 “Royalty” means a potential payment dependent on ArTara's discretion, not necessarily tied to Net Sales of Product in the Indication, and may or may not be as set forth in Article Three below.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clearly states that 'Royalty' refers to payments linked to Net Sales as outlined in Article Three. The modified definition introduces ambiguity by making the royalty payment discretionary, not necessarily tied to Net Sales, and casts doubt on whether Article Three provisions apply. This contradicts the original intent and creates uncertainty regarding royalty obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text grants ArTara an 'exclusive license', meaning only they can use the Program Data for the specified purposes. The modified text changes this to a 'non-exclusive license' and explicitly states the University can grant similar licenses to others. This directly contradicts the initial exclusivity, creating uncertainty about ArTara's rights and competitive advantage.",

                "original_text": "5.1 Confidentiality. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of seven (7) years after its termination or expiration each Party (the “Receiving Party”) shall maintain in confidence and, except as authorized by this Agreement, not use any know-how, data, processes, techniques, formulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the “Disclosing Party”) and which for any of the foregoing, if written, is marked “Confidential” by the Disclosing Party or, if verbal or visual, is identified in writing as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure and reduced to writing by the Disclosing Party within thirty (30) days of the verbal or visual disclosure (“Confidential Information”).",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Confidentiality. During the term of this Agreement, each Party (the “Receiving Party”) shall endeavor to maintain in confidence and, except as authorized by this Agreement, to limit the use of know-how, data, processes, techniques, formulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the “Disclosing Party”) and which for any of the foregoing, if written, is marked “Confidential” by the Disclosing Party or, if verbal or visual, is identified in writing as “Confidential”. Confidentiality is not expected to extend for a fixed period after termination or expiration of the agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause imposes a strict obligation to maintain confidentiality for a defined period. The modified clause weakens this obligation by replacing 'shall maintain' with 'shall endeavor to maintain' and 'not use' with 'to limit the use of', thus diminishing the strength of the confidentiality commitment. The removal of a fixed period after termination creates uncertainty around the lifetime of confidentiality obligations.",

                "original_text": "2.\nTerm of Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and ending \non February 19, 2013 (\"Term\").",
                "changed_text": "2.\nTerm of Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and ending \non February 19, 2013 (\"Term\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, HDS retains the right to extend the Term indefinitely, subject to continued compliance by Celebrity with the terms outlined herein.",
                "explanation": "Section 2 initially establishes a clear one-year term. The added sentence introduces the possibility of an indefinite extension by HDS, contingent solely on Celebrity's compliance. This creates uncertainty about the actual duration of the agreement, contradicting the initial fixed term and leading to potential disputes over the length of the endorsement.",

Celebrity represents and warrants that during the Term and in the Territory, Celebrity will not endorse or \nmake any appearances or advertisements on behalf of any other multivitamin. However, Celebrity may endorse other multivitamins at their discretion, provided such endorsements do not directly compete with Clotamin as determined by Celebrity.",
                "explanation": "The original clause strictly prohibits Celebrity from endorsing competing multivitamins. The added sentence allows Celebrity to endorse competitors as long as they don't 'directly compete with Clotamin as determined by Celebrity.' This creates a contradiction because the initial clause promised exclusive endorsement, whereas the altered clause opens up a loophole dependent on Celebrity's subjective determination, thus damaging exclusivity.",

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations contained herein may be assigned or \ntransferred by either party without the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, HDS shall be permitted to assign this agreement to any of its subsidiaries or affiliates without the consent of Celebrity.",
                "explanation": "This section initially restricts assignment without mutual consent. The added phrase allows HDS to assign the agreement to subsidiaries/affiliates without Celebrity's consent. This directly contradicts the first sentence, leading to uncertainty about whether Celebrity's approval is truly required for assignment and potentially diminishing Celebrity's control over who uses their endorsement.",

                "original_text": "Wherever used in this Agreement with initial terms capitalized, the\nfollowing terms shall have the following defined meanings:\n      \"CO-BRANDED PAGES\" means pages of the Snap Web Site, to be developed\npursuant to Section 2.2  [CO-BRANDED PAGES] and hosted on the Snap Web Site, that display both the\nSnap Brand Features and the Sponsor Brand Features, along with such Sponsor\nContent, Snap Content and other content as the parties may agree upon.",
                "changed_text": "Wherever used in this Agreement with initial terms capitalized, the\nfollowing terms shall have the following defined meanings:\n      \"CO-BRANDED PAGES\" means pages of the Snap Web Site that display both the\nSnap Brand Features and the Sponsor Brand Features, along with such Sponsor\nContent, Snap Content and other content as Snap deems appropriate. The exact specifications and development process of Co-Branded pages will be determined solely at Snap's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'CO-BRANDED PAGES' states they are 'to be developed pursuant to Section 2.2'. The modified definition removes this reference and adds that the specifications and development process will be determined solely at Snap's discretion. This contradicts Section 2.2, which implies collaboration between Snap and Sponsor in developing the Co-Branded Pages, thus creating uncertainty about the level of Sponsor's involvement.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term, the receiving party will not disclose to others or use for any\npurpose of its own, other than in performance of this Agreement, any\nConfidential Information of the other party. The obligation to protect Confidential Information extends for a period of one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement with respect to Sponsor's Confidential Information, and indefinitely with respect to Snap's Confidential Information. Each party shall take, at a\nminimum, measures consistent with those taken to protect its own similar types\nof Confidential Information (and in any event, at least reasonable measures) to\nprotect the other's Confidential Information against disclosures prohibited by\nthis Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states confidentiality obligations last for five years. The modified version introduces a contradiction by stating the obligation is for 1 year for Sponsor's confidential information, and indefinitely for Snap's, which would cause uncertainty about the length of confidentiality based on which party's information is at risk. It also creates an imbalance of obligations between the parties.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows both parties to terminate for breach of contract or certain financial events. The modified clause adds that Snap can terminate 'at any time and for any reason' with 30 days' notice. This contradicts the initial 60-day notice period for breach and introduces uncertainty about Sponsor's protection against termination, as Snap could terminate without cause with only 30 days' notice, while Sponsor still has a 60 days notice upon breach.",

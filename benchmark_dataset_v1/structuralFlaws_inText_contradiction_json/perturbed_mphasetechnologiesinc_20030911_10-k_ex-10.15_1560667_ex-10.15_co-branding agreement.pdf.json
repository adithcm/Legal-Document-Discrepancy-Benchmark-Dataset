                "original_text": "11. The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Either party wishing to terminate the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the desired date of termination.",
                "changed_text": "11. The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent may be withheld at Lucent's sole discretion. Either party wishing to terminate the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the desired date of termination.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that Lucent's consent for renewal 'shall not be unreasonably withheld.' The modified version removes this constraint, stating that consent 'may be withheld at Lucent's sole discretion.' This creates a contradiction, as one phrase limits Lucent's ability to deny renewal while the other gives them unlimited discretion. This could lead to disputes about whether Lucent is acting within its rights when denying renewal.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that mPhase has no obligation to remove the Lucent Co-Branding Logo from goods sold before termination. The modified version removes this exception and mandates that mPhase must remove the logo from these goods. This creates a contradiction, as the original text protects mPhase from this removal obligation, while the changed version forces them to do it. This introduces conflict of whether mPhase needs to remove or not.",

However, Lucent's right to inspection is limited to once per year, with no less than 60 days' prior written notice, unless Lucent suspects a material breach of this Agreement, in which case, no notice is required.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts itself by first stating that Mphase allows Lucent inspections to ensure compliance with Schedule B. Then, it introduces a limitation of once per year with 60 days written notice, but then says that if Lucent suspects a material breach, no notice is required. This could lead to conflicting interpretations of inspection rights.",

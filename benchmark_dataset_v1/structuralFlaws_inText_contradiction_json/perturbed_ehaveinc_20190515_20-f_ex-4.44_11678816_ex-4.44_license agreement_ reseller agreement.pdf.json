                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This term of this Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereto shall commence as of the Effective Date and shall continue in perpetuity (the “Term”), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions contained herein.",
                "changed_text": "This term of this Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereto shall commence as of the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of five (5) years (the “Term”), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions contained herein.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the term of the agreement is 'in perpetuity' contradicting the 'unless terminated earlier' clause.  Changing the term to a fixed five-year period introduces a contradiction with other clauses that assume a potentially longer or indefinite relationship, such as those dealing with long-term support, data usage rights, and future developments, and will also add to the 'unless terminated earlier' clause.",

CHT does not acquire any rights, title or ownership interests of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, in any of the foregoing other than the licenses granted herein.",

CHT also owns some rights, title or ownership interests of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, in any of the foregoing other than the licenses granted herein.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Ehave owns all IP related to the Ehave Companion Solution, and that CHT does not acquire any ownership rights except for the explicit licenses. The modified version adds 'CHT also owns some rights', which directly contradicts the previous statement by implying CHT has some level of ownership, creating uncertainty about the IP ownership and control.",

                "explanation": "The original text states there is no liability upon termination due to force majeure. This change directly contradicts that by stating that there is now 50% liability of damages to both parties, making the enforcement of the termination clause uncertain and open to interpretation.",

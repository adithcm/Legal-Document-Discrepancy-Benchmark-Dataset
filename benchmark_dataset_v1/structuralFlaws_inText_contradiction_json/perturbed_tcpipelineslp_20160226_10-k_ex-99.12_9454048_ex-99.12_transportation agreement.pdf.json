                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear end date for the agreement. Changing it to 'indefinitely' contradicts the set term and creates uncertainty about the agreement's duration.",

                "explanation": "Originally, the MDQ is a fixed number (101,300). This modification makes the MDQ variable and dependent on the Transporter's discretion, directly contradicting the fixed quantity mentioned earlier and creating uncertainty about the shipper's guaranteed capacity.

The modified text introduces an exception, stating that all obligations cease except for payment obligations. More critically, it grants the Transporter discretion over any ongoing obligations, creating uncertainty regarding which obligations remain valid post-termination and contradicting the original clause's clear assertion.",

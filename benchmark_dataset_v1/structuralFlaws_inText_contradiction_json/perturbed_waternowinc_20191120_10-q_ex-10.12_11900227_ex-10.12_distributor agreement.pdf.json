Hydraspin hereby appoints Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts appointment, as Hydraspin’s exclusive distributor of the Products in the Territory during the term of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmarks. The Territory may be amended with the mutual agreement of both Parties from time to time to add or delete geographic territories by amending Exhibit B attached hereto. If Hydraspin desires to enter a new territory in the United States, Hydraspin will offer Distributor the first opportunity to become the exclusive distributor for the new territory. If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity within ten (10) business days of the date the opportunity is presented to Distributor, Hydraspin shall have no obligation to enter into a contract with Distributor regarding the new territory. In the event the Distributor loses exclusivity on a territory due to not meeting Performance Benchmarks, the Distributor shall maintain exclusivity on any and all existing Products that are in the field and operating at them time exclusivity if forfeited.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Exclusivity and Territory. Hydraspin hereby appoints Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts appointment, as Hydraspin’s exclusive distributor of the Products in the Territory during the term of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmarks. The Territory may be amended at Hydraspin's sole discretion without the need for Distributor's approval. If Hydraspin desires to enter a new territory in the United States, Hydraspin will offer Distributor the first opportunity to become the exclusive distributor for the new territory; however, Hydraspin reserves the right to contract with other distributors for any new territory, even if the Distributor is willing to meet Hydraspin’s terms. In the event the Distributor loses exclusivity on a territory due to not meeting Performance Benchmarks, Hydraspin may immediately remove all existing Products from the field and terminate the agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the territory can only be amended with the mutual agreement of both parties, but the modified text allows Hydraspin to amend the territory at its sole discretion. This directly contradicts the initial agreement, creating uncertainty about the Distributor's exclusive rights. The original clause grants the distributor a first opportunity, while the modified version provides that Hydraspin may contract with other distributors whether or not the distributor agrees. This contradiction weakens the distributor's initial rights and makes them discretionary to Hydraspin. The original clause states the distributor may maintain exclusivity in the case exclusivity is forfeited. the modified states Hydraspin may immediately remove all products if exclusivity is forfeited.",

                "original_text": "5.1 Orders. Distributor shall order Products from Hydraspin by submitting purchase orders and an installation plan identifying the number(s) and type(s) of Products ordered, the requested delivery date(s) (each, an “Order”). The requested delivery date shall be no less than 120 days from the date the Order is accepted by Hydraspin. Hydraspin will not unreasonably reject any Order for Products. Hydraspin will accept or reject each Order submitted by Distributor within ten (10) days after receipt of the Order. Any Orders not expressly rejected by Hydraspin within such ten (10) day period shall be deemed accepted by Hydraspin. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributor may cancel any Order for Products that are not delivered within sixty (60) days after the delivery date specified therein.",

Distributor shall order Products from Hydraspin by submitting purchase orders and an installation plan identifying the number(s) and type(s) of Products ordered, the requested delivery date(s) (each, an “Order”). The requested delivery date shall be subject to Hydraspin's availability and cannot be guaranteed. Hydraspin reserves the right to reject any Order for Products, regardless of the reason. Hydraspin will make a good faith effort to respond to each Order submitted by Distributor within a reasonable time frame. Distributor may cancel any Order for Products, but may be subject to a cancellation fee determined by Hydraspin.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states Hydraspin will not unreasonably reject orders and orders not expressly rejected within ten days will be deemed accepted. The modified text states Hydraspin may reject any order for any reason, contradicting that Hydraspin will not unreasonably reject orders. This change creates ambiguity regarding Hydraspin's obligations to fulfill orders. The original clause states the Distributor can cancel any Order not delivered within sixty (60) days, while the modified version states the Distributor may be subject to cancellation fees, contradicting the first clause and creating uncertainty regarding the terms of cancellation.",

The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and end on the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”), unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof. Upon expiration of the Initial Term of this Agreement, this Agreement will automatically renew for additional, successive five (5) year periods unless either Party provides the other Party written notice of its desire to terminate at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any renewal.",

The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and end on the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”), unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof. Upon expiration of the Initial Term of this Agreement, this Agreement will renew for additional terms only if Hydraspin provides written confirmation of renewal to Distributor. Hydraspin is under no obligation to renew this agreement, and lack of response from Hydraspin will result in automatic termination of this agreement. Furthermore, the termination requirements described in the previous sentences will not apply to Hydraspin, as Hydraspin may terminate this agreement at will with no advance notice.",
                "explanation": "The original clause describes automatic renewal, but the modified clause removes the automatic renewal and instead makes the agreement only renewable with written confirmation from Hydraspin. This creates uncertainty whether the agreement will continue after the initial term. The modified text also contradicts the initial text about giving at least 120 days notice. Hydraspin may terminate the agreement at will with no advance notice in the modified text, contradicting the original notice provision.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that maintenance is provided at no charge. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that maintenance fees will be determined later, contradicting the initial statement and potentially imposing costs where none were expected.",

                "original_text": "Thereafter, the Maintenance Term shall automatically renew for successive period, 12 months, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement unless Bank of America terminates Maintenance Services pursuant to this Agreement. Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services for convenience at any time in accordance with the Section entitled “Termination” of the Agreement. If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, Bank of America shall have the right to reinstate the Maintenance Services without paying any reinstatement fee.",
                "changed_text": "Thereafter, the Maintenance Term may renew for successive periods, subject to Supplier's approval and revised terms. Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services for convenience at any time in accordance with the Section entitled “Termination” of the Agreement. If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, reinstatement of Maintenance Services will be subject to a reinstatement fee, as determined by the Supplier at the time of reinstatement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Maintenance Term automatically renews and that reinstatement after termination is without fee. The modified text contradicts this by requiring Supplier approval for renewal, introducing the possibility of non-renewal, and by imposing a reinstatement fee determined by the Supplier, making the terms less favorable and uncertain for Bank of America.",

                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding anything set forth elsewhere in this Agreement (or below), the Maintenance Period shall generally be available during normal business hours, excluding Bank of America holidays. Extended support, including 24/7 availability, may be purchased separately at an additional cost.",
                "explanation": "The original text guarantees 24/7 maintenance. The changed text contradicts this by limiting maintenance to normal business hours and adding a condition that 24/7 support is only available at additional cost. This creates ambiguity about the standard level of maintenance support.",

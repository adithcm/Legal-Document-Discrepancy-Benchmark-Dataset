[***] For the purposes of this paragraph, [***] facilities located at [***] are considered one Facility. Any facility that Heritage wishes to use, other than [***] to manufacture the Products must be approved by Premier in writing, in advance. For the avoidance of doubt, Heritage’s [***] facility must be approved by Premier before it may be used to manufacture the Products. Such facility approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Premier’s facility approval will be based, in part, on the successful completion of a trial production run that is sufficient in meeting finished product specifications, and an evaluation of the stability and specifications of trial production product within [***] of the trial production run.",

[***] For the purposes of this paragraph, [***] facilities located at [***] are considered one Facility. Heritage may use any facility it deems appropriate to manufacture Products, with notification to Premier. Premier's approval is not required, however Heritage will inform Premier of the facility to be used. Premier’s facility approval will be based, in part, on the successful completion of a trial production run that is sufficient in meeting finished product specifications, and an evaluation of the stability and specifications of trial production product within [***] of the trial production run.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that any facility Heritage wants to use, other than [***], requires advance written approval from Premier. The modified text removes the need for written approval, stating Heritage may use any facility with notification to Premier. This introduces a contradiction regarding facility approval requirements, making it unclear whether Premier has final say on where products are manufactured.",

However, if (i) any increase or decrease in Unit volume under a particular PO is greater than [***] of the initial PO quantity and (ii) Premier requests such change or cancellation within the [***] period prior to the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable) (the “[***] Period”), Heritage in its sole discretion, may charge Premier [***]. In no event shall Premier pay [***] if (i) it cancels or modifies any PO prior to the commencement of the [***] Period (i.e.; prior to the commencement of the [***] period preceding the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable), (ii) Heritage or Jasper fails to timely start production in the [***] period before or after the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable), or (iii) the basis for Premier’s cancellation is a breach by Heritage of its obligations, representations or warranties hereunder.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that Heritage, in its sole discretion, *may* charge Premier [***] for certain changes or cancellations to purchase orders within a specified period. The modified text removes 'Heritage in its sole discretion, may' and now makes charging Premier [***] mandatory under the defined circumstances. This introduces a contradiction. The first sentence allows Premier to cancel orders, but the next makes them pay for it. This contradiction creates uncertainty around the conditions under which Premier might be penalized for order modifications or cancellations and the extent of Heritage's discretion.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states a [***] grace period for storing finished Products at no cost, followed by a defined warehouse fee of $[***]. The modified text removes the grace period and replaces it with possibility to charge fees immediately and removing the warehouse fee amount of $[***], allowing Heritage to charge Premier for storage immediately and giving Heritage the right to determine it. This directly contradicts the original no-cost period and fixed warehouse fee, creating uncertainty about storage costs and when they apply.",

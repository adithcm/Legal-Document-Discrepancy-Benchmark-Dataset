Regardless of any obligations defined by Commercially Reasonable Efforts, AbbVie retains absolute discretion in determining the level and nature of efforts, resources, and the strategic direction of activities related to the Licensed Compounds and Licensed Products.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' would imply a specific standard of effort, potentially creating an obligation to conduct activities in a defined manner. By adding the second sentence, AbbVie retains absolute discretion, effectively negating the intended meaning of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts'. This creates uncertainty about whether AbbVie is bound by any actual effort requirements.",

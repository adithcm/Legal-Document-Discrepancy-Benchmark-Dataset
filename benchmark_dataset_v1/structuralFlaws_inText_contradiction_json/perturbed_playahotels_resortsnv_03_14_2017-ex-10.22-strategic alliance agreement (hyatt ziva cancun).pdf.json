                "original_text": "During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2018 (the “Development Term”), each Party (the “Offering Party”) agrees to provide to the other Party (the “Receiving Party”) a right of first offer with respect to any proposed offer or arrangement, which the Offering Party (or its affiliate) desires to accept, under which the Offering Party or one of its affiliates would acquire the ownership of real property in the Market Area (the “Development Property”) on which a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort would operate (a “Development Opportunity”).",
                "changed_text": "During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2018 (the “Development Term”), the Offering Party may, but is not obligated to, provide the Receiving Party a right of first offer with respect to any proposed offer or arrangement, which the Offering Party (or its affiliate) desires to accept, under which the Offering Party or one of its affiliates would acquire the ownership of real property in the Market Area (the “Development Property”) on which a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort would operate (a “Development Opportunity”).",
                "explanation": "The original text states that each party 'agrees to provide' a right of first offer. The changed text uses 'may, but is not obligated to, provide', directly contradicting the original, making the 'right of first offer' discretionary and creating uncertainty about its enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Any required notice shall be effective upon receipt by the other party, or potentially longer depending on the interpretation of internal company policy, even if sent via a recognized international courier service. Any receipt issued by the courier service may or may not be accepted as conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice; other forms of proof may be required.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a clear and defined method for providing effective notice and uses the courier receipt as 'conclusive evidence.' The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that notice is effective 'upon receipt' (contradicting the two-business-day rule), adding 'or potentially longer' based on 'internal company policy' and questioning the conclusiveness of the courier receipt. This change creates significant uncertainty regarding when notice is considered officially given.",

                "changed_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement may be submitted to non-binding mediation, but there is no requirement to do so. Should the parties choose to pursue mediation, the timeline for such efforts is at the sole discretion of both parties, and the agreement to arbitrate is not negated should mediation fail. The parties are free to pursue any other legal remedies available to them.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a 15-day negotiation period before arbitration. The modified text makes mediation optional and non-binding, removing the mandatory nature of the initial negotiation period and making the decision to proceed to arbitration uncertain by stating 'the parties are free to pursue any other legal remedies available to them.' This directly contradicts the original commitment to arbitration as the primary dispute resolution method, potentially leading to litigation instead.",

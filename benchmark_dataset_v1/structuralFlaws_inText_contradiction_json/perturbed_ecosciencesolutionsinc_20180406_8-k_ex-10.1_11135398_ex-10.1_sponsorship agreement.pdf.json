                "changed_text": "Contribution by Sponsor:\nIn consideration for the right to sponsor the Kaya Fest and to be acknowledged by Fruit of Life Productions LLC., as a Promoter of the event\nduring the term of this Agreement, Sponsor agrees to contract with Fruit of Life Productions LLC., for the amount of $250,000.00. Payment shall be determined at the sole discretion of Fruit of Life Productions LLC and may be subject to adjustments based on event attendance.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement stated the sponsorship fee was to be paid in full upon signing. The revised text introduces uncertainty by stating payment is at Fruit of Life Productions LLC's discretion and can be adjusted based on event attendance, creating a contradiction regarding payment terms and potentially leading to disputes.",

However, Fruit of Life Productions LLC reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time without notice if the Sponsor's actions are deemed detrimental to the Kaya Fest brand.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement specified a fixed term (April 1-30, 2018). The revised text contradicts this by making the term indefinite and subject to termination with 30 days' notice, but also adding a clause allowing Fruit of Life Productions LLC to terminate immediately under certain circumstances. This creates a contradiction regarding the agreement's duration and termination conditions, leading to uncertainty about the Sponsor's rights.",

Fruit of Life Productions LLC, however, reserves the right to assign this agreement to any subsidiary, affiliate, or successor without prior consent from the Sponsor.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement required mutual consent for assignment. The modified agreement gives Fruit of Life Productions LLC the unilateral right to assign the agreement without the Sponsor's consent, contradicting the initial clause. This asymmetry in assignment rights creates uncertainty about the Sponsor's position and potential future contractual obligations.",

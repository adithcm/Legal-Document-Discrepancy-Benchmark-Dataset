                "original_text": "A. This Agreement and the provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided, shall be in full force and effect commencing on the date of execution by both Parties and shall extend for an initial term of two (2) years. This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for additional extended terms each of two (2) years duration unless either party notifies the other in writing of its intention not to renew the Agreement, such notification to be provided at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the then in-effect term. The initial two (2) year term as it might be extended herein is referred to herein as the \"Term.\"",
                "changed_text": "A. This Agreement and the provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided, shall be in full force and effect commencing on the date of execution by both Parties and shall extend for an initial term of two (2) years. This Agreement renewal is subject to mutual agreement by both parties, contingent upon satisfactory performance reviews. The initial two (2) year term as it might be extended herein is referred to herein as the \"Term.\"",
                "explanation": "Section 8.A originally stated the agreement would automatically renew unless either party provides written notice. The revision introduces a contradiction, stating renewal is contingent upon mutual agreement and satisfactory performance reviews. Now, it is unclear if the contract auto-renews, or is dependent on an evaluation.",

                "explanation": "Section 5.A originally stated that the content provider will have sole control. The modified version gives the company preliminary control over the same information. This undermines the allocation of responsibilities and causes uncertainty in which entity can modify content.",

All books and records relative to COMPANY’S obligations to a particular Licensor hereunder shall be maintained and made accessible to that Licensor for inspection at a location in Los Angeles, California for at least twelve (12) months after termination of this Agreement.",

All books and records relative to COMPANY’S obligations to a particular Licensor hereunder may or may not be maintained and made accessible to that Licensor for inspection and will be located at the discretion of the company. The licensor will be given two weeks notice about the location of the documents.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the books and records will be maintained for twelve months. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that the files may or may not be maintained. It also removed the concrete location of Los Angeles, CA. This is an in-text contradiction because the records may be inaccessible.",

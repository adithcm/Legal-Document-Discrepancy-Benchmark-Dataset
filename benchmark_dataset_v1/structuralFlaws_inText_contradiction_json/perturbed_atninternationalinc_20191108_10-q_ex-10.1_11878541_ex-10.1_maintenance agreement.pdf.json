                "original_text": "3.40 Title and Risk. Title to Material furnished by Vendor shall vest in AT&T immediately and automatically upon Location Acceptance (as defined in the Build Addendum) or, if after Location Acceptance of a Cell Site, with respect to any Material provided in connection with the Maintenance Addendum, when actually installed or incorporated in the Work; provided, if the Material was paid for or provided by AT&T prior to incorporation into the Work, title shall always be vested in AT&T; provided, further, in both cases Vendor shall retain risk of loss and damages to all of the Material (including all AT&T Provided Equipment (as such term is defined in the Build Addendum)) until Location Acceptance and thereafter to the extent such Material is in the custody or control of Vendor.",
                "changed_text": "3.40 Title and Risk. Title to Material furnished by Vendor shall vest in Vendor until AT&T has paid for such materials, regardless of whether Location Acceptance (as defined in the Build Addendum) has occurred. Even after Location Acceptance or installation, Vendor retains title if payment is outstanding. Vendor shall retain risk of loss and damages to all of the Material (including all AT&T Provided Equipment (as such term is defined in the Build Addendum)) until final payment is received.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause, which stated that title to materials vests in AT&T upon Location Acceptance. Now, title remains with Vendor until payment, creating uncertainty about ownership rights. This could lead to disputes about who bears responsibility for loss or damage before full payment is made, even after the equipment is installed and accepted.",

Any amounts payable (including any recoupment claims or other amounts to be reimbursed) by Vendor or its Affiliates to AT&T or its Affiliates under this Agreement (including under the Build Addendum or the Maintenance Addendum) may be offset against the Maintenance Fees or any payment due or to become due to Vendor or its Affiliates from AT&T or its Affiliates under the Transport Agreement, Master License Agreement; provided, however, that AT&T’s offset right under this Section 3.22 shall not apply to any Structured Payments for any Cell Site that has reached Location Acceptance and AT&T hereby waives all such rights of setoff and recoupment against such Structured Payments. Prior to exercising its right to offset amounts pursuant to this Section 3.22, AT&T shall provide written notice to Vendor of its intention to offset such amounts and to the extent any dispute between the Parties exists in respect of the amount to be offset, AT&T must first utilize the Escalation Procedure in Section 4.8(a).",

Any amounts payable (including any recoupment claims or other amounts to be reimbursed) by Vendor or its Affiliates to AT&T or its Affiliates under this Agreement (including under the Build Addendum or the Maintenance Addendum) may be offset against the Maintenance Fees or any payment due or to become due to Vendor or its Affiliates from AT&T or its Affiliates under the Transport Agreement, Master License Agreement, including Structured Payments for any Cell Site that has reached Location Acceptance. AT&T may exercise its right to offset amounts pursuant to this Section 3.22 without providing prior written notice to Vendor, and without utilizing the Escalation Procedure in Section 4.8(a).",
                "explanation": "The original clause prohibited AT&T from offsetting amounts against Structured Payments for cell sites that had reached Location Acceptance, and required prior notice and escalation. The modified version now allows AT&T to offset against Structured Payments and removes the requirements of prior notice and escalation, creating a direct contradiction and potentially unfair financial leverage for AT&T.",

This responsibility includes, but is not limited to, (i) timely payment of compensation and benefits, including, but not limited to, overtime, medical, dental, and any other benefit, and (ii) all matters relating to compliance with all employer obligations to withhold employee taxes, pay employee and employer taxes, and file payroll tax returns and information returns under local, state, and federal income tax laws, unemployment compensation insurance and state disability insurance tax laws, social security and Medicare tax laws, and all other payroll tax laws or similar laws with respect to all Vendor personnel providing Services.

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly established the Vendor as an independent contractor with full control over its personnel and performance. The revised version introduces several qualifications: AT&T can direct performance, approve personnel, reassign personnel, and provide bonuses. These qualifications undermine the 'independent contractor' status, creating ambiguity and potential liability issues. AT&T's ability to directly influence Vendor's employees could blur the lines between contractor and employee.",

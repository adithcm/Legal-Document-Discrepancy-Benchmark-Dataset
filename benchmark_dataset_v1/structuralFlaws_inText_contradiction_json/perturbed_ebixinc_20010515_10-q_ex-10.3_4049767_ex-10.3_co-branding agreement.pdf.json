The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating ebix *may* provide the data at its sole discretion, thus contradicting the original obligation. Additionally, the original text permits ebix to disclose About Customer Data, while the revised text adds a condition that this permission is revoked if About provides written notice, thus creating another contradiction.",

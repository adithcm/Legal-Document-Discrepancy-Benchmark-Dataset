This provision is intended to maintain the integrity of the original agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that the original agreement prevails in case of conflict, contradicting the purpose of an amendment which should supersede conflicting original terms. This creates uncertainty about which version controls.",

While each counterpart is considered a copy of the original, the versions may vary slightly based on administrative processes at each company. The definitive version of this amendment will be the one archived by PCQ.",
                "explanation": "The original text ensures all counterparts are the same. The modification introduces uncertainty by saying the versions might vary, and that PCQ's version is the definitive version. This contradicts the original statement that all counterparts are equal and may lead to disputes if counterparts differ.",

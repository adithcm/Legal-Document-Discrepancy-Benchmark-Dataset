                "changed_text": "AGREEMENT PERIOD\nThis Agreement will be for the maximum period of six (6) months beginning for the commencement\ndate. This agreement can be extended at the sole discretion of VAL, irrespective of the terms outlined herein. This agreement can be earlier terminated pursuant to this\nAgreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a maximum period of six months, \"renewable in accordance with the terms hereof\". The modification introduces ambiguity by stating that the agreement can be extended at the \"sole discretion of VAL\", negating the original renewal clause and creating uncertainty about the agreement's actual duration. It contradicts the premise of a fixed term with defined renewal processes.",

Payment to the following individual below will be made according to VAL's payment schedule, which may not coincide with the completion and handover on the Project to VAL. VAL holds the right to withhold payment based on internal performance reviews.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that payment will be made within 7 days upon completion and handover. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that payment will be made according to VAL's schedule, which may not be within 7 days and VAL has the right to withhold payment. The clause will create confusion around the payment terms.",

                "changed_text": "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP\nAll Intellectual Property during the project is initially owned by the Developer, but VAL retains an option to acquire full ownership upon completion of the project. The transfer of IP rights is contingent on satisfactory performance as determined solely by VAL. The rights and title to Duesey Coffee Intellectual Property created pursuant to the Project shall be jointly managed by VAL and the Developer, pending a formal agreement on revenue sharing.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that all Intellectual Property is owned by VAL. The modified version states that IP is initially owned by the Developer and introduces conditions for VAL to acquire ownership. This creates contradiction around IP ownership.",

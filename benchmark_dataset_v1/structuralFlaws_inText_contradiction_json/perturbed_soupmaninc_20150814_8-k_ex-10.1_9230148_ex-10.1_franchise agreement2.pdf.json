            {
                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A.  Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement on the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof.",
                "changed_text": "A. Guarantors may, at their discretion, contribute to the payment of monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement. The timing and amount of such contributions are subject to mutual agreement between the Guarantors and the Franchisor.",
                "explanation": "This modification changes the guarantor's obligation from a mandatory payment to a discretionary contribution. The original clause clearly states the Guarantors 'shall pay', creating an obligation. The new clause introduces ambiguity using 'may, at their discretion' and 'subject to mutual agreement', weakening the obligation and requiring further negotiation.",

                "changed_text": "B. Guarantors guarantee the obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement, but this guarantee is conditional upon the Guarantors' assessment of the Master Franchisee's financial standing at the relevant time.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stated the Guarantors 'shall unconditionally guarantee', creating a strong and absolute obligation. The modified version makes the guarantee conditional on the Guarantors' assessment of the Master Franchisee's financial standing, thus contradicting the initial unconditional guarantee.",

            {
                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "D. Franchisor shall not be obligated to proceed against Master Franchisee or exhaust any security from Master Franchisee or pursue or exhaust any remedy, including any legal or equitable relief against Master Franchisee, before proceeding to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee, and the enforcement of such obligations may take place before, after, or contemporaneously with, enforcement of any debt or obligation of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "D. Before proceeding to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee, Franchisor shall make reasonable efforts to pursue remedies against Master Franchisee, unless such efforts would be unduly burdensome or futile, as determined by Franchisor in its sole discretion. The enforcement of the Guarantors' obligations may take place before, after, or contemporaneously with the enforcement of any debt or obligation of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text unequivocally stated that the Franchisor is not obligated to pursue the Master Franchisee before going after the Guarantors. The changed text introduces a conflicting requirement that the Franchisor must make 'reasonable efforts' to pursue remedies against the Master Franchisee. This requirement contradicts the original statement and adds ambiguity, as what constitutes 'reasonable efforts' is subjective.",

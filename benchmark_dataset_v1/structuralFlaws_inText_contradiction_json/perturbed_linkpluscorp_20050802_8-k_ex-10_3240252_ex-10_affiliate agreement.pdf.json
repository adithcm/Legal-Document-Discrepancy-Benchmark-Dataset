TERM\n        This Agreement will remain in force for a period of one (1) year, automatically renewing for successive one (1) year terms, unless either party provides written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, LKPL may terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, upon written notice to Axiometric.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement is in force for perpetuity (forever). The modified version limits the term to one year with automatic renewals, but then contradicts this by allowing LKPL to terminate at any time. This creates uncertainty about the actual term of the agreement and LKPL's obligations.",

OFFICE SPACE\n         2.1      During the term of this Agreement, LKPL will provide\n                  Axiometric with a license to use office space in LKPL's\n                  corporate facility in Columbia, Maryland, free of charge.\n         2.2      LKPL will allow Axiometric to use enough office space for two\n                  individuals and associated equipment in locations convenient\n                  for LKPL's purposes for as long as that space is available and\n                  not needed by LKPL for its own purposes.

LKPL, at its sole discretion, may charge Axiometric a monthly fee for access to LKPL's telephone system, internet connections, conference room, and printers. The fee structure will be determined by LKPL and may be adjusted at any time with 30 days notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that Axiometric will have free access to LKPL's telephone system, internet connections, conference room, and printers. The modified text introduces the possibility of LKPL charging a fee for these services, contradicting the \"free of charge\" aspect of the agreement. This creates uncertainty about the cost of the office space for Axiometric and allows LKPL to impose potentially unreasonable fees.",

The RFM shall specify delivered product cost,\n                  credit requirements, delivery schedules, warranty service,\n                  quality using industry standard terms, and other industry\n                  standard manufacturing requirements. As the preferred\n                  manufacturer, LKPL shall have first right of refusal on all\n                  such RFMs. If LKPL does not respond to an RFM within thirty\n                  (30) days, or cannot provide competitive terms (such as cost,\n                  credit, quality, schedule), Axiometric will be free to award\n                  the manufacturing contract to an alternate manufacturer.",

The RFM shall specify delivered product cost, credit requirements, delivery schedules, warranty service, quality using industry standard terms, and other industry standard manufacturing requirements. While LKPL is considered a potential manufacturer, Axiometric is under no obligation to solicit RFMs from LKPL. Axiometric may, at its sole discretion, choose any manufacturer it deems appropriate, regardless of LKPL's capabilities or pricing.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes LKPL as the preferred manufacturer with the first right of refusal on RFMs. The modified text negates this preference by stating that Axiometric is under no obligation to even solicit RFMs from LKPL, and can choose any manufacturer at its discretion. This directly contradicts the original intent of giving LKPL a manufacturing advantage and introduces uncertainty about LKPL's role in the manufacturing process.",

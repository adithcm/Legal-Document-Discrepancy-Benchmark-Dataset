                "original_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms will have the meanings set forth below:\n\"Base Salary\" means the Employee's total base salary as of each January 1st exclusive of special payments such as bonuses or\ncommissions, but including any salary reductions made in accordance with Section 125 or 401(k) of the Code.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms will have the meanings set forth below:\n\"Base Salary\" means the Employee's total base salary, as determined by the Employer's sole discretion, potentially including special payments such as bonuses or commissions, and may or may not include any salary reductions made in accordance with Section 125 or 401(k) of the Code.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear definition of \"Base Salary.\" The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating the 'Employer's sole discretion' determines the base salary. This contradicts the initial clear definition, creating uncertainty in determining benefits or payouts tied to base salary.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated by the Employer at any time with or without cause, with 30 days written notice to the employee. The Employee may only terminate this agreement with the express written consent of the Employer. Termination of the Employee's employment may or may not result in the termination of this agreement, depending on the circumstances as determined by the Employer.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows either party to terminate with written notice and specifies automatic termination upon employment termination. The modified text gives the Employer broad termination rights, severely restricts the Employee's termination rights, and makes termination upon job loss conditional, contradicting the original mutually agreeable termination provision and creating an imbalance of power.",

While the parties intend to comply with the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, the Employer's internal policies may take precedence in certain situations.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states the agreement is the 'entire agreement' and supersedes prior agreements, governed by Pennsylvania law. The modified text weakens this by stating it's only the 'current understanding' and subject to 'future amendments' by the Employer, also suggesting that 'internal policies' might override Pennsylvania law. This contradicts the original intent of a binding, legally sound contract.",

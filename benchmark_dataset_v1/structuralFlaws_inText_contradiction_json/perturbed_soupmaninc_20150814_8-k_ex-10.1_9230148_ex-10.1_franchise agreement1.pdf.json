The Franchise Sales Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us at the same time and in the same manner as the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee provided in Section 4.2.1 above. Any Royalty Fee you collect from the Franchisee shall be immediately paid to Us, but no later than the fifteen (15 th ) day of each calendar month. A Unit Franchise shall be deemed to be sold to a Unit Franchisee on the date that you and the Unit Franchisee execute the Unit Franchise Agreement, irrespective of when the Unit Franchise begins operation. Fees and Royalties cannot be increased or decreased without our prior written consent.",

The Franchise Sales Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us at the same time and in the same manner as the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee provided in Section 4.2.1 above. Any Royalty Fee you collect from the Franchisee may be retained by you, until such point as the Unit Franchise begins operation. A Unit Franchise shall be deemed to be sold to a Unit Franchisee when the Unit Franchise begins operation. Fees and Royalties can be adjusted at our discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandated that if a discounted franchise fee is used, the Franchisee is still required to pay the full fee. In the modified version, fees can be adjusted at the company's discretion. The original text said a franchise is deemed to be sold to a Unit Franchisee on the date that you and the Unit Franchisee execute the Unit Franchise Agreement, irrespective of when the Unit Franchise begins operation. The modified text says a franchise is deemed to be sold to a Unit Franchisee when the Unit Franchise begins operation. Furthermore, the original text said fees and royalties cannot be increased or decreased without prior written consent; the modified text says fees and royalties can be adjusted at our discretion. These modifications lead to an in-text contradiction and creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

The modified version says the Franchisee does have the right to suggest policies pertaining to the operation of the Franchised Business to protect the Proprietary Marks and goodwill.

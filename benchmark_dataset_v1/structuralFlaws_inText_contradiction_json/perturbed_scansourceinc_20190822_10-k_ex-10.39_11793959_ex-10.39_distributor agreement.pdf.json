                "original_text": "1. The Term of the Agreement is hereby extended to January 20, 2012 unless sooner terminated as provided for in the Agreement. If the Agreement expired prior to the Amendment Effective Date, any orders received and Products and Services purchased between the date of expiration and the Amendment Effective Date shall be in all respects deemed made under the Agreement as in effect prior to this Amendment. The parties further agree that if Distributor places Purchase Orders after the expiration of the Agreement, and Cisco accepts such Purchase Orders, then any such Purchase Orders shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Agreement; provided, however that acceptance by Cisco of any Purchase Order placed after the Agreement has expired will not be considered as an extension of the term of the Agreement nor a renewal thereof. Notwithstanding Cisco’s right to extend the term of the Agreement, each party acknowledges that the Agreement shall always be interpreted as being limited in duration to a definite term and that the other party has made no commitments whatsoever regarding the renewal of the Agreement beyond those expressly agreed in writing.",

Notwithstanding Cisco’s right to extend the term of the Agreement, each party acknowledges that the Agreement shall always be interpreted as potentially extending beyond a definite term, depending on the ongoing business relationship. Acceptance by Cisco of Purchase Orders placed after the agreement’s expiration may be considered an implied renewal of the agreement, subject to Cisco's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that acceptance of purchase orders after expiration does *not* constitute a renewal. The modified text directly contradicts this by stating it *may* be considered an implied renewal. This creates uncertainty regarding the actual term and conditions of the agreement and when an implied renewal can be inferred from the behavior of the parties.",

                "explanation": "Original (b) required compliance with all applicable laws. Changed (b) now implies Distributor will take direction from Cisco on what is allowed, potentially disregarding applicable laws.  Original (c) required money provided by Cisco must be used in legal means but the changed version directly contradicts the original and states that it is permissible to use the money in any method Cisco deems allowable, even if it violates laws. Original (d) held the distributor responsible for sub-contractors compliance; the change absolves them of this responsibility, unless explicit direction is given by Cisco.",

In the event that Company sells a LICENSED PRODUCT(S) in\ncombination with other ingredients or substances or as part of a kit, the NET SALES for purposes of royalty payments shall be\nbased on the sales revenues and fees received from the entire combination or kit.",

In the event that Company sells a LICENSED PRODUCT(S) in\ncombination with other ingredients or substances or as part of a kit, the NET SALES for purposes of royalty payments shall be\nbased solely on the revenues and fees received from the LICENSED PRODUCT(S) and exclude any other elements in the combination or kit.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'NET SALES' includes revenues from the entire combination when a LICENSED PRODUCT is sold as part of a kit. The modified definition contradicts this by stating that only the revenue directly attributable to the LICENSED PRODUCT should be used, excluding other elements. This creates uncertainty about how royalties should be calculated for combination products.",

However, termination by the company is subject to JHU's written consent, which may be withheld at JHU's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants the Company the right to terminate the agreement 'for any reason' with 60 days' notice. The modified text adds a requirement for JHU's consent, which JHU can withhold, effectively negating the Company's right to terminate at will. This creates a direct contradiction and uncertainty about the conditions under which the Company can terminate the agreement.",

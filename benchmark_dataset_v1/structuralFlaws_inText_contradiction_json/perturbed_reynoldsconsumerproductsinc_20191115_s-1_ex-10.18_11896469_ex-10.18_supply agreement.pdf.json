Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may suspend performance or terminate this Agreement or any accepted purchase order for a product being purchase and sold under this Agreement immediately on written notice to the other Party, and without providing the other Party an opportunity to cure the material breach or attempting to resolve a Dispute over the material breach by negotiation or mediation as provided in this Section, for a material breach by the other Party involving substantial harm to the reputation, goodwill and business of the non-breaching Party that cannot reasonably be avoided or fully redressed by providing the other Party an opportunity to cure the material breach.",

                "explanation": "The original text restricts immediate termination to cases of material breach causing substantial harm. The modification eliminates this 'substantial harm' requirement, creating a contradiction. It is now unclear whether 'substantial harm' is required for immediate termination, thus creating uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that rights and obligations related to breaches, statements, disputes, and inventory obligations survive termination. The modified text explicitly states that these items DO NOT survive termination. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the survival of key obligations, making enforcement uncertain.",

                "explanation": "The original text is an integration clause asserting that the written agreement is the complete and final agreement, superseding all prior agreements. The change introduces an exception for 'verbal agreements between the Sales Representative of either party'. This directly contradicts the entire agreement clause and makes the contract's scope uncertain because it is unclear if the agreement is entire.",

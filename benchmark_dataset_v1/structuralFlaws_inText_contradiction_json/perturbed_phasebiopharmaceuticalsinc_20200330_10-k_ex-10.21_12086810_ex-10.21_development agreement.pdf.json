Any Development Costs in excess of the sum of the Maximum Development Costs and any Going Concern Funding will be borne by PB.",

Any Development Costs in excess of the sum of the Maximum Development Costs and any Going Concern Funding will be borne by PB, unless otherwise agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates SFJ's obligation to pay up to $120M. The modified version introduces SFJ’s discretion, making it unclear if the company will fulfill its financial commitment. By adding 'unless otherwise agreed upon' it creates a loophole to avoid paying excess development costs, contradicting the explicit financial obligation.",

All decisions will be determined on a case by case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear transfer of ownership to PB under defined conditions. The modification removes this certainty, stating that SFJ retains ownership and any PB access is at SFJ's discretion and potentially requires additional agreements. It also implies that PB may no longer guaranteed to purchase the Trial Data Package. The final sentence further muddies the waters by removing any guarantees.",

                "explanation": "The original text implies a strict obligation, but the modifications makes it uncertain. Originally there was a fixed timeline where PB had to give the draft to JCC at least 'x' days before MedImmune. But after the changes, it is determined by PB, which means no timeline guarantees. Also 'shall' becomes 'may' for the review and discuss phase.",

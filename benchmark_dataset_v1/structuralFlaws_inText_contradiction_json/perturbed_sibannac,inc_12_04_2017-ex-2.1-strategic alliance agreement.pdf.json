                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof, and will be automatically renewed for one (1) additional twelve month period unless either party shall notify the other in writing of its intention not to renew. Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof. Renewal of this agreement will occur at the sole discretion of Company, regardless of prior notice. Bravatek must obtain written consent from Company ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term to discuss renewal.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement automatically renews unless either party gives notice. The modified version makes renewal entirely at Company's discretion, contradicting the automatic renewal and creating uncertainty about the conditions for renewal. It also introduces a hurdle for Bravatek to even discuss renewal.",

                "original_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek may receive a discretionary lead-finder bonus, the amount of which is to be unilaterally decided by COMPANY based on unspecified metrics. Payment terms are subject to COMPANY's internal accounting policies.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a lead-finder fee ranging from 10% to 20%, to be mutually discussed. The modified clause removes the certainty of a fee and makes it a discretionary bonus with an amount decided unilaterally by COMPANY. Furthermore, changing 'payable NET 30 days' to 'subject to COMPANY's internal accounting policies' creates payment uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "COMPANY may, at its sole discretion, provide limited indemnification to Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees. The extent and conditions of such indemnification, if any, will be determined on a case-by-case basis and are subject to COMPANY's internal review and approval processes. This clause does not create any obligation on COMPANY.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates COMPANY to indemnify Bravatek under specific circumstances. The modified version makes indemnification discretionary and subject to COMPANY's approval, removing the guaranteed protection and introducing ambiguity regarding when and how indemnification will be provided. The added sentence explicitly stating that the clause does not create any obligation contradicts the initial statement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that all rights conferred to ETON continue until termination of the agreement, with Aucta receiving royalties as long as ETON sells the product unless otherwise agreed. The modification directly contradicts this by stating ETON's rights cease immediately upon termination, but Aucta continues to receive royalties even after termination. This creates uncertainty about the duration of rights and royalty obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows a cure period for breaches before termination is effective.

                "explanation": "The original clause limits Aucta's indemnification obligations by excluding claims attributable to ETON's breach or applicable laws. The modified clause removes \"material\" before breach to increase the types of breaches indemnifiable. More importantly, it eliminates the exclusions regarding ETON's breach or applicable laws, meaning Aucta would have to indemnify ETON even when ETON's actions contribute to the loss. This creates a contradiction because under the original wording the allocation of risk was clearer and under the new wording it is not clear what ETONs liability is.",

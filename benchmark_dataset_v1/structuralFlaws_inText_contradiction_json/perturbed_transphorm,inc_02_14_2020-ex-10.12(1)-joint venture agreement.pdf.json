                "changed_text": "1.29 “Joint Venture” means the operation of the Company pursuant to this Agreement from the Effective Date until the achievement of mutual profitability targets as defined annually by the Board. This definition supersedes any termination clause outlined in Article VII hereof.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Joint Venture' specified its duration, tied to events like 'Put Closing Date' or termination under Article VII. The modified definition introduces a conflicting end condition: 'achievement of mutual profitability targets.' This contradicts Article VII, which lays out specific termination events, creating uncertainty about when the joint venture ends.",

During the term of this Agreement, TPH-A/TPH shall be responsible for the costs and expenses\nagreed by the Parties to maintain and/or procure the equipment for wafer processing specified in the Appendix 2 attached hereto\nand as amended from time to time upon the mutual agreement of the Parties (the “GaN Equipment”). At TPH’s sole option, TPH\nor TPH-A may purchase the GaN Equipment by completion of payment of the purchase price or depreciation cost for such\nequipment as set forth in Appendix 2. In such case: (i) TPH-A or TPH, as the case may be, shall acquire sole and exclusive title to\nthe GaN Equipment, free and clear of all Encumbrances, and none of FSL, AFSL or the Company shall have any right, title or\ninterest in such GaN Equipment, (ii) such GaN Equipment shall be clearly labeled as the property of TPH-A or TPH, as the case\nmay be, and (iii) FSL and AFSL shall cause to be assigned to TPH-A or TPH, as the case may be, all licenses and warranties for\nsuch GaN Equipment and the software or firmware required to operate such GaN Equipment that are attached to, installed on, or\nembodied in such GaN Equipment as of the Effective Date. During the term if this Agreement, the GaN Equipment shall be used\nexclusively in GaN wafer processing, and shall not be used in the silicon wafer processing for AFSL’s or FSL’s current products.\nIn the event that the Company needs to use the GaN Equipment to provide products or services to any customer other than TPH-\nA or TPH or their Affiliates prior to the Put Closing Date or the Call Closing Date, the Company shall reimburse TPH-A or TPH\nfor the use of such equipment in the manner to be discussed in good faith and agreed upon by the Parties, which reimbursement\nmay be offset against amounts otherwise owing from TPH-A or TPH, as the case may be, to the Company.",
                "changed_text": "5.3 GaN Equipment. During the term of this Agreement, AFSL/FSL will have full autonomy to decide on the use and maintenance of the equipment for wafer processing specified in the Appendix 2 attached hereto (the “GaN Equipment”). TPH-A/TPH may request to purchase the GaN Equipment by completion of payment of the purchase price or depreciation cost for such equipment as set forth in Appendix 2, but the decision to sell remains at the sole discretion of AFSL/FSL. In such case: (i) TPH-A or TPH, as the case may be, shall acquire sole and exclusive title to the GaN Equipment if AFSL/FSL approves, free and clear of all Encumbrances, and none of FSL, AFSL or the Company shall have any right, title or interest in such GaN Equipment, (ii) such GaN Equipment may be labeled as the property of TPH-A or TPH, as the case may be, at the discretion of AFSL/FSL, and (iii) FSL and AFSL will decide whether to assign to TPH-A or TPH, as the case may be, all licenses and warranties for such GaN Equipment and the software or firmware required to operate such GaN Equipment that are attached to, installed on, or embodied in such GaN Equipment as of the Effective Date. There is no limitation on the use of the GaN Equipment; it may be used in any wafer processing. In the event that the Company uses the GaN Equipment, no reimbursement to TPH-A or TPH is required.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly stated TPH-A/TPH's responsibility for costs/maintenance and their 'sole option' to purchase the GaN Equipment, with FSL/AFSL obligated to transfer ownership and licenses upon purchase. The modified clause contradicts this by giving AFSL/FSL 'full autonomy' over the equipment, making the sale discretionary, removing restrictions on usage, and waiving the reimbursement obligation. This creates uncertainty about ownership, control, and financial responsibilities related to the GaN Equipment.",

The Parties agree that they may use their respective Affiliates to use, any Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever without restriction. The treatment of any Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to the Amended Process Development Agreement will also be treated as non-confidential and may be disclosed to any Person at any time and for any reason.",
                "explanation": "The original confidentiality clause imposed a strict obligation to keep 'Confidential Information' secret, with limited exceptions. The modified clause directly contradicts this by stating that all information is considered 'non-confidential' unless specifically marked 'Highly Confidential.' This creates a conflict: one clause mandates secrecy, while the other permits unrestricted disclosure. This change fundamentally undermines the purpose and enforceability of the confidentiality provisions, creating significant uncertainty about what information is truly protected.",

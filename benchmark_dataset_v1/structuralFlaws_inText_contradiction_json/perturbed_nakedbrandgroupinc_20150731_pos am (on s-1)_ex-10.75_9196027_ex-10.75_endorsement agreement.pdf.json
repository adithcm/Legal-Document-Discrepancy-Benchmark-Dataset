                "original_text": "All uses of Wade Image in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the prior written approval of Wade, which Wade shall not unreasonably withhold. Naked agrees to submit to Wade or its authorized agent a copy of all new promotional and/or advertising material using Wade Image at least ten (10) days prior to the release to the general public. Wade and its authorized agent agree that they shall not unreasonably withhold such approval. In the absence of disapproval within three (3) business days of Wade’s or authorized agent’s receipt of a request for approval, said advertising or promotional material shall be deemed approved.",
                "changed_text": "All uses of Wade Image in connection with this Agreement shall require the express written approval of Naked, which Naked may grant or deny at its sole discretion. Naked has no obligation to seek approval from Wade or its agents for the use of Wade Image. Wade acknowledges that Naked has the exclusive right to determine the use of Wade Image, subject to Naked's internal policies.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that Wade's prior written approval is required for the use of Wade Image, and that Wade shall not unreasonably withhold such approval. This implies a collaborative approval process. The modified version reverses this, stating that Naked has exclusive control over the use of Wade Image and is not obligated to seek Wade's approval. This creates a direct contradiction concerning the approval process and control over the use of Wade Image, potentially leading to disputes about creative direction and brand representation.",

                "original_text": "Wade agrees that during the Term of this Agreement, he will not represent or perform as a representative, spokesperson or provide Wade Services for, nor furnish services or materials, or allow the use of the Wade Image to be used for the advertising, endorsement, promotion, or sale of Innerwear in the Territory. Furthermore, Wade will not engage in any business or other transaction or have any financial or personal interest in any entity whose primary or core business is selling or manufacturing Innerwear during the Term. Endorsement of any Innerwear other than the Naked Products or Wade Products without the express written consent of Naked will constitute a material breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the above, Wade may, at his discretion, engage in endorsements or promotional activities for other Innerwear brands, provided that such activities do not directly compete with specific Naked Products currently in active marketing campaigns. The determination of what constitutes 'direct competition' will be made solely by Wade. Wade is also permitted to maintain existing investments in companies that may incidentally sell or manufacture Innerwear.",
                "explanation": "Section 4 originally imposes a strict exclusivity clause, preventing Wade from representing or endorsing any Innerwear other than Naked Products. The modified text introduces exceptions, allowing Wade to endorse competing Innerwear brands and maintain conflicting business interests. This directly contradicts the initial exclusivity agreement, creating ambiguity and potential disputes over the scope of Wade's permitted activities and creating the opportunity to breach the agreement.",

                "original_text": "Naked shall have the right at any time during the term of this Agreement to make any revision or versions of all or any part of the Commercial Materials to conform to the requirements of individual markets as Naked may desire, subject to Wade’s reasonable approval as aforesaid.",
                "changed_text": "Naked shall have the right at any time during the term of this Agreement to make any revision or versions of all or any part of the Commercial Materials to conform to the requirements of individual markets as Naked may desire, and any requested modifications to the Commercial Materials shall be deemed approved. Wade's approval is not required for any use of Commercial Materials; approval is solely at Naked's discretion and convenience.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives Wade rights of approval over any revisions to Commercial Materials, indicating that Wade has say over what is published and shown with his image on it. The modified version of the contract removes the need for Naked to get approval, saying that the edits are considered approved, and Wade's rights of approval are solely at Naked's discretion and convenience. This introduces a contradiction about whether Wade needs to give permission for changes to Commercial Materials.",

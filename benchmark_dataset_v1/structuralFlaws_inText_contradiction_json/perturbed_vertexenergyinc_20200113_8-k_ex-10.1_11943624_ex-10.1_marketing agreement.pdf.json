                "explanation": "The original text defines a Business Day as opening at 8:00 a.m. and closing at 5:00 p.m. Houston time. The modified version changes this to 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. This creates a contradiction regarding the operational hours considered a Business Day, which could affect deadlines, payment schedules, and other time-sensitive obligations, introducing uncertainty in enforcement.",

This JSMA will be terminated as of the end of the Term or any Renewal Term, by either Party giving written notice of non-renewal to the other Party no less than 120 prior to the applicable expiry date (the \"Termination Period”).",

The term of this JSMA shall commence on May 1, 2020 (the “Commencement Date”) and ends at April 30, 2029 (the “Term”), with renewals subject to mutual agreement by both parties.\n5.2. This JSMA will be terminated as of the end of the Term or any Renewal Term, by either Party giving written notice of non-renewal to the other Party no less than 120 prior to the applicable expiry date (the \"Termination Period”).",
                "explanation": "The original text implies automatic renewal unless a party gives notice. The change implies that renewal is subject to mutual agreement. This creates a contradiction regarding whether the JSMA automatically renews or requires explicit agreement for renewal.

In the event that any Party makes a disclosure contrary to the provisions of this clause the other Party shall have the right, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies it may have hereunder or otherwise, to terminate the JSMA effective immediately upon notice to the disclosing Party.

                "explanation": "The original clause states the confidentiality obligations continue for two years after termination of the JSMA. The modified clause states the obligation of confidentiality ceases immediately after termination. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the duration of confidentiality obligations, making it unclear whether confidential information remains protected after the contract ends.",

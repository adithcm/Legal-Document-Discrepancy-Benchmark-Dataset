Effect of Termination.\n\n(a) Upon termination (but not expiration) of this Agreement for any reason, Licensee shall be entitled to use the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content for a limited period of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, during which it shall diligently work to transition to another solution. Upon expiration of this Agreement or such 90-day period, (i) all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content shall immediately cease, and (ii) Licensee shall immediately discontinue all use of the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content.",
                "changed_text": "6.6. Effect of Termination.\n\n(a) Upon termination (but not expiration) of this Agreement for any reason, Licensee may, at Licensor's sole discretion, be entitled to use the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content for a period of time, potentially exceeding ninety (90) days, as mutually agreed upon. Upon expiration of this Agreement, the continuation of rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content will be subject to further negotiation between both parties. Licensee should immediately discontinue all use of the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content unless explicitly permitted by Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the Licensee is 'entitled to use' the Licensed Domain Names, and 'all rights...shall immediately cease' after 90 days. The modified version contradicts this by making Licensee's usage after termination 'at Licensor's sole discretion' and extending the usage based on 'mutual agreement'. The clear implication is that the usage period is no longer guaranteed or time-limited and the licensor can grant permissions without further notice. This is further compounded by stating that 'continuation of rights...will be subject to further negotiation', thereby removing the initial 90-day upper limit for usage. It is now ambiguous and potentially unlimited.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensee shall be entitled to exercise exclusive control over all aspects of the websites and the Business associated with the Licensed Domain Names including, without limitation, the operation, the look-and-feel and the Content of such websites.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensee may exercise control over all aspects of the websites and the Business associated with the Licensed Domain Names including, without limitation, the operation, the look-and-feel and the Content of such websites. However, Licensor reserves the right to override Licensee's decisions regarding the Content if it deems it necessary for legal or reputational reasons.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants 'exclusive control' to the Licensee. The modified text introduces an exception by granting the Licensor the right to 'override Licensee's decisions'. This contradicts the 'exclusive control' clause, and creates uncertainty as to the extent of the Licensee's control and when the Licensor can interfere.",

As between Licensee and Licensor, Licensor shall have the sole and exclusive right and obligation to maintain and renew registrations for the Licensed Domain Names during the Term, and shall do so at its own cost and expense during the Term. Licensee shall not engage in the foregoing affairs, in particular, Licensee shall not change or apply for change of the domain name registration service agency for the Licensed Domain Names during the Term of this Agreement.",

As between Licensee and Licensor, Licensor may have the right and obligation to maintain and renew registrations for the Licensed Domain Names during the Term. Licensor's fulfillment of this obligation is contingent upon Licensee reimbursing all associated costs and expenses. Licensee may engage in affairs relating to the domain name registration service agency for the Licensed Domain Names, but must obtain prior written approval from Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Licensor 'shall have the sole and exclusive right and obligation' to maintain the domain names at 'its own cost'. The modified text introduces three contradictions: it makes the Licensor's obligation conditional ('may have the right'), shifts the cost to the Licensee ('contingent upon Licensee reimbursing'), and allows Licensee to manage the domain registration, contradicting the 'sole and exclusive right' aspect.",

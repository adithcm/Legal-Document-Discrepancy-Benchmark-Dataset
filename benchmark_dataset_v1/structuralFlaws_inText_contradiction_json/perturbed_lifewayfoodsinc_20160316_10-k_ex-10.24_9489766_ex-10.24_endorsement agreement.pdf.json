                "explanation": "The original agreement grants Lifeway a 'perpetual' license. By adding the clause 'This license is granted for the duration of this agreement,' we contradict the 'perpetual' nature of the license, making it unclear whether the license extends beyond the termination of the agreement.",

Compensation\n(a) In consideration of the rights granted by Individual hereunder, Lifeway agrees to pay Individual a royalty (the \"Royalty\") equal to $0.02 for each Lifeway product or individual item sold by Lifeway during each calendar month of the Term bearing Individual's first name, last name or other identifying personal characteristics; provided, however, the Royalty will cease being paid upon the death of Individual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Royalty will not exceed $50,000 in any month. All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month for sales during the previous month.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that royalty payments are 'due and payable within thirty (30) days'. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating payments 'will be made at Lifeway’s discretion, and payment terms shall be decided on a per-month basis'. This contradicts the fixed 30-day payment term, creating uncertainty about when the individual will be paid. Addition of Lifeway Stock options makes the 'cash' and 'check' payment methods uncertain.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires mutual consent for assignment, stating that consent should not be 'unreasonably withheld'. The altered clause allows Lifeway to assign freely without consent, while the Individual is bound to Lifeway's permission which may be withheld for any reason. This creates an unequal and contradictory assignment condition, favoring Lifeway and potentially disadvantaging the Individual.",

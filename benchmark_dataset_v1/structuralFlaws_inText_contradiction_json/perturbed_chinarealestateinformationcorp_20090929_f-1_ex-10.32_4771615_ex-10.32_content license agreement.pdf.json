                "explanation": "The original text grants an 'exclusive' license, while the modified version grants a 'non-exclusive, transferable' license, directly contradicting the exclusivity clause. This creates uncertainty about the Licensee's rights concerning other potential licensees and their ability to transfer the license.",

Licensor may, at its discretion, choose to monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names, but carries no liability for failure to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that both the Licensee and Licensor 'shall' have the right to monitor and censor content. The changed version introduces a discretionary element for the Licensor ('may, at its discretion') and removes their liability for not doing so. This creates uncertainty about the Licensor's responsibility and could lead to disputes over content monitoring.",

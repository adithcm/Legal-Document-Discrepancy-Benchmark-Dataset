                "explanation": "The original text states a 5% limit on passive investment in competing businesses. The modification changes this to 15%, and adds ambiguity by stating the percentage can be modified based on buyer discretion. The original text says business did not receive more than $25,000,000. In the modified text, it says $100,000,000.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall also be permitted to solicit employees of the Combined Business for employment through direct and targeted communication, and hire them, provided that a non-compete waiver form is signed by each employee.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly prohibits hiring employees of the Combined Business during the Non-Solicit Period, even if they are solicited through general means. The modified version contradicts this by allowing direct solicitation and hiring of these employees if they sign a non-compete waiver. This introduces uncertainty about the actual enforceability of the non-solicitation clause.",

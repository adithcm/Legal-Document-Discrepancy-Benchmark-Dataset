This Agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall continue in force for three years from the Launch Date (the \"Initial Term\") unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Section (the \"Term\"). The Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one year additional terms unless terminated by either party at least six months prior to the expiration of the then-current term.",

This Agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall continue in force for three years from the Launch Date (the \"Initial Term\") unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Section (the \"Term\"). The Agreement will renew each year only if both parties give written consent 30 days prior to the renewal date; otherwise, this agreement will not be extended.",

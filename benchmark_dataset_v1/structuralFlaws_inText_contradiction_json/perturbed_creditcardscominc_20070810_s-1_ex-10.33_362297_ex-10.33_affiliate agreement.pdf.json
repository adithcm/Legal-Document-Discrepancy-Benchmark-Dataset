                "original_text": "4.\tApproved Account\n\nFor purposes of determining Affiliate’s Commission, an “Approved Account” means any Chase credit card application that is: (i) submitted by any user who clicks on an e-mail, banner or any other advertising material from Affiliate’s Website; (ii) is approved by Chase; and (iii) is reported as approved by Chase to Affiliate.",
                "changed_text": "4.\tApproved Account\n\nFor purposes of determining Affiliate’s Commission, an “Approved Account” may mean any Chase credit card application. Determination of an approved account is at Chase's sole discretion. Chase is not required to report the approved account to the Affiliate.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Approved Account' had specific criteria that had to be met. The modified version introduces ambiguity by using 'may mean' and removing the mandatory criteria, giving Chase sole discretion and removing the requirement to report to the Affiliate. This creates uncertainty about how an Approved Account is determined and if affiliates will even know when they have earned a commission.",

Either Affiliate or Chase may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other party written or e-mail notice of termination. At the time of termination, any links to Chase’s Website must be removed immediately. Affiliate will continue to receive Commission payments for all Approved Accounts placed during the term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Chase may terminate this Agreement if Affiliate does not comply with the terms and conditions herein.",

Either Affiliate or Chase may terminate this Agreement, but any termination by the Affiliate is subject to Chase's approval. At the time of termination, any links to Chase’s Website may be removed at the Affiliate's convenience. Affiliate will receive Commission payments for Approved Accounts at Chase’s discretion. Chase may terminate this Agreement if Affiliate does not comply with the terms and conditions herein.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows either party to terminate with notice. The modified version states that the agreement continues indefinitely, subject to Chase's approval if the Affiliate wants to terminate. The original requires immediate removal of links upon termination, whereas the edited version makes it optional for the affiliate. The original specifies the Affiliate will continue to receive commission payments for all approved accounts placed during the term, while the edited version states payments are at Chase’s discretion. This introduces significant uncertainty and contradicts the original intent of the section.",

Commissions are payable for Approved Accounts to third parties who access the Chase URL's (marketing pages) through the Links located on Affiliate’s sponsoring Web site. Affiliates who use this program to apply for credit cards for their own use are NOT in violation of this Agreement.",

Affiliates who use this program to apply for credit cards for their own use are in violation of this Agreement and may be subject to penalties.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the program is intended for commercial use and that affiliates using the program for their own credit card applications are not in violation. The modified version directly contradicts this by stating the program may be used for non-commercial purposes, commissions are not payable and that affiliate usage for personal applications is a violation that could incur penalties. This introduces conflict on the program’s purpose and terms of usage.",

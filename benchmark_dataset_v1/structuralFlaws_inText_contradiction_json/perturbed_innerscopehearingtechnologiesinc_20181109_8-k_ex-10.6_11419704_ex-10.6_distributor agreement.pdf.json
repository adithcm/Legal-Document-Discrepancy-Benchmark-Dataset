                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This agreement shall automatically renew for a period of three (3) years and upon the parties mutual agreement on new minimum performance goals for the renewal period.",
                "changed_text": "This agreement may automatically renew for a period of three (3) years, and no mutual agreement will be needed for the new minimum performance goals for the renewal period.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that the agreement automatically renews for three years only if the parties mutually agree on new minimum performance goals. The altered version suggests that agreement auto renews without any need for mutual agreement which create contradiction and confusion about renewal terms and obligations for the new performance goals.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the Distributor use its best efforts to market and sell products, whereas the modified text suggests the distributor may choose to do so or not. It is contradicting the original obligation for distributor, and undermines the commitment to product sales.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates consultation and cooperation between Distributor and Erchonia regarding marketing and promotional activities. The altered clause eliminates this obligation, contradicting the prior expectation of partnership and communication. This creates uncertainty about Erchonia’s ability to influence or oversee the marketing and sales of its products.",

Each party agrees that the primary remedy for a breach of the warranties set forth in this Section 12 shall be the indemnification set forth in Section 13 below. However, the non-breaching party retains the right to pursue equitable relief, including specific performance, at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text states indemnification is the 'sole and exclusive remedy', while the modified text allows for 'equitable relief' in addition to indemnification. This creates a contradiction as to whether indemnification is the only recourse, introducing uncertainty in enforcement.",

However, inadvertent placement of such advertising shall not be considered a breach of this section if promptly rectified upon notification by eDiets.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a strict prohibition ('will not'), while the modified text introduces a 'commercially reasonable efforts' standard, and allows for 'inadvertent placement'. This creates a contradiction as to the level of obligation Women.com has regarding competitive advertising, making enforcement of the exclusivity provision less certain.",

ABW will commence payment\nof a monthly fee for the right to permit access by ABW's clients to said\nSOFTWARE and HYPERFEED.",

Installation and testing of all equipment and services are not prerequisites for payment.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that payment commences on the date specified in Schedule A OR upon completion of installation and testing, whichever is LATER. The modified text removes the 'whichever is later' clause and explicitly states that installation and testing are NOT prerequisites. This creates a contradiction as to when payment obligations begin, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies termination notice must be sent by certified mail and is effective at the end of the anniversary month. The changed text allows email termination with immediate effect. This is contradictory and creates uncertainty about the proper procedure and timing of termination.",

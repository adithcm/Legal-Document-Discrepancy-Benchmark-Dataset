Licensee shall have the right to assign or sublicense any or all of its rights granted under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to third parties exhibiting the Titles in the ordinary course of Licensee’s business with prior written notice to Licensor. Except as otherwise specified in the previous sentence, Licensee may not sublicense any of its rights under Section 2(a) without Licensor’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Sublicensing. Licensee shall have the right to assign or sublicense any or all of its rights granted under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to third parties exhibiting the Titles in the ordinary course of Licensee’s business without any notice or consent from Licensor. Licensee may sublicense any of its rights under Section 2(a) at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the sublicensing rights. The original text allows sublicensing with prior written notice for ordinary course business, but requires consent for other sublicensing. The modified text grants unrestricted sublicensing rights, negating the need for any notice or consent. This could lead to disputes over whether Licensor has any control over who the Licensee sublicenses the content to.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement; (b) the receiving party lawfully receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without breach of a nondisclosure obligation; (c) the receiving party rightfully knew prior to receiving such information from the disclosing party; or (d) the receiving party develops entirely independently of, and without any access or reference to or use of, any Confidential Information communicated to the receiving party by the disclosing party.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means any information exchanged between the parties, regardless of whether it is marked as confidential or could reasonably be understood as such. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is in or enters the public domain due to any reason; (b) the receiving party receives from a third party, regardless of any restriction on disclosure; (c) the receiving party knew prior to the agreement, regardless of how they obtained it; or (d) the receiving party develops independently, even with direct use of Confidential Information communicated by the disclosing party.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly broadens the definition of 'Confidential Information' initially, then dramatically weakens the exclusions. The initial definition states that it has to be 'marked or designated by such party as “confidential” or “proprietary”', while the modified version states that it could be any information exchanged between the parties, without any consideration of marking or reasonable understanding. The modified exclusions essentially nullify the protection offered by confidentiality by including circumstances where Confidential Information would typically be protected. This could create disputes over what information is actually protected under the agreement.",

This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral or written agreements and representations with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement may be modified or amended through verbal agreement confirmed via email between any representative of each party.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly requires modifications or amendments to be in writing and signed by all parties. The modified version introduces an internal contradiction by allowing verbal agreements confirmed via email, thus undermining the certainty and enforceability established by the original written requirement. This could lead to disputes over the validity of modifications and whether they were properly authorized.",

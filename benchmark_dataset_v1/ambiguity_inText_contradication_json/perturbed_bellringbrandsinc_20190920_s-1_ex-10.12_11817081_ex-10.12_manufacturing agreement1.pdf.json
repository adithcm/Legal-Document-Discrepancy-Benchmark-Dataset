                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement will commence on the Commencement Date and will continue through December 31, 2022, unless terminated earlier per Section 11(a) or extended by mutual agreement in writing (“Term”). For accounting purposes, the ‘Term’ will always be considered to extend to December 31, 2023, regardless of actual termination or extension.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the definition of 'Term.' The first part defines it as ending on December 31, 2022, unless terminated earlier or extended. The second part states that for accounting, it extends to December 31, 2023, irrespective of the actual date. This could create confusion over financial obligations, reporting, and audit periods, leading to potential disputes.",

If the final production quantity for any accepted PO is less than [***] of the PO quantity ordered, or if the quantity of production released for shipment within [***] from the last day of production is less than [***] of the PO quantity, upon request by Premier, Heritage shall take all commercially reasonable steps to produce or replace the shortfall within [***]. The final production quantity by Heritage and Jasper will count towards the MAOV requirements.",
                "changed_text": "Heritage shall within [***] after the end of the production run, notify Premier via email of the final estimated production quantity and the estimated quantity, including losses, of all Premier-supplied materials used. The notification should include both estimated and confirmed quantities. If the confirmed final production quantity for any accepted PO is less than [***] of the PO quantity ordered, Premier may, at its discretion, either (a) request Heritage to take commercially reasonable steps to produce or replace the shortfall within [***], or (b) accept the reduced quantity without further obligation on Heritage's part. The final production quantity by Heritage and Jasper will count towards the MAOV requirements, calculated at Premier’s discretion.",
                "explanation": "This edit introduces conflicting interpretations. The original text mandates Heritage to make up any shortfall, making it an obligation. The changed text gives Premier the option to accept a reduced quantity, negating the original firm obligation. Furthermore, it adds that MAOV is calculated at Premier's discretion, conflicting with the rest of the agreement where that metric is clearly calculable.",

The foregoing shall not relieve either Party of any obligation to make payments required pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there is a force majeure at either Heritage production facility, then the non-force majeure facility shall not be required to produce the total production quantities agreed upon for both facilities. However, the non-force majeure facility shall use commercially reasonable efforts to produce as much Product as possible for Premier during the force majeure period. Heritage shall not be responsible for any excess freight expense on Product incurred by Premier due to the force majeure.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that either Party shall be totally or partially unable to fulfill one or more of its obligations hereunder as a result of acts or occurrences beyond the control of the Party affected, such as, but not limited to, actions, omissions or impositions by local, state or federal governmental authorities, fire, flood, earthquake or other natural disasters, acts of God, revolution, strikes or fuel shortages, the Party so affected shall be totally or partially relieved from fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement during the period of such force majeure; provided, however, that the affected Party shall notify the other Party of the circumstances as soon as reasonably possible; and further provided that if such period of force majeure shall continue for a period of [***] or more, the Party not affected shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement by giving notice to take effect immediately. The foregoing shall relieve either Party of any obligation to make payments required pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there is a force majeure at either Heritage production facility, then the non-force majeure facility shall still be required to produce the total production quantities agreed upon for both facilities, but will have an additional [***] days to achieve such production. However, the non-force majeure facility shall use commercially reasonable efforts to produce as much Product as possible for Premier during the force majeure period, at a rate of 50% of previously agreed upon production for both facilities. Heritage will be responsible for any excess freight expense on Product incurred by Premier due to the force majeure.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the force majeure payment clause. The original says it does not relive payment obligation, and the changed version relieves parties of those payment obligations. Additionally, there is now a contradiction with total production levels, making it ambiguous of the original agreement holds or the forced production numbers and imposed deadlines in the modified agreement do.",

                "original_text": "2.1 Subject to the provisions hereof, Dong-A shall (i) supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo already manufactured by Dong-A as of the Effective Date in compliance with the KGMP, and (ii) manufacture in compliance with the KGMP and in conformity with the specifications separately agreed upon between the Parties and attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Product Specifications”) and supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, and NeuroBo shall purchase from Dong-A the entire requirement of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for research and development of the Licensed Products under the License Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Subject to the provisions hereof, Dong-A shall use its best efforts to (i) supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo already manufactured by Dong-A as of the Effective Date in compliance with the KGMP, and (ii) manufacture in compliance with the KGMP and generally in conformity with the specifications separately agreed upon between the Parties and attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Product Specifications”) and supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, and NeuroBo shall purchase from Dong-A the entire requirement of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for research and development of the Licensed Products under the License Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states 'Dong-A shall' supply and manufacture, creating a definite obligation. The modified text uses 'Dong-A shall use its best efforts', significantly weakening the obligation. This introduces an ambiguity, as another part of the contract could depend on the original strict interpretation.",

                "original_text": "3.1 NeuroBo shall submit to Dong-A an order for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo no later than [***] days prior to the requested delivery date thereof. For each order, NeuroBo shall be obligated to order the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in [***] tablets. NeuroBo acknowledges and agrees that certain quantity of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo from each batch ordered shall be retained by Dong-A for use in the stability tests and as retention samples, and NeuroBo shall order the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in consideration of such quantity to be retained by Dong-A. Each order shall specify at least (i) the quantity of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, (ii) the specifications of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, including the specifics of packaging, (iii) the expected delivery date for the API, (iv) the requested delivery date for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, (v) the shipment terms for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo and (vi) the supply price for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo. Upon receipt of the order from NeuroBo, Dong-A shall promptly acknowledge the receipt of such order. No order shall be binding upon the Parties until agreed in writing by Dong-A and NeuroBo; provided, however, that such agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Upon such agreement, the order shall be deemed to be the “Firm Order” which shall be binding and may only be revised by agreement of the Parties in writing. Dong-A shall deliver the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to NeuroBo in accordance with the Firm Order on the shipment terms of [***] manufacturing facility of Dong-A (ICC Incoterms 2010), including the delivery date and place set forth therein, within the later of (i) [***] days after the date of the Firm Order and (ii) [***] days after the date of acceptance by Dong-A of the API.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 NeuroBo shall submit to Dong-A an order for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo no later than [***] days prior to the requested delivery date thereof. While NeuroBo intends to order the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in [***] tablets, it is understood that the exact quantity may vary based on NeuroBo's research needs. NeuroBo acknowledges and agrees that certain quantity of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo from each batch ordered shall be retained by Dong-A for use in the stability tests and as retention samples, and NeuroBo shall order the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in consideration of such quantity to be retained by Dong-A. Each order should generally specify (i) the approximate quantity of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, (ii) the desired specifications of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, including the specifics of packaging, (iii) the estimated delivery date for the API, (iv) the preferred delivery date for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, (v) the suggested shipment terms for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo and (vi) the proposed supply price for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo. Upon receipt of the order from NeuroBo, Dong-A shall acknowledge the receipt of such order within a reasonable time. No order shall be binding upon the Parties until agreed in writing by Dong-A and NeuroBo; however, Dong-A maintains discretion in accepting orders. Upon such agreement, the order shall be deemed to be the “Firm Order” which shall be considered binding but subject to adjustments based on unforeseen circumstances. Dong-A will attempt to deliver the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to NeuroBo in general accordance with the Firm Order on the shipment terms of [***] manufacturing facility of Dong-A (ICC Incoterms 2010), including the delivery date and place set forth therein, within a reasonable timeframe after the later of (i) [***] days after the date of the Firm Order and (ii) [***] days after the date of acceptance by Dong-A of the API.",
                "explanation": "The changes in Section 3.1 introduce several ambiguities: 1) 'shall be obligated' is replaced with a flexible quantity. 2) 'shall specify at least' is replaced with 'should generally specify'. 3) 'Dong-A shall promptly acknowledge' becomes 'Dong-A shall acknowledge within a reasonable time'. 4) 'agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed' is altered to allow Dong-A full discretion. 5) 'Dong-A shall deliver' is changed to 'Dong-A will attempt to deliver'. These weaken NeuroBo's ability to enforce the order terms, creating uncertainty about the supplier's obligations. The term 'Firm Order' is itself weakened.",

                "explanation": "The original text is definitive: prices 'shall be specified' and implies fixed. The modified text introduces flexibility with 'expected to be specified' and adds 'subject to change'. This creates a direct contradiction and ambiguity, as one section could assume a fixed price (e.g., for budgeting), while another allows price fluctuations, leading to potential disputes over the invoiced amount.",

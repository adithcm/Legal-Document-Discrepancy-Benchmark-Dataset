During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2018 (the “Development Term”), each Party (the “Offering Party”) agrees to provide to the other Party (the “Receiving Party”) a right of first offer with respect to any proposed offer or arrangement, which the Offering Party (or its affiliate) desires to accept, under which the Offering Party or one of its affiliates would acquire the ownership of real property in the Market Area (the “Development Property”) on which a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort would operate (a “Development Opportunity”).",

During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2018 (the “Development Term”), each Party (the “Offering Party”) agrees to provide to the other Party (the “Receiving Party”) a right of first offer with respect to any proposed offer or arrangement, which the Offering Party (or its affiliate) desires to consider, but is not obligated to accept, under which the Offering Party or one of its affiliates would express interest in the ownership of real property in the Market Area (the “Development Property”) on which a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort might operate (a “Potential Development Opportunity”).",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a 'right of first offer' for opportunities the Offering Party 'desires to accept,' implying a binding obligation. The modified text softens this by stating the Offering Party 'desires to consider, but is not obligated to accept,' and referring to 'Potential Development Opportunity,' creating uncertainty about the obligation's strength.",

Any required notice shall be effective two business days after it is sent by a recognized international courier service to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and any receipt issued by the courier service shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice.",
                "changed_text": "3. Notices. Any notice required under this Agreement to be given by either Party to the other Party shall be in writing in the English language. Any required notice shall be considered delivered when sent via email, or five business days after it is sent by a recognized international courier service to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and a delivery confirmation or courier receipt shall serve as acceptable evidence of sending.",
                "explanation": "The original states notices are 'effective two business days after sending via courier.' The modified version introduces email as an alternative, which is 'considered delivered' immediately upon sending, creating a conflict. Courier notice is now effective 5 days after sending. The term 'conclusive evidence' is weakened to 'acceptable evidence' adding further ambiguity. It's unclear whether both email and courier options need to be used, or which one takes precedence.",

Dispute Resolution.\n(a) All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall to the extent possible be settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties within fifteen (15) days from the date of written notice by either Party of the existence of such dispute, and, failing such amicable settlement, shall be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“Rules”). To the extent there is any conflict between the Rules and the Federal Arbitration Act as it pertains to such arbitration, the Rules shall prevail.",
                "changed_text": "5. Dispute Resolution.\n(a) All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement may be initially addressed through informal mediation between the Parties for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days from the date of written notice of the dispute. If mediation is unsuccessful, either party may then elect to pursue arbitration, which shall be conducted according to principles of fairness and equity, but without strict adherence to the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. To the extent any legal precedents or statutes are deemed relevant, the Federal Arbitration Act will be considered as a persuasive, but not binding, authority.",
                "explanation": "The original mandates 'arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce.' The modified version introduces 'informal mediation' as an initial step and suggests arbitration without strict adherence to those rules and FAA becomes non-binding. This contradicts the original, creating uncertainty about the arbitration process and applicable rules.",

As used herein, capitalized terms have the meaning ascribed to them herein, including the following terms have the meanings\nset forth below. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "1.\nDEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION\n1.1\nCertain Definitions. As used herein, capitalized terms have the meaning ascribed to them in the Stock Purchase Agreement, irrespective of whether they are defined herein. The following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. If a term is defined both in this Agreement and the Stock Purchase Agreement, the definition that provides the broadest possible interpretation shall prevail.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in how terms are defined. The original text prioritizes definitions within the agreement, while the modified text suggests definitions in the Stock Purchase Agreement take precedence, and if both are available, the broadest interpretation is used. This creates confusion about which definition is valid. This change affects the enforcement of the agreement because of how the defined terms can allow for multiple interpretations of the defined terms.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by creating an exception to the original 'Company Field' definition. It's now unclear whether the entire contract applies to the commercial sale of products, as the original definition suggests, or if another part of the contract restricts the company from using the products for commercial purposes. This contradiction affects how the contract is enforced because it will become unclear what is in the scope or outside the scope, or whether the contract applies at all.",

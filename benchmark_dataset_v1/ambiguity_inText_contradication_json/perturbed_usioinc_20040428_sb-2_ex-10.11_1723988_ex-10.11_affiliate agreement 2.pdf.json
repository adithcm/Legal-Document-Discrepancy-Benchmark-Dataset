Affiliate  shall  use its best efforts to market and sell\nto  commercial businesses the Services of Network 1 and Network 1's subsidiaries\nand  to  locate individuals who are willing and capable of acting as Contractors\nof  Network  1  and Affiliate subject to the approval of all such individuals by\nNetwork  1  as  set  out  in  Section  2.01  [CONTRACTORS].  All  such Contractors must process\nMerchant applications and transactions exclusively through Network 1.  Network 1\nconsents  to  waive  said  exclusivity  requirement  with  respect  to  specific\nMerchants  in  the  event  Network  1 (i) is unable to process for such specific\nMerchant,  and  (ii)  the  declined Merchant is not accepted for processing by a\nprovider  that Network 1 designates for specific Merchant's that are declined by\nNetwork  1  (\"B  Bank  Source\").  Affiliate  shall  disclose  to  Network  1 all\ninformation  known  to  Affiliate  with  respect  to  the background, character,\nemployment  history,  business  experience  and other information regarding each\nprospective  Contractor  relevant to Network 1's determination whether to accept\nor  not  accept  each  prospective  Contractor.",

Affiliate  shall  use commercially reasonable efforts to market and sell\nto  commercial businesses the Services of Network 1 and Network 1's subsidiaries\nand  to  locate individuals who are willing and capable of acting as Contractors\nof  Network  1  subject to the approval of all such individuals by Network 1. All  such Contractors must process Merchant applications and transactions primarily through Network 1, with the allowance to use other providers where Network 1 is demonstrably uncompetitive in pricing.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'best efforts' from the Affiliate to market services and requires Contractors to process exclusively through Network 1. The modified text changes 'best efforts' to 'commercially reasonable efforts' making it less stringent, and replaces the exclusivity requirement with a clause allowing other providers if Network 1's pricing is uncompetitive, creating an ambiguity regarding how exclusivity is enforced.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original clause giving Network 1 absolute discretion to accept or reject contractors. Now it says Network 1 will 'endeavor to accept' and Contractors identified by Affiliate will be given 'preference'. This makes the approval process ambiguous; it is unclear how much discretion Network 1 retains, and what constitutes 'preference'.",

                "explanation": "The original clause outlines specific conditions for automatic renewal or termination. The added sentence introduces a conflicting clause, stating Network 1 can terminate 'at any time and for any reason with 30 days written notice'. This contradicts the previous clauses specifying term length and renewal conditions, making it unclear under what circumstances Network 1 can actually terminate the agreement.",

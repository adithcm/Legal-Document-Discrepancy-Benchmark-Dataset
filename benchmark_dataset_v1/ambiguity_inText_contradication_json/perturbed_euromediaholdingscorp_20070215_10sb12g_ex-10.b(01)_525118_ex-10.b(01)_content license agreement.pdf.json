                "original_text": "This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for a term of one (1) year from the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”), unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms hereof.  Following the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms (each a “Renewal Term”), unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for a term of one (1) year from the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”), unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms hereof.  Following the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms (each a “Renewal Term”), unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'thirty (30) days' to 'sixty (60) days' creates a contradiction regarding the notice period required for non-renewal. One section states 30 days, another states 60 days, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes.",

However, this exclusion does not apply to punitive damages arising from willful misconduct or gross negligence.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'However, this exclusion does not apply to punitive damages arising from willful misconduct or gross negligence,' we create an exception to the liability waiver for punitive damages under certain circumstances. This contradicts the original absolute waiver and makes the scope of liability unclear.",

Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be instituted in the state or federal courts located in Delaware, and each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding.",

Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be instituted in the state or federal courts located in Delaware, or at the Plaintiff's discretion, in the courts of New York. Each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'or at the Plaintiff's discretion, in the courts of New York' introduces a contradiction. The original text specifies Delaware courts, while the changed text allows the plaintiff to choose between Delaware and New York. This creates jurisdictional ambiguity and potential forum shopping.",

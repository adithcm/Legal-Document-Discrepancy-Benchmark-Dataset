                "original_text": "3. To the extent, if any, that provision of this Agreement\nconflicts with or differs from any provision of the Agreement, such provision\nof this Second Amendment shall prevail and govern for all purposes and in all\nrespects.",
                "changed_text": "3. To the extent, if any, that any term or condition in this Agreement is unclear, the parties will attempt to resolve such unclear provision by good faith negotiation. If the Parties are unable to come to an agreement through such negotiations, the original agreement shall take precedence.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by contradicting the precedence of the Second Amendment. The original text explicitly states the Second Amendment prevails in case of conflicts. The modified version suggests negotiation in case of unclear terms, but states the original agreement takes precedence if the parties cannot agree on the meaning, effectively nullifying the amendments priority.",

                "explanation": "The original text confirms ratification except as modified. The changed text introduces doubt about full ratification. It suggests further documentation may be required which contradicts the definitive statement of the original text. It makes the agreement unstable. The use of the words 'believed to be ratified' weakens this assertion.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that PCQ and ABW executed a Co-Branding Agreement. The changed text undermines this foundation by suggesting they 'may have' executed such agreement. The dates of the agreements also are questioned. The modified version introduces uncertainty by replacing concrete facts with conjecture, contradicting the firm statement in the original version.",

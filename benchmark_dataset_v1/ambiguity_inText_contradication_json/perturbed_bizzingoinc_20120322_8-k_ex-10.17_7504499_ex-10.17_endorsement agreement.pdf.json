                "original_text": "“Property” as stated herein shall mean Theismann’s name (including “Joe Theismann”, “Theismann” “J. Theismann”), nicknames, initials, autograph, facsimile signature, photograph, image, likeness, voice, video portrayals, biographical data, character, symbols, and/or other endorsement, and any variations or deviations thereof.",
                "changed_text": "“Property” as stated herein shall mean Theismann’s name (including “Joe Theismann”, “Theismann” “J. Theismann”), nicknames, initials, autograph, facsimile signature, photograph, image, likeness, voice, video portrayals, biographical data, character, symbols and/or other endorsement, and any variations or deviations thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, Property does not include Theismann's likeness in any video game format.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Property' is broad, including various aspects of Theismann's identity. The modified definition adds a clause excluding his likeness in video games. This creates a contradiction if other sections of the contract grant Bizzingo rights related to 'Property' that could be interpreted as including or excluding video game likenesses, leading to disputes over scope of rights.",

Theismann agrees that such material, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Bizzingo to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by the Theismann in writing within fourteen (14) days after Theismann’s receipt thereof. Theismann agrees that any material submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Theismann shall advise Bizzingo in writing of the specific grounds therefor at the time of disapproval and provide Bizzingo with specific changes or alterations to such materials. Bizzingo thereafter shall have the right and privileged to use such Property as provided in this Agreement subject to such changes or alterations.",
                "changed_text": "Bizzingo agrees that any use of the Property for advertising, promotional or sale purposes will be approved in advance by Theismann. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Theismann's approval is only required for national advertising campaigns exceeding $500,000 in budget. For smaller, regional campaigns, Bizzingo may proceed without explicit approval, provided they adhere to generally accepted marketing practices.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that ALL uses of 'Property' require advance approval by Theismann. The modified version introduces an exception for regional campaigns under a certain budget, creating a conflict. This raises questions about when approval is required, potentially leading to disputes over Bizzingo's right to use Theismann's Property without consent.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the royalty statement must be in a form acceptable to Theismann, giving him control over the format and content of the statement. The altered text states it needs to be in a form acceptable to Bizzingo. This creates a direct conflict in who has authority in determining the format, leading to potential disputes.",

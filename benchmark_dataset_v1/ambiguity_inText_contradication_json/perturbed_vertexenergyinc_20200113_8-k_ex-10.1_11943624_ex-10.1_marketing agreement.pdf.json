                "original_text": "“Business Day” means any day except a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal Reserve Bank holiday. A Business Day shall open at 8:00a.m. and close at 5:00p.m. Houston, Texas, time.",
                "changed_text": "“Business Day” means any day except a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal Reserve Bank holiday.\n\nLater in this document, the definition of Business Day means any day except Saturday and Sunday. This definition supersedes the previous definition.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Business Day' is contradicted by stating that it will be redefined later in the document and subsequently redefining it without referencing Federal Reserve Bank holidays. This could lead to disputes regarding deadlines and payment schedules, as one definition includes Federal Reserve Bank holidays and the other does not.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Area' is changed such that the immediately adjacent area needs explicit approval, not just agreement. This contradicts the first definition, and the introduction of the fact it can change gives rise to ambiguity.",

Payment shall be made within 5 business days when the invoiced amount exceeds $[****].",
                "explanation": "The definition of payment terms introduces an exception for a specific amount. This creates ambiguity because it doesn't specify if the 5-day term applies to all invoices exceeding that amount or just some. It is unclear under what circumstances the 5 business day rule applies.",

                "explanation": "Original text clearly states the licensee *shall* develop 'one' 2D puzzle game. The modified text states the licensee *shall endeavor* to develop 'one or more' 2D puzzle games. This creates ambiguity about the mandatory nature of the development, and the exact number of games to be delivered, potentially altering the contractual obligations.",

Licensee shall have the non-exclusive right and license to develop and distribute ICE AGE 2 Wireless Products during the Term of the Agreement for all Wireless Products set forth in this Paragraph 2(c) except the Game, for which Licensee shall have the exclusive right and license to develop and distribute until December 31, 2006.",
                "changed_text": "(i) “ICE AGE 2” WIRELESS PRODUCTS: Licensee shall consider developing and distributing the following Wireless Products in connection with the property “ICE AGE 2”: (i) Possibly a Java Game; (ii) A Java Application (‘Screensaver’) if easily achieved; (iii) Potentially up to 5 MMS; (iv) Maybe up to 10 Wallpapers; (v) And perhaps up to 5 Voicetones (“ICE AGE 2 Wireless Products”) in some of the following five (5) languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, with Portuguese, Greek, Dutch and Swedish to be considered. Licensee shall have the non-exclusive right and license to develop and distribute ICE AGE 2 Wireless Products during the Term of the Agreement for all Wireless Products set forth in this Paragraph 2(c) except the Game, for which Licensee shall have the exclusive right and license to develop and distribute until December 31, 2006.",
                "explanation": "The original text is quite specific about the products *shall* be developed and the number of items. The changes introduce uncertainty by using words like 'consider', 'possibly', 'potentially', 'maybe', and 'perhaps', which replace the firm commitment to develop specific wireless products. This creates a contradiction within the contract, particularly if other sections rely on the assumption that these products will be delivered as previously 'required'.",

                "explanation": "The original text firmly states Fox *reserves the right* to distribute and *shall retain* a Distribution Fee. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that Fox 'may consider' distribution and 'might retain' a Fee, which is 'possibly' as defined. This weakens Fox's rights and introduces ambiguity. This can be problematic if other sections of the contract rely on Fox's right to distribution, or assume Fox's distribution fee to calculate payment structures.",

                "changed_text": "1.10\n“Control” or “Controlled” shall mean possession of more than sixty percent (60%) of the share capital of a corporation or other\nbusiness entity, and/or the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a corporation or other entity\nwhether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "This changes the definition of 'Control' from 'more than fifty percent' to 'more than sixty percent'. This creates a contradiction, impacting sections dealing with 'Change of Control' and affiliate relationships, leading to uncertainty about when control is actually established and what the threshold is for triggering certain contractual obligations.",

In the event that a defect is not apparent upon visual inspection during the shelf\nlife of the Product (“Hidden Defect”), Kitov shall use commercially reasonably best efforts to provide Dexcel with written\nnotification within thirty (30) Working Days of discovering the same, to be accompanied by samples of any such allegedly\ndefective Product, if such samples are available In the event of any failure by Kitov to provide Dexcel with written\nnotification of any such shortfall, Apparent Defect or Hidden Defect within the respective aforementioned periods, it shall\nbe deemed as Kitov having accepted the relevant consignment.",

In the event that a defect is not apparent upon visual inspection during the shelf\nlife of the Product (“Hidden Defect”), Kitov shall use commercially reasonably best efforts to provide Dexcel with written\nnotification within sixty (60) Working Days of discovering the same, to be accompanied by samples of any such allegedly\ndefective Product, if such samples are available In the event of any failure by Kitov to provide Dexcel with written\nnotification of any such shortfall, Apparent Defect or Hidden Defect within the respective aforementioned periods, it shall\nbe deemed as Kitov having accepted the relevant consignment.",
                "explanation": "The notification period for 'Apparent Defects' is shortened from 30 Working Days to 15, while the notification period for 'Hidden Defects' is extended from 30 Working Days to 60. This creates inconsistency and uncertainty. If a defect is arguably both 'Apparent' and 'Hidden,' it's unclear which notification period applies, potentially leading to disputes over whether Kitov has properly notified Dexcel and whether the consignment is deemed accepted.",

                "explanation": "The original text contains '****' where the notification period should be specified. The modified text inserts 'ninety (90) days', a seemingly reasonable value. However, if another section of the contract (or a related document referenced by the contract) specifies a different notice period (e.g., 180 days) or a different event triggering the notice period (e.g. notice of a change of control), there will be a conflict regarding the proper procedure for non-renewal, leading to a dispute on the valid termination of the contract.",

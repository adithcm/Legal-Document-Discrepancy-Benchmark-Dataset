                "explanation": "The original text allows Bank of America to terminate the schedule and receive a full refund if the price increases at any time. The modified text restricts this right, allowing termination and refund only if the price increase is greater than 10%. This creates a contradiction regarding the conditions under which Bank of America can terminate the Schedule and receive a refund.",

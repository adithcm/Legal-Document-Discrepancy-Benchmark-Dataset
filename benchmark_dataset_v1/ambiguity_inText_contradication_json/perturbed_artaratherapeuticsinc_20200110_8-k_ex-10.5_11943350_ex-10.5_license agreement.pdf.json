                "original_text": "1.2\n“CRO” means a contract research organization selected by ArTara to assist in the Project as approved by the University and/or Principal\nInvestigator, such approval not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld.\n\n1.16\n“Project Documentation” shall mean the documentation created and generated by ArTara and CRO in the conduct of the Project that\nincorporates or is based upon Program Data.",
                "changed_text": "1.2\n“CRO” means a contract research organization unilaterally selected by ArTara to assist in the Project. The University's and/or Principal Investigator's approval is optional and advisory only.\n\n1.16\n“Project Documentation” shall mean the documentation created and generated solely by ArTara in the conduct of the Project that incorporates or is based upon Program Data. The CRO's contributions are limited to data entry and have no bearing on the content of the documentation.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of 'CRO' now implies ArTara can select a CRO without needing the University's or Principal Investigator's real consent. The change to 'Project Documentation' excludes the CRO, creating confusion about who is responsible for it. This conflict undermines collaborative research.",

During the term of this Agreement and for a period of seven (7) years after its termination or expiration each Party (the\n“Receiving Party”) shall maintain in confidence and, except as authorized by this Agreement, not use any know-how, data, processes, techniques,\nformulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the “Disclosing Party”) and which for any of the foregoing, if written, is\nmarked “Confidential” by the Disclosing Party or, if verbal or visual, is identified in writing as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure and reduced\nto writing by the Disclosing Party within thirty (30) days of the verbal or visual disclosure (“Confidential Information”).",
                "changed_text": "4.2\nLicense. University hereby grants to ArTara a non-exclusive license to use the Program Data solely for internal research purposes only. Use of Program Data in Regulatory Filings requires a separate written agreement.\n\n5.1 Confidentiality. During the term of this Agreement and perpetually thereafter, each Party (the “Receiving Party”) shall maintain in strictest confidence and, except as authorized by this Agreement, not use any know-how, data, processes, techniques, formulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the “Disclosing Party”) and which for any of the foregoing, if written, is marked “Confidential” by the Disclosing Party or, if verbal or visual, is identified in writing as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure and reduced to writing by the Disclosing Party within thirty (30) days of the verbal or visual disclosure (“Confidential Information”). This includes but is not limited to all Program Data and Project Documentation, regardless of whether it is explicitly marked 'Confidential'.",
                "explanation": "The license granted in 4.2 is changed from exclusive to non-exclusive and use for regulatory filings is restricted, whereas it was previously allowed. Meanwhile, the confidentiality clause in 5.1 has been changed to 'perpetually' and expanded so that it includes program data and project documentation even if unmarked. These two changes directly contradict each other, causing confusion over what can be done with the Program Data and for how long it is confidential.",

Termination of the Project for any reason shall not relieve any Party of any obligation that accrued under this Agreement prior to\ntermination.

Termination of the Project for any reason shall relieve all parties of all accrued obligations under this agreement, prior to\ntermination. No provisions of this agreement survive termination, with immediate effect.",
                "explanation": "Section 8.2 originally states that upon termination by ArTara, they are obligated to reassign the IND (investigational new drug application) back to the University, but it is revised to state that ArTara retains all rights to the data. This conflicts with the subsequent alteration of Section 8.3, removing the previously outlined surviving clauses. The original agreement dictated the sections which survived termination, where these sections do not survive, the termination conflicts with requirements after the original termination.",

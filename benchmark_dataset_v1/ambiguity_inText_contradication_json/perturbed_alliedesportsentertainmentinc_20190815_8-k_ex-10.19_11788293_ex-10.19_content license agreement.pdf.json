Neither party shall have the right to obligate or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever, and nothing herein contained shall give, or is intended to give, any rights of any kind to any third persons.",
                "changed_text": "The parties are independent contractors with respect to each other; however, WPT is authorized to act as Zynga's agent for specific marketing activities as outlined in Exhibit A. Neither party shall have the right to obligate or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever, except as expressly provided for in Exhibit A, and nothing herein contained shall give, or is intended to give, any rights of any kind to any third persons.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original text states that no agency relationship exists, while the modified text implies a limited agency relationship for marketing activities. This creates uncertainty about the extent to which WPT can act on behalf of Zynga.",

This Agreement shall automatically extend for an additional two (2) years on the same terms herein (“Renewal Term”) provided WPT receives payments greater than twelve million U.S. dollars ($12,000,000) within the Initial Term. The Initial Term and any such Renewal Term are collectively referred to as the “Term.”",

This Agreement may extend for an additional two (2) years (“Renewal Term”) based on mutual agreement between both parties. The Initial Term and any such Renewal Term are collectively referred to as the “Term.”",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the Renewal Term. Originally, the agreement automatically extends if WPT receives $12 million. Now, it's subject to 'mutual agreement,' creating uncertainty, even if WPT receives the payments, because Zynga could simply not agree to renew. This contradicts the original automatic renewal condition.",

Zynga shall not be required to pay the Royalty to the extent offset by the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments previously paid to WPT during the Term.

Zynga will pay to WPT ten percent (10%) of the cumulative Net Revenue (as defined in Section 3.b. of the Additional Provisions) (“Royalty”) from the WPT-branded Zynga Poker Tournament Mode or other such use of the WPT brand on the Zynga platform. Zynga's obligation to pay the Royalty is contingent on WPT fulfilling certain marketing obligations, as detailed in a separate agreement to be provided at a later date. Zynga shall not be required to pay the Royalty to the extent offset by the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments previously paid to WPT during the Term. Conversely, Zynga shall not be required to make Annual Minimum Guarantee payments to the extent offset by the Royalty previously paid to WPT during the Term.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the condition for royalty payments. The original states a clear percentage, but the modified version introduces a contingency based on 'certain marketing obligations' detailed in a future agreement. This creates uncertainty because the criteria for those obligations aren't defined, potentially allowing Zynga to avoid royalty payments based on subjective interpretations of WPT's marketing performance.",

Any modifications to the foregoing that may\nbe created during the term of this Agreement are excluded.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Brand Features' is broad, encompassing trademarks, trade names, and distinct brand elements protected under U.S. copyright law or established trademark rights. The modified definition introduces a contradiction by limiting 'Brand Features' to only actively used and displayed registered trademarks and copyrighted logos on the main website, explicitly excluding any modifications made during the agreement's term. This contradiction could lead to disputes over which elements qualify as 'Brand Features' and are therefore subject to the agreement's branding provisions, especially if a party uses unregistered trademarks or modifies their brand elements during the term.",

Any verbal agreement or email correspondence regarding potential updates shall not be legally binding.",
                "explanation": "The original definition allows for the Specifications (Exhibit D) to be updated from time to time during the agreement's term. The modified definition contradicts this by stating that the Specifications are fixed and not subject to updates unless through a formal written amendment. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes about whether changes to the Manifest's functionality or technical requirements are permissible without a formal amendment, even if updates are discussed or implemented informally.",

The Company will make Updates to the\nService in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Specifications at\nno charge for the initial year of this Agreement.

                "explanation": "The original text says updates will be at no charge for the entire term. The modification contradicts this in the first sentence by stating that updates are free only for the first year, and beyond that require a separate fee schedule. It also says that additional Intellectual Property Rights that are made available without development charge to other customers of the Company, the Company will also make such Intellectual Property Rights available to MBE at market rate charge, not free. This introduces uncertainty and opens the door to potential disagreements over the cost of maintaining and improving the Service, thereby creating Ambiguities.",

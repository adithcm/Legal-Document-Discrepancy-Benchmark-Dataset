Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, words with initial capitalized letters shall have the meanings assigned to such\nwords in this Section 1:\n(a) “Applicable Laws and Regulations” shall mean any law, statute, rule, regulation, ordinance or other non-binding guidance\nof any duly authorized court, tribunal, arbitrator, agency, commission, official or other instrumentality of any federal, state, province, county, city or\nother political subdivision (domestic or foreign) having the effect of law in the United States, any foreign country or territory or any domestic or\nforeign state, province, county, city or other political subdivision applicable to the Company or its business.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'binding pronouncements' to 'non-binding guidance', the scope of what constitutes 'Applicable Laws and Regulations' becomes unclear. This introduces ambiguity, as it is not definitively stated whether the Company is obligated to follow such guidance.",

                "explanation": "Changing the definition of 'Reed's Intellectual Property' to include 'any input or ingredient ever used by Reed's in their commercial products' drastically broadens the scope of their ownership. This creates a conflict with the intended purpose of the agreement, where Company is contributing recipes and Deliverables, potentially infringing on Reed's now broadly defined IP. Additionally, Specifications are now considered 'initial draft', implying that they may not be the final say which goes against the intent.",

                "explanation": "This modifies the confidentiality clause to allow a Receiving Party to disclose Confidential Information to third parties if it deems it necessary for its business purposes, effectively negating the original intent of confidentiality and creating a large loophole that can lead to legal challenges.",

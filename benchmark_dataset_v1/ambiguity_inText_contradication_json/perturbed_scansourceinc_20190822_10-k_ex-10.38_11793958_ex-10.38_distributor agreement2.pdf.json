                "original_text": "Customer's license to use the Software shall be limited to, and Customer shall not use the Software in excess of, a single hardware chassis or card or that number of agent(s), concurrent users, sessions, IP addresses, port(s), seat(s), server(s) or site(s), as set forth in the applicable Purchase Order which has been accepted by Cisco and for which Customer has paid to Cisco the required license fee.",
                "changed_text": "Customer's license to use the Software shall be limited to a single hardware chassis or card. The number of agent(s), concurrent users, sessions, IP addresses, port(s), seat(s), server(s) or site(s) may exceed that set forth in the applicable Purchase Order even if it has been accepted by Cisco and the customer has paid to Cisco the required license fee.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by stating that while the software is licensed to a single chassis or card, other licensing metrics are not strictly limited to the quantities specified in the purchase order. It contradicts the preceding statement that limits the license based on quantities in the Purchase Order, creating uncertainty on the allowed usage limits.",

                "changed_text": "Cisco warrants that commencing from the date of shipment to Customer (but in case of resale by an authorized Cisco reseller, commencing not more than ninety (90) days after original shipment by Cisco), the Software substantially conforms to its published specifications. However, this warranty is valid for only thirty (30) days, regardless of any longer period defined in the warranty card accompanying the product.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the initial warranty period. The original text defines the warranty period as the *longer* of ninety days or the period on the warranty card. The modified text specifies a *fixed* 30-day warranty, overriding the potentially longer period in the warranty card. This creates a direct conflict and uncertainty about the actual warranty duration.",

The foregoing limitations shall apply even if the above​ stated warranty fails of its essential purpose.",

However, in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct by Cisco, this limitation shall not apply, and liability will be determined based on applicable laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a clause that removes the liability cap in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This contradicts the initial statement that *always* limits liability to the purchase price of the software, creating ambiguity regarding the maximum liability amount in specific circumstances. It creates a potential legal dispute.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Gross Revenues' includes income from various sources. The modified definition restricts it to only fees for access and use of the Licensee Site. This creates ambiguity about whether to calculate Royalties on all revenues or just a portion.",

Licensee shall not use, register or attempt to register in any jurisdiction any Mark that is confusingly similar to or incorporates any of the Licensor's Marks.

Licensee shall not use, register or attempt to register in any jurisdiction any Mark that is identical to the Licensor's Marks.

The modified clause eliminates the materiality requirement, applies a uniform cure period to all breaches, and removes the expedited cure for payment defaults, creating conflict and uncertainty.",

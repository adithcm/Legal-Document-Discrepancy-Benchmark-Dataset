                "explanation": "The original definition grants 'exclusive distribution opportunities' in other states, implying a guaranteed chance, whereas the modified version introduces uncertainty by making it subject to Company approval on a 'case-by-case basis'.",

Information disclosed orally will not be considered Confidential Information unless summarized in writing and designated as such within thirty (30) days of the oral disclosure. Confidential Information excludes information publicly available or independently developed by the Distributor.",
                "explanation": "The original definition is broad, covering all proprietary information 'designated as confidential or proprietary,' regardless of form. The modified definition narrows this scope, requiring explicit written designation and excluding certain types of information, creating a contradiction and making it unclear which information is truly protected.",

All such arbitration proceedings shall be administered by the AAA and held in Dallas, Texas. The parties agree that the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding as to each of them. The AAA administrative fee shall be advanced by the party initiating the proceeding, but shall be subject to final apportionment by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's fee shall be shared equally by the parties. The arbitrator's award may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Prior to invoking arbitration, the parties will make a reasonable effort to settle any dispute in an informal and expeditious manner. The parties separately and specially agree that if either shall contend that this Agreement is invalid or that grounds exist for its rescission or cancellation, that any dispute concerning such contention shall be submitted to arbitration in the manner provided in this section. Each party shall bear such party's own attorneys' fees in any arbitration proceeding; however, if either party commences an action in court to compel arbitration, enforce an arbitration award, or otherwise seek by judicial means to secure compliance with the arbitration provisions of this Agreement, then the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing party the prevailing party's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit incurred for such purpose.",
                "changed_text": "Any dispute arising over the terms and conditions of this Agreement or in any manner relating to this Agreement which the parties are unable to resolve informally between themselves or by mediation shall be submitted, upon the motion of either party, to arbitration under the appropriate rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). All such arbitration proceedings shall be administered by the AAA and held in Dallas, Texas, or at a location mutually agreed upon by both parties. The parties agree that the decision of the arbitrator shall be considered as advisory, but not final or binding. The AAA administrative fee shall be advanced by the party initiating the proceeding, but shall be subject to final apportionment by the arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties. The arbitrator's fee shall be subject to negotiation between the parties. The arbitrator's award may be challenged in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Prior to invoking arbitration, the parties are encouraged, but not required, to make a reasonable effort to settle any dispute in an informal and expeditious manner. The parties separately and specially agree that if either shall contend that this Agreement is invalid or that grounds exist for its rescission or cancellation, such contention may be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear such party's own attorneys' fees in any arbitration proceeding, unless the arbitrator determines that one party acted in bad faith, in which case the arbitrator may award attorneys' fees to the prevailing party.",
                "explanation": "The original section states that the arbitrator's decision is 'final and binding' and that disputes concerning the agreement's validity will be submitted to arbitration. The revised version contradicts this by stating that the arbitrator's decision is 'advisory, but not final or binding,' that the award 'may be challenged in any court', and that such validity 'may be litigated in a court.' This creates significant uncertainty about the enforceability of arbitration.",

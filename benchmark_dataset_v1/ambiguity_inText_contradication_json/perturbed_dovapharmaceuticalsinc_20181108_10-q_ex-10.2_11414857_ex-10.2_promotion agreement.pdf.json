The modified text grants Valeant 'exclusive' rights and states that Dova can promote a competing product creating an in-text contradiction about the exclusivity of the arrangement.  It is unclear whether Dova can also promote the Product itself.",

                "explanation": "The original definition lists the sole remedies for not maintaining the minimum number of sales reps to be 'adjustment to the promotion fee' and 'termination right'. The modified definition changes one of the remedies, a fine for Valeant, to a previously unmentioned financial penalty, and making the previously agreed remedy not sole anymore. There is no other section or article indicating this fine that creates a contradiction that makes the contract harder to enforce.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall, and shall cause any of its Affiliates or third parties providing or receiving Services (as the case may be) to, follow the reasonable policies, procedures and practices of the other Party and its Affiliates applicable to the Services that are known or made known to such Party. A failure of a Recipient to act in accordance with this Section 3.2 that prevents a Provider from providing a Service hereunder shall, upon reasonable advance written notice to the Recipient (where practicable), relieves Provider of its obligations under the Service until such time as the failure has been cured.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall endeavor to cause any of its Affiliates or third parties providing or receiving Services (as the case may be) to, follow the reasonable policies, procedures and practices of the other Party and its Affiliates applicable to the Services that are known or made known to such Party. A failure of a Recipient to act in accordance with this Section 3.2 that prevents a Provider from providing a Service hereunder may, at the Provider's discretion, relieve Provider of its obligations under the Service until such time as the failure has been cured, subject to good faith negotiations.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates adherence to policies, while the modified text uses 'endeavor to cause,' making compliance discretionary. Additionally, the original text clearly states that the Provider will be relieved of its obligations with advance notice, but the modified version states that the Provider 'may' be relieved of its obligations 'at the Provider's discretion', creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

Subject to Section 3.1(c), internal controls of Provider and its Affiliates with respect to the Service Standard shall remain materially the same in effect throughout the term of this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party and their Affiliates are not professional service providers of the Services.",
                "changed_text": "Provider shall attempt to perform the Services (i) at a level of quality similar to that at which such Services were performed or enjoyed during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof and (ii) in general accordance with applicable Law (collectively, (i) and (ii), the “Service Standard”). Subject to Section 3.1(c), internal controls of Provider and its Affiliates with respect to the Service Standard should generally remain the same in effect throughout the term of this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party and their Affiliates are not professional service providers of the Services.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the required level of performance. 'Shall perform at a level of quality substantially similar in all material respects' is replaced with 'attempt to perform at a level of quality similar to' making the performance standard less stringent. The phrase 'in accordance with applicable Law' is changed to 'in general accordance with applicable Law'. Finally, the phrase 'shall remain materially the same' is softened to 'should generally remain the same'. These changes weaken the obligations of the service provider and introduce potential ambiguity and conflict with other clauses requiring strict adherence to standards.",

                "original_text": "Recipient shall pay Provider (i) the fee for each Service set forth on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, (ii) Providers’ and their Affiliates’ reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing the Services, including the third-party fees and expenses that are charged to Recipient or their Affiliates in connection with provision of the Services (including any fees and expenses charged by subcontractors permitted to provide the Services under Section 2.2) but excluding payments made to employees of Provider or any of their Affiliates pursuant to Section 5.2, and (iii) any other fees as agreed to by the Parties in writing (collectively, the “Fees”).",
                "changed_text": "Recipient will generally pay Provider (i) the fee for each Service set forth on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, (ii) Providers’ and their Affiliates’ out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing the Services, including the third-party fees and expenses that are charged to Recipient or their Affiliates in connection with provision of the Services (including any fees and expenses charged by subcontractors permitted to provide the Services under Section 2.2) but excluding payments made to employees of Provider or any of their Affiliates pursuant to Section 5.2, and (iii) any other fees as potentially agreed to by the Parties in writing (collectively, the “Fees”).",
                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty around payment obligations. By changing 'shall pay' to 'will generally pay', the obligation to pay fees becomes less definitive. The removal of 'reasonable and documented' before 'out-of-pocket expenses' gives the provider much more discretion over what expenses are billed. Changing 'any other fees as agreed to by the Parties in writing' to 'any other fees as potentially agreed to by the Parties in writing' makes it unclear whether these fees are actually agreed upon or just under discussion, creating room for disputes.",

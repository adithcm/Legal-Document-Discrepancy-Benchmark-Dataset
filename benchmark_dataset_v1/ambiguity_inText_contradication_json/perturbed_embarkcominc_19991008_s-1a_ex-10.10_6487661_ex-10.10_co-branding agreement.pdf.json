This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and shall continue for an initial term of five (5) years (the “Initial Term”), unless sooner terminated as provided herein. Thereafter, this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive one (1) year terms (each a “Renewal Term”), unless either party gives written notice of termination at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon thirty (30) days written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof.",

This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and shall continue for an initial term of five (5) years (the “Initial Term”), unless sooner terminated as provided herein. Thereafter, this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive one (1) year terms (each a “Renewal Term”), unless either party gives written notice of termination at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the termination notice period for material breach. Initially, it was 'thirty (30)' days, but it has been changed to 'sixty (60)' days. This creates uncertainty about the actual notice period required, leading to disputes during termination.",

The Receiving Party agrees to take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "This change modifies the duration of the confidentiality obligation. Initially, it was 'three (3)' years, but now it is 'one (1)' year post-termination. This introduces a contradiction, as other sections of the contract may refer to a three-year confidentiality period, leading to disputes about what information remains confidential after the agreement ends. Also, the obligations mentioned in other articles could assume a longer post-term protection.",

                "explanation": "This change alters the governing law of the agreement from 'Delaware' to 'New York.' This directly contradicts the initial choice of law and creates a significant ambiguity. This conflict will be crucial in legal disputes, as the applicable state law determines the interpretation and enforcement of the contract.",

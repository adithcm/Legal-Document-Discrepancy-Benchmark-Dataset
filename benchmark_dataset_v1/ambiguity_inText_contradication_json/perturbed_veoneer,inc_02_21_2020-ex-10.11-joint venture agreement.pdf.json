                "original_text": "a.As of the VNBJ Closing, except as expressly set forth in this Amendment, the JV Agreement shall immediately cease to have any application or effect with respect to VNBJ, all rights and obligations with respect to VNBJ under the JV Agreement shall terminate and all references to “Company” or “Companies” in the JV Agreement (either in the body of the JV Agreement or its schedules and other attachments) shall read and be interpreted to mean VNBZ and/or ANRA except as the context otherwise requires.",
                "changed_text": "a. As of the VNBJ Closing, the JV Agreement shall immediately cease to have any application or effect with respect to VNBJ. However, certain operational clauses, specifically those relating to intellectual property outlined in Schedule B, will remain in effect for a period of one year post-closing. All other rights and obligations with respect to VNBJ under the JV Agreement shall terminate and all references to “Company” or “Companies” in the JV Agreement (either in the body of the JV Agreement or its schedules and other attachments) shall read and be interpreted to mean VNBZ and/or ANRA except as the context otherwise requires.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an exception to the termination of the JV Agreement with respect to VNBJ, stating that intellectual property clauses in Schedule B remain in effect for one year. This contradicts the earlier statement that the JV Agreement 'shall immediately cease to have any application or effect'. This creates uncertainty about the extent to which the original agreement is terminated.",

                "changed_text": "d. Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the termination of the JV Agreement with respect to VNBJ, VNBZ or the Veoneer Parties shall not release any Veoneer Party or any Nissin Party from liability for the breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the JV Agreement that arise prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable, *except* for breaches of covenants related to operational matters which will be subject to a good faith negotiation between the parties for a period not exceeding 60 days.",
                "explanation": "This modification adds an exception to the non-release of liability for breaches. While the original text states that all prior breaches remain actionable, the added clause specifies that breaches of covenants related to operational matters will be subject to negotiation. This is a contradiction, as it implies that certain breaches *can* be released or modified through negotiation, creating ambiguity regarding the extent of continued liability.",

                "original_text": "This Amendment shall only become effective upon the VNBJ Closing with respect to Article 1.1 and the VNBZ Closing with respect to Article 1.2, and shall terminate without any force or effect in the event that the VNBJ SPA and the VNBZ SPA are terminated in accordance with the terms thereof.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall only become effective upon the VNBJ Closing with respect to Article 1.1 and the VNBZ Closing with respect to Article 1.2, and shall terminate without any force or effect in the event that the VNBJ SPA and the VNBZ SPA are terminated in accordance with the terms thereof. *However*, should either the VNBJ SPA or the VNBZ SPA be terminated due to a material breach by Veoneer AB, Article 2 regarding D&O Indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of the termination of this Amendment.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the entire amendment terminates if the VNBJ or VNBZ SPA are terminated. The added clause states that Article 2 (D&O Indemnity) will *still* be in effect if termination is due to Veoneer AB's breach. This is a direct contradiction because it means that even if the overarching agreement is considered terminated according to the initial condition, a specific clause within it persists. This creates confusion about the true extent of the termination and the continuing obligations of the parties.",

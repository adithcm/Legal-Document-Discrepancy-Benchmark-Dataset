                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding maintenance costs. Initially, maintenance is stated to be free. The modification suggests that maintenance may incur costs based on a separate agreement. This could lead to disputes over whether maintenance is actually free or subject to additional charges.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the Maintenance Period includes Bank of America holidays without exception. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating that the Maintenance Period generally includes holidays but can exclude them unless explicitly agreed upon. This creates confusion about whether maintenance support is guaranteed during holidays, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines the acceptance period as 120 days. The modified text indicates that the acceptance period is subject to determination and only initially estimated as 120 days. This creates ambiguity in the duration of the acceptance period.",

                "original_text": "(b) Products. As used in this Agreement, “Products” shall mean dietary supplements manufactured within the fifty states of the United States of America; provided, however, MusclePharm shall not produce during the Term (and any renewal Term, if any) any diet pills and/or sexual enhancement products; provided, further, that fat burning products, Shred Matrix and Live Shredded products and products that increase testosterone levels currently produced by MusclePharm as of the date hereof shall be part of the definition of Products for the purpose of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Products. As used in this Agreement, “Products” shall mean dietary supplements manufactured within the fifty states of the United States of America and internationally. MusclePharm shall reserve the right to produce during the Term (and any renewal Term, if any) any diet pills and/or sexual enhancement products should market conditions deem favorable; provided, further, that fat burning products, Shred Matrix and Live Shredded products and products that increase testosterone levels currently produced by MusclePharm as of the date hereof shall be excluded from the definition of Products for the purpose of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Products' excludes the possibility of international manufacturing and restricts production of certain items. The modified version directly contradicts this by allowing international manufacturing and reserving the right to produce previously restricted items based on market conditions. Additionally, it excludes the existing fat burning and testosterone products whereas previously they were included.",

Sales and Marketing Plan And AS Product Line and Trademarks: (a) MusclePharm shall utilize its commercially reasonable efforts to advertise and promote the Licensed Products at its own expense and to sell the Licensed Products through the Distribution Channels worldwide as contemplated herein during the Term and to promote both the goodwill of the Endorser and the market reputation of the Licensed Products. MusclePharm will conduct its activities relating to the marketing of the Licensed Products in a professional manner. In that connection:",

Sales and Marketing Plan And AS Product Line and Trademarks: (a) MusclePharm may, at its discretion, advertise and promote the Licensed Products, resources permitting, and may sell the Licensed Products through any distribution channels it deems appropriate during the Term. Promotion of the Endorser's goodwill and the market reputation of the Licensed Products is optional. MusclePharm will determine the nature and extent of marketing activities. In that connection:",
                "explanation": "The original text states that MusclePharm 'shall utilize its commercially reasonable efforts,' creating an obligation. The modified text makes advertising, promotion, and distribution channels discretionary ('may, at its discretion'), directly contradicting the mandatory language. This creates uncertainty about the extent of MusclePharm's marketing commitment and the distribution strategy.",

Insurance: MusclePharm shall, throughout the Term of the Agreement and for a period of not less than four years thereafter, obtain and maintain at its own cost and expense from a qualified insurance company licensed to do business in California and New York, a commercial general liability insurance policy including coverage for contractual liability (applying to the terms and conditions of this agreement), product liability, personal injury liability, and advertiser's liability, in a form approved by the AS Parties, in the amount of at least Five Million Dollars (US$5,000,000) per occurrence naming the AS Parties (for the avoidance of doubt, specifically including each of Lender, Endorser, and Fitness) as additional named insureds.",
                "changed_text": "27. Insurance: MusclePharm is encouraged to obtain and maintain liability insurance throughout the Term of this Agreement, should funds be available. The type and amount of insurance are left to MusclePharm's discretion, and the AS Parties may or may not be named as additional insureds. MusclePharm will evaluate the necessity of obtaining and maintaining insurance. Any certificates of insurance are not required.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates specific insurance coverage with a minimum amount and requires the AS Parties to be named as additional insureds. The modified clause makes obtaining insurance optional, removes the specified coverage amount, and gives MusclePharm discretion over the terms and whether the AS Parties are included. This is a direct contradiction, significantly reducing the protection for the AS Parties.",

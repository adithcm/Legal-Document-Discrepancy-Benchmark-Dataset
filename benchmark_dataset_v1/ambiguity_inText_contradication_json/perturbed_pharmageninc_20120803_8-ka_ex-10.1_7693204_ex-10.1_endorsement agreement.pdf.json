                "explanation": "The original clause prohibits endorsing any multivitamin. The modified clause narrows the restriction to only competing multivitamin product lines. This creates a contradiction because it is unclear whether the celebrity can endorse a multivitamin that doesn't directly compete with Clotamin.",

HDS shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Celebrity in\nthe event Celebrity fails to perform the duties set forth in Paragraph 4 hereof or breaches any other\ncovenant or agreement set forth herein. Such termination shall relieve HDS of its obligation to provide any further consideration pursuant to this Agreement, unless the breach was related to Paragraph 4, in which case HDS remains obligated to pay a pro-rata amount of the Cash Payment described in section 5.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that HDS is relieved of all further consideration upon termination due to Celebrity's breach. The modified clause introduces an exception where HDS remains obligated for a pro-rata payment if the breach relates to the duties in Paragraph 4. This creates a contradiction because it's unclear whether HDS is entirely relieved of financial obligation or only partially, depending on the nature of the breach.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates Celebrity be named as additional insured on A, B, and C. The changed text states that celebrity is named only on A and B. Then the very next sentence says that celebrity is afforded waiver of subrogation on coverages A, B and C.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company hereby grants to MA the right to advertise, market and sell to corporate users, government agencies and educational facilities (“Clients”) for any purpose, including remarketing and redistribution, for use in a data center environment for multiple users Clients, without requiring further approval by Company, the Technology listed in Schedule A of this Agreement, and to sell and/or bundle Technology Maintenance for the Technology and to provide first line technical support and implementation services for the Technology in the territories listed in Schedule A of this Agreement, providing MA meets the criteria required for delivering services according to Schedule A.",
                "explanation": "The original text restricts the definition of the purpose that the 'Clients' could use for the services. This restricts the use to 'their own internal language learning, soft skills and communication purposes only, and not for remarketing or redistribution'. The changed text removes such a condition, therefore conflicting with the original contract and allowing potential legal disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires MA to protect all intellectual property of the Company. The changed text introduces an exception that MA doesn't need to protect the company if it's something they independently develop, which introduces conflict with section 12.1 where it states that the technology is the exclusive property of the company. This allows MA to leverage the company's proprietary information.",

The changed text specifies 30-day notice for Technology and a 60-day notice to MA for any other fees. This creates a contradiction regarding notification periods, potentially leading to disputes.",

These manufacturing services shall include, but not be limited to, labor, materials, testing, packaging and delivery to Customer, all subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.",

These manufacturing services shall include, but not be limited to, labor, materials, testing, packaging and delivery to Customer, all subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition requires pre-approval of the Specifications by the Contractor. Removing 'pre approved by Contractor' creates a conflict. If later sections rely on the 'Specifications' being pre-approved, this change introduces ambiguity and allows the Customer to unilaterally define the specifications.",

Contractor further represents and warrants that the Product will consist of new materials.",

Contractor further represents and warrants that the Product will consist of new or refurbished materials.",
                "explanation": "This creates a conflict in the warranty. Previously, materials defects were only covered to the extent the original manufacturer warrants the Contractor, which limited liability. Furthermore, the Product needs to consist of new materials. Removing this clause and replacing it with 'new or refurbished materials' broadens the Contractor’s material liability and introduces potentially lower quality refurbished materials, conflicting with the higher original standards and creating uncertainty about the material quality under warranty.",

This lack of clarity introduces uncertainty and potential disagreement on what conditions the restriction will be waived.",

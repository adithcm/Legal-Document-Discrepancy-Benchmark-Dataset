                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be' to 'are estimated to be' introduces ambiguity regarding the fixed nature of the project fees. Additionally, changing 'completion' to 'substantial completion' adds another layer of uncertainty. The original text clearly defines payment milestones based on specific dates, implying strict adherence. The updated language now allows for subjective interpretation of what constitutes substantial completion, leading to disputes over payment triggers.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will' to 'may' and 'will' to 'attempt to' introduces uncertainty around whether the application is actually guaranteed to connect to the POS system and update the inventory. If the contract elsewhere assumes real-time inventory updates and bases features on it, there is now a clear ambiguity and contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will' to 'should' weakens the obligation for ID verification. Also, changing 'will be' to 'may be' questions when the transaction is truly completed, creating conflict.",

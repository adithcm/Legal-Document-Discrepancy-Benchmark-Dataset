                "changed_text": "Distributor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to market, promote and sell the Products to the authorized customers in the Filed of Use and in the Territory during the term of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'best efforts', implying a high standard of diligence. The modified text uses 'commercially reasonable efforts,' a lower standard, creating ambiguity about the required intensity of marketing efforts. If a later clause refers to Distributor having to put in their 'best efforts,' but commercially reasonable efforts is present, then the section will be internally conflicted.",

                "explanation": "The original requires a 'material' breach, and ten days to cure. The modified does not require a material breach and gives thirty days to cure. This conflicts with the original text, and creates ambiguity as to what constitutes a 'breach'.",

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to give Distributor any right, title or interest in any Trademark. The Trademarks include but are not limited to: the names “Erchonia”, “Erchonia Medical”, the phrase “Erchonia, Designs Into the Future”, the Erchonia logo, packaging design, and Product design.",

The modified text adds 'unless otherwise agreed upon in writing,' introducing uncertainty. In a subsequent clause, if Erchonia's trademarks are still said to be wholly owned by Erchonia, then it is directly conflicted by this earlier sentence.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict by initially stating a specific purpose (IT Development) but then opening the door to any legal business activity. This contradicts the explicitly stated exclusive purpose and makes it unclear which activities are actually permitted, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction. Originally, meetings were quarterly. Now, the frequency is uncertain, 'at least once per year, but no more than once per quarter' giving the managers discretion. Also the original text stated 'Minutes of the meetings will be maintained on file', but now they may be maintained, its no longer required, leaving the company open to legal challenges.",

Indemnification may not apply in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, at the Venture's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original states that harm or damages resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct will not be indemnified. This text modifies that by saying indemnification 'may not apply', giving the Venture discretion. It's unclear whether they will be indemnified or not.",

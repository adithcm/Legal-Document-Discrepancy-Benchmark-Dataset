            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Client agrees to pay to Company the sum of $5,000 (the “Contract Price”) to design and develop a website for Client (the “Client Website”) in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A.",
                "changed_text": "Client agrees to pay to Company an estimated sum of $5,000 (the “Contract Price”) to design and develop a website for Client (the “Client Website”). The final Contract Price will be determined upon project completion, accounting for any overages or underruns based on actual time spent, regardless of the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by suggesting the initial price of $5,000 is an estimate and may change based on actual time spent, contradicting the original text which frames it as a fixed price tied to the Scope of Work. If the Scope of Work has fixed deliverables, this becomes contradictory.",

                "changed_text": "Client shall make a prepayment of $1,900. The remaining $3,100 will be paid according to a payment schedule agreed upon after the prepayment is processed, which will be based on project milestones, not necessarily the completion of the Scope of Work.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the remaining balance is due upon completion of the Scope of Work. The modified text introduces ambiguity by suggesting a payment schedule based on project milestones, potentially before or after the Scope of Work is completed. This contradicts the original, creating uncertainty about when the final payment is due.",

                "original_text": "Company representatives are available during Company’s normal business hours which are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. UTC +2, Monday through Friday. Any email or telephone correspondence received after normal business hours will be processed the following business day.",
                "changed_text": "Company representatives are typically available during standard business hours. While Company strives to respond promptly, correspondence received outside core business hours might experience a delay of up to 72 hours depending on workload and staffing availability.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear and specific commitment to processing after-hours correspondence the following business day. The modified text uses weaker, less definite language ('typically available,' 'strives to respond,' 'might experience a delay'), removing the guarantee and introducing ambiguity about response times. This contradicts the original's definitive promise of next-day processing.",

USER shall mean a single person who accesses and views a Site whether\ndirectly from a web browser or through a Link.\n\n2.5 Impresse hereby grants to VerticalNet a non-exclusive,\nnon-transferable, royalty-free, right and license to link to the Impresse Area\nof the Co-Branded Site. Impresse shall permit Qualified Users who access the Co-Branded\nSite to access and use Co-Branded Content from the Co-Branded Site for the\npersonal use of such Users in accordance with the then-current terms of\nImpresse's standard license agreement governing the use of such Co-Branded\nContent. Qualified Users are defined as those who have previously purchased commercial printing services from Impresse.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'USER' is broad (anyone who views a site). The modified Section 2.5 introduces 'Qualified Users' but does not explicitly define them in the definitions section. Qualified Users are now those who have purchased services, creating uncertainty about the rights afforded to regular vs. qualified users and whether those who only view the website but didn't purchase anything still qualify as 'USER'",

                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to purchase' to '*may* agree to purchase' creates a contradiction because the beginning of the section states Impresse 'agrees to purchase' a total amount. This creates an ambiguity as to whether the quarterly purchase commitment is mandatory or optional.",

                "explanation": "The initial statement in section 6.5 sets a two-year limitation for claims. Adding 'more than one year' but then saying the limitation is 'extended to five years' for specific cases creates a contradiction. Which limitation applies and under what conditions is now ambiguous, leading to uncertainty.",

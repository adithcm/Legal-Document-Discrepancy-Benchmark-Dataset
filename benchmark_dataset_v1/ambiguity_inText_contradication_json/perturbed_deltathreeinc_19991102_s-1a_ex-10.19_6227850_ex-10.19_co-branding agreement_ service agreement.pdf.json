                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that PrimeCall's liability is limited to direct damages, but then specifies they are liable for damages resulting from gross negligence. This creates ambiguity as to whether gross negligence is included or excluded from the direct damages limitation.",

However, in the altered version of Section 3.04, that responsibility shifts to DeltaThree. If PrimeCall proceeds with those aspects of the Calling Card distribution, then they are no longer aligned with the legal language set forth in that section of the agreement.",

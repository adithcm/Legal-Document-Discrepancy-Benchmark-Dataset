                "changed_text": "“Service” means exclusively the Advertising Services, explicitly excluding the Video Display Program.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction because the original definition clearly includes the Video Display Program, while the modified definition explicitly excludes it. This affects all obligations and rights tied to the 'Service,' leading to confusion on what is covered by the agreement.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction. The original text specifies a 'non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, royalty-free limited license,' while the modified text grants an 'exclusive, transferable, sublicenseable, royalty-bearing unlimited license.' This directly clashes with the intended restrictions on the software usage.",

The passes shall be provided to NCM at least 30 days prior to the month in which such passes first become valid.",
                "changed_text": "Network Affiliate may provide to NCM during each month of the Term up to 5 complimentary Theatre passes that will expire within 30 days from the date of issuance. The provision of passes is subject to Network Affiliate’s discretion, and passes are given on a 'best efforts' basis. The passes shall be provided to NCM within 5 days prior to the month in which such passes first become valid.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting terms regarding the number, expiration, obligation, and timing of providing theater passes. The original text states 'shall provide 25', while the modified text says 'may provide up to 5', creating ambiguity about Network Affiliate's obligations and NCM's entitlements.",

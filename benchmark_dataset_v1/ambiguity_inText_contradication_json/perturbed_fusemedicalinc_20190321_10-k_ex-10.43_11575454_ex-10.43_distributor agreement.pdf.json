                "explanation": "This introduces conflicting definitions. 'Commencement Date' now requires a signed addendum, contradicting a simple 'date of agreement.' 'Control' is restricted to share ownership, conflicting with the original broader definition. 'Inactive Territories' now focuses on marketing, not just sales. 'Products' definition now excludes any future developed products. 'Trade Marks' cannot have any further or additional marks. These inconsistencies create uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "This introduces conflicting terms related to the Distributor's appointment. The addition to 2.1 stating that Supplier may appoint additional distributors creates ambiguity with the rest of the document that refers to the 'Distributor' and its rights. The added caveats to 2.4 (a), (c), (d) and (e), allowing for exceptions with written consent or guidelines, now contradicts the original intent of these sections, which aimed to prevent the distributor from acting on behalf of the Supplier without explicit prior authorization.",

                "explanation": "This introduces conflicting financial terms. The added clause to 5.1, that prices set out initially in Schedule 4 are subject to annual review and adjustment, contradicts the definitiveness of 'the Price, as set out in Schedule 4'. The clause added to 5.2 introduces reimbursement of marketing expenses dependent on sales targets, which conflicts with the initial strict liability of the Distributor for all expenses. 5.3 shortens the payment terms, contradicting initial agreement of 45 days, but then introduces exceptions. Finally 5.4 allows for withholding payments under agreed errors in invoicing. These inconsistencies create uncertainty.",

Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide immediate assistance to, and actively cooperate with, the other Party, to implement this Agreement.",

Each Party shall use its best efforts, but not necessarily immediate assistance, and strive to cooperate with the other Party, to implement this Agreement. If immediate assistance is not possible, a reasonable alternative solution will be considered.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the level and immediacy of assistance required from each party. The original text clearly states 'reasonable best efforts to provide immediate assistance', while the modified version softens this obligation by stating 'best efforts, but not necessarily immediate assistance' and introducing the concept of 'reasonable alternative solution'. This creates uncertainty about the expected level of commitment and responsiveness in implementing the agreement.",

The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (“Dispute Notice”) to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall each select one (1) arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. All language used in such proceedings shall be Mandarin Chinese. The Parties agree to keep the content of the dispute and the proceeding of the arbitration confidential. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney’s fees).",

The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (“Dispute Notice”) to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute.

All language used in such proceedings shall be Mandarin Chinese unless the intellectual property laws of PRC are invoked, in which case, English will be used.

The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties, except in matters of intellectual property. The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney’s fees), unless the dispute involves intellectual property.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the governing law for disputes. Initially, all disputes are governed by Taiwan law. However, the modified text specifies that disputes involving intellectual property are governed by PRC law. This creates confusion and potential legal battles over which jurisdiction's laws apply when intellectual property is involved, especially if the dispute touches upon multiple areas of the agreement. It also creates ambiguity regarding the finality of arbitration awards and the allocation of costs in intellectual property disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change creates ambiguity regarding what constitutes official notice. While the original text clearly states that written notices are to be delivered via registered mail, express delivery, or personal delivery, the modified text introduces email as acceptable for urgent matters, while still requiring registered mail for 'official notice'. This introduces uncertainty as it is unclear what defines an 'urgent matter' and when registered mail is absolutely required versus when email is sufficient. It also doesn't specify the legal weight of email communication, leading to potential disputes over whether information conveyed via email is legally binding.",

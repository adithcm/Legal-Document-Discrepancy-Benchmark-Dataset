                "original_text": "c) “FINANCIAL SERVICES” shall mean banking, lending, financial and wealth management products and services offered by Berkshire and insurance products and services offered by Berkshire’s affiliate Berkshire Insurance Group, Inc.",
                "changed_text": "c) “FINANCIAL SERVICES” shall mean banking and lending products and services offered directly by Berkshire. Wealth management and insurance products are explicitly excluded from this definition for the purposes of clauses referring to Auriemma's direct endorsements.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a narrower definition of 'Financial Services' in section 1(c) which creates a conflict with the broader definition in the original document, particularly concerning Auriemma's endorsement obligations for wealth management and insurance products.",

                "original_text": "b) Berkshire agrees that all use of the Auriemma Identification in connection with advertising, displays, and other materials and all advertising shall not be made unless and until finished samples of such proposed use have been provided to Auriemma and such use has been approved by Auriemma or Auriemma’s authorized representative. Auriemma agrees that any use of the Auriemma Identification submitted for approval as provided herein will be deemed to have been approved by Auriemma if the same is not disapproved in writing within ten (10) business days after receipt",
                "changed_text": "b) Berkshire agrees that all use of the Auriemma Identification in connection with national advertising campaigns requires Auriemma's explicit prior written approval. However, for local branch-level marketing initiatives, Auriemma's approval is only required for the initial concept; subsequent minor variations do not necessitate further approvals, and if no response is received within twenty (20) business days after receipt, it will be automatically approved.",
                "explanation": "This creates conflicting approval processes for use of the Auriemma Identification. The original text requires Auriemma’s approval for all uses. The modified text introduces a distinction between national campaigns (requiring explicit approval) and local initiatives (allowing for deemed approval after 20 days and waiving approval for 'minor variations'), which is not clearly defined and thus introduces ambiguity.",

Either Party shall have the right, without prejudice to any other rights it may have, to terminate this Agreement if the other Party materially breaches its obligation hereunder and such breach remains uncured.\n\nA material breach occurs if either Party (i) fails to make any payment, or (ii) fails to observe or perform any of the covenants, agreements, or\nobligations (other than payments of money).\n\nUpon the breach of either of the above conditions, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: (A) as to a default under\nclause (i) above, if payment is not made within ten (10) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make\npayment; or (B) as to a default under clause (ii) above, if such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after the defaulting party shall have\nreceived written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default and such action the defaulting party must take in order to cure\neach such item of default.",

Either Party shall have the right, without prejudice to any other rights it may have, to terminate this Agreement if the other Party materially breaches its obligation hereunder and such breach remains uncured.\n\nA material breach occurs if either Party (i) fails to make any payment, or (ii) fails to observe or perform any of the covenants, agreements, or\nobligations (other than payments of money), *unless* that failure is related to a Force Majeure event as defined in Section 15.\n\nUpon the breach of either of the above conditions, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: (A) as to a default under\nclause (i) above, if payment is not made within ten (10) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make\npayment; or (B) as to a default under clause (ii) above, if such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after the defaulting party shall have\nreceived written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default and such action the defaulting party must take in order to cure\neach such item of default. However, the cure period for breaches related to Force Majeure events is extended to ninety (90) days.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradiction regarding termination for breach. While the original clause 10(a) states that failure to make payment or observe obligations constitutes a material breach allowing termination, the addition of 'unless that failure is related to a Force Majeure event' creates ambiguity. Section 15 already addresses Force Majeure events and their impact on performance; this addition creates a conflict as to whether a Force Majeure related failure is a material breach or not, and it also introduces different cure periods for Force Majeure breaches, contradicting the original 30-day cure period for other breaches.",

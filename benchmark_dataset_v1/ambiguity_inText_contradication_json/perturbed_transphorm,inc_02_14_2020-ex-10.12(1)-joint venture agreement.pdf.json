The Parties agree that the following matters require the unanimous approval of all Directors, whether or not present at the Board meeting, and no Shareholder shall convene a shareholders meeting with respect to the following matters without notifying the other Shareholder:\n4.7.1 revising the budget or Business Plan of the Company after the first year of operation;",
                "explanation": "The original text refers to Directors 'present at a properly-noticed Board meeting'. The changed text, however, states 'all Directors, whether or not present'. Moreover, the original text states that consent must be given prior to shareholder's meeting, whereas the change requires notification. The 'revising the budget' also has temporal constrains. These changes introduce ambiguity and potential conflict.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies the English text as the controlling language while the changed version designates the Japanese text for matters related to company internal affairs. This creates a significant ambiguity and potential conflict. It’s unclear what constitutes ‘company internal affairs’ and which language prevails in disputes not directly related to such affairs, impacting the interpretation and enforcement of the entire agreement.",

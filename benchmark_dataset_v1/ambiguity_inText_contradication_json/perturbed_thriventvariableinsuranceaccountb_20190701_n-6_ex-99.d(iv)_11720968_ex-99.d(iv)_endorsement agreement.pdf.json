                "original_text": "We, Our, Us. Lutheran Brotherhood Variable Insurance Products Company.",
                "changed_text": "We, Our, Us. Lutheran Brotherhood Variable Insurance Products Company. We may also refer to a third-party administrator.",
                "explanation": "This adds ambiguity to the definition of 'We, Our, Us'. In some contexts, 'We' refers to Lutheran Brotherhood Variable Insurance Products Company, but elsewhere, it could refer to an unmentioned third-party administrator. This is contradictory because the contract doesn't define the situations when ‘We’ refers to the administrator and it makes determination difficult, potentially impacting liability.",

                "changed_text": "The ASSIGNMENT section is amended to include the following: You may transfer ownership of this contract in accordance with our bylaws, provided it does not violate any federal regulations. Society membership rights and privileges can be transferred or assigned with the prior written consent of the Society's President.",
                "explanation": "This introduces two conflicting statements. Originally, the contract states Society membership rights and privileges cannot be transferred. The modified version states that they *can* be transferred with the Society President's written consent. This creates uncertainty about the assignability of membership rights and requires subjective judgment.",

                "original_text": "DIVIDENDS. Each year, we will determine our divisible surplus. This contract’s share, if any, will be credited as a dividend. Since we do not expect this contract to contribute to divisible surplus, it is not expected that any dividends will be credited.",
                "changed_text": "DIVIDENDS. Each year, we will determine our divisible surplus. This contract’s share, if any, will be credited as a dividend. While it is not expected that this contract contributes to divisible surplus, in exceptional years, dividend payments will be credited under the discretion of the Board of Directors.",
                "explanation": "The original section says dividends are not expected. The modified section adds a caveat that 'in exceptional years' dividends *will* be credited at the discretion of the Board of Directors. This creates ambiguity, because this phrase contradicts the first part of the original text saying that no dividends will be credited. It relies on undefined conditions and subjective determination, which creates an ambiguity in enforceability.",

Exclusivity of Sponsorship Rights for Newegg\n7.1 In all of Allied’s actions and publications (in all media and formats) in connection with the marketing and conducting of the Events, where possible and appropriate, Allied shall where reasonably practicable communicate that Newegg is the exclusive sponsor of the Arena for the technology e-commerce and online retailer categories.\n7.2 Allied shall not endorse, or permit the marketing of any other company whose principal business is as an e-commerce provider at or in connection with the Arena. For purposes of clarity, this is not meant to prohibit incidental third-party endorsements not controlled by Allied such as individual player and team sponsorships of participants in events at the Arena.",

Exclusivity of Sponsorship Rights for Newegg\n7.1 In all of Allied’s actions and publications (in all media and formats) in connection with the marketing and conducting of the Events, Allied shall communicate that Newegg is the exclusive sponsor of the Arena for the technology e-commerce and online retailer categories. However, Allied retains the right to partner with other e-commerce providers for specific events or promotions, provided these partnerships do not directly compete with Newegg's core product offerings.\n7.2 Allied shall not endorse, or permit the direct marketing of any other company whose principal business directly competes with Newegg's core product offerings as an e-commerce provider at or in connection with the Arena. For purposes of clarity, this is meant to permit incidental third-party endorsements and strategic partnerships not controlled by Allied such as individual player and team sponsorships of participants in events at the Arena, and targeted campaigns with other retailers focusing on non-overlapping product lines.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes Newegg as the exclusive sponsor. The modified text introduces ambiguity by allowing partnerships with other e-commerce providers under certain conditions, creating a contradiction in the exclusivity clause. This weakens Newegg's position and opens the door for disputes about what constitutes a 'direct competitor' or 'core product offering.'",

Expiry or Termination\n14.1 Failure by Allied to perform and comply with any of its obligations in sections 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and Newegg shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately if Allied fails to cure the breach within fifteen (15) days following Newegg’s written notice of the breach.\n14.2 Each Party may also terminate the Agreement for convenience after Contract Year 2 (as defined in Section 14.4) by providing written notice to the other Party at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the effective date of such termination",

Expiry or Termination\n14.1 Failure by Allied to perform and comply with any of its obligations in sections 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and Newegg shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately if Allied fails to cure the breach within fifteen (15) days following Newegg’s written notice of the breach. However, Newegg's right to terminate immediately under this clause is subject to a good faith effort to negotiate a mutually agreeable solution, delaying the termination right.\n14.2 Each Party may also terminate the Agreement for convenience after Contract Year 2 (as defined in Section 14.4) by providing written notice to the other Party at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the effective date of such termination",
                "explanation": "The original Section 14.1 gives Newegg the right to immediate termination (subject to a 15-day cure period) for material breaches. The modified version adds a caveat requiring a 'good faith effort to negotiate,' which effectively delays and complicates Newegg's termination rights, creating a contradiction. While the section still states it is an immediate right, it is not, by adding the condition of good faith effort to negotiate. Now the immediacy of right is ambigious.",

The Parties shall co-operate in good faith on all announcements and press releases regarding this Agreement and Newegg’s sponsorship arrangement with Allied and Newegg shall determine in its sole discretion whether any such announcement or press release shall be published.

The Parties shall co-operate in good faith on all announcements and press releases regarding this Agreement and Newegg’s sponsorship arrangement with Allied. While Newegg retains significant influence over publicity, Allied also has the right to issue press releases related to the Arena and events held therein, provided they do not explicitly mention Newegg without prior written consent. Press releases concerning Newegg’s sponsorship of the Arena will only be published after written preapproval by both Parties, but this preapproval requirement does not extend to general announcements regarding Arena events.",
                "explanation": "The original Section 15.2 gives Newegg final decision-making rights over press releases. The modified section gives Allied the right to issue press releases about Arena events without Newegg's prior written approval, creating ambiguity about Newegg's control over publicity related to the sponsorship. A release mentioning an event may in effect promote the partnership.",

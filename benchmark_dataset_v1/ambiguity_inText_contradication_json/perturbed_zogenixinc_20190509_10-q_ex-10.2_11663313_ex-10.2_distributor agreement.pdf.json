                "original_text": "1.10 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means, with respect to a Party’s specific obligations under this Agreement, that level of efforts and resources, [***]. Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires that the applicable Party: (i) [***], (ii) [***], and (iii) [***].",
                "changed_text": "1.10 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means, with respect to a Party’s specific obligations under this Agreement, that level of efforts and resources, [***]. Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires that the applicable Party: (i) to operate in good faith, (ii) document all the actions taken to accomplish such specific obligation, and (iii) if such specific obligation could not be accomplished, the party shall not be in breach of its duty.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides more concrete requirements for “Commercially Reasonable Efforts”. Changing it to “to operate in good faith, document all the actions taken to accomplish such specific obligation and if such specific obligation could not be accomplished, the party shall not be in breach of its duty.” introduces ambiguity, as 'good faith' is subjective. This creates a contradiction if other sections of the contract rely on a more stringent interpretation of \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\".",

Zogenix shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Zogenix Technology unless Nippon Shinyaku Company, Ltd. contributes with novel technology, in that case, Nippon Shinyaku Company, Ltd. shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Zogenix Technology.",
                "explanation": "The original states Zogenix retains all rights. The modified introduces a contradiction, because if Nippon Shinyaku Company, Ltd. contributes to Zogenix Technology, the ownership then goes to Nippon Shinyaku Company, Ltd., creating uncertainty over the ownership of Zogenix's Technology.",

The Parties may terminate this Agreement by mutual agreement; however, Zogenix's approval is required for any termination related to Distributor convenience, while Nippon Shinyaku Company, Ltd's approval is needed for reasons related to Zogenix's performance.",
                "explanation": "The original states the agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement. The modified version states that even if there is a mutual agreement, if the reasons for termination are related to the specific partner (for example, Distributor convenience), the other partner (Zogenix) approval will be needed, so the termination might not happen. This is a contradiction of the mutual agreement.",

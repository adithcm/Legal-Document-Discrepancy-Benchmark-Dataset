Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods.\n         mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the\n         Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to the current\n         quality of their Goods.",

Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods.\n         mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the\n         Lucent Co-Branding Logo; however, mPhase is not obligated to maintain a specific quality level, as long as they make reasonable efforts.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity in the quality standards. Initially, mPhase was required to maintain a quality comparable to the current quality. Now, it states they are only obligated to make 'reasonable efforts,' contradicting the implied strict adherence to a quality level, thus creating uncertainty about the required quality standard.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding inspection rights. The original text implies unconditional access for inspection. The modified text introduces a 60-day notice period, but then provides an exception for immediate inspection if consumer complaints arise, making the terms unclear and contradictory.",

Additional products, including but not limited to Zezel Probiotic Water, Zayin Sports\nWater, Gridiron CBD H2O Probiotics™ Water, Gridiron MVP™ and Gridiron MVP™ Concentrate, *may* be considered Licensed Products at a later date based on the sole discretion of the NFLA-NC.

The modified definition introduces ambiguity by stating that additional products 'may' be considered Licensed Products at the discretion of one party, contradicting the initial inclusive definition. The removal of the 'signed by all parties' requirement further complicates the amendment process, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that the donation 'may' be payable and that the Company will decide whether to donate. This directly contradicts the original mandatory donation, creating a significant point of contention. Additionally, the conversion rates were certain, and now they are subject to change. This introduces a material uncertainty into the agreement.",

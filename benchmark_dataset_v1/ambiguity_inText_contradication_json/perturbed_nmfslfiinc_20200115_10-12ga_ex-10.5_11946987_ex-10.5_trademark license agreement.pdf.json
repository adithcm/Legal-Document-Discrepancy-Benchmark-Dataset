Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee’s own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this Agreement, and except as provided above, neither the Licensee nor any of its affiliates, owners, directors, officers, employees or agents shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivatives without the prior express written consent of the Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion. All rights not expressly granted to the Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor. Upon written notification by the Licensor",

The modified text broadens this to any name the Licensee chooses and any business. This creates a contradiction if other sections of the contract rely on the original, narrower definition.",

This Agreement shall be terminable (a) by the Licensor (i) at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that the Licensor or the Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of the Licensee’s use of the Licensed Mark or (ii) upon sixty (60) days’ written notice by the Licensor to the Licensee or (b) by the Licensee (i) at any time in the event such Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of the Licensee’s rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Licensor or (ii) upon sixty (60) days’ written notice by the Licensee to the Licensor.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement shall expire 'if' the investment advisor ceases to serve the Licensee. I have updated the text to state that it will expire 'immediately'. Additionally, the right for the licensor to terminate the agreement at 'any time' is now updated to 'after a year', which contradicts the ability to terminate it after 60 days written notice and the 'perpetual' term statement. This makes the circumstances for terminations very ambiguous and creates in-text contradiction.",

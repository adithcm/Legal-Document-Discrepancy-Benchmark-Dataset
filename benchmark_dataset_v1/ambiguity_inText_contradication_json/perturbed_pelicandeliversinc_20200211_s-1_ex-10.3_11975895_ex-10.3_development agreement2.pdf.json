                "explanation": "Changing 'as described' to 'as generally described' weakens the link between the Subject Program and the SOW. Then, stating that in cases of conflict, the SOW controls over the main agreement introduces contradiction if other clauses rely on the Agreement to control.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Sometimes during the term of this Agreement change order may or may not be requested by Client' to 'During the term of this Agreement, all changes must be formally requested by Client' establishes a *requirement* for all changes to go through the change order process. However, section 3.9 states 'Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, regardless of the acceptance or rejection of any Milestone Deliverable, Developer shall continue to perform all Services and deliver all Deliverables in accordance with the Delivery Schedule' which implies that the Developer must continue to perform under the original agreement even if Change Orders aren't agreed to.

                "explanation": "The modified version removes 'and or any of its affiliates' from the definition of 'disparage'. This means that while the agreement states that the parties can not disparage each other, the definition of 'disparage' no longer extends to affiliates, opening a loophole. It is also in contradiction to the statement 'take reasonable steps to prevent and will not knowingly permit any of their respective employees or agents to, disparage or speak ill of such persons' because technically, the disparagement can happen, as long as its of an affiliate.",

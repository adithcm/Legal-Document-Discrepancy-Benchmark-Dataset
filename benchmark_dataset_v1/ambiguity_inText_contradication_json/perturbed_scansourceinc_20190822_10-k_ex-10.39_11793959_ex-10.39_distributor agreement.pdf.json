If the Agreement expired prior to the Amendment Effective Date, any orders received and Products and Services purchased between the date of expiration and the Amendment Effective Date shall be in all respects deemed made under the Agreement as in effect prior to this Amendment. The parties further agree that if Distributor places Purchase Orders after the expiration of the Agreement, and Cisco accepts such Purchase Orders, then any such Purchase Orders shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Agreement; provided, however that acceptance by Cisco of any Purchase Order placed after the Agreement has expired will not be considered as an extension of the term of the Agreement nor a renewal thereof. Notwithstanding Cisco’s right to extend the term of the Agreement, each party acknowledges that the Agreement shall always be interpreted as being limited in duration to a definite term and that the other party has made no commitments whatsoever regarding the renewal of the Agreement beyond those expressly agreed in writing.",
                "changed_text": "1. The Term of the Agreement is hereby extended to January 20, 2012 unless sooner terminated as provided for in the Agreement.

The parties further agree that if Distributor places Purchase Orders after the expiration of the Agreement, and Cisco accepts such Purchase Orders, then any such Purchase Orders shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Agreement; provided, however that acceptance by Cisco of any Purchase Order placed after the Agreement has expired will be considered an automatic extension of the term of the Agreement and a renewal thereof. Notwithstanding Cisco’s right to extend the term of the Agreement, each party acknowledges that the Agreement shall always be interpreted as being unlimited in duration and that the other party has made commitments regarding the renewal of the Agreement beyond those expressly agreed in writing.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text regarding the term of the agreement and renewal. It initially states that acceptance of purchase orders does NOT extend the agreement and it is limited in duration, but the modified text says acceptance DOES extend it and is unlimited in duration. This creates a significant point of contention.",

The above-referenced cap shall be determined based on all Product purchases made under\nthis Agreement. The responsibility to manage the Balancing Cap shall rest solely upon Distributor. Distributor shall be\nentitled to return Product once per quarter, provided such returns do not exceed the Balancing Cap. \"Dead on Arrival\"\nand Obsolete Products returned pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement shall be excluded from calculation of the\nBalancing Cap.

Cisco shall credit Distributor's account in the amount of 50% of the price paid by Distributor, with no deductions whatsoever.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several contradictions related to the 'Balancing Cap' and product returns. The original states the cap is based on *all* product purchases by the distributor and the distributor is responsible for managing it with quarterly returns. The modified version states the cap is based solely on products *designated by Cisco* and Cisco is responsible for managing it, with monthly returns. Further the modified version explicitly includes \"Dead on Arrival\" products in the calculation where the original explicitly excluded them. Finally the Return Credit calculation is changed.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires strict compliance with all laws, including anti-corruption laws like the FCPA. The modified text completely negates this requirement by stating the distributor doesn't need to comply with anti-corruption laws and *is* allowed to violate applicable laws. This creates a contradiction, especially if other sections of the agreement rely on the distributor's initial warranty of compliance.",

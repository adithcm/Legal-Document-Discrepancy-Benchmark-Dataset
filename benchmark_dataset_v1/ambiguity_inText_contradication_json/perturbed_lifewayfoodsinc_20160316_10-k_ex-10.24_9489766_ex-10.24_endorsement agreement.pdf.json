Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Lifeway shall be under no obligation to cause the Marketing Materials to be displayed, published or performed. Individual further waives the right to inspect or approve the Marketing Materials.",

Individual further waives the right to inspect or approve the Marketing Materials.",
                "explanation": "The first definition allows Lifeway to use the likeness for a broad range of purposes including 'historical reference and display purposes and other internal purposes,' whereas the changed text limits the use of likeness to 'marketing, advertising or otherwise promoting the Lifeway products and/or services.' This contradiction creates uncertainty whether Lifeway can use the likeness for internal presentations or archival purposes.",

                "explanation": "The original text prohibits Individual from promoting 'products that compete with products manufactured or distributed by Lifeway'. The modified version changed the clause to include 'products that directly compete with products manufactured or distributed by Lifeway'. This creates ambiguity regarding what defines direct competition versus regular competition, thus making the clause weaker and harder to enforce.",

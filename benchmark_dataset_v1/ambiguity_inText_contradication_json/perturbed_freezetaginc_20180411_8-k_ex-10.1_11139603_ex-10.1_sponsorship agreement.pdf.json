                "explanation": "The original text states that approval shall be in the Association's 'sole discretion' and that failing to get approval 'may be considered breach of the Agreement and cause for immediate cancellation.' The modified text changes this to 'reasonable efforts to provide approval in a timely manner' and states that failure to get advance approval 'will not be considered a breach of the Agreement.' This creates a contradiction regarding the extent of the Association's control and the consequences of not obtaining approval, introducing uncertainty in enforcement.",

Insurance: During the term of this Agreement, Company shall use its best efforts to obtain and maintain, at its expense, Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage with an insurance carrier with a Best’s rating of A or better. The insurance should ideally be in an amount of: $2,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate with a $2,000,000 aggregate for products and completed operations. The Association is recommended to be a named additional insured, and should be provided at least 30 days’ notice for cancellation of policy. Such insurance should be primary and non-contributory.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates specific insurance requirements ('shall obtain and maintain,' 'A+,' 'must be a named additional insured'). The modified text softens these requirements ('use its best efforts,' 'A or better,' 'recommended to be a named additional insured,' 'should'). This creates a contradiction: the original text implies strict requirements for insurance, whereas the modified version allows for potentially less stringent coverage. This could lead to disputes over whether the Company has adequately fulfilled its insurance obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear and binding payment obligation ('agrees to pay,' 'shall be payable'). The revised text introduces ambiguity by using terms like 'intends to pay,' 'approximate amount,' 'estimated to be payable' and including the clause 'Company will provide a good faith effort to adhere to this schedule.' This creates a contradiction between a firm financial commitment and a more flexible, non-binding agreement regarding payment, making it unclear if the Company is legally obligated to make the payments as scheduled.",

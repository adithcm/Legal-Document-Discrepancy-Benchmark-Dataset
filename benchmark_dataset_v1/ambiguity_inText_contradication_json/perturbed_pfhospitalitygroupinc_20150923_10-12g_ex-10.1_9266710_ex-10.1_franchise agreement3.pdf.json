Information is not considered Confidential Information if Member can demonstrate it came to Member’s attention by lawful means prior to disclosure to Member; or if, at the time of disclosure to Member, it was already part of the public domain and Member can prove Franchisor gave public access to the Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' excludes information that was already in the public domain at the time of disclosure. The modified definition adds the clause that the public information must be proven to be given access by the franchisor, which creates a contradiction because the original definition did not include this condition, broadening the definition of what's confidential based on who released it. It's now unclear if public knowledge obtained elsewhere but released by the franchisor is considered confidential.",

The modified version removes the restriction based on other existing or under construction franchises, narrowing the scope of the non-compete. This creates a contradiction because it's now unclear if the member can engage in competitive activities near *other* Pizza Fusion franchises after termination. If they are not running the franchised business that member was employed by, can they now act on other franchised locations?",

The changed version limits the expiration or termination of franchise agreement if that happened due to franchisee's breach. Also, it limits the member’s employment with Franchisee is terminated for gross misconduct. This means if the franchisee did not breach, and the member did not act with gross misconduct, it is unclear if there is a post-term period.",

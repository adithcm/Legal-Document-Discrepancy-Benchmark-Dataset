                "explanation": "Changing the definition of 'control' from 50% to 30% ownership creates a contradiction, as other sections might rely on the 50% threshold for determining Affiliate status. This leads to uncertainty in contractual obligations related to Affiliates.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'CEO' to 'Board of Directors' introduces a conflict, because in Article 67 The CEO shall be in charge of the day-to-day operation and management of the Joint Venture Company and shall carry out all matters entrusted by the Board of Directors. The Deputy CEO shall assist the CEO in his work and shall report to the CEO. This creates uncertainty in contract as it is unclear whose responsible for selection",

                "explanation": "Changing 'two years' to 'ten years' after termination for confidentiality obligations introduces a contradiction. Enforcing a 10-year confidentiality period instead of the original two may cause disputes, affecting the Parties' ability to operate independently post-termination. This also conflicts with international commercial practice because confidentiality agreements generally last 2-5 years.",

                "original_text": "Section 1.2 Integrity agrees to use its best efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares at the public offering price, as determined in accordance with the Registration Statement, and will undertake such advertising and promotion as it believes is reasonable in connection with such solicitation. Integrity shall order Shares from the Fund only to the extent that it shall have received purchase orders therefore.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.2 Integrity agrees to use reasonable efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares at a price it deems fit. Integrity may undertake advertising and promotion as it believes is beneficial in connection with such solicitation. Integrity shall endeavor to order Shares from the Fund, but this is subject to market conditions and the availability of Shares.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity in the definition of 'solicit orders' and 'order Shares'. 'Best efforts' is replaced with 'reasonable efforts,' reducing the obligation. 'Public offering price' is replaced with 'price it deems fit' . The mandatory 'shall' is softened to 'endeavor,' making the ordering of shares discretionary.",

                "changed_text": "Section 1.8 Integrity will bear some expenses in connection with the performance of its services and the incurring of certain distribution expenses under this Agreement, as mutually agreed upon by Integrity and the Fund. For purposes of this Agreement, “distribution expenses” of Integrity may include expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities intended to generally support the distribution of Shares, and may encompass:\n(a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide general support services relating to the distribution of Shares, including potentially office space and equipment, telephone facilities, and vaguely answering inquiries regarding the Fund;\n(b) costs relating to the potential formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, maybe including direct mail promotions and limited television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and possibly other mass media advertising;\n(c) a portion of the costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to possible shareholders of the Fund;\n(d) costs involved in very minimal preparation, printing, and distribution of sales literature pertaining to the Fund;\n(e) costs involved in occasionally obtaining some information, minimal analyses, and brief reports with respect to some marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, suggest; and\n2\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n(f) some sales commissions and vague other fees possibly paid, together with vaguely related financing costs to possibly brokers, dealers or other selling entities with a dealer agreement in effect for the sale of Fund Shares.\nDistribution expenses, however, may include certain expenditures in connection with services which Integrity, any of its affiliates,\nor any other person has agreed to bear without reimbursement.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly reduces the obligation on Integrity to bear distribution expenses. 'All expenses' is changed to 'some expenses', introducing uncertainty. 'Shall mean' is weakened to 'may include', making the included items optional. The specific examples are also weakened with 'potentially', 'vaguely', 'possibly' and 'some', making the scope of distribution expenses unclear and subject to interpretation.",

                "changed_text": "Section 4.1 The Fund authorizes Integrity and any dealers with whom Integrity has entered into dealer agreements to use the prospectus or statement of additional information currently furnished by the Fund in connection with the sale of Shares. The Fund agrees to potentially indemnify, possibly defend, and vaguely hold Integrity, its officers and governors, and any person who controls Integrity within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, vaguely free and somewhat harmless from some claims, demands, liabilities, and potential expenses (maybe including the cost of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and some counsel fees potentially incurred in connection therewith) which Integrity, its officers and governors, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or somewhat under common law, if related to claims arising out of an untrue statement of a fact contained in a registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information, or arising out of omission to state a fact required to be stated in such documents, or necessary to make the statements in any of them not misleading.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce uncertainty by weakening the obligation and scope of indemnification. 'Agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold' is changed to 'agrees to potentially indemnify, possibly defend, and vaguely hold,' making the obligation discretionary. 'Any and all claims' is reduced to 'some claims', 'Expenses' are now 'potential expenses' and additional qualifiers are inserted throughout the text further reducing the level of obligations and reducing its binding nature.",

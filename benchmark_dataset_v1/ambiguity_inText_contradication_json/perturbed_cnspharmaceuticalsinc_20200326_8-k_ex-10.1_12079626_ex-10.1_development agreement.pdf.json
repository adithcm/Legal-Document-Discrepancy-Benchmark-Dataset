                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Approval Achievement Date' includes two possible triggers: marketing approval in half the sublicense territory OR payment of $1.0 million in Development Fees. The modified definition removes the payment option. This creates a contradiction if Article 2 relies on the original definition for triggering certain obligations, potentially leading to disputes over whether the 'Approval Achievement Date' has been reached solely based on the payment.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines confidentiality obligations as lasting 'during the term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years thereafter'. The changed text removes 'and for a period of five (5) years thereafter', limiting the confidentiality obligations to only the term of the agreement. This contradicts the original intention of extended confidentiality, potentially leading to disputes after the agreement's termination. This directly affects the scope of 'Confidential Information' protection.",

The modification removes the cure period. If another section (e.g., Article 8 - Indemnification) relies on the concept of 'material breach' from this section, it is now unclear whether a party has an opportunity to cure the breach before termination is triggered. This creates a conflict in how 'material breach' is handled.",

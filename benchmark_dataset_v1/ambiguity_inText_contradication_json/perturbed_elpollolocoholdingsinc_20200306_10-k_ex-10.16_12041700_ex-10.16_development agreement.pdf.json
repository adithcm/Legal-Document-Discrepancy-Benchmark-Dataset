Developer must submit one or more site(s) for approval, enter into binding leases or purchase agreements and open to the public the number of El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) on such approved sites each calendar year as required on the Development Schedule, all as set forth on Exhibit “B” attached hereto and made a part hereof.",

Developer should endeavor to submit one or more site(s) for approval, aim to enter into leases or purchase agreements and attempt to open to the public the number of El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) on such approved sites each calendar year as suggested on the Development Schedule, all as set forth on Exhibit “B” attached hereto and made a part hereof.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by weakening the obligations of the developer. 'Must' becomes 'should endeavor', 'enter into binding leases' becomes 'aim to enter into leases,' and 'open to the public' becomes 'attempt to open to the public.' This creates an internal contradiction if other sections of the contract enforce strict adherence to the Development Schedule.",

                "original_text": "7.4. Developer shall defend immediately upon tender of defense, at its own cost, the Franchisor, its subsidiaries, parent and affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively for this section only known as “Franchisor”), from and against any and all claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitrations, demands, allegations, costs embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees), liens and damages (collectively for this section only known as “Losses”), however caused, and reimburse Franchisor for all costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Franchisor in defense of any Losses, resulting directly or indirectly from or pertaining to or arising out of, or alleged to arise out of, or in connection with Developer’s activities under the Development Agreement, including any labor, any employee related claims whatsoever, including, without limitation any claims made by an employee of Developer resulting from the employee’s training in a Franchisor operated facility or restaurant, and including Developer’s failure for any reason to fully inform any third party of Developer’s lack of authority to bind the Franchisor for any purpose. Such Losses shall include, without limitation, those arising from the death of or injury to any person or arising from damage to the property of Developer or the Franchisor, or any third person, firm or corporation, whether or not resulting from any strict liability imposed by fact, law, statute, or ordinance, on the Franchisor. Developer further agrees that Developer’s duty to defend the Franchisor is separate from, independent of and free-standing of Developer’s duty to indemnify the Franchisor and applies whether the issue of Developer’s negligence, breach of contract, or other fault or obligation has been determined. Developer’s duty to defend is regardless of the outcome of liability even if Developer is ultimately found not negligent and not dependent on the ultimate resolution of issues arising out of any claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitration, demands, allegations, costs embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees), liens or damages.",
                "changed_text": "7.4. Developer shall reasonably consider defending the Franchisor, its subsidiaries, parent and affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively for this section only known as “Franchisor”), from and against claims where the Developer is directly and solely responsible for damages. The Developer will cover attorney's fees only if they are deemed reasonable by an independent arbitrator. This obligation is subject to Developer's ability to obtain affordable insurance coverage for such defense. The Developer’s decision to defend is contingent on a good-faith assessment of their liability, based on preliminary investigations. Developer's duty to defend is only applicable if Developer is ultimately found negligent.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the Developer's obligation to defend the Franchisor. By replacing 'shall defend immediately' with 'shall reasonably consider defending' and limiting the obligation to cases where the Developer is 'directly and solely responsible,' the contract introduces substantial ambiguity. The condition of 'affordable insurance coverage' further weakens the obligation, creating a contradiction if other sections assume a comprehensive defense obligation.",

                "original_text": "18.1. This Agreement, after review by Developer and El Pollo Loco, was accepted in the state in which Franchisor’s then-current headquarters (currently the State of California) is located and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of such state, except that the provisions in Section 20.1 covering competition following the expiration, termination or assignment of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state in which the breach occurs. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY ACTION BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY AGAINST EACH OTHER IN ANY COURT, WHETHER FEDERAL OR STATE, WILL BE BROUGHT WITHIN THE STATE IN WHICH FRANCHISOR’S HEADQUARTERS (CURRENTLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA) IS THEN LOCATED. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO DEMAND OR HAVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE FRANCHISOR IS A PARTY. THE PARTIES CONSENT TO THE EXERCISE OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER THEM BY SUCH COURTS AND TO THE PROPRIETY OF VENUE OF SUCH COURTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF CARRYING OUT THE PROVISION, AND THEY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO THE SAME. ANY ACTION BETWEEN DEVELOPER AND FRANCHISOR SHALL INVOLVE ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS OF DEVELOPER AND SHALL NOT INVOLVE ANY CLASS, GROUP, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR ASSOCIATIONAL ACTION. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 18.1 IS INTENDED BY THE PARTIES TO SUBJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ANY FRANCHISE OR SIMILAR LAW, RULE OR REGULATION TO WHICH THIS AGREEMENT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE SUBJECT.",
                "changed_text": "18.1. This Agreement, after review by Developer and El Pollo Loco, may be interpreted under the laws most favorable to the Developer, considering the Developer's principal place of business. While the Franchisor prefers disputes to be resolved in the state of its headquarters, the Developer retains the right to seek resolution in their state of primary business operation. The waiver of jury trial is considered negotiable and may be revisited during dispute resolution. The Developer acknowledges the Franchisor's preferred venue but does not waive their right to object based on inconvenience or cost. Any action between Developer and Franchisor may involve class, group, consolidated, representative or associational action.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a direct conflict with the original clause regarding governing law and venue. The original specifies California law and venue, with a jury trial waiver. The modification introduces the possibility of applying the Developer's preferred law, disputes the exclusivity of the Franchisor's venue preference, makes the jury trial waiver negotiable, and allows for class action lawsuits. This introduces significant legal uncertainty.",

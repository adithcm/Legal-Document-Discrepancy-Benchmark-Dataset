                "original_text": "2.2 The seller shall be confirmed within three working days after receipt of order. If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should\nnote entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or\nmodifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party shall not\nunilaterally cancel the order before the two sides agreed .",
                "changed_text": "2.2 The seller shall endeavor to confirm within three working days after receipt of order. If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or modifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller confirms, but either party may cancel the order with a 30-day written notice prior to the scheduled delivery date.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the seller *shall* confirm within three days, implying a strict obligation. The modified text changes 'shall' to 'endeavor to,' weakening this obligation. Furthermore, the original text strictly prohibits unilateral cancellation after acceptance, while the modified text allows cancellation with 30 days' notice. This creates a contradiction regarding the binding nature of accepted orders.",

                "explanation": "The original text offers an absolute guarantee of compliance. The modification inserts 'generally complies,' introducing ambiguity. This creates a contradiction if other clauses rely on the commodity meeting specific and exact specifications.",

CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, may attempt to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation. The Buyers may issue the claim and the certificate so issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, but it will be in Seller’s sole discretion to accept it as the base of a claim. The Sellers, in accordance with their internal policies and procedures and at their own discretion, may determine if the defect(s) will be eliminated, the commodity will be replaced or devaluated. The buyers are not allowed to eliminate the defect(s) themselves at the Sellers’ expenses. If the Sellers fail to answer the Buyers within one weeks after receipt of the aforesaid claim, it does not automatically mean that the claim shall be reckoned as having been accepted by the Sellers.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants the buyer a *right to claim* and mandates that the inspection certificate *shall be accepted* as the basis of a claim, placing a firm obligation on the seller. The changed text weakens the buyer's position considerably, stating that the buyer *may attempt to claim* and grants the seller the *sole discretion* to accept the certificate. Further, the 'shall' regarding remedies like defect elimination is changed to a discretionary 'may determine if', and the final sentence removes the automatic acceptance of a claim if the seller doesn't respond, contradicting the original text's clear timeline.",

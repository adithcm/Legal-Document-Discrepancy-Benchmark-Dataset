                "original_text": "b. Integrity Distribution. Integrity will hold exclusive worldwide rights to promote and sell the product to/through the following distribution channels: Christian retail (CBA or Christian Booksellers Association markets), direct mail (including continuity sales, church sales, digital and e-commerce sales.) Integrity will have Internet and e-commerce rights with respect to its own web site and other Christian e-commerce. Integrity shall have the right to license distribution of the Product through all channels of distribution throughout the remainder of the world.",

Integrity will hold exclusive worldwide rights to promote and sell the product to/through the following distribution channels: Christian retail (CBA or Christian Booksellers Association markets), direct mail (excluding continuity sales), church sales, digital and e-commerce sales.

Integrity shall have the right to license distribution of the Product through all channels of distribution throughout the remainder of the world.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by excluding 'continuity sales' from Integrity's direct mail distribution rights. Originally, Integrity had exclusive rights to direct mail, including continuity sales. Now, it's unclear if continuity sales are part of Integrity's distribution rights or if they fall under TL's rights, creating a contradiction about who controls continuity sales through direct mail.",

                "changed_text": "TL may purchase from Integrity limited quantities of the Product for its promotional use, at a cost to be negotiated. TL warrants that any units so purchased, whether or not labeled \"promotional only\" or cut-out, will be given away for purposes of promotion of the Products, and will not be sold.",
                "explanation": "This edit removes the specific pricing (Manufacturing cost set forth in paragraph 3(a) and the 7% limitation) and replaces it with a vaguer 'cost to be negotiated.' This creates a direct contradiction. TL could be purchasing those products at 'Manufacturing cost' vs a cost to be negotiated. If paragraph 3(a) defines a specific manufacturing cost, this change creates ambiguity as to the actual cost TL will pay.",

Thereafter, the agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 90 days prior to the end of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original term. The original agreement states that the term ends December 31, 2004, and requires a *written agreement* for extension. The modified version introduces an *automatic renewal* with a termination clause. This creates a direct conflict: does the agreement require mutual written consent to extend, or does it automatically renew unless one party terminates?",

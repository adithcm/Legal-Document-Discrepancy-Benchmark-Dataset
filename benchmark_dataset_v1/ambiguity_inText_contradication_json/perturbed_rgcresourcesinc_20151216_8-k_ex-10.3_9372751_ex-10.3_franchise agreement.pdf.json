                "explanation": "Adding 'unless terminated earlier as per section 10' introduces a contingency to the defined term. If section 10 contains vague termination clauses, it makes the '20 years' term ambiguous.",

                "changed_text": "Grantee shall during the term of this Franchise make reasonable efforts to maintain a business presence within the Territorial Limits of Grantor. While the Grantee intends to maintain an office open for business, the operating hours are subject to change based on market demands.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'maintain at least one business office' to 'make reasonable efforts to maintain a business presence' weakens the obligation. Removing the '40 hours per week' requirement and adding 'subject to change based on market demands' makes the commitment to a physical office and its operational hours uncertain, conflicting with an implicit assumption of a consistent business location.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be' to 'should ideally be' and 'shall be deemed validly given' to 'should be considered for delivery' significantly weakens the mandatory nature of the notice requirement. This introduces ambiguity about the validity and method of delivering notices, making enforcement difficult and contradicting any sections relying on strict adherence to notice procedures.",

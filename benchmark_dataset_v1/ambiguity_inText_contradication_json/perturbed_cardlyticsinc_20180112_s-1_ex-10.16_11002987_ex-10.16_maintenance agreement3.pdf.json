                "original_text": "This Schedule (“Schedule”) is made as of the effective date set forth above to that Software License, Customization, and Maintenance Agreement, by and between Cardlytics, Inc. (“Supplier”) and Bank of America, N. A, (“Bank of America”), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (“SLCMA”). Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned in the SLCMA.",

(“Supplier”) and Bank of America, N. A, (“Bank of America”), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (“SLCMA”). Each capitalized term used but not explicitly defined herein shall have the meaning assigned in this Schedule, overriding any conflicting definitions in the SLCMA.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that terms not explicitly defined in this schedule will follow the definitions in the SLCMA, while simultaneously stating that this schedule's definitions override any conflicting definitions in the SLCMA. This could lead to disputes on which definition of a term to use if there is ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "The original text indicates that the SLCMA definitively sets the terms and conditions, and the parties 'desire' to *add* the placement system to the SLCMA with certainty. The changed text states it sets 'definitive' terms, implying no changes possible, and the parties 'potentially' supplement it implying optional inclusion. This creates a contradiction: is the placement system certainly part of the agreement, or potentially supplemental to it?",

                "explanation": "This alteration casts doubt on the key elements of contract formation. The phrases 'partial consideration', 'sufficiency of which is debated', and 'may agree' undermine the binding nature. Furthermore, 'possibly intended' and 'potential use' removes certainty about whether Schedule A is a definitive and required part of the agreement, contrasting with other sections that may assume its mandatory implementation. This introduces critical inconsistency.",

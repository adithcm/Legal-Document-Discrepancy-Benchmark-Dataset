                "original_text": "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Attachments A, G or H, neither party can suspend its further performance, terminate this Agreement or require specific performance of the other party of this Agreement in whole or in part as a result of the other party’s material breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement without first providing notice to such party in writing and thirty (30) days’ opportunity to cure the material breach (and then only if such party fails to cure such breach).",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Attachments A, G or H, either party can immediately suspend its further performance upon material breach of this agreement. Termination of this agreement requires providing a 30-day notice to cure the breach; if the breach is not cured, only then can the agreement be terminated. Specific performance may be required at any time, regardless of breach status, based on the breaching party’s demonstration of good faith and intent to fulfill their contractual obligations.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting conditions for suspension, termination, and specific performance. Originally, suspension and termination required a 30-day cure period. The modified version allows immediate suspension upon breach, a delayed termination after the 30-day cure period, and introduces a discretionary condition for specific performance based on 'good faith,' which contradicts the right to specific performance upon breach under normal contract law, creating uncertainty.",

Sellers agrees to support the creation of purchasing specifications for Products by Buyer and agrees to supply Products in accordance to those purchasing specifications. Seller has the right to review each purchasing specification and needs to accept in writing before such purchasing specifications become effective. Seller has the right to take exceptions to terms and provisions in these purchasing specifications if in contradiction with Seller’s Sales specifications, General Terms and Condition of Sales or other Seller’s procedures and policies.",
                "changed_text": "Product shall conform to ExxonMobil Selling Affiliates' standard sales specifications as of the date of shipment. Sellers agree to support the creation of purchasing specifications for Products by Buyer and agrees to supply Products in accordance to those purchasing specifications. Buyer will provide the specifications which will be deemed automatically accepted, if no rejection has been sent by the Seller. Should there be any conflicts between the specification created by the buyer and sales specifications or any terms and conditions, the buyer’s specifications will prevail.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that product must conform to the Seller's standard sales specifications, but that the seller agrees to work with buyer on purchasing specifications. This is qualified by stating that the seller must accept the buyer's specifications in writing. The modified version dictates that if the seller has not rejected it, then it’s accepted automatically and that even if the new specifications conflict with the existing ones, the new specification will still prevail creating an internal contradiction that is not clearly specified when new specifications will preside over the original ones.",

                "original_text": "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Attachments A, G or H, if Buyer/Buyer Affiliates and Seller/ExxonMobil Selling Affiliates are unable to agree on the quality or quantity of Product delivered and received following their internal investigations and good faith efforts to resolve the dispute, the parties shall cooperate to have the Products in dispute analyzed by a mutually selected independent testing laboratory. The results of such laboratory testing shall be final and binding on the parties on the issue of conformance of the Products. If the Products are determined to be conforming, then Buyer/Buyer Affiliates shall bear the cost of such laboratory testing. If the Products are determined not to be conforming, then Seller/ExxonMobil Selling Affiliates shall bear the cost of such laboratory testing.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Attachments A, G or H, if Buyer/Buyer Affiliates and Seller/ExxonMobil Selling Affiliates are unable to agree on the quality or quantity of Product delivered and received, the buyer reserves the right to hire its own independent testing laboratory, whose findings will be solely determinative of whether there is conformance of the products. If the Products are determined to be conforming, then Buyer/Buyer Affiliates shall bear the cost of such laboratory testing. If the Products are determined not to be conforming, then Seller/ExxonMobil Selling Affiliates shall bear the cost of such laboratory testing regardless if the buyer or a mutually selected lab made the determination.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a mutually selected independent testing laboratory and makes the results binding. The modified text allows the buyer to choose their own lab and renders that lab’s decision solely determinative. This is a contradiction as it removes the requirement of mutual agreement, potentially biasing the outcome. The addition that seller will always bear the cost regardless of which lab is hired leads to a potential abuse where the buyer could potentially choose a biased lab.",

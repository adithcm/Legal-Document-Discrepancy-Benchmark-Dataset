                "original_text": "1.3 “Affiliate” means any distributor or franchisee of HSWI or any company or other entity worldwide, including without limitation corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, and limited liability companies in which HSWI directly or indirectly holds at least a 19% ownership, equity, control or financial interest and which HSWI intends to enjoy any of HSWI’s rights hereunder. A list of Affiliates as of the Effective Date is attached hereto as Attachment A. Attachment A may be modified from time to time upon notice by HSWI to reflect a revised list of Affiliates and each modified Attachment A shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference.",

Attachment A may be modified from time to time upon notice by HSWI to reflect a revised list of Affiliates and each modified Attachment A shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' is broad, including entities with at least 19% ownership by HSWI. The modified version removes the reference to specific ownership, equity, control, or financial interest percentages, thus only including distributors or franchisees. This creates a contradiction because an entity could be considered an Affiliate under the original definition but not under the modified one, leading to uncertainty about which entities HSWI can extend its rights to.",

                "explanation": "The original definition limits costs that can be deducted from gross revenue to a certain percentage. The modified definition removes this limit, making it unclear how much can be deducted. This creates a contradiction regarding the calculation of 'Net Revenue', potentially affecting the royalties payable to World Book, as it’s now unclear which costs can be deducted.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides strong warranties, including complete legal compliance and content free from material errors. The modified version weakens these guarantees by changing \"it will perform all services\" to \"it will make reasonable efforts to perform all services\", \"Content will be free from material errors\" to \"Content will be free from errors to the best of World Book’s knowledge\", \"Content will comply with all laws and regulations\" to \"Content will comply with some laws and regulations\", and removing the claim about express government approval. This creates an in-text contradiction because the original clause implies a high degree of certainty about content compliance and quality, whereas the changed clause admits potential gaps and a lack of guaranteed approval, potentially impacting HSWI’s ability to confidently distribute the content.",

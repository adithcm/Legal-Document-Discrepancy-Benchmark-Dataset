The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a thirty-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\"). The term can also be terminated by ESSI if the talent does not maintain a certain level of social media engagement, defined as posting at least 3 times per week.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a second, conflicting condition for termination. Section 2 initially defines 'Term' termination as requiring a 30-day notice. The added sentence allows ESSI to terminate based on a different criterion (social media engagement), creating ambiguity as to when and how the contract can be terminated. It's unclear if ESSI needs to provide 30 days notice if terminating based on social media engagement. This creates in-text contradiction about the term of agreement.",

ESSI may request an additional production session(s), or a media tour or personal appearance(s) of Talent without any additional fee.",
                "explanation": "This change modifies the original agreement in several conflicting ways. Initially, the production sessions required mutual agreement on location and time. The modified text gives ESSI sole discretion. Furthermore, it changes the compensation for additional hours. Finally, it says Talent is not responsible for attending meetings, then it changes to Talent being responsible for attending essential meetings and corporate functions. This creates in-text contradiction regarding the agreed upon duties, giving rise to uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original section requires Talent's approval for commercial placements and press releases. If approval isn't received in five days, the usage is 'deemed unapproved'. In contradiction, the revised version states ESSI can proceed if no approval is given in fourteen days. Additionally, Talent is now able to use such images for commercial resale, reversing the prior text and creating ambiguity. The contradiction that really does the trick, however, is the removal of the restriction on Talent publishing press releases, completely contradicting clause 9.1.",

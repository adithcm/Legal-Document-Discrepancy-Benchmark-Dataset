                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction to the definition of Intellectual Property Rights, which now includes contractual rights, versus the original text where it specifically excluded them. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty around the scope of the agreement, especially with licensing.",

                "original_text": "Section 8.01. No Assignment or Transfer Without Consent. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement, including the licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement, shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Party to this Agreement (or any of its successors or permitted assigns) (a) shall enter into a consolidation or merger transaction in which such Party is not the surviving entity and the surviving entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of such Party’s assets, (b) shall transfer all or substantially all of such Party’s assets to any Person or (c) shall assign this Agreement to such Party’s Affiliates, then, in each such case, the assigning Party (or its successors or permitted assigns, as applicable) shall ensure that the assignee or successor-in-interest expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement, and the assigning Party shall not be required to seek consent, but shall provide written notice and evidence of such assignment, assumption or succession to the non-assigning Party. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. No assignment permitted by this Section 8.01 shall release the assigning Party from liability for the full performance of its obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the licenses granted in this Agreement extend to products, product lines, services, apparatus, devices, systems, components, hardware, software, processes, solutions, any combination of the foregoing, or other offerings of the assignee existing on or before the date of the transaction described in clauses (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such transaction.",

                "explanation": "The change removes the requirement for the assigning party to ensure that the assignee expressly assumes all obligations in case of a merger, asset transfer, or assignment to affiliates. This creates a contradiction with the earlier statement requiring consent for assignment. It becomes unclear whether obligations are automatically transferred in these specific scenarios, leading to potential disputes.",

Subject to Section 11.02 and Section 11.05, in the event of any actual or threatened default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, the affected Party shall have the right to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief of its rights under this Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies at Law or in equity, and all such rights and remedies shall be cumulative. The other Party shall not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that money damages are an adequate remedy. The Parties agree that the remedies at Law for any breach or threatened breach hereof, including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are waived.",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text regarding specific performance. Previously, the agreement stated that the breaching party cannot oppose specific performance based on monetary damages being adequate. Now, the change mandates that the breaching party will oppose the granting of such relief on that basis, indicating that money damages are an adequate remedy. This creates a conflicting scenario, as it is difficult to predict the outcomes of disputes and legal issues.",

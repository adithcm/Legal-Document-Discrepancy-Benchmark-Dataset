                "changed_text": "“End Users” or “User” means any person who has an active paid subscription directly with iPass, regardless of subscriber ID eligibility, to access the iPass Services and iPass Network.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'End Users'. The original definition focuses on having an eligible subscriber ID, while the modified definition centers on having an active, paid subscription directly with iPass. This conflict may lead to disputes over which users qualify as 'End Users' under the agreement, impacting the applicability of various clauses related to user rights and responsibilities.",

                "original_text": "2.6 End User Agreements. Before making available any Services to an End User, Channel Partner will enter into an End User Agreement that is materially similar to the terms and conditions contained in Exhibit E. Channel Partner will enforce each End User Agreement with at least the same degree of diligence used in enforcing similar agreements pertaining Channel Partner’s own services or products but in no event will Channel Partner provide a standard of care in this regard that is less than commercially reasonable. Channel Partner will not waive, amend, or agree to terms that would tend to negate or materially dilute the sample terms provided in Exhibit E. Channel Partner shall promptly notify iPass of any material breach of any End User Agreement and will cooperate with iPass and/or iPass suppliers in any legal action to mitigate iPass’ damages in the event of any such breach. iPass may, and may require Channel Partner to suspend or terminate Services to an End User who breaches the terms of an End User Agreement. Upon request, Channel Partner will provide iPass a copy of each End User Agreement entered into by Channel Partner and End Users. A breach by an End User is deemed a breach by Channel Partner.",
                "changed_text": "2.6 End User Agreements. Before making available any Services to an End User, Channel Partner will enter into an End User Agreement that is substantially different from the terms and conditions contained in Exhibit E. Channel Partner is not required to enforce any End User Agreement. Channel Partner may waive, amend, or agree to terms that would tend to negate or materially dilute the sample terms provided in Exhibit E. Channel Partner is not required to notify iPass of any material breach of any End User Agreement. iPass may not require Channel Partner to suspend or terminate Services to an End User who breaches the terms of an End User Agreement. Upon request, Channel Partner is not required to provide iPass a copy of each End User Agreement entered into by Channel Partner and End Users. A breach by an End User is not deemed a breach by Channel Partner.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a direct conflict regarding the End User Agreements. The original text mandates that Channel Partners must use a similar end user agreement, enforce it, and notify iPass of breaches. The modified text allows Channel Partners to use substantially different end user agreements and states they are not required to enforce agreements or notify iPass of breaches. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the obligations of the Channel Partner with respect to the End User Agreements and who is responsible for breaches.",

                "original_text": "10.2 Termination for Breach. If either party materially breaches this Agreement or terms or conditions within this Agreement, and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice is given to the breaching party, then the other party may, by giving written notice to the breaching party, terminate this Agreement as of the end of such thirty (30) day notice period or such later date as is specified in such notice of termination",
                "changed_text": "10.2 Termination for Breach. If either party is suspected of materially breaching this Agreement or terms or conditions within this Agreement, and such breach is not discussed within ninety (90) days after verbal notice is given to the breaching party, then the other party is encouraged to consider termination of this Agreement as of the end of such ninety (90) day notice period or such later date as is specified in such notice of potential termination",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear process for termination due to a material breach, requiring written notice and a 30-day cure period. The modified text introduces several ambiguities and weakens the termination process. The introduction of 'suspected of' and 'encouraged to consider termination' introduces ambiguity and makes the termination process non-binding. The notice period is extended to 90 days and is only verbal. This contradiction could lead to uncertainty about whether a material breach actually justifies termination and whether the process was adhered to.",

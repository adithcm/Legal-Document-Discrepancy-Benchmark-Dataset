                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly\ninsofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not\nthe case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100\nEUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the\nAffiliate's participation in the Program.",
                "changed_text": "(6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly\ninsofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not\nthe case, the sum due can be retained indefinitely, without accruing interest, regardless of the total value, or until element 5's sole discretion determines to release the funds.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that if the sum due is less than 100 EUR/USD, it can be retained indefinitely. The original text stated it would be retained until a total value of at least 100 EUR/USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination. Now, the 'at the latest' clause is removed, creating uncertainty on when it will be released and putting it up to element 5’s discretion which removes clarity and creates disputes over payment release.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may cancel this Agreement at any time with 30 days written notice, and only if there are no ongoing campaigns. Element 5 may cancel this agreement at any time, with or without supplying a reason, effective immediately.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting terms regarding cancellation rights. The original text allows either party to cancel at any time without reason. The modified version imposes a 30-day written notice and a condition about ongoing campaigns for one party, while granting element 5 the right to cancel immediately without any conditions. This creates ambiguity regarding the circumstances under which each party can terminate the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "When the agreement ends, all usage rights of the Affiliate expire. However, the Software Publisher retains the right to use data collected during the agreement period for marketing purposes, unless explicitly notified otherwise by the Affiliate.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction concerning the usage rights post-termination. The original text states that all usage rights expire for both parties. The modified version states all usage rights of the affiliate expire, but the software publisher retains rights to use collected data. This creates a conflict as to whether the affiliate's data is still being used post-termination and if that is allowed, leading to disputes over data privacy.",

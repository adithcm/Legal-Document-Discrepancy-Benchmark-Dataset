Investor will not assign to any Third Party any rights under this IP Agreement not specifically transferable by its terms without the prior written consent of Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the foregoing: (1) such rights are assignable by Investor to an Affiliate of Investor, and (2) Investor’s rights in Investor Improvements and Joint Improvements shall be freely assignable by Investor to any Person.",

Investor will not assign to any Third Party any rights under this IP Agreement without the prior written consent of Company, such consent to be withheld at Company's sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the foregoing: (1) such rights are assignable by Investor to an Affiliate of Investor, but only with the express written consent of the Company, and (2) Investor’s rights in Investor Improvements and Joint Improvements shall only be assignable by Investor to another entity, and only for purposes relating to rare earth mineral processing and rare earth separation.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Company's consent to assignment 'not to be unreasonably withheld.' The modified text allows the consent to be 'withheld at Company's sole discretion,' creating a contradiction. Furthermore, the original text allows free assignment of Investor's rights in Investor Improvements and Joint Improvements to any Person, which is now limited in the modified text, creating further confusion.",

If Company fails to cure the identified breach within thirty (30) days after the date of the notice, Investor may terminate this IP Agreement by written notice to Company. However, such termination is only valid if the material breach directly affects Investor's rights concerning Patent prosecution.\n\n16.02 If the Option is not exercised before the expiration of the Option Period, Company may provide written notice to Investor of a material breach of this IP Agreement. If Investor fails to cure the identified breach within thirty (30) days after the date of the notice, Company may terminate this IP Agreement by written notice to Investor.

Conversely, Company originally could not terminate after the option was exercised, but now it can if the breach involves unauthorized disclosure.

The original also restricts the license use by Company and it's affiliates, while the modified license adds that the Investor has the right to restrict usage based on business interest. This introduces a contradiction regarding the license's stability and the Company's ability to rely on it.",

                "changed_text": "Licensed Product\nAny products sold directly by the Licensee under the brand name Nolazol, which directly incorporate NLS's original patents. Products utilizing only Developed Intellectual Property are excluded.",
                "explanation": "The original definition is broad, covering any product using any form of licensed IP. The modified version is much narrower, only covering products sold directly by the licensee under the 'Nolazol' brand that use the original patents. This creates a contradiction as products developed using the original IP but sold under a different brand name or through an affiliate may or may not be considered Licensed Products depending on which definition is used.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement mentions that royalty payments must be paid quarterly within 45 days following the close of the calendar quarter, while the modified text describes that royalty payments must be paid annually no more than 45 days after the close of the calendar year. This is a contradiction in payment terms of royalty.",

In this modification, Licensor shall be fully responsible for the labelling and packaging, and is also responsible to get all regulatory approvals. This creates a contradiction between the responsibilities of both parties.",

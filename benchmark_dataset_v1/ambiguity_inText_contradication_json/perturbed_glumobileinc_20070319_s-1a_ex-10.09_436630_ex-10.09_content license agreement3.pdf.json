                "explanation": "The change from 'limited, non-exclusive' to 'unlimited, exclusive' outside the US introduces a contradiction. The definition of rights granted is now conflicting within the same section, creating ambiguity regarding the scope of Licensee's distribution rights in different regions. The original text specifies limited rights, whereas the modified version grants an unlimited right, directly conflicting with the nature of rights granted in the US.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'Licensee may not recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee' is changed to 'Licensee may recoup 50% portion of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee'. This introduces a direct contradiction about whether recoupment is allowed or not, which affects the financial implications of the agreement. The original text strictly prohibits recoupment, while the changed version allows a 50% recoupment, leading to uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The clause relating to direct-to-consumer distribution royalty is changed to allow the licensee to receive a 25% share of revenues, directly contradicting the original clause that denied them any share or claim to the revenue.

                "changed_text": "“Performance Benchmarks” shall mean the following *suggested* requirements for Distributor to *strive to achieve* the exclusivity granted in Section 2.1 hereof: (a) the *attempted* execution of contracts to deploy Products in *approximately* 25 new locations *discussed* with Hydraspin (“Customer Locations”) during each 12 month period following the Effective Date and (b) all Customer Locations in the aggregate shall generate an average of *around* 7,500 barrels of fluid per day on a trailing 12 month basis.

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Performance Benchmarks' lays out specific, measurable requirements for maintaining exclusivity. The modified version introduces ambiguity by weakening the language with words like 'suggested,' 'strive to achieve,' 'approximately,' and 'around.' This makes it unclear whether the benchmarks are mandatory or merely aspirational, creating an internal contradiction with Section 2.1, which states exclusivity is 'subject to the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmarks'. It also creates ambiguity about if you dont do it, do you lose exclusivity.",

                "explanation": "This change replaces the originally binding language regarding order placement and delivery timelines (e.g., 'shall order,' 'the requested delivery date shall be no less than 120 days') with much weaker, discretionary terms ('may from time to time,' 'no fixed requirement,' 'try to use'). This introduces a contradiction because the rest of the contract, particularly the termination clauses relating to performance, could be interpreted as relying on the distributor placing consistent orders and Hydraspin delivering on time. The ambiguity makes it difficult to determine if a failure to place orders or deliver products constitutes a breach.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Hydraspin provides products, installation, and maintenance at no cost, except for their share of net revenue. This is a fundamental assumption of the agreement. The modification introduces ambiguity by adding qualifiers like 'endeavor,' 'unless otherwise agreed,' and 'make reasonable efforts.' This creates a contradiction because the agreement now implies that Hydraspin could potentially charge for these services or the revenue percentages can be negotiable, which undermines the distributor's expected profit margins and shifts unstated responsibilities to distributors, resulting in possible legal disputes.",

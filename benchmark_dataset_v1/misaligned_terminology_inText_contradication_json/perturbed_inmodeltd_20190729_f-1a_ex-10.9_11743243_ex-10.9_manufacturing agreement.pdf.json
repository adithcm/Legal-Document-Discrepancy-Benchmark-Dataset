In the first sentence, \"Contractor\" is replaced with \"Service Provider,\" but \"Customer\" is replaced with \"Client,\" referencing the earlier change. In the second sentence, the introduction of “Vendor” creates confusion as to which entity is responsible for quality assurance, as Vendor is undefined and used interchangeably with contractor.",

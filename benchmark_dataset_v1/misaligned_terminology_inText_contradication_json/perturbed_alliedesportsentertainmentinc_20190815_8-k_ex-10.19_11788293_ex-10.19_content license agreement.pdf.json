                "explanation": "The term 'game' is replaced with 'application' and 'offering'. While seemingly synonymous, in the context of digital distribution, these terms can have different legal implications regarding classification and associated regulations. This could lead to confusion about the agreement's scope, as the term 'game' has a more defined meaning under intellectual property law than 'application' or 'offering'.",

                "explanation": "The word 'Royalty' is changed to 'Commission', and 'Royalty' is renamed to 'Payment'. While in some contexts these might be considered similar, the term 'royalty' often implies ongoing rights to intellectual property, whereas 'commission' typically implies a transactional payment. This change creates confusion about whether the payments are tied to ongoing rights or simply a payment for services, which can affect dispute resolution.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Royalties' is changed to 'Remuneration', 'Net Revenue' to 'Net Earnings', 'gross revenues' to 'gross receipts', 'receivables' to 'profits', and 'Allowable Deductions' to 'Permissible Expenses'. While these terms are similar, 'Revenue' and 'Earnings' have distinct accounting meanings. 'Earnings' usually implies that some expenses have already been deducted. 'Deductions' and 'Expenses' are more generalized, the specific accounting implications of each are different. The lack of clarity might cause financial disagreement.",

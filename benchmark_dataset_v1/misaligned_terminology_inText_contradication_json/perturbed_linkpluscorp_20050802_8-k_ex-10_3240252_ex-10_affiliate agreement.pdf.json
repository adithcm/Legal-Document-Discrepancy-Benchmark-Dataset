                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, LKPL will provide Axiometric with a license to use office space in LKPL's corporate facility in Columbia, Maryland, free of charge. LKPL will allow Axiometric to use enough office space for two individuals and associated equipment in locations convenient for LKPL's purposes for as long as that space is available and not needed by LKPL for its own purposes.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, LKPL will provide Axiometric with a license to use office space in LKPL's corporate facility in Columbia, Maryland, free of charge. LKPL grants Axiometric access to office space suitable for two individuals, subject to availability and LKPL's operational needs.",
                "explanation": "The original text states LKPL *will allow* Axiometric to use enough office space for two individuals. The changed text uses 'grants access to office space suitable' which is less definite and introduces ambiguity. 'Enough' is more specific than 'suitable.' Furthermore, explicitly stating it's 'subject to availability and LKPL's operational needs' shifts the obligation further, making it less of a guarantee and more of a conditional arrangement, contradicting the initial 'will provide...free of charge'.",

The following shall be the general roles and responsibilities of the two companies with respect to AMR efforts: 3.1 AMR Products",
                "changed_text": "Axiometric and LKPL will collaborate to explore and potentially enter the AMR market. The extent of the collaboration, including the development, promotion, and sale of related product lines, remains subject to further agreement. The general roles and responsibilities of each company will be further defined in subsequent addendums, specifically related to the 'AMR Offerings'.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a definite agreement to jointly pursue the AMR market. The modified text uses weaker language ('will collaborate to explore and potentially enter') and introduces uncertainty about the extent of the collaboration. Replacing 'AMR Product Suites' with 'AMR Offerings' without defining it introduces a different scope, and the stipulation that roles and responsibilities will be defined later contradicts the original's intent to establish them upfront. This creates uncertainty about the commitment level and specific responsibilities of each party.",

                "changed_text": "For product sales related to AMR technologies by LKPL, excluding sales to Datamatic: LKPL will compensate Axiometric based on a mutually agreed upon percentage of profits, to be no less than five percent of gross revenue.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a precise calculation for payment. The modified text introduces ambiguity by changing 'AMR Product Suites' to 'product sales related to AMR technologies', which is broader and undefined. Replacing 'the higher of' with 'a mutually agreed upon percentage of profits, to be no less than five percent of gross revenue' removes the guaranteed higher amount and introduces a negotiation element, contradicting the original's defined payment structure. It also changes proceeds to revenue and eliminates definition of net proceeds.",

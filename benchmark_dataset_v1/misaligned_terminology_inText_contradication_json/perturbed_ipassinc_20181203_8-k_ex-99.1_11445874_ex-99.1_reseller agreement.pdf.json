                "explanation": "The definition of “Channel Partner” is changed to “Partner,” but many sections still reference “Channel Partner.” This creates ambiguity as to whether “Partner” and “Channel Partner” are interchangeable. Additionally, it is stated that capitalized terms 'may not be defined' making the interpretation of capitalized terms ambiguous and uncertain.",

                "explanation": "Here Partner, Supplier, Channel Partner and Reseller are all used interchangeably without being clearly defined as referencing the same party or having the same responsibilities. This lack of clarity creates confusion as to which party is being assigned the responsibilities and rights listed, and whether or not they are the same entity. This can lead to disputes over contract performance and breach.",

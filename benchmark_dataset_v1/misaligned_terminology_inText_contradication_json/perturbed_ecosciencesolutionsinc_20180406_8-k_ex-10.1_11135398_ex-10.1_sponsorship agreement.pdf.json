                "explanation": "The term 'Promoter' is used to describe both Fruit of Life Productions LLC and, in this modification, Eco Science Solutions, Inc. This creates an internal contradiction because previously 'Promoter' was only defined for Fruit of Life Productions LLC. Changing it to 'Contributor' creates a scenario where the Sponsor is now also seemingly acting as a promoter, confusing roles and responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Promoter' with 'Producer' introduces a new, undefined term. While 'Promoter' was initially defined, 'Producer' is not, leading to ambiguity about who the Sponsor is contracting with. This could be interpreted as a clerical error, but it does introduce uncertainty about the involved parties and the contract's enforceability, especially if 'Producer' has specific legal connotations in the context of event sponsorship.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Promoter' to 'Organizer' adds to the confusion by bringing in another undefined term. Now, it is unclear who is dictating banner placement. While a reasonable person could assume 'Organizer' refers to Fruit of Life Productions LLC, the lack of explicit definition allows for the Sponsor to dispute the interpretation, creating potential for conflict and uncertainty in fulfilling the agreement.",

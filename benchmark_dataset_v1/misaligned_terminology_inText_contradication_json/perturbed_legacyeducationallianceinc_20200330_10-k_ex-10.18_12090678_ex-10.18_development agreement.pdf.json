For these purposes, “control” means: (a) the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct the management or policies of an entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; or (b) the ownership, directly or indirectly, of at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities or other ownership interest of an entity.",

For these purposes, “control” means: (a) the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct the management or policies of an entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; or (b) the ownership, directly or indirectly, of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting securities or other ownership interest of an entity.",
                "explanation": "The definition of Affiliate includes a definition of control. By changing the percentage of ownership required for control from 50% to 25%, this introduces a contradiction within the definition of affiliate, making it unclear when an entity is considered an affiliate.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Cash Sales' to 'Gross Revenue' for the final royalty tier introduces ambiguity. It's unclear whether 'Gross Revenue' includes the same deductions as 'Cash Sales' (defined in 1.3), leading to a potential dispute over how the royalty is calculated for the highest sales tier. This creates inconsistent financial obligations based on similar but undefined terms.",

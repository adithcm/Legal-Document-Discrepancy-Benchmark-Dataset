                "explanation": "The definition of \"Client\" is modified to create ambiguity. Initially, both SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings could introduce any person/entity within covered regions as a client. The revised text states that for Moelis Holdings, a 'Client' only refers to Japanese Companies and not other entities, thereby contradicting the initial part of the definition.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Client' is replaced with \"Customer\" in the modified text. Although seemingly similar, this replacement introduces potential ambiguity as the contract consistently uses 'Client' in various other sections, and it never defines \"Customer\". Furthermore, the phrase \"in all material respects\" is replaced with \"in all respects\", therefore, creating a higher, stricter standard of compliance than initially intended.",

Sekisui shall be permitted to appoint sub-distributors in the Territory (including any current Qualigen distributors) with the approval of Qualigen, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Sekisui shall purchase the Products exclusively from Qualigen, and Qualigen shall supply the Products exclusively to Sekisui, in each case for the Territory. Qualigen shall assign to Sekisui Qualigen’s agreements with Qualigen’s current distributors (such that such current Qualigen distributors shall become Sekisui subdistributors), each of which is set forth on Schedule 2.1 hereto; if any of such agreements do not allow such assignment and the current distributor declines to consent to such an assignment to Sekisui, Qualigen shall (if Sekisui so requests) act pursuant to such agreement to terminate such agreement.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'distributor' and 'supplier' are used interchangeably without clearly defining their different roles. This creates ambiguity because the obligations of a 'distributor' versus a 'supplier' can be distinct regarding sales, marketing, and support responsibilities. The second portion of the paragraph mentions 'current distributors', without amending this to current suppliers, further muddling the understanding.",

Sekisui shall not imprint or affix any of its (or any non-Qualigen person’s) trade names, brand names, trademarks or logos to any Product or its packaging or labeling, and shall also cause its subdistributors not to do so.

                "explanation": "The interchangeable use of 'logos' and 'symbols' without a clear definition creates confusion. While generally understood, in a legal context, their scope might differ. Are symbols inclusive of logos, or do they encompass other graphical elements? The inconsistency introduces ambiguity regarding what Sekisui is prohibited from altering or adding.",

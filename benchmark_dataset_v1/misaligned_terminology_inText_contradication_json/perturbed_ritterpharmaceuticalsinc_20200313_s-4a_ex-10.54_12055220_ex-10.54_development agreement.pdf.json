Sekisui shall be permitted to appoint sub-distributors in the Territory (including any current Qualigen distributors) with the approval of Qualigen, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.",

Sekisui shall be permitted to appoint sub-agents in the Territory (including any current Qualigen distributors) with the approval of Qualigen, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'sub-distributors' to 'sub-agents' creates uncertainty about the nature of the relationship between Sekisui and these entities. Are they acting as independent distributors or as agents of Sekisui? This can affect liability and responsibility.",

Except as set forth in Section 3.2, such forecasts and budgets are intended for guidance purposes only and are not binding obligations.",
                "explanation": "The substitution of the word 'targets' for 'objectives' creates ambiguity. 'Objectives' often implies broad strategic goals, while 'targets' can suggest specific, measurable metrics. This shift blurs the line between aspirational goals and contractual obligations.",

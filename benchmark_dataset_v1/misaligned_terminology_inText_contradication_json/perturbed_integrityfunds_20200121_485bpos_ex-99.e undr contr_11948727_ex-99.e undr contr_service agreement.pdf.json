                "original_text": "In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive the excess, if any, of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as underwriter. The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the “Plan”) adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive the excess, if any, of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as distributor. The Fund shall also pay Integrity any marketing expenses applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Marketing Initiative (the “Initiative”) adopted by the Fund and set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement. Such expenses shall be payable at the Fund's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The change replaces the term 'underwriter' with 'distributor,' creating confusion whether Integrity is acting as an underwriter or distributor for compensation calculation. Additionally, 'distribution and/or service fees' has been replaced with 'marketing expenses' and the fixed 'Shareholder Services Plan' with a discretionary 'Shareholder Marketing Initiative', changing the nature and certainty of payment.",

                "changed_text": "The Fund agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Integrity, its several officers and directors, and any person who manages Integrity within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the cost of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) which Integrity, its officers and directors, or any such managing person may incur under the 1933 Act, state law, or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any misleading statement or alleged misleading statement of a fact contained in any marketing material, any sales document, or any supplemental information, or arising out of or based upon any exclusion or alleged exclusion to state a fact required to be stated in any marketing material, any sales document, or any supplemental information, or necessary to make the statements in any of them accurate",
                "explanation": "The terms 'governors' is replaced with 'directors', 'controls' with 'manages', 'common law' with 'state law', 'untrue statement of a material fact' with 'misleading statement of a fact', 'registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information' with 'marketing material, any sales document, or any supplemental information', and 'omission' with 'exclusion' creating inconsistencies that significantly alter the scope of indemnification and creates uncertainty regarding the governing laws.",

This Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) on 60 days’ written notice, by vote of a majority of the Relevant Trustees or by vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Fund or (b) on 90 days’ written notice by the Distributor. This Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of a transfer of rights.",
                "explanation": "This section now contains mismatched terminology. The term “Qualified Trustees” has been replaced with 'Relevant Trustees', and voting securities are replaced with the vaguer 'shareholders'. 'Integrity' is now named the 'Distributor' in the event of termination of the contract, however, at the beginning of the document it is referenced as 'Integrity'. Also the phrase 'assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act)' is replaced with “transfer of rights”, leading to questions over the interpretation of termination. Due to the uncertainty over who can actually terminate the agreement, it could significantly reduce the value to either party.",

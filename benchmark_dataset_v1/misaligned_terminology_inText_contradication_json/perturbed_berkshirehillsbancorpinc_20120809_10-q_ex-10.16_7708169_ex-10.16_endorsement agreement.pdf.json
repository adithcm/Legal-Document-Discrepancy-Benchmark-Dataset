                "explanation": "Changing 'PARTIES' to 'Individual' creates ambiguity as to whether 'PARTY' always refers to multiple entities or can also refer to a single person. This could lead to disputes regarding obligations that apply to single vs. multiple entities.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Parties' to 'Participants' introduces a new, undefined term. It's unclear whether 'Participants' refers to the same entities as 'Parties' or something else, creating confusion about who is bound by the contract terms.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'provision(s)' to 'term(s)' creates inconsistency. While seemingly similar, legal 'provisions' encompass broader aspects than individual 'terms'. This raises questions about the scope of severability; does invalidating a term invalidate the entire related provision?",

                "original_text": "(b) Licensee shall have the right to assign or sublicense any or all of its rights granted under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to third parties exhibiting the Titles in the ordinary course of Licensee’s business with prior written notice to Licensor. Except as otherwise specified in the previous sentence, Licensee may not sublicense any of its rights under Section 2(a) without Licensor’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Licensee shall have the right to assign or transfer any or all of its rights granted under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to third parties exhibiting the Titles in the ordinary course of Licensee’s business with prior written notice to Licensor. Except as otherwise specified in the previous sentence, Licensee may not sublicense any of its rights under Section 2(a) without Licensor’s prior authorization, which shall be subject to Licensor's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'assign' and 'sublicense' are used interchangeably with 'transfer' and 'authorization'. The change from 'consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld' to 'authorization, which shall be subject to Licensor's sole discretion' creates a significant contradiction regarding the Licensor's power over the Licensee's actions, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'User information' to 'Subscriber data' and 'Confidential Information' to 'Private Data' introduces ambiguity about the scope and handling of this information. The added phrase 'managed according to prevailing internet laws' is vague and potentially conflicts with the initial statement of ownership by Licensee, making the obligations unclear.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'User inquiries' to 'Customer issues' and 'Titles' to 'Films' without defining the terms introduces ambiguity. The shift from 'will provide reasonable assistance' to 'may provide optional support' significantly weakens the Licensor's obligation and adds uncertainty about the level and type of support Licensee can expect.",

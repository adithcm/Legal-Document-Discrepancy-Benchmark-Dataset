All capitalized terms contained herein shall have the same meaning as the terms defined in the Agreement unless specifically modified in this Amendment.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Distributor' to 'Reseller' without defining 'Reseller' creates ambiguity. The agreement refers to ScanSource, Inc. as 'Distributor' in some places and 'Reseller' in others without clarifying if these terms are interchangeable. This could lead to disputes over rights and responsibilities if the terms are interpreted differently.",

The above-referenced cap shall be determined based on all Product purchases made under this Agreement. The responsibility to manage the Balancing Cap shall rest solely upon Distributor. Distributor shall be entitled to return Product once per quarter, provided such returns do not exceed the Balancing Cap. \"Dead on Arrival\" and Obsolete Products returned pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement shall be excluded from calculation of the Balancing Cap. Cisco shall credit Distributor's account in the amount of the price paid by Distributor therefore, less any price protection credits issued to Distributor related to the Product returned (the \"Return Credit\").",

                "explanation": "The term 'Distributor' is replaced with 'Retailer' in the first sentence of section 12.1 and some other parts, but not consistently throughout the section. The section is still referencing to 'Distributor' in the middle. This creates an internal contradiction: is it the 'Retailer' or the 'Distributor' who manages the Balancing Cap and can return product? The term is being used interchangeably without definition.",

                "explanation": "Here, in section 21.1, 'Distributor' is changed to 'Partner' in the first paragraph and 'Sales Agent' in the immediate next. Because both term names exist in the same section, an uncertainty as to which entity has which obligations arises. This creates confusion regarding compliance responsibilities.",

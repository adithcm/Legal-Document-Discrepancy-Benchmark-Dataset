                "explanation": "The term 'Seller' is changed to 'Vendor' in subsection (i). This creates ambiguity because 'Seller' is a defined term at the begining of the contract and not 'Vendor'. Introducing an undefined, potentially conflicting term makes enforcement uncertain because it is unclear whether the restrictions in (i) apply to all the entities defined as 'Sellers' or some other group.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of\nBuyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their\nrespective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by\nmeans of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former\nemployees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the\nNon-Solicit Period.",

                "explanation": "In section 1(d), 'employee' is replaced with 'personnel' in subsection (i). The term 'personnel' is broader and undefined in the contract. This creates uncertainty in what is exactly covered. Does it now include contractors of the combined business? By using these terms interchangeably it creates conflicting obligations.",

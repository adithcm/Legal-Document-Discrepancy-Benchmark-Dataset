                "explanation": "Changing 'health services web site' to 'health content platform' introduces a subtle shift in the nature of HCI's offering. This could lead to disputes about whether HCI is obligated to provide actual health services or just health-related content, affecting the scope of their responsibilities under the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'general terms and conditions' with 'overall terms of service' creates ambiguity. It becomes unclear whether MediaLinx's approval extends to all terms, including specific clauses, or only the broad, overarching terms. This can lead to disagreements about which terms require MediaLinx's consent, affecting operational flexibility.",

                "explanation": "Switching 'generally available to the public' to 'publicly known' changes the scope of what constitutes non-confidential information. 'Publicly known' suggests a higher threshold of widespread awareness, potentially conflicting with the broader concept of general availability. This difference can create disputes regarding the confidentiality obligations of each party.",

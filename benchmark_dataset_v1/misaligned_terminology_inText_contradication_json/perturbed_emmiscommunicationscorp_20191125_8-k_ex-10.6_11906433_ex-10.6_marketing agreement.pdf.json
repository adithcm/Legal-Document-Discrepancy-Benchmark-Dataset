The broadcasting facility has the capability to transmit an in-band, on-channel (“IBOC”) digital broadcast signal.",
                "explanation": "The terms “radio station” is replaced with “broadcast outlet” and 'Station' is replaced with 'broadcasting facility', which are used interchangeably without definition. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the scope of the agreement, particularly regarding regulatory compliance and operational responsibilities. It is unclear if 'broadcast outlet' and 'broadcasting facility' have the same meaning as 'radio station'.",

                "explanation": "The term “Programmer” is replaced with “Content Provider”. This creates confusion over the entity responsible for music licenses. The original text clearly states that the 'Programmer' obtains the licenses. By replacing this with 'Content Provider' without defining it, it introduces a potential conflict, especially if 'Content Provider' and 'Programmer' are interpreted as different entities within the agreement.",

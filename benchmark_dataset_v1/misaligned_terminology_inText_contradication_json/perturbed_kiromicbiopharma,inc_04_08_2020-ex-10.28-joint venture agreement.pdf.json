                "original_text": "Kiromic is committed to bear all costs necessary for R&D, including all clinical development costs, according to the terms and conditions set out in point n. 3;",
                "changed_text": "Kiromic is responsible for some expenses related to R&D, including select clinical development costs, subject to budget approval and point n. 3;",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states 'committed to bear all costs', implying a firm obligation. The revised text introduces ambiguity by stating 'responsible for some expenses' and 'subject to budget approval'. This creates uncertainty about the extent of Kiromic's financial commitment and introduces a potential conflict, as budget approval is not defined, thus making enforcement difficult. This changes a definitive obligation to a conditional one.",

                "original_text": "The Steering Committee shall appoint, within 30 days of the signature of this JV, a Technical Committee composed of one representative of each of the Parties in relation to each specific clinical trial program, which shall have the function of coordinating the technical and administrative activities to be undertaken in the framework of this JV.",
                "changed_text": "The Steering Committee may consider appointing, at their discretion, a Project Coordination Group, which might include representatives from each Party, to assist in coordinating specific actions of this JV.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the mandatory 'shall appoint' with the discretionary 'may consider appointing'. The original text mandates the creation of a Technical Committee, while the revised text makes it optional and renames the committee to 'Project Coordination Group'. Also, replacing 'Technical Committee' with 'Project Coordination Group' is never clearly defined, which makes the enforcement of the original term confusing. This undermines the originally intended structure for technical coordination, making it difficult to enforce specific responsibilities related to the original mandatory committee.",

                "changed_text": "Rights to discoveries are typically shared, unless otherwise specified by partner leadership. Individual contributions may be recognized as appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a specific 50/50 split for intellectual property rights. The edited version introduces a much vaguer 'typically shared, unless otherwise specified by partner leadership', which can lead to disputes. Additionally, the document fails to define the term 'discoveries', which could cause disputes. Replacing 'Intellectual Property Rights' with 'rights to discoveries' is undefined, and undermines the original specific allocation of IP rights, creating an in-text contradiction.",

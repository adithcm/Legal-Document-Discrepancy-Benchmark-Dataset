                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Royalty,' but the modified text substitutes it with 'compensation.' While both are payments, 'royalty' typically implies a percentage of revenue, whereas 'compensation' is broader and could be interpreted as a fixed fee, leading to potential disputes over payment structure.",

                "explanation": "Using “Remuneration” and “Compensation” interchangeably and then referring back to “Royalties” creates confusion. It's unclear if “Remuneration” or “Compensation” is intended to be different than “Royalties”, potentially affecting payment amounts.",

                "explanation": "By changing “Indemnification” to “Protection” in the header and “negligent” to “intentional” changes the standard of care ArTara is held to for liability, while the body of the section still mentions indemnification, and creates an internal conflict. Indemnification typically covers negligence, while making it intentional creates a contradiction of standard of care to be protected against.",

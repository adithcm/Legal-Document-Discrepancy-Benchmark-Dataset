Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to require Lucent to enforce any rights against third parties or to restrict Lucent's rights to license or consent to such third parties' use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo or any other Lucent marks.",

In this context, it could lead to disputes over whether services or software, if associated with the logo, also fall under the exception allowing continued use after termination.",

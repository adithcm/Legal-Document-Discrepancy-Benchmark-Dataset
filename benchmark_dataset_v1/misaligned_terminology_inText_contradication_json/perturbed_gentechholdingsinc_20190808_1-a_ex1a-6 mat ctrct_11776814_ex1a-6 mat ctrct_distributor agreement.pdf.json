                "explanation": "The document uses the terms 'customers' and 'consumers' interchangeably. This creates a contradiction as customers are usually intended to mean wholesalers and retailers that are purchasing with the intent of resale. 'Consumers' are the end-users of the product. There is no specification of what these terms mean. The lack of distinction between these categories introduces uncertainty regarding the scope of the exclusive distribution rights and potential restrictions on the Distributor's sales channels.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'Customer', 'Client', and 'purchaser' are used seemingly interchangeably, but they relate to distinct entities within the sales process. A client might be the overarching entity establishing the relationship, the purchaser is completing the transaction, and the customer is being used to refer to the business relationship within the sales channel. Since the contract requires the distributor to wire transfer funds to these entities, there should be a distinction between which is being used.",

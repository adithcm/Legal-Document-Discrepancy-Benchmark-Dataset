                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be responsible for' to 'is in charge of' for VerticalNet in part (a) but then assigning responsibility to Impresse in part (b) creates ambiguity. It's unclear who ultimately bears the responsibility for the V-Solutions Link. It also uses different terms such as 'shall be responsible for' and 'in charge of', to describe the same concept but assigns it to different entities, creating a contradiction.",

Such payments will be provided with a report of the details regarding the type and amount of transactions.",
                "explanation": "The modification of 'shall pay' to 'may provide' reduces the obligation of Impresse to pay and makes it permissive. Also, the term 'payable to VerticalNet on or before the thirtieth day of the calendar quarter' is changed to 'payable to VerticalNet at a mutually agreed upon date'. This creates uncertainty of payment obligation. It also changes the term 'statement' to a 'report' for describing transaction details.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall bear interest' to 'will be subject to a late fee' changes the term used. Additionally, changing 'the maximum rate permitted by law' to 'a reasonable charge amount' introduces ambiguity as 'reasonable charge' is subjective and undefined. It changes 'payments' to 'dues' and 'date payments are actually paid' to 'date the dues are satisfied'.",

AFFILIATE shall mean, when used with reference to a party, any\nindividual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under\ncommon control with such party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means\nthe direct or indirect ownership of at least 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of a party, or the right to control the policy decisions of such\nparty.",
                "changed_text": "1.  DEFINITIONS\n     1.1. ASSOCIATE shall mean, when used with reference to a party, any\nindividual or entity directly or indirectly influencing, influenced by or under\ncommon ownership with such party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means\nthe direct ownership of at least 25% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of a party, or the ability to suggest policy decisions of such\nparty.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'AFFILIATE' is changed to 'ASSOCIATE', and the definition of 'control' is modified to be less restrictive. 'influencing' is not synonymous with 'controlling'. Reduces ownership percentage to 25%. This creates uncertainty about which entities are bound by the affiliate clauses in the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changes have been made to the wording in Section 3.1 to weaken the standard of effort required. 'Commercially reasonable efforts' is swapped to 'endeavor to'. Also, 'best efforts' replaces 'reasonable efforts'. As well as, VerticalNet must now respond with 3 'Business Days' (opposed to 1). The changes in terminology and duty create uncertainty in the standard of support required from each party and the timeframe each must adhere to.",

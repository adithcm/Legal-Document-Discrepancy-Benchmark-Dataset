Heritage and Premier are each referred to herein as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties.”",

Heritage and Premier are each referred to herein as a “Party” and collectively as the “Vendors.”",
                "explanation": "The term 'Parties' is changed to 'Vendors'. It's inconsistent because the agreement initially defines Heritage and Premier as 'Parties,' but later refers to them collectively as 'Vendors.' This creates confusion as to whether the terms are interchangeable, and it opens the agreement to challenges based on inconsistent naming.",

The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019.

                "explanation": "The term 'Contract Period' is replaced with 'Trading Window'. This causes the agreement to be internally inconsistent regarding the designated timeline/period. The contract has established 'Contract Period' in previous sentence, while another sentence replaces it with 'Trading Window'. This inconsistency creates ambiguity, as it is unclear if both of these terms can be used interchangeably.",

                "explanation": "The word 'conditions' is replaced with 'provisions', and 'covenants' with 'understandings'. This creates an internal contradiction because the agreement initially specifies 'terms, conditions and covenants' as binding elements, whereas the modified text refers to 'terms, provisions and understandings'. It becomes ambiguous whether 'conditions,' 'covenants,' 'provisions,' and 'understandings' are synonymous or distinct elements, potentially affecting enforcement and interpretation.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "VerticalNet hereby grants LeadersOnline a non-exclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free right and license for the Term of this Agreement to utilize a VerticalNet Mark in a form approved by VerticalNet for the design and display of  the VerticalNet Branded Link.",
                "changed_text": "VerticalNet hereby grants LeadersOnline a non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free right and license for the Term of this Agreement to utilize a VerticalNet Mark in a form approved by VerticalNet for the design and display of  the VerticalNet Branded Link.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the license is 'non-transferable', while the modified text states that the license is 'transferable.' This directly contradicts the terms of the license and creates uncertainty in the rights of the parties. It is now unclear whether LeadersOnline can assign or sublicense the right to use the VerticalNet Mark.",

                "original_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other Party in the event of any material breach of a term of this Agreement by such other Party that remains uncured 30 days after notice of such breach was received by such other Party or, if the breach is not reasonably capable of cure within 30 days, such longer period, not to exceed 60 days, so long as the cure is commenced within the 30-day period and thereafter is diligently prosecuted to completion as soon as possible and in any event within 60 days.",
                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other Party in the event of any material breach of a term of this Agreement by such other Party that remains uncured 30 days after notice of such breach was received by such other Party. If the breach is not capable of cure, the non-breaching party can terminate the agreement at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a cure period of 30 days for material breaches, with a possible extension to 60 days if the breach is difficult to cure. The modified version removes the potential for an extended cure period and permits immediate termination at the discretion of the non-breaching party if the breach is 'not capable of cure'. This creates a contradiction as to the rights and obligations of the parties in the event of a breach.",

                "changed_text": "Any controversy or claim between the Parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by non-binding mediation. If mediation fails, either party may pursue litigation in the courts.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates binding arbitration for dispute resolution, while the modified text removes this requirement and replaces it with non-binding mediation, followed by the option for litigation. This is a direct contradiction regarding the method of resolving disputes arising from the agreement. It creates ambiguity regarding whether disputes should be arbitrated or litigated and undermines the enforceability of the original arbitration clause.",

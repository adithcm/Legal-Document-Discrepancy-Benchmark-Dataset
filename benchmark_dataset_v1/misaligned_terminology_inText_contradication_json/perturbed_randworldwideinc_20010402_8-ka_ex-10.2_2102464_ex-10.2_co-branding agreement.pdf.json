                "explanation": "The term \"Net Revenue\" is replaced with \"Net Earnings,\" \"customers\" with \"users,\" and \"resellers\" with \"distributors.\" Although seemingly similar, these terms have different financial and operational implications. \"Net Earnings\" typically refers to profit after all expenses, while \"Net Revenue\" is revenue after deductions. The shift from \"customers\" to \"users\" could imply different usage rights or service levels. Finally, \"resellers\" and \"distributors\" have varying responsibilities in the sales channel. This inconsistency creates uncertainty about how revenue is calculated and shared.",

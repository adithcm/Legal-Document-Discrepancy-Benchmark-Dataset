The party responsible for documentation fees and costs will be the Customer.",

The responsibility for document-related charges and expenses will rest with the Client.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Manufacturer,' 'Products,' 'Territories,' and 'Customer' have been replaced with 'Supplier,' 'Goods,' 'Regions,' and 'Client,' respectively. It's now ambiguous if these terms refer to the same entities or concepts, which may lead to disagreement over the responsibilities for supplying documentation and who bears the associated costs.",

All freight, insurance, and other delivery expenses shall be the responsibility of the Customer.",

'Products' became 'Items', 'Agreement' is now 'Contract,' 'Manufacturer' is changed to 'Vendor,' 'Customer' to 'Buyer', 'Recipient' and 'Territories' to 'Areas.' Introducing 'Recipient' and 'Customer' as potentially different entities responsible for shipping costs creates ambiguity about who actually pays.",

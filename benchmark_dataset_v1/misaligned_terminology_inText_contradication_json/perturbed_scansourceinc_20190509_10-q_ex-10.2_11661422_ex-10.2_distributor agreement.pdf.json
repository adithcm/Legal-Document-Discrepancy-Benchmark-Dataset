By changing \"Distributor\" to \"Reseller\" in this specific definition, we introduce ambiguity. It's unclear whether the rest of the contract, which uses \"Distributor,\" now also refers to this new definition of \"Reseller\", or if \"Distributor\" still refers to the original definition, potentially creating uncertainty about which entity is bound by the distributor obligations throughout the document.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the process for ordering products requires the distributor to do so. By replacing 'Distributor' with 'Customer' only in this section, it raises questions. Is the customer allowed to place orders directly, even if not a distributor? Are orders placed by distributor different than orders placed by the customer. It creates confusion regarding who is authorized to place the order.",

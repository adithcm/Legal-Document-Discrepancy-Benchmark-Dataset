                "explanation": "The first sentence states that the Distributor must maintain stock in ScanSource's inventory. The third sentence says that if inventory levels fall below a goal, Xplore will notify the Distributor Group. This creates an internal contradiction. The Distributor may interpret that only ScanSource, Inc.'s inventory counts towards the stock levels, relieving its affiliates. Xplore, on the other hand, may expect stock levels of all \"Distributor Group\" entities to be aggregated. The written notice to the \"Distributor Group\" puts the other ScanSource companies on notice for something that is not expected of them.",

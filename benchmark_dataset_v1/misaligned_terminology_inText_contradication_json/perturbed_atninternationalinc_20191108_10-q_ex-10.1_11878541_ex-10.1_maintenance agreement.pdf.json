Vendor completes Delivery of\nMaterial or Completion of Services: (i) in the case of any Cell Site (and all Material and Services\nincorporated therein or related thereto) upon Location Acceptance, and (ii) in the case of delivery of\nMaterial or Services that are required to be delivered prior to or following Location Acceptance, (A)\nupon AT&T’s possession of the Material if Vendor is not required to provide additional Services, such as\ninstallation, (B) upon completing such additional Services, if Vendor is required to provide such Services in\nconnection with providing Material, or (C) for Services, upon completing the provision of Services.\nNotwithstanding the above, Delivery and Completion shall not be deemed to have occurred until Vendor\ncauses the Material and Services to strictly conform to the Specifications and in the case of any Cell Site,\nLocation Acceptance has occurred.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines strict conformance as a requirement. The modified text uses 'Fulfillment' instead of 'Completion' and states 'substantially conform' which is contradictory. The shift from 'strictly conform' to 'substantially conform' introduces ambiguity, making enforcement difficult.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces 'Supplier' instead of 'Vendor', 'small fee' instead of 'no additional cost', 'general technical assistance' instead of 'full and complete technical assistance' and 'responsibility' instead of 'Warranty'. 'Supplier' has not been defined in this section and has been defined as a different entity elsewhere. The change to 'general' assistance diminishes the level of service and creates confusion about its completeness and the introduction of the small fee is a point of uncertainty, leading to potential disputes during enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Subcontractor' with 'Outside Contractor' introduces a potential contradiction. The document now inconsistently uses both terms.

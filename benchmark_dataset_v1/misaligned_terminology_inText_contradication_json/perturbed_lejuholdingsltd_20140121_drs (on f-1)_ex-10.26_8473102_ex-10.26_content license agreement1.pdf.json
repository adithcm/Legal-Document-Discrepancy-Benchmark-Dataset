Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensee shall be entitled to exercise exclusive control over all aspects of the websites and the Business associated with the Licensed Domain Names including, without limitation, the operation, the look-and-feel and the Content of such websites.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensee shall be entitled to exercise considerable influence over all aspects of the websites and the Business associated with the Licensed Domain Names including, without limitation, the operation, the look-and-feel and the Content of such websites.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'exclusive control' to 'considerable influence' weakens the Licensee's rights and creates ambiguity, because the original wording entails the licensee has ultimate authority on the website, while the new wording implies the licensor may also exert control.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Force Majeure\" to \"Unforeseen Circumstances\" broadens the scope of excused non-performance, without specifying what other events would qualify. This creates an internal contradiction by using a specific term (\"Force Majeure\" is usually understood to have a specific legal definition) and replacing it with a vague one, allowing for potential disputes regarding what qualifies as an \"Unforeseen Circumstance\" versus a traditionally understood \"Force Majeure\" event. This is made worse by not defining \"Unforeseen Circumstances.\"",

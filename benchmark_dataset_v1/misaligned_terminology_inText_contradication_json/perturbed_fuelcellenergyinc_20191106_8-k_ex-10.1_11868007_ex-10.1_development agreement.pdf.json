                "explanation": "The terms \"Research Costs\", \"Development Costs\", \"Project\", and \"Undertaking\" are used without clear distinction. The paragraph opens referring to Project Costs then substitutes it with Development Costs, with the sentence later referring to Investigation Costs. The paragraph mentions the total cumulative cost to be no more than the 'Total Research Cost'. It is unclear whether Development Costs fall under Research Costs, or if 'Undertaking' is defined as 'Project'. This makes it difficult to understand how much ExxonMobil is obligated to reimburse, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The terms have been switched out with other synonyms; these changes introduce internal contradiction by using unnecessarily formal terminology (\"formulation,\" \"transmittal,\" \"fruition\") which obscure meaning, making it more difficult to interpret the declarations and guarantees. Changing \"Party\" to \"Organization\" and \"Agreement\" to \"Accord\" without properly defining these terms creates confusion and makes it unclear who is subject to the warranty and what the warranty covers.",

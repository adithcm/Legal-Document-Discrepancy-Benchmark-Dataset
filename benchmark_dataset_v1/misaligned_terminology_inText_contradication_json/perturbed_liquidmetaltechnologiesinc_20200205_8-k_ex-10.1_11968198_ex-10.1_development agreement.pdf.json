In consideration of the license of Liquidmetal Technical Information and the Licensed Equipment granted by\nLiquidmetal, Eutectix agrees to pay Liquidmetal a cash royalty based on a percentage of the invoice price of any Licensed\nProducts (but not including Liquidmetal Products) sold by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees and for which payment was\nactually received by Eutectix. The cash royalty shall be an amount equal to six percent (6.0%) of the Net Sales Price of the\ninvoice price of any Licensed Products and for which payment was actually received by Eutectix (the “Liquidmetal Royalty”).\n“Net Sales Price” is defined as the gross invoice price actually received by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees on the sale\nof Licensed Products, less returns or refunds, but before deduction of cash discounts. The Net Sales Price shall be\ncommercially reasonable, and in no case shall the Net Sales Price be less than the cost of material consumed in a single\nmanufacturing cycle, divided by the number of Licensed Products produced by such single cycle. The Liquidmetal Royalty\nshall be paid in U.S. dollars within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, based on payments received for sales of\nLicensed Products made during a given quarter. Liquidmetal hereby waives the payment of any Liquidmetal Royalty\notherwise due and payable pursuant to this Agreement until the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Date.",
                "changed_text": "2.7\nRemuneration. In consideration of the license of Liquidmetal Technical Information and the Licensed Equipment granted by\nLiquidmetal, Eutectix may provide Liquidmetal a cash consideration based on a discretionary percentage of the invoice price of any Licensed\nProducts (but not including Liquidmetal Products) sold by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees and for which payment was\nactually received by Eutectix. The compensation may be an amount equal to six percent (6.0%) of the Gross Sales Price of the\ninvoice price of any Licensed Products and for which payment was actually received by Eutectix (the “Liquidmetal Remuneration”).\n“Gross Sales Price” is defined as the invoice price received by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees on the sale\nof Licensed Products, including returns or refunds, after deduction of cash discounts. The Gross Sales Price will not be\ncommercially reasonable. The Liquidmetal Remuneration\nwill be paid at Eutectix's sole discretion and is not obligated to be paid in U.S. dollars at the end of each calendar quarter, and not based on payments received for sales of\nLicensed Products made during a given quarter. Liquidmetal may not be entitled to any Liquidmetal Remuneration\npursuant to this Agreement at any time.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed royalty percentage and payment terms. The modified version changes 'Royalty' to 'Remuneration', making the payment discretionary, altering the calculation basis to 'Gross Sales Price' (including returns) and waiving the obligation to pay in USD or on a quarterly basis. This creates a contradiction as the original clause mandates a royalty, while the modified clause turns it into a discretionary payment, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear warranty, meaning that Eutectix guarantees certain qualities of the product. The modified text waters this down by changing 'Warranty' to 'Assurance', introducing vagueness with terms like 'generally conform' and 'may contain,' and negating the guarantee of being 'free and clear of all liens'. Furthermore, it suggests the warranty may not survive delivery, inspection, and payment, contradicting the standard warranty structure and creating uncertainty about its scope and duration.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear obligation for Liquidmetal to purchase raw material inventory at a defined price and pay amounts rightfully owing. The modified version changes 'shall purchase' to 'may consider purchasing', 'purchase price' to 'reduced price that Liquidmetal will solely determine', and 'unconditional right' to 'conditional right'. It also shifts the cost of repossession to Eutectix. This contradicts the original clause, which mandates a purchase and payment, creating significant uncertainty about Liquidmetal's obligations upon termination and opening the door for potential disputes about the value of inventory and outstanding payments.",

                "original_text": "During the Term, VerticalNet shall not (a) act as an advertising agent or representative for any PaperExchange Competitor and (b) place any advertisements on Pulp and Paper Online from any PaperExchange Competitor.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, VerticalNet shall not (a) act as an advertising agent or representative for any PaperExchange Rival and (b) place any advertisements on Pulp and Paper Online from any PaperExchange Competitor.",
                "explanation": "The term 'PaperExchange Competitor' is replaced with 'PaperExchange Rival' in the first clause, while the second clause retains 'PaperExchange Competitor'. This introduces ambiguity as to whether 'Rival' and 'Competitor' are interchangeable, potentially leading to disputes.",

In addition, PaperExchange shall not now or in the future contest the validity of VerticalNet's Intellectual Property.",

In addition, PaperExchange shall not now or in the future contest the validity of VerticalNet's Intellectual Property.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'Intellectual Property' to describe VerticalNet's assets. The modified version replaces it with 'Intellectual Assets' in the first sentence. Since 'Intellectual Assets' is not defined, it's unclear if it's synonymous with 'Intellectual Property', creating uncertainty regarding the scope of PaperExchange's acknowledgement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'permits' to 'permissions' introduces inconsistency. While seemingly similar, 'permits' often refers to formal, documented authorizations, while 'permissions' can be more general. This creates uncertainty regarding the specific type of authorizations required and whether informal permissions suffice.",

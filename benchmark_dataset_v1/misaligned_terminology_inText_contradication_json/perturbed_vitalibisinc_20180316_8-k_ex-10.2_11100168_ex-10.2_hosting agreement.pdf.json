Licensee may not transfer the license granted in this Agreement unless such transfer is mutually agreed upon by the Parties in a writing signed by the Parties. VOTOCAST reserves all rights under any intellectual property rights in and to the Services not expressly granted in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original contract refers to the recipient of the license, Vitalibis Inc., as ‘Licensee.’ By referring to 'Licensee' in one instance and the specific name of 'Vitalibis Inc.' in another, it creates ambiguity. If they are meant to be used interchangeably, it should be consistent. Failing to clarify, the inconsistency creates uncertainty, especially regarding legal implications of actions taken by the licensee.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Licensee' to 'Vitalibis Inc.' and 'Licensee Users' to 'Client Users' introduces ambiguity. While 'Licensee' is formally defined at the beginning of the document, if the parties are meant to be the same, it should be kept consistently. This creates potential confusion regarding which set of users the obligations apply to, making enforcement complex. Now the term should be redefined at the beginning of the document to avoid confusion.",

This 10% of the total revenue generated is payable only if the EBITDA is a positive EBITDA and exceeds the 10% of the revenue. In cases of a positive EBITDA but shortage of funds compared to the 10% of the revenue, Distributor will take less than 10%. If the EBITDA is negative, no payments will be made to Distributor. Additionally, it will be the sole responsibility of Distributor to make a full disclosure of the 10% MDO to all its clients.",

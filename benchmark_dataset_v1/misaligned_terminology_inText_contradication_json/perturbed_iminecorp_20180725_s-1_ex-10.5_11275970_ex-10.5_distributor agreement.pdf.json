For the purpose of Section 7, Products shall also include any software necessary for the rigs to function correctly.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Products' is expanded in Section 1.7, but only for purposes of Section 7. This creates ambiguity: are software updates covered under warranty? Are they part of the deliverable? What if section 7 is terminated?",

If the Distributor determines any unit of Products defective, the Distributor shall promptly notify JRVS of such defects. Defective Products may be returned for retest, evaluation and examination subject to JRVS Returned Material Authorization (“RMA”) procedure; provided, that such written notification and request for an RMA number must be received by JRVS during the Inspection Period. Returns must be prepaid by Distributor. When requesting a return authorization, Distributor must supply Distributor’s purchase order number and JRVS’s invoice number. Product description must include lot number and wafer numbers.",

If the Importer determines any unit of Goods defective, the Importer shall promptly notify JRVS of such defects. Defective Goods may be returned for retest, evaluation and examination subject to JRVS Returned Material Authorization (“RMA”) procedure; provided, that such written notification and request for an RMA number must be received by JRVS during the Inspection Period. Returns must be prepaid by Importer. When requesting a return authorization, Importer must supply Importer’s purchase order number and JRVS’s invoice number. Good description must include lot number and wafer numbers.",
                "explanation": "By using 'Importer' instead of 'Distributor' and 'Goods' instead of 'Products', the agreement creates confusion as to whether these terms refer to the same entity and items. This is in addition to the change in inspection period from 30 to 15 days that is in direct contradiction with the original inspection period.",

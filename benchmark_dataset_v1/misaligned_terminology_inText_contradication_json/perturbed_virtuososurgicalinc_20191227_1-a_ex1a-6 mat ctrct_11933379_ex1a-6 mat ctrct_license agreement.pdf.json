                "explanation": "The terms 'material' and 'product' in 'LICENSED PRODUCT(S)' are replaced with 'goods' and 'offering', respectively. Similarly, in 'LICENSED SERVICE(S)', the terms 'performance' and 'manufacture' are replaced with 'provision' and 'production', while 'method' and 'use' are replaced with 'process' and 'usage'. These substitutions, without explicit definitions or cross-references, create ambiguity as to whether the original and substitute terms have precisely the same scope, potentially leading to disputes over what falls under the license.",

                "explanation": "In Section 4.3, 'LICENSED PRODUCT(S)' is changed to 'LICENSED ITEM' and 'LICENSED SERVICE(S)' to 'LICENSED TASK'. Then in Section 4.4, 'amount of' is changed to 'quantity of' and 'sold' is changed to 'marketed', creating a contradiction in terminology, as 'ITEM' and 'TASK' were never formally defined but are used as substitutes. This creates uncertainty in reporting obligations and payment calculations, because it is unclear what exactly is being referred to as 'LICENSED ITEM' and LICENSED TASK'.",

This creates an internal contradiction regarding the scope of indemnification, since the phrase 'practice of the inventions covered by' sometimes references the new term and sometimes the old, making it ambiguous if the Company’s indemnification duties extend to everything considered a LICENSED PRODUCT or LICENSED SERVICE or only things also classifiable as CREATIONS or PROVISIONS, leading to uncertainty and potential for disputes.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'distributor' to 'vendor' introduces ambiguity. The contract relies on 'Distributor' as a defined term with specific obligations. Using 'vendor' interchangeably without defining it creates uncertainty about the scope of the agreement, particularly regarding exclusivity and revenue sharing.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'customer' to 'buyer' in the definition creates a contradiction. The contract uses the term 'Customer' throughout, implying a relationship beyond a simple transaction. Substituting 'buyer' limits the definition to a transactional context, potentially conflicting with obligations related to ongoing support and service (Support Services) defined later in the agreement. The term customer has a specific definition which buyer could change the intent of this.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Customers' to 'Clients' without defining 'Client' creates a contradiction and could create uncertainty. The definition of 'Customer' is already provided, and by introducing Client there is confusion on who the 'Support Services' are given to.",

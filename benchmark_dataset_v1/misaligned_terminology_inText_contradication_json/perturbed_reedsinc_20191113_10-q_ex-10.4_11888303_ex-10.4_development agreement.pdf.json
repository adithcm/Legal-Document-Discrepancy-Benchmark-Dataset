                "explanation": "The term 'Deliverables' is subtly replaced by 'Products' in the first sentence of Section 6(a)(i), while the rest of the paragraph still refers to 'Deliverables.' This creates confusion about what exactly Company is assigning to Reed's. The original text clearly states the assignment pertains to 'Deliverables,' but the altered sentence implies that the company needs to provide 'Products', which is ambiguously defined in the agreement, potentially opening a loophole. It is not clear if 'Products' and 'Deliverables' can be used interchangeably.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Products' is replaced with 'Recipes' in the first sentence of section 6(b). The scope of 'Work Product' becomes ambiguous. Since 'Recipes' and 'Products' are defined distinctly in Section 1, and are also used elsewhere in the document, this alternation means that the work that 'Company' does may create a scope of work product that is far narrower than what the original agreement intended. This introduces an internal contradiction in the agreement.",

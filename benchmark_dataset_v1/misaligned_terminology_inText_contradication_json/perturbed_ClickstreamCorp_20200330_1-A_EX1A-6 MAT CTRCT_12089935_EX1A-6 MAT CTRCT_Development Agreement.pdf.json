                "explanation": "The terms 'Developer', 'Vendor,' and 'Supplier' are used interchangeably without clear definitions. This introduces uncertainty as to which entity is responsible for designing the application. If 'Vendor' is interpreted as a separate entity, it conflicts with the understanding that the 'Developer' is responsible for the application design, creating potential confusion and ambiguity regarding the actual party bound to the design obligations.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'Client' and 'Customer' are now used to describe the party that has a '30 day right to cure before a cancelation can occur', while the term 'Developer' is now replaced with 'Service Provider' but the Client still is stated as having a 30-day right to cure. This could lead to confusion and disputes over whether the entities 'Customer' and 'Client' are the same, if 'Service Provider' is the same entity that must receive a cure before cancellation, and who has to provide said cure.",

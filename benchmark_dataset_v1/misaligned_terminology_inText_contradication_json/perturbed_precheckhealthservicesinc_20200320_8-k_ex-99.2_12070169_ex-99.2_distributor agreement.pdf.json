The Products are described on Exhibit A to this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'distributor' to 'seller' and 'Products' to 'Merchandise' without defining 'seller' or 'Merchandise' creates confusion. The agreement repeatedly uses 'Distributor' later on, creating a contradiction about the nature of the appointed role. It is uncertain if the role of seller carries the same responsibilities as a distributor.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Distributor' to 'Vendor', 'Products' to 'Offerings' and 'policies' to 'guidelines' creates a contradiction. The contract uses all these terms interchangably. It is unclear if 'Vendor' is responsible for the payment or other responsibilities.",

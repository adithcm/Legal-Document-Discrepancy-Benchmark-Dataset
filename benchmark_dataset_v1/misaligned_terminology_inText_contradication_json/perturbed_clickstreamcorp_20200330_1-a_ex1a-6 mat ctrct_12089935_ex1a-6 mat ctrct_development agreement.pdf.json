                "explanation": "The terms “Developer” and “Client” have been changed to “Vendor” and “Customer” respectively. The contract now uses different terms for the same entities without defining them. This creates ambiguity regarding obligations and responsibilities throughout the document, as the changed terms might be interpreted as different parties.",

                "explanation": "The terms “Developer” and “Client” have been changed to “Vendor” and “Customer”, and a new term 'Consultant' is introduced. This change further compounds the earlier confusion, as it is now unclear whether the “Vendor” and “Consultant” are the same entity or separate entities, resulting in uncertainties about who is responsible for the 'Services'.",

                "explanation": "Here, \"Developer\" is switched with \"Vendor\", and \"Client\" is switched with \"Customer\" as established. The final sentence adds \"Service Provider is allowed to develop, maintain or market a similar platform.\" This creates a direct contradiction, as 'Vendor' is defined as the 'Developer' earlier, but 'Service Provider' is introduced without context. This severely impacts the enforceability of the non-compete clause, creating a contradiction with the prohibition against competition.",

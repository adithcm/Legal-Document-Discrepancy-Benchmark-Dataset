                "original_text": "This NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT AMENDMENT NO. 1 (this “Amendment”) is entered into as of August 16, 2017, by and between VIVINT SOLAR, INC., a Delaware corporation (together with its successors and permitted assigns, “Vivint Solar”), and VIVINT, INC., a Utah corporation (together with its successors and permitted assigns “Vivint”). Each of Vivint Solar and Vivint may also be referred to herein individually as a “Party”, and collectively as the “Parties”.",

Each of the Company and the Business may also be referred to herein individually as a “Party”, and collectively as the “Parties”.",
                "explanation": "The terms “Vivint Solar” and “Vivint” are initially defined as “Vivint Solar” and “Vivint” respectively. By changing “Vivint Solar” to “the Company” and “Vivint” to “the Business” introduces ambiguity as to whether these new terms always and exclusively refer to the original entities or if they can refer to other related entities or future acquisitions. This creates uncertainty in enforcement regarding which specific entity is bound by certain obligations.",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the “Sales Term” as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC (the “Term”).",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the “Sales Period” as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC (the “Term”).",
                "explanation": "Changing “Sales Term” to “Sales Period” without a clear definition of “Sales Period” creates confusion. It is no longer clear what the duration of the agreement is, since it now references an undefined term “Sales Period”. The original text specifically referenced “Sales Term” defined within another agreement, providing a measurable duration. The new term creates uncertainty and potential disputes over the length of the non-competition agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing “Master Framework Agreement” to “Master Agreement” without explicitly stating that the two are the same creates a contradiction. If the 'Master Agreement' is a different document, or even just perceived as a different document, the provisions governing the Amendment become unclear. This impacts the enforceability of confidentiality clauses and other miscellaneous terms, potentially leading to legal challenges.",

                "explanation": "The original text refers to 'Company' or 'Companies', which are generally understood to refer to the joint venture entities. The modified text replaces 'Company' with 'the Business', creating confusion whether it refers to the operational aspects of the joint venture rather than the entities themselves. This misinterpretation could create disputes over which clauses apply to ongoing business activities versus the legal entities.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses 'Veoneer Party' and 'Nissin Party', referring to the specifically defined groups of companies. The modified text replaces 'Party' with 'Entity' and 'agreements' with 'promises', which are vaguer terms. 'Entity' could be interpreted more broadly than 'Party', potentially including subsidiaries or affiliates not originally intended to be bound. Similarly, 'promises' lack the legally binding force of 'agreements' which can change the enforceability of clauses.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Nissin Parties' is changed to 'Nissin Companies', 'indemnification or reimbursement' to 'compensation or payment', 'Directors and Officers' to 'Executives and Managers', and 'Liabilities' to 'Debts.' These terms are not clearly defined in place of those which are, and can be interpreted as narrower terms; 'Debts' are more specific than general 'Liabilities', and 'Executives and Managers' may not encompass all 'Directors and Officers', leading to conflict on who is covered.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'exclusive purpose' and 'primary objective' are used interchangeably for the same defined term 'Purpose'. 'Exclusive' suggests that the Venture is restricted only to IT Development, while 'primary' suggests that other activities can be undertaken. This ambiguity creates uncertainty about whether the Venture can engage in any other activities beyond those explicitly stated, therefore it generates internal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The definition 'Capital Contribution' is replaced with 'Initial Investment'. While both indicate an initial stake, 'Capital Contribution' has established legal precedent (and is subsequently used throughout the document), while 'Initial Investment' is vague. This might imply that subsequent capital injections aren't considered 'Capital Contributions', potentially impacting profit/loss distribution or member liability, even though the document refers to 'Capital Contributions' elsewhere.",

                "changed_text": "On dissolution, the Venture will be dissolved immediately and liquidated within a fair timeframe.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'promptly and within a reasonable time' and 'immediately and liquidated within a fair timeframe' are used differently. 'Promptly' suggests acting swiftly, whereas 'Immediately' denotes an instantaneous action. 'Reasonable time' is generally interpreted as considering the given circumstances, whilst a 'fair timeframe' is open for interpretation and is subjective. This poses a contradiction on how quickly dissolution should occur, thus introducing internal contradiction.",

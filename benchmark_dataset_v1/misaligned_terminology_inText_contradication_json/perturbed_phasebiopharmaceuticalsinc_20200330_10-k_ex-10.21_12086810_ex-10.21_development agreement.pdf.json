                "changed_text": "1.1.42 “Commercially Sound Efforts” means with respect to the performance of activities under this Agreement by a Party (as pertains to its role in conducting the Clinical Trials): reasonable, diligent, good-faith actions to accomplish such goal which are consistent with internal strategic interests, regardless of industry standards. “Commercially Sound Efforts” requires, with respect to a particular task or activity in making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, exporting, developing (including seeking regulatory approvals or applicable pricing or reimbursement approvals) or otherwise commercializing the Product, that a Party: (i) assign responsibility for such task or activity to the appropriate employee(s); (ii) set objectives for carrying out such task or activity; and (iii) make decisions and allocate resources to progress with respect to such objectives; provided, however, that, to the extent that the performance of a Party’s obligations hereunder is adversely affected by the other Party’s breach in performing its obligations hereunder, the impact on the first Party of such performance failure by the other Party will not be taken into account in determining whether the first Party has used its Commercially Sound Efforts to perform any such affected obligations.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of “Commercially Sound Efforts” contradicts the original definition of “Commercially Reasonable Efforts”. The term \"Commercially Sound Efforts” has been changed to allow a party to prioritize internal strategic interests over industry standards, and eliminates accountability, consistent objective-setting, and timeline adherence. Moreover, the definition explicitly ignores the other party's breach, creating uncertainty about enforcement. The original text uses objective criteria for the determination of the efforts, the changed text uses subjective criteria. It’s unclear whether “Commercially Sound Efforts” refer to the same entity, leading to conflicting action terms.",

                "explanation": "By modifying the title and first sentence to \"Reasonable Efforts\" while maintaining \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" in the subsequent conditional clauses, the document introduces an internal conflict. The original intent is to establish an objective standard defined in section 1.1.42. In this case, it fails to define whether “Reasonable Efforts” and “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” are the same, creating uncertainty about enforcement. It is unclear whether to adhere to an objective, business-conscious standard or a potentially less stringent one, leading to confusion on timelines.",

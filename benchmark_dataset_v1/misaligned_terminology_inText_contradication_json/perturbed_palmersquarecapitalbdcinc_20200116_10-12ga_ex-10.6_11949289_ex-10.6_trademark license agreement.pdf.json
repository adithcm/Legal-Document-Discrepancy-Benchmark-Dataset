                "explanation": "Changing 'Advisor' to 'Consultant' and 'Territory' to 'Area' creates confusion about the defined terms. The contract relies heavily on 'Investment Advisor,' so introducing 'Investment Consultant' without clarifying if they're interchangeable is problematic. Also changing 'Territory' to 'Area' without defining 'Area' creates further ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "Continuing to interchange 'Investment Advisor' with 'Investment Consultant' makes the termination clause unclear. If the agreement terminates when the 'Investment Advisor' ceases to serve, but another section refers to an 'Investment Consultant,' it is difficult to determine the actual trigger for termination.",

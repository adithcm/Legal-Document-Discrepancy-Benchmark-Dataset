                "explanation": "Changing 'Products' to 'Goods' in the definition introduces inconsistency. Throughout the agreement, 'Products' is used consistently. This change makes it unclear if 'Goods' refers to the same items, especially since the defined term is 'Products.'",

                "explanation": "Using 'Items' instead of 'Products' in the delivery section creates ambiguity. While arguably they could be the same, the contract defines 'Products'.

                "original_text": "WHEREAS, the Licensee desires to use the Licensed Mark as part of its company name and in connection with the operation of its business, and the Licensor is willing to grant the Licensee a license to use the Licensed Mark, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, the Licensee desires to use the Licensed Mark as part of its company name and in connection with the operation of its business, and the Licensor is considering allowing the Licensee to use the Licensed Mark, subject to the guidelines of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'is willing to grant' to 'is considering allowing' creates uncertainty. It's unclear if the license is guaranteed or subject to further approval, contradicting the later definitive 'License Grant' in Article 1.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee’s own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor authorizes the Licensee, and the Licensee acknowledges from the Licensor, a conditional, non-exclusive, royalty-free possibility to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee’s own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business considered by the Licensee.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'License' to 'Authorization' and replacing 'grants' with 'authorizes' and 'accepts' with 'acknowledges', replacing 'right and license to use' with 'possibility to use', adding that the business is 'considered' instead of 'provided' fundamentally changes the nature of the agreement. It now suggests a permission that can be revoked and a business activity that has not been decided. This conflicts with the original intent of granting a definite right to use the trademark.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall be suspended if the Investment Advisor or one of its affiliates halts acting as investment adviser to the Licensee.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Term' to 'Duration', 'license granted' to 'permission offered', 'shall expire' to 'shall be suspended', and 'ceases to serve' to 'halts acting' creates uncertainty. 'Suspended' implies temporary cessation rather than permanent termination, and 'halts acting' is less definitive than 'ceases to serve', creating a potential conflict about whether the agreement truly ends.",

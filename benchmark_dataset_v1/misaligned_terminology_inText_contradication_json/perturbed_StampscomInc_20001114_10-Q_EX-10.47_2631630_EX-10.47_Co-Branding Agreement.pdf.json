                "original_text": "The Company shall maintain complete and accurate records of the number of packages shipped by the MBE Centers using the Service and all payments due or accrued to the Company by MBE Centers hereunder. MBE shall, at any time during the term of this Agreement, be entitled to audit all such records upon ten (10) days written notice to the Company, in order to confirm the accuracy of such records and conformance with the terms and conditions of this AgreementÍ¾\nprovided, however, that no more than one (1) such audit may be conducted in any\nninety (90)-day period.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall maintain complete and accurate records of the number of packages shipped by the MBE Centers using the Service and all payments due or accrued to the Company by MBE Centers hereunder. MBE shall, at its discretion during the term of this Agreement, be entitled to review all such records upon ten (10) days written notice to the Company, in order to generally understand the performance of the service. For clarity, 'review' is defined as a high-level check to ensure general data integrity, whereas a formal 'audit' is explicitly disallowed.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows MBE to 'audit' records, whereas the modified text changes 'audit' to 'review' and explicitly disallows a formal audit. This creates a contradiction regarding the extent and frequency of MBE's access to company records.",

The Subscription Agreement shall provide that an MBE Center that accesses or uses the Service on any hardware or other equipment, or in conjunction with any software, that does not constitute Authorized Equipment does so as its own risk, and the Company shall not be liable for any failure of the Service on hardware or other equipment, or in conjunction with any software, that does not constitute Authorized Equipment.",

The Subscription Agreement may provide that an MBE Center that accesses or uses the Service on alternative hardware or other tools, or in conjunction with varying software, that does not constitute Authorized Equipment proceeds at its own risk, but the Company may be liable for service disruption.",
                "explanation": "The original states MBE *shall* be responsible and the company *shall not* be liable, whereas the modified text states MBE *may* be responsible contingent on the subscription and the Company *may* be liable for disruptions. This creates uncertainty.",

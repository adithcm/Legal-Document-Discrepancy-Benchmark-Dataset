                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be effective as of the date first stated above and shall continue for a period of three (3) years, unless cancelled earlier in accordance with the stipulations of this Agreement (the \"Term\"); provided, however, that PrimeCall may choose to end this Agreement, upon sixty (60) days' written notification, at any point following the time that collectively RSL Communications, Ltd. and/or its Affiliates possesses less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting control of DeltaThree's outstanding shares.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'terminated' and 'cancelled' are used interchangeably, as are 'elect to terminate' and 'choose to end'. Similarly, the notice period changes from 'thirty (30) days' to 'sixty (60) days', creating conflicting obligations. The term 'stipulations' is also used instead of 'provisions' to refer to the same concept within the contract, leading to possible ambiguity. It also introduces the term 'possesses' when previously 'holds' was used, and 'notification' instead of 'notice'.",

Toll-Free Access Number. PrimeCall shall procure on behalf of DeltaThree a unique toll-free \"800\" access number for users of the Calling Card. DeltaThree shall be responsible for all costs in connection therewith.",

DeltaThree shall be liable for all charges associated with it.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'reimburse', 'refund', 'costs', 'expenses', 'incurred' and 'made' are used interchangeably. 'Procure' is replaced with 'obtain', 'users' with 'callers', 'responsible for all costs' with 'liable for all charges' and 'in connection therewith' with 'associated with it'. Using different words without clear definitions can lead to confusion about the exact obligations of each party. Also the word 'unique' changed to 'exclusive', further highlighting subtle differences in legal intent.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'materially breaches' becomes 'significantly violates', 'duties or obligations' becomes 'responsibilities or requirements', 'breach' becomes 'violation' and 'infraction'. The cure period changes from 'thirty (30) days' to 'forty-five (45) days'. 'Written notice' changes to 'formal notification'. 'Breaching party' changes to 'violating entity', and 'terminate' is changed to 'cancel'. It is also introducing the word 'applicable' instead of 'as the case may be'. These interchangeable terms create uncertainty about the standard required to trigger termination, and creates internal contradiction.",

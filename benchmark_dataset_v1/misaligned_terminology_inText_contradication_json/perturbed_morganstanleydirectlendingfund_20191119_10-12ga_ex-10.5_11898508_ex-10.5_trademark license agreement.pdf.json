This creates confusion as the contract refers to \"Licensee Business\" in other sections, such as Section 7.1 Indemnity by Licensee. It’s unclear if \"Licensee Operations\" is the same as \"Licensee Business,\" creating ambiguity in obligations.",

                "explanation": "The term “Permitted Activity” is changed to “Permitted Use”.

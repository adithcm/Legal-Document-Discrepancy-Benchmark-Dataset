                "explanation": "Changing 'Brand' to 'Intellectual Property' without defining it creates ambiguity. While the initial definition clarifies \"Brand,\" the introduction of \"Intellectual Property\" as potentially synonymous creates doubt about whether the entire agreement's references to \"Brand\" now encompass a broader set of intellectual assets.",

                "explanation": "Here, \"Brand\" is replaced with \"Intellectual Property\". Because Intellectual property includes any creation of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce, and the term \"Brand\" in the original text is limited to the specific named trademarks of 'Morgan Stanley', it introduces an ambiguity concerning the extent of the protection Licensee must provide to the Licensor. This could potentially extend the obligations of Licensee to areas not initially intended in the contract.",

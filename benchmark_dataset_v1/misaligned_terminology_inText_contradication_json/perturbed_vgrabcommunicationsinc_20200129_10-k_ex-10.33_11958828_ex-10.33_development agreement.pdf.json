                "explanation": "The terms \"Developer\" is changed to \"Designer\" and \"Project\" is changed to \"Product\", these terms are used interchangeably without clear distinction in subsequent clauses. This introduces uncertainty about which entity is responsible for development tasks and what constitutes the final deliverable, whether it's the \"Project\" or the \"Product\".",

                "explanation": "The term \"individual\" is changed to \"entity\" and \"Project\" to \"Application\". While the original text refers to specific individuals, the revised text uses the term \"entity,\" creating ambiguity as to whether payments can be made to a company instead. Replacing \"Project\" with \"Application\" creates confusion about the scope of deliverables.",

                "explanation": "The word 'products' has been changed to 'deliverables'. This change leads to confusion as the agreement elsewhere defines 'deliverables' in the context of the mobile application itself. The scope of 'products' is less well-defined, introducing uncertainty as to what VAL is required to supply, potentially delaying the project.",

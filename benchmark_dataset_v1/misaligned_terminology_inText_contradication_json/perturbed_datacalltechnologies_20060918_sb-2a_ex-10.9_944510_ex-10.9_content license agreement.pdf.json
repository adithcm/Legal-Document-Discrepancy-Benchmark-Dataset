                "original_text": "     1.2  End User  means  any  third  Party  receiving  Content  on  a  mobile\n          device  for  a  payment in accordance with the terms and conditions of\n          this  Agreement  for  their  own  private  and  non-  commercial  use.",
                "changed_text": "     1.2  End User  means  any  third  Party  receiving  Content  on  a  mobile\n          device. The specific terms for End User eligibility are defined in Section 3.5.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'End User' is intentionally made vague here by removing the phrase about payment and non-commercial use, creating ambiguity. This contradicts the original specific definition, potentially leading to disputes about who qualifies as an 'End User' and under what conditions.",

Such  report  shall  be  provided  to LICENSOR in electronic\n          format  within  6  weeks  of  the  end  of  a  quarter.",

                "explanation": "The term 'detailed written record' is replaced with 'periodic report', and specific requirements for the report are omitted. The phrase that it “may be provided” weakens Plan_B’s obligation to send it and it also gives plan_b the authority to pick and choose the report’s content. This change provides plan_b with significant flexibility over the reporting content and its delivery format, creating a point of contention.",

The Initial Term will renew for a period determined by mutual agreement of the parties, made no later than thirty (30) days before the expiration date.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains an auto-renewal term of half a year unless either party opts out by written notice at least sixty days before the agreement's end date. The modified text replaces this clause with a mutual agreement of the parties on extension period, made no later than thirty (30) days before the expiration date. This change alters the circumstances for renewing the contract, creating a contradiction between the two sections.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires mutual agreement on the data transmission method, ensuring both parties are satisfied. The modified version gives Excite@Home unilateral control, potentially disadvantaging e-centives and creating a conflict of interest since how data is sent will affect both parties but only one gets to choose.",

The placement of the link and the definition of a 'persistent' link is the sole discretion of Excite@Home.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a prominent placement ('Above-the-Fold' as specifically defined) and requires mutual agreement on the link's phrasing. The modified text removes the specific placement, allows Excite@Home to determine what is 'appropriate' (making it more vague), dictates the phrasing, and puts link persistence completely under Excite@Home's control. This creates a contradiction as the original implied a more prominent and mutually agreed-upon promotion while the modified version allows for minimal and unilaterally controlled promotion by Excite@Home.",

                "explanation": "The original implies that Excite@Home will provide promotion per Exhibit F, with the possibility of additional promotion. The modified version implies that Excite@Home can choose not to promote it at all, even if Exhibit F is in place, contradicting the expectation that there will be a minimum level of promotion.",

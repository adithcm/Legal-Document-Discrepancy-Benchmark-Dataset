                "original_text": "Company desires to appoint Distributor as its exclusive distributor of the Products to all Clients that Distributor introduce, and upon confirmed the first order, this client come to be exclusive of Distributor, every new customer introduced by Distributor, must be approved by the company prior to any sale. After official approval from the Company, the customer introduced by Distributor, will appear on an official list in this contract, and will only be met by the Distributor and will follow the rules of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Company desires to appoint Distributor as its exclusive distributor of the Products to all Clients that Distributor introduce, and upon confirmed the first order, this client come to be exclusive of Distributor, every new consumer introduced by Distributor, is not subject to company approval prior to any transaction. After acceptance from the Company, the consumer introduced by Distributor, will not appear on any list in this contract, and will be met by either the Distributor or the Company and may or may not follow the rules of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text enforces a strict approval process for new 'clients' introduced by the Distributor, ensuring exclusivity and adherence to the agreement. The modified version replaces 'client' with 'consumer,' removes the mandatory approval step, and allows the Company to directly interact with the consumer, contradicting the original exclusivity agreement. This creates uncertainty about the Distributor's rights and the Company's obligations regarding new business.",

The operations of Distributor are under its sole and exclusive control, including without limitation supervision of, and liability for expenses incurred with respect to, employees. The Distributor will use best reasonable efforts to distribute the Products in the Territory.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor agrees that it will diligently perform the services and obligations detailed in this Agreement. The operations of the Distributor may be directed by the Company if it is determined that performance benchmarks are not being met. The Distributor will use reasonable efforts to distribute the Products in the Territory.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the Distributor as an entity with 'sole and exclusive control' over its operations. The modified version introduces the possibility of Company intervention and direction, contradicting the original independent contractor status and creating ambiguity about who ultimately controls the distribution process. This affects the liability and responsibility of each party.",

                "changed_text": "In the event that the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator within a Thirty (30) day period, the Company will select an arbitrator, and that arbitrator will resolve the dispute.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a process where both parties are equally involved in selecting the arbitrator. The modified version grants the Company unilateral authority to select the arbitrator, potentially creating bias and undermining the fairness of the arbitration process. It removes the provision for a third arbitrator chosen by both parties' initial picks.",

Watley, Inc. (hereinafter\nreferred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the\naforementioned Co-Branding Agreement.

Watley, Inc. (hereinafter\nreferred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the entities contracted in the\naforementioned Co-Branding Agreement. This Amendment shall only apply to PCQ\nand ABW.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'parties' to 'entities' introduces a subtle but potentially significant ambiguity. 'Parties' typically refers to the specific legal entities signing the agreement. 'Entities' could be interpreted more broadly, potentially including divisions or departments within PCQ and ABW that are not legally distinct entities. Additionally, the original text includes 'all of their subsidiaries and related companies', but the changed text restricts the amendment's application to 'PCQ and ABW'. This creates a contradiction, as the original text intended to bind subsidiaries while the new text does not, making it unclear if the subsidiaries are bound to the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Director\" to \"Managing Director\" and \"President\" to \"Chief Executive Officer\" creates ambiguity. While these roles might seem similar, they have different legal and operational implications within a company. Depending on the bylaws of A.B. Watley, Inc. and PC Quote, Inc., a Managing Director might have different levels of authority than a simple Director. Similarly, a Chief Executive Officer could have more power or responsibility than the original President. This inconsistency makes it harder to define who had the authority to make the agreement.",

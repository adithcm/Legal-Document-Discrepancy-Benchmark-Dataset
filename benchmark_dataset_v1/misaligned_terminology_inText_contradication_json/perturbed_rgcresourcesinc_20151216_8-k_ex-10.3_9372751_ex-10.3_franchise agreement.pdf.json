                "explanation": "The terms “Grantor” and “Grantee” are replaced with “Town” and “Company” respectively. While the document refers to these entities subsequently as Grantor and Grantee, using Town and Company creates initial confusion about the defined roles and responsibilities, which can be exploited later. Whether the 'Town' is the same as 'Grantor' is now unclear.",

                "changed_text": "(a) Company shall remit to Town a Service Charge, which shall be calculated pursuant to this Section. It is understood that Company has or will enter into franchise agreements with the City of Roanoke (“Roanoke”) and the City of Salem (“Salem”) and the\nTown of Vinton (“Vinton”) (Grantor, Roanoke and Salem being hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the “localities” and\nsingularly as a “locality”) with fee provisions identical to this one, and that the total annual Franchise Fee to be paid to the three\nlocalities in aggregate is $98,196 for calendar year 2016 (“base year total annual Franchise Fee”). Grantor’s Franchise Fee shall\nbe a percentage share of the base year total annual Franchise Fee, which shall be determined on a pro rata basis according to its\npercentage share of the total dollar value of Grantee’s gas sales occurring within the localities during the calendar year.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Franchise Fee' is replaced with 'Service Charge' for what Company pays Town. However, subsequent references to the localities' agreements still use 'Franchise Fee'. This creates ambiguity: Is the Service Charge equivalent to the Franchise Fee? The text defining the calculation still links it to the 'base year total annual Franchise Fee', even though the payment is now described as a 'Service Charge'. Also, mixing 'Company' and 'Town' with the original 'Grantor' and 'Grantee' adds to this complexity.",

                "changed_text": "4. OPERATIONAL CENTER. Company must, for the duration of this Franchise, have an operational center inside the City Limits of the Town. This center needs to be accessible for a minimum of 40 hours weekly for business interactions between the gas provider and service recipients.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'BUSINESS OFFICE' to 'OPERATIONAL CENTER', 'Grantee' to 'Company', 'Territorial Limits of Grantor' to 'City Limits of the Town', and 'customers' to 'service recipients' creates uncertainty about whether these terms are interchangeable. Does 'Operational Center' have the same functions and requirements as 'Business Office'? Using 'gas provider' and 'service recipients' further distances the language from the defined 'Grantee' and 'Grantor', making the obligation less clear.",

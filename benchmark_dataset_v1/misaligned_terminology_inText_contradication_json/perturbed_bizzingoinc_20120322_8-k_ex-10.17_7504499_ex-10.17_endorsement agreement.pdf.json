                "original_text": "In consideration for the rights granted hereunder and for the promotional appearances provided herein, Bizzingo, subject to the other terms and conditions herein, agrees to pay to Theismann during the Term the royalty recited in Schedule A (the “Royalty”). In addition, concurrent with the execution hereof, Bizzingo will pay Theismann the Initial Bonus described in Schedule A.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration for the rights granted hereunder and for the promotional appearances provided herein, Bizzingo, subject to the other terms and conditions herein, agrees to pay to Theismann during the Term the compensation recited in Schedule A (the “Royalty”). In addition, concurrent with the execution hereof, Bizzingo will provide Theismann the Initial Consideration described in Schedule A.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Royalty' is replaced with 'compensation' and 'Initial Bonus' replaced with 'Initial Consideration'. While Schedule A refers specifically to the Royalty and Initial Bonus as warrants, the edited text uses 'compensation' and 'Initial Consideration' which suggests other forms of payment besides the warrants described in schedule A, creating confusion and potentially conflicting obligations as to the form of payment.",

                "original_text": "Theismann acknowledges that the Royalty Warrant and Bonus Warrant and the shares of common stock of Bizzingo underlying such warrants are \"restricted securities\" as that term is defined under federal securities laws. In addition, any stock certificate representing such shares shall contain the restrictive legend set for on Schedule A may not be sold, transferred or hypothecated unless such transfer is pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from such registration as verified by an opinion of counsel acceptable to Bizzingo.",
                "changed_text": "Theismann acknowledges that the Celebrity Warrant and Theismann Bonus and the shares of common stock of Bizzingo underlying such incentives are \"restricted securities\" as that term is defined under federal securities laws. In addition, any stock certificate representing such shares shall contain the restrictive legend set for on Schedule A may not be sold, transferred or hypothecated unless such transfer is pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from such registration as verified by an opinion of counsel acceptable to Bizzingo.",
                "explanation": "The phrases 'Royalty Warrant and Bonus Warrant' are changed to 'Celebrity Warrant and Theismann Bonus'. This could be interpreted as new incentives apart from those that are already stated. There is now ambiguity in the text, as these terms are used without any reference to them. If, for example, those other securities did not have the same value as 'Royalty Warrant and Bonus Warrant' then that would create contradictions and potentially conflicting obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement as provided in this Section 10 (each a \"Termination Date\") or upon the expiration of the Term, Bizzingo shall cease using the Property in any way, and Theismann shall not be entitled to the Benefits, in each case from and after the Termination Date.",
                "explanation": "The word 'Royalty' is replaced with 'Benefits'. The term Royalty is explicitly defined in section 3.a and schedule A of the original text. The term 'Benefits' is not defined, and this suggests that payment of royalty is not the only benefit Theismann is entitled to under this contract. There is now a conflict between what are Theismann's entitlements upon termination: is it only the Royalty as defined in 3.a and Schedule A, or are there other benefits that Theismann is entitled to under the terms of this agreement?",

For clarity, Commercialization does not include Development and/or Manufacturing of a Licensed Product. When used as a verb, “Commercialize” means to engage in Commercialization.",

For clarity, such activities does not include Development and/or Manufacturing of a Licensed Product. When used as a verb, “Commercialize” means to engage in commercial activities post regulatory approval.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Commercialization\" included pre-launch, launch, and post-launch activities. The modified definition restricts it to only \"post-regulatory approval\" activities. This creates a contradiction because earlier sections in the document may rely on the broader definition, whereas later sections will now only refer to activities after regulatory approval, leading to uncertainty.",

Such activities include toxicology, pharmacology, and other non-clinical efforts, statistical analysis, formulation development, delivery system development, the performance of Clinical Trials, including the Manufacturing, as applicable, of the Licensed Product for use in research and Clinical Trials, or other activities necessary to obtain and pursue Regulatory Approval of Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory. When used as a verb, “Develop” means to engage in the named Development activities.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Development\" was broader, encompassing all activities 'reasonably necessary' to obtain Regulatory Approval. The new definition includes 'necessary in the judgment of CytoDyn', thus inserting CytoDyn's subjective judgement for activities necessary in pursuing approval. This change creates an in-text contradiction because Vyera's Commercialization rights may be dependent on Development decisions, and this definition change gives CytoDyn increased discretionary control over what constitutes sufficient Development, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

Vyera shall have the exclusive right to implement, and subject to Section 5.5, final decision-making authority with respect to, Commercialization of all Licensed Products in the Field and the Territory. Vyera shall be solely and exclusively responsible for all costs and expenses associated with Commercialization of Licensed Products in the Field and the Territory. Vyera shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts in connection with such Commercialization of Licensed Products in the Territory for each indication in the Field for which such Licensed Products have received Regulatory Approval, and shall conduct Commercialization activities in material compliance with Applicable Laws and shall ensure that its Third Party contractors conduct Commercialization activities in material compliance with Applicable Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, Vyera shall have the exclusive right and responsibility throughout the Territory for the following: (a) receiving and accepting orders for the Licensed Product from customers; (b) distributing the Licensed Product to customers; (c) controlling invoicing and collection of accounts receivable for Licensed Product sales; (d) recording Licensed Product sales in its books of account for sales (in accordance with Vyera’s accounting standards consistently applied (currently GAAP)); (e) subject to Section 5.5, determining pricing for the Licensed Product and all aspects of the promotion (including promotional materials) to be used in Commercializing Licensed Products; (f) negotiating with Third Parties, including without limitation, payors, pharmacy benefit managers and distributors, with respect to sales and distribution of Licensed Product; and (g) paying all rebates, chargebacks and other amounts due to customers in respect of Licensed Products (it being understood that all such amounts shall be deducted in calculating Net Sales). Notwithstanding the foregoing, CytoDyn acknowledges and agrees that in the event Vyera delivers to CytoDyn a notice of termination pursuant to Sections 11.2(b) or (c), the use of Commercially Reasonable Efforts shall take into account Vyera’s intent to cease its Commercialization activities as of the end of the applicable notice period and shall not require Vyera to take any action that is inconsistent with such intent.",

                "explanation": "In this example, the phrase \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" has been changed to \"Commercially Compliant Activities\", this change introduces an element of uncertainty into the agreement because \"Commercially Compliant Activities\" is undefined. This could lead to disputes regarding the scope and intensity of effort Vyera is required to exert, creating a breach of contract dispute.",

Licensee agrees to use the Licensed Domain Names only in accordance with such content distribution policy that Licensor uses in connection with its own business, and as may be established by Licensor and communicated in writing in advance to Licensee from time to time or as may otherwise be agreed to by the Parties from time to time, provided that Licensee shall be afforded the same period of time to implement any such content distribution policy as is afforded to Licensor’s Affiliates and other third parties.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'policy' to 'regulation', this creates a contradiction as 'policy' is a more flexible internal guideline, whereas 'regulation' implies a stricter legal or quasi-legal mandate. Also, changing 'Affiliates' to 'subsidiaries' creates ambiguity as to the scope of entities receiving the same implementation period.  'Third parties' has been replaced with 'outside firms', further creating doubt as to who the text refers to.",

Licensee’s obligation to indemnify Licensor shall be conditioned on (x) Licensor’s provision to Licensee of prompt notice of such an Action (except where any delay does not materially prejudice Licensee); (y) Licensor’s reasonable cooperation with Licensee in the defense and settlement of such an Action at Licensee’s cost; and (z) Licensee having exclusive control of the defense, settlement and/or compromise of such an Action (provided that Licensee may not settle any Action in a manner that adversely affects Licensor without Licensor’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).",

Licensee’s obligation to indemnify Licensor shall be conditioned on (x) Licensor’s provision to Licensee of prompt notification of such an Action (except where any delay does not materially prejudice Licensee); (y) Licensor’s adequate collaboration with Licensee in the defense and resolution of such an Action at Licensee’s expense; and (z) Licensee having complete command of the defense, settlement and/or resolution of such an Action (provided that Licensee may not resolve any Action in a manner that adversely affects Licensor without Licensor’s prior approval, not to be unreasonably denied or postponed).",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Affiliates' to 'Associates' introduces ambiguity regarding the relationship and scope of indemnity. Replacing 'direct losses' with 'actual damages' and then 'concrete losses' creates a contradiction on the scope of recoverable damages. The phrase 'Regulatory Body' is used instead of 'Governmental Authority' creating further potential ambiguity. Replacing 'reasonable cooperation' with 'adequate collaboration' adds further nuance. Lastly, replacing 'control' with 'command', 'settlement' with 'resolution' and 'consent' with 'approval' provides no clear meaning to the document. ",

                "explanation": "Using “lawsuit” instead of “dispute or claim” suggests formal court proceedings, which is different than simply a disagreement. Switching 'subject matter' to 'substance' changes the focus from the topic of the agreement to its core essence, potentially creating ambiguity. Changing “governed by, and construed in accordance with” to “subject to, and explained consistent with” weakens the legal directive. The term ‘People’s Republic of China’ has been shortened to ‘China.’ Lastly, replacing “conflicts of laws rules that would mandate the application of the laws of another jurisdiction” with “choice of law provisions which would require the utilization of another nation's legislation” introduces more legal terms in an attempt to create confusion.",

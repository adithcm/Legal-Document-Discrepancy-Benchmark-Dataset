                "explanation": "The terms “Parties” and “Party” are replaced by “Venturers” and “Venturer” respectively, but only in the introductory paragraph, but not in the rest of the contract. This creates confusion as to whether \"Parties\" and \"Venturers\" are to be interpreted as the same entity throughout the whole document, potentially affecting the interpretation of obligations and rights outlined elsewhere.",

                "explanation": "The term \"finished goods\" is replaced by \"final product\". The distinction between the two terms is ambiguous. Is \"finished goods\" the same as \"final product?\" Does this affect the types of facilities to be developed? This can lead to disputes regarding the scope of NVOS's obligations.",

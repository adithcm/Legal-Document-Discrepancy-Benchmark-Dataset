MBE agrees to use its commercially\nreasonable best efforts to facilitate the execution of a Subscription Agreement\nby each participating MBE Center within a reasonable amount of time after the\nEffective Date. The Company hereby grants the MBE Centers a [***]* under all of\n                                                             ---\nCompany's Intellectual Property Rights solely to access and use the Service in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Subscription\nAgreement.",

MBE will consider encouraging each participating MBE Location to sign a Franchise Agreement\nwithin a reasonable amount of time after the Effective Date.

                "explanation": "The terms 'MBE Center' and 'MBE Location' are used interchangeably, creating confusion about which entities are subject to the agreement. Additionally, 'Subscription Agreement' is replaced with 'Franchise Agreement', and the method of determining the agreement is changed from mutual agreement to unilateral determination, conflicting with the earlier statement about mutual agreement. Further complicating the matter, the level of effort MBE commits to facilitating the execution is lessened from 'commercially reasonable best efforts' to 'consider encouraging'.",

If the relevant carrier declines, the Base Payment shall be paid by MBE itself, with no reimbursement from the MBE Center.",
                "explanation": "The key term 'Basic Fee' is changed to 'Base Payment,' and MBE's obligation to facilitate payment from carriers is removed. Instead, MBE directly assumes responsibility for the payment if the carrier doesn't pay, creating a financial burden that contradicts the original intent. In the original excerpt, each MBE Center paid the basic fee, whereas the new excerpt obligates MBE to pay the base payment with no reimbursement. This creates uncertainty about which entity bears the responsibility for the fee, and introduces new financial liabilities for the MBE.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Warranty' is changed to 'Guarantee', significantly weakening the Company's commitment. The original excerpt enforces that the service 'shall conform' to its specifications; whereas, the changed excerpt enforces that the service 'shall more or less resemble' its specifications. Furthermore, the original excerpt states that the service must be properly used and shall not contain errors, and the changed excerpt states that the Company does not care about this. This change creates significant ambiguity and reduces the reliability of the service as described by this warranty. Moreover, the term 'reasonable commercial user' is replaced with 'any user of a service loosely similar to the Service', further weakening the obligation.",

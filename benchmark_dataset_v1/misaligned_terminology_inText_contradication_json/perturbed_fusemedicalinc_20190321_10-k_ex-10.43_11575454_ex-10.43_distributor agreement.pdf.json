                "explanation": "Replaced 'Distributor' with 'Vendor' in the first clause of the Background section. This introduces uncertainty regarding whether the 'Distributor' and 'Vendor' are the same entity throughout the agreement, potentially creating confusion about roles and responsibilities. The terms are used interchangeably without being precisely defined.",

                "explanation": "Changed 'Supplier' to 'Manufacturer' in section 4.1(a) while maintaining 'Supplier' in 4.1(b). This creates a contradiction by implying the 'Manufacturer' and 'Supplier' may be distinct entities, despite the agreement initially defining 'Supplier' as such. This causes conflict when the agreement refers to the obligation of 'Supplier'.",

                "explanation": "Replaced 'Director' with 'CEO' and 'Executive Director' for the signature block.

While seemingly minor, this introduces ambiguity in the contract, particularly in Section 6 (Payment Terms), where the method of payment and auditing of these fees/expenses is discussed.

This introduces ambiguity in the contract, because it makes it unclear whether a user and customer is the same thing. It makes it unclear as to what information constitutes as one or the other, and therefore obfuscates the obligations when regarding those terms.",

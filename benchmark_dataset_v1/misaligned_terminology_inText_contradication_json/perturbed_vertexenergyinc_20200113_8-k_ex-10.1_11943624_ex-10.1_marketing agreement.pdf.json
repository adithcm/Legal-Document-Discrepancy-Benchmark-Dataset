                "original_text": "Vertex currently owns a production facility in Marrero, LA which has the capacity to produce 100,000 bbls/mo. +/- 10 % of a\nfeedstock/product (the “Output”) that can be consumed as bunker suitable fuel for offshore use and use as a marine vessel's\npropulsion system. See Appendix A for qualities of the feedstock/product (the “Product”).",

See Appendix A for qualities of the feedstock/material (the “Bunker Fuel”).",
                "explanation": "The original text defines “Output” as feedstock/product, while “Product” is further defined by its qualities in Appendix A. The change replaces 'product' with 'material' in the initial description of “Output” and redefines “Product” as “Bunker Fuel”. This creates confusion, as the document now implies the initial raw material is different from the end Bunker Fuel, even though they should be related.",

                "explanation": "The change replaces 'Product' with 'the end product' in the first sentence, implying that only the final output should be stored for the purposes of the JSMA but retains Product definition. Then the JSMA refers to itself as an 'agreement' in the last sentence creating potential confusion, as tank/storage fees are no longer tied to the specific purposes outlined for the \"JSMA\" but rather a more general agreement, making enforcement ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "The term “Remaining Exposure” is replaced with “Remaining Liability.” The document does not define 'Remaining Liability,'. This creates confusion and uncertainty, as it's unclear what components make up the ‘Remaining Liability’ calculation and whether it corresponds to the defined 'Remaining Exposure' or represents a different obligation, potentially leading to disputes over final settlements.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'Franchise Agreement' to 'Restaurant Agreement' creates confusion. While it renames the agreement, it retains the original parenthetical reference to 'Franchise Agreements', leading to a contradiction. It’s now unclear what type of agreement is being referenced, which creates uncertainty in the franchisee's obligations, rights, and expectations, and the legal ramifications of the new type of agreement.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'Franchise Agreement' to 'Restaurant Permit' creates a contradiction. It now mentions that all restaurant(s) developed must be duly licensed through individual Restaurant Permit(s), but it continues that Developer will execute El Pollo Loco's then standard Franchise Agreement.

                "explanation": "The terms 'Franchisee' and 'Licensee' are used in the same sentence, with the latter replacing the former, creating a conflict. The text also mentions how Developer must be in good standing prior to El Pollo Loco's execution of each standard Franchise Agreement, even though the prior term was 'Licensee'. This generates confusion over the franchisee's actual standing in order to execute each standard Franchise Agreement.",

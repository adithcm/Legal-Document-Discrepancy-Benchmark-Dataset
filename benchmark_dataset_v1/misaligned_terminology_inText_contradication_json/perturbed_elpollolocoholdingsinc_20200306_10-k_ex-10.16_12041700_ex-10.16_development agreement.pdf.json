                "explanation": "The terms 'franchise' and 'license' are used interchangeably. Licensing is a broad term for granting rights, while franchising is specific to a business model. Using them interchangeably introduces uncertainty as it could be interpreted that the franchisor can use a less regulated licensing structure rather than offering franchise agreement.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'site' and 'location' are used interchangeably. They are not defined, potentially leading to disputes over the specific requirements for an 'approved location', as they may carry subtly different connotations (e.g., a 'site' might refer to a specific plot of land, while a 'location' might refer to a broader area).",

                "explanation": "The terms 'default' and 'failure' are used interchangeably within a defined event of default. The legal interpretation of 'default' can be more nuanced, implying a breach of duty, while 'failure' is more straightforward. Using them interchangeably introduces ambiguity as it is unclear whether a simple failure is equal to a default",

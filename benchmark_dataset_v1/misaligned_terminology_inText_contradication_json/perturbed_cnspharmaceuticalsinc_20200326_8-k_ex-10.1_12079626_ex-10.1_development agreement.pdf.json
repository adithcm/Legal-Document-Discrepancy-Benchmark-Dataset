                "changed_text": "1.5 “Development Fee” means 50% of the Gross Revenue for any Development Products in the Development Territory.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Net Sales' is replaced with 'Gross Revenue' without clarifying if these terms are synonymous. This introduces ambiguity in calculating the Development Fee, as 'Net Sales' typically implies deductions (e.g., returns, discounts) that 'Gross Revenue' does not. This may lead to disputes over the amount owed as the 'Development Fee'.",

                "changed_text": "2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, WPD hereby agrees to use its best efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable or advisable under applicable laws to develop and commercialize the Development Products, with a goal of eventual approval of Development Products in the Development Territory.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"commercially reasonable efforts\" to \"best efforts\" increases the level of obligation on WPD. 'Commercially reasonable efforts' requires a balancing of costs and benefits, while 'best efforts' suggests a more stringent requirement. This creates a contradiction because, while the contract states WPD must use 'best efforts,' it doesn't specify what constitutes 'best efforts,' creating enforcement uncertainty.",

WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) will at all times during the Term be in full compliance with all applicable data privacy and security laws and regulations, and WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) have taken or will take appropriate actions to comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) (EU 2016/679) and all other applicable laws and regulations with respect to Personal Data (defined below) that have been announced as of the date hereof as becoming effective within 12 months after the date hereof, and for which any non-compliance with same would be reasonably likely to create any liability (collectively, the “Privacy Laws”).",
                "explanation": "The original text states 'material compliance' whereas the changed text now enforces 'full compliance'. This is a contradiction because failing to define either phrases, WPD has little guidance. The text also swaps 'commercially reasonable' actions for 'appropriate actions', further creating uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Net Sales\" to \"Net Revenue\" and removing the constraint regarding standard accounting practices introduces ambiguity. The conflict arises because later sections refer to 'Net Sales' for milestone payments and royalties, while the definition now uses 'Net Revenue' with differing conditions. This change can cause confusion as the terms are used differently and can create uncertainty in financial obligations and revenue calculations because the changed definition contradicts with later sections, potentially affecting royalty calculation.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"shall be responsible and liable\" to \"will undertake reasonable efforts,\" Aucta's obligation becomes less stringent. Furthermore, altering the responsibility for regulatory activities from Aucta's 'sole cost and expense' to a 'shared cost and expense' with Eton introduces a contradiction. Section 3.1.1 changed from all inclusive to 'reasonable efforts', and Section 3.1.2 changes cost and responsibility. This change creates uncertainty over responsibility for regulatory filings and approval, which could lead to disputes over cost-sharing and the extent of effort required. The contract fails to clearly define the scope of “reasonable efforts” or how the shared costs will be allocated.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'material breach' to 'significant breach' introduces a different terminology of breach and increases ambiguity, particularly if the contract doesn't define 'significant.' Also, it switches \"shall\" to \"may\" which weakens the requirement. Furthermore, changing 'written notice' to 'verbal notice' creates a severe contradiction, as it's challenging to prove a verbal notice was given. The contract does not define what qualifies as a 'significant' breach or describe process of a verbal notice, this introduces confusion.",

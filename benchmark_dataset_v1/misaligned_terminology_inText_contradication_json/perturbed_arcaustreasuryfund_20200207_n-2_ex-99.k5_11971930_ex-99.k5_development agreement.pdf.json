                "original_text": "(a) In full consideration of the provision of the services of the Blockchain Administrator set forth herein, the Fund shall pay the Blockchain Administrator a fees calculated at the annual rate of 0.20% of the value of the Fund’s average annual net assets. Such fee shall be accrued daily and paid monthly in arrears.",
                "changed_text": "(a) In full consideration of the provision of the services of the Blockchain Administrator set forth herein, the Fund will provide a compensation to the Blockchain Administrator equivalent to 0.20% of the Fund's average annual net assets. The compensation may be accrued and paid at the discretion of the Fund's management.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the fee 'shall' be paid monthly in arrears, implying a mandatory and regular payment schedule. The modified version changes 'fee' to 'compensation' and states payment 'may' be accrued and paid at the discretion of the Fund's management. This introduces uncertainty and contradicts the mandatory nature of payment established in the original text, potentially leading to disputes over payment terms.",

                "original_text": "WHEREAS, the Fund desires to retain the Blockchain Administrator to provide services related to the development of ERC-1404 compatible digital securities and administration of the smart contracts underlying the Fund’s digital securities in the manner and on the terms set forth herein;",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, the Fund desires to engage the Technology Provider to furnish services related to the creation of ERC-1404 compliant digital assets and management of the digital contracts backing the Fund’s digital assets in the manner and on the terms detailed herein;",
                "explanation": "The original text consistently refers to 'Blockchain Administrator' and 'digital securities.' The modified version introduces 'Technology Provider' as potentially synonymous with 'Blockchain Administrator' and 'digital assets' as potentially synonymous with 'digital securities'. This change creates ambiguity about the roles and responsibilities, leading to confusion about whether the 'Blockchain Administrator' and the 'Technology Provider' are indeed the same entity and if 'digital securities' and 'digital assets' have the same meaning under the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "The Technology Provider agrees to preserve and store all documentation, financial statements, and other data of the Fund pertaining to tasks executed by the Technology Provider under this agreement and will preserve and store such documentation, financial statements, and other data in compliance with generally accepted accounting practices.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces several ambiguities. Firstly, it replaces 'Blockchain Administrator' with 'Technology Provider,' creating uncertainty as to whether these entities are identical. Secondly, it substitutes 'books, accounts and other records' with 'documentation, financial statements, and other data,' potentially narrowing the scope of what must be maintained. Lastly, it replaces 'Investment Company Act' with 'generally accepted accounting practices,' altering the regulatory standard and potentially reducing the level of legal scrutiny applied to record-keeping practices. The shift from a legal requirement to a standard practice introduces flexibility but also risk of non-compliance.",

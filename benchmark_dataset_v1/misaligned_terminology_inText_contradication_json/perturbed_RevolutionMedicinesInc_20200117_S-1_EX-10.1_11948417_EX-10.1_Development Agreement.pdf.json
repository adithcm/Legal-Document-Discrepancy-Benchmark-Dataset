Such records shall fully and properly reflect all work done and results achieved in the performance of the Research activities in good scientific manner appropriate for regulatory and patent purposes. Each Party shall keep the other Party reasonably informed as to its progress in the conduct of the Research activities through meetings of the JRDC. Upon written request from the JRDC, each Party shall submit to the JRDC a written summary (in slide format unless otherwise agreed by the Parties) of its Research activities since its prior report.",

The records must fully and properly reflect all work done and results achieved in the performance of the Research activities in a manner suitable for internal auditing. Each Party shall keep the other Party reasonably informed as to its progress in the conduct of the Research activities through meetings of the JRDC. Upon written request from the JRDC, each Party may submit to the JRDC a written summary of its Research activities since its prior report.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the records to be maintained in a manner appropriate for 'regulatory and patent purposes' and each party 'shall' submit the requested report, thus enforcing a legal obligation. The modified version loosens this standard by requiring records in a manner 'suitable for internal auditing' and allowing parties that 'may' submit the requested report. This contradiction introduces uncertainty in enforcement.",

Promptly following the end of each Calendar Quarter during which RevMed is responsible for activities under the Research Plan, but in no event later than [***] following the end of such Calendar Quarter, RevMed will provide to Sanofi a detailed expense report in form approved by the JRDC with respect to the RevMed R&D Costs incurred by or on behalf of RevMed during such Calendar Quarter consistent with the previous sentence (including, if requested by Sanofi in writing, copies of receipts or invoices from Third Parties for all RevMed R&D Out-of-Pocket Costs) together with an invoice for the same, provided that[***]. Sanofi will reimburse RevMed in Dollars all undisputed amounts within such expense reports under this Section 4.5 within [***] following receipt of the invoice therefor. RevMed shall invoice Sanofi for costs under this Section 4.5 on an accrual basis.",

Within a reasonable timeframe following the end of each Calendar Quarter, RevMed will provide to Sanofi a general summary of expenses incurred. Sanofi may reimburse RevMed in Dollars some amounts within these expense reports, timeline to be decided by Sanofi. RevMed shall invoice Sanofi for costs under this Section 4.5 on a mutually agreed basis.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Sanofi 'will reimburse' which implies obligation. The modified text states that Sanofi 'may, at its discretion, reimburse' which implies optional. This contradiction introduces uncertainty in enforcement about financial obligations.",

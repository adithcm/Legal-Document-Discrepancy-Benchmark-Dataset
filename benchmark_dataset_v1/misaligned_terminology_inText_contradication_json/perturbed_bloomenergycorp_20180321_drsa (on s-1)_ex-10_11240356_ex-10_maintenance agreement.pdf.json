                "original_text": "Section 2.4 Facility Services Warranty. During the Warranty Period, Operator shall perform the services to the Bloom Systems and the BOF necessary for the Portfolio to perform to the Warranty Specifications (the “System Service Warranty”). In the event that Owner desires Operator to service the Bloom Systems and the BOF beyond the Warranty Period, the rate for such time-based services will be quoted by Operator to Owner quarterly for the following quarter, and materials will be invoiced at the retail prices for such materials.",
                "changed_text": "Section 2.4 Facility Services Warranty. During the Warranty Period, Operator shall perform the services to the Bloom Systems and the BOF necessary for the Portfolio to perform to the Warranty Specifications (the “System Maintenance Obligation”). In the event that Owner desires Operator to service the Bloom Systems and the BOF beyond the Warranty Period, the rate for such time-based services will be quoted by Bloom Energy Corporation to Diamond State Generation Partners, LLC annually for the following year, and materials will be invoiced at a negotiated price for such materials.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'System Service Warranty,' but the modified version replaces it with 'System Maintenance Obligation'. Further, the entities and frequency of quotations/invoicing are changed, making it unclear whether the 'Operator' refers to the same obligations under the same conditions after the Warranty Period. The original is quarterly, while the changed is annually.",

Operator may appoint an unrelated third party, who is appropriately qualified, licensed, and financially responsible, to operate and maintain the Facilities throughout the Term (a “Service Provider”). Operator shall submit such appointment of any Service Provider to Owner for its prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and if applicable, to PJM and/or DPL. No such appointment nor the approval thereof by Owner, however, shall relieve Operator of any liability, obligation, or responsibility resulting from a breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Section 2.18 Appointment of Contractor. Operator may appoint any party, who is deemed suitable, to manage the Bloom Systems throughout the Term (a “Contractor”). Operator may proceed with such appointment without needing approval from Owner, PJM, and/or DPL. Such appointment shall relieve Operator of all responsibility and liability, transferring these to the appointed Contractor.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the 'Service Provider' must be qualified, licensed, and financially responsible and that their appointment requires Owner approval. The modified version introduces 'Contractor' with far less stringent requirements, removes the approval requirement, and states that the Operator is completely relieved of liability. This directly contradicts the original provision that the Operator remains responsible even with a Service Provider.",

                "original_text": "Section 6.1 Indemnification of Operator by Owner. Owner shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Operator, its officers, directors, employees, shareholders, Affiliates and agents (each, a “Operator Indemnitee”) from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses asserted against or suffered by any Operator Indemnitee arising out of any Third Party Claims against a Operator Indemnitee to the extent arising out of or in connection with (i) Owner’s breach of its representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement, (ii) the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of Owner or its subcontractors, agents or employees or others under Owner’s control or (iii) a breach by Owner of its obligations hereunder, provided that Owner shall have no obligation to indemnify Operator for any negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of any Operator Indemnitee or the breach by Operator of any Operator Indemnitee of its covenants and warranties under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.",
                "changed_text": "Section 6.1 Indemnification of Operator by Owner. Owner will provide compensation to Operator, its officers, directors, personnel, stakeholders, subsidiaries, and representatives (each, an “Operator Representative”) for certain expenses linked to external allegations against an Operator Representative, specifically those stemming from Owner’s failure to meet promises or responsibilities within this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text enforces that there should be a formal indemnification and defense. The modified version replaces key terms: 'Indemnify, defend, and hold harmless' is replaced by 'provide compensation', 'Operator Indemnitee' by 'Operator Representative' and 'Indemnifiable Losses' by 'certain expenses' which introduces uncertainty in scope. The phrase, 'Third Party Claims against a Operator Indemnitee' is changed to 'expenses linked to external allegations against an Operator Representative', changing the scope and nature of the claims covered. The list of indemnifiable events and the exclusion for Operator's misconduct are removed making the obligations significantly different.",

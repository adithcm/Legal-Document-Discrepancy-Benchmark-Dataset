                "changed_text": "Chase will provide Partner a reimbursement for each validated credit card application stemming from a link on Partner’s Website.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Affiliate' and 'Partner' are used interchangeably, even though it's unclear if they are intended to represent the same entity. Further, 'fee' is replaced with 'reimbursement', and 'approved credit card account' is changed to 'validated credit card application'. This creates ambiguity concerning the basis of payment.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Customers' becomes 'Consumers,' 'Affiliate Program' is now 'Partner Network,' and 'Affiliate' is renamed 'Vendor.' This substitution generates potential uncertainty around who is bound by the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "For each Eligible Application (as detailed in section 4), obtained through the Promoter’s platform, the Promoter shall obtain earnings or payment (“Incentive”) computed according to the following scheme, settled quarterly.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'Approved Account' to 'Eligible Application' and 'Affiliate's site' to 'Promoter’s platform', also 'Affiliate' to 'Promoter' 'referral fee' to 'Incentive' and 'Commission' to 'Incentive', adds confusion about the method and schedule of payments. This affects the understanding of the contract's financial implications.",

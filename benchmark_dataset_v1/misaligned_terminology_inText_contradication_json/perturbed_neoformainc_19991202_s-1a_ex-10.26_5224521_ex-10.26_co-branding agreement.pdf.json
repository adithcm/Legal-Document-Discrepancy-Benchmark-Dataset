                "explanation": "The original text uses 'Advertising' with a specific exclusion. The modified text uses 'Marketing' without clearly defining its relation to 'Advertising', making it uncertain if they are the same. This could lead to disputes over what falls under revenue-sharing arrangements that should be excluded.",

                "explanation": "The original text focuses on 'commissions' based on 'Transaction Origination Party'. The modified version changes 'commissions' to 'payments,' 'Net Revenues' to 'Net Sales,' 'Transaction Origination Party' to 'Initial Contact' and 'cultivated the Opportunity', and describes a portion of the 'payments' as a 'discount for marketing and sales'. This creates ambiguity in the calculation of amounts due, as 'Net Sales' and 'cultivated the Opportunity' are not defined, differing from the original contract's clear definition of 'Net Revenues' and 'Transaction Origination Party'.",

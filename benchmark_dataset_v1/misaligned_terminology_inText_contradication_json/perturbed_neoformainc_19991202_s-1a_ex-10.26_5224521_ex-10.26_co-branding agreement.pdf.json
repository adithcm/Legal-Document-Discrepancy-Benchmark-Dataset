                "explanation": "The term 'Career Center' is replaced with 'Job Board.' It's unclear whether 'Career Center' and 'Job Board' refer to the same thing, creating potential for disputes about the scope of the agreement if VerticalNet has both a 'Career Center' and a 'Job Board' with different functionalities.",

                "explanation": "The original text includes 'sales by auction' within the definition of 'Product Listing.' The modified text explicitly excludes 'any form of auction sale.' This creates a direct contradiction about whether auction sales are included in the definition of Product Listing, affecting revenue calculations and exclusivity clauses.",

During the Term, the parties shall meet from time to time to discuss the Advertising inventory available for sale.

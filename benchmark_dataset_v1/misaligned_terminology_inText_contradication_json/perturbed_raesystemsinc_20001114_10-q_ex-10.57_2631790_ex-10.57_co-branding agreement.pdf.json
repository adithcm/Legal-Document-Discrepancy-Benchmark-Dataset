This discrepancy may lead to disputes concerning the brand features that are covered under the agreement.",

While the subsequent text refers to \"SpinRecords.com Pages,\" the change in the section heading implies a different scope. The contract does not define if the \"Website\" and \"Pages\" are the same. The change suggests there are different branding obligations for the different entities, and it's unclear which sections of the website constitute \"pages\".",

                "explanation": "Changing the term \"Rate\" to \"Payment\" can create confusion regarding whether this section describes the specific financial amount (rate) or the general obligation to remit payment (payment). Because \"Rate\" can be the agreed figure for value, while Payment is the action of doing it, the lack of consistency may lead to conflict around calculating the advertisement revenue due.",

                "original_text": "This agreement (“Agreement”) is made by and between Erchonia Corporation. (“Erchonia”) whose address\nis 650 Atlantis Rd., Melbourne, Florida, USA, 32904 and InnerScope Hearing Technologies Inc, (“Distributor”)\nwhose address is 2151 Professional Drive, Second Floor, Roseville, California, USA, 95661 hereafter referred to\ncollectively as the (“Parties”).",

(“Erchonia”) whose address\nis 650 Atlantis Rd., Melbourne, Florida, USA, 32904 and InnerScope Hearing Technologies Inc, (“Vendor”)\nwhose address is 2151 Professional Drive, Second Floor, Roseville, California, USA, 95661 hereafter referred to\ncollectively as the (“Parties”).",
                "explanation": "The contract initially defines InnerScope Hearing Technologies Inc. as “Distributor.” Changing this definition in the introductory paragraph to “Vendor” introduces ambiguity, as the contract proceeds to use both terms. This creates uncertainty regarding which entity is bound by the obligations assigned to either the “Distributor” or the \"Vendor\" throughout the agreement. Without explicit clarification, it is unclear whether both terms refer to the same entity, or if they represent distinct roles with different responsibilities.",

                "changed_text": "Responsibilities of Vendor.\na.\nVendor should aim to market, promote and sell the Products to the authorized\ncustomers in the Filed of Use and in the Territory during the term of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "In Section 2, the original text imposes an obligation on the “Distributor” to use its best efforts. The modified text replaces \"Distributor\" with \"Vendor\" and 'shall' with 'should aim', creating a shift from a mandatory obligation to a more suggestive one. This conflict impacts the enforceability of this clause. If “Distributor” and “Vendor” are intended to be the same entity (as now contradicted in the introduction), the degree of effort required is ambiguous. Did the party violate their contract if they didn't fully commit to promoting and selling the products if 'shall' was changed to 'should aim'?",

Such purchase orders shall set\nforth the quantity of each product ordered, the required delivery date, and the point of delivery.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that Erchonia will provide products to the \"Distributor.\" In the revised text, 'Distributor' is replaced with 'client', 'buyer', and 'purchaser.' This substitution creates confusion regarding the roles and responsibilities within the purchasing process. It is now unclear whether the Distributor, Client, Buyer, and Purchaser are the same entity, or if they are distinct parties involved in the transaction. This creates ambiguity around who is authorized to place orders and receive products, which can lead to disputes over order fulfillment and payment obligations.",

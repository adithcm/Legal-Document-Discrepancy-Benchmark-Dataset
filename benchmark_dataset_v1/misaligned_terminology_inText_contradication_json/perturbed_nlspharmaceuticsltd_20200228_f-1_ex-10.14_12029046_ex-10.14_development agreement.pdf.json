                "changed_text": "Retailer shall mean a company selected by Licensee and agreed by Licensor in a country of the Territory for the import, selling, promotion and distribution of the Licensed Product in such country of the Territory.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Distributor' is replaced by 'Retailer'. While both can refer to entities involved in selling products, 'Distributor' typically implies a larger scale operation, potentially with exclusive rights within a territory, whereas 'Retailer' suggests a direct seller to consumers. This creates ambiguity about the scope of the Licensee's rights and responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "The term 'products' is replaced by 'formulations'. This changes the scope of the agreement, as 'formulations' refers specifically to the chemical or medicinal composition of the drug, while 'products' is broader and could include packaging, devices, or other related items. This could lead to disputes over what is actually covered by the license.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'Distributor' and 'Retailer' are replaced by 'Vendor'. While both can refer to entities involved in selling products, 'Vendor' typically implies a party that is selling/providing goods and/or services for further value-added processing rather than just retail sale directly to consumers as in 'Retailer'.

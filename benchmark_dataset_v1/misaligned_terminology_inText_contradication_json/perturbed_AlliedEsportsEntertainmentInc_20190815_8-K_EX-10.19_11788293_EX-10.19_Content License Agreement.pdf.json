Zynga shall not be required to pay the Royalty to the extent offset by the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments previously paid to WPT during the Term. Conversely, Zynga shall not be required to make Annual Minimum Guarantee payments to the extent offset by the Royalty previously paid to WPT during the Term.",
                "changed_text": "Zynga will provide WPT ten percent (10%) of the cumulative Net Revenue (as defined in Section 3.b. of the Additional Provisions) (“Consideration”) from the WPT-branded Zynga Poker Tournament Mode or other such use of the WPT brand on the Zynga platform. Zynga may, at its discretion, provide the Consideration, with the amount offset by the Annual Minimum Guarantee amounts previously paid to WPT during the Term. Conversely, Zynga shall not be required to make Annual Minimum Guarantee payments to the extent offset by the Consideration previously provided to WPT during the Term.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'Royalty' payments, whereas the modified version changes 'Royalty' to 'Consideration' and states that Zynga 'may, at its discretion, provide the Consideration'. This introduces uncertainty and contradicts the obligatory nature of the initial payment terms, creating a contradiction in enforcement.",

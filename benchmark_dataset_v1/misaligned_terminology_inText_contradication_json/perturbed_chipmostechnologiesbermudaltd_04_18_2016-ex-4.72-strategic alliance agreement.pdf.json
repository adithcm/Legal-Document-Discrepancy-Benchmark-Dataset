(“Tsinghua Unigroup”), a company incorporated under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). ChipMOS and Tsinghua Unigroup shall collectively be referred to as the “Parties.”",

(“Tsinghua Unigroup” or “Client”), a company incorporated under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). ChipMOS and Tsinghua Unigroup shall collectively be referred to as the “Parties.”",
                "explanation": "Introduces ambiguity by using 'Service Provider' and 'Client' interchangeably with 'ChipMOS' and 'Tsinghua Unigroup'. This can lead to confusion regarding their roles and obligations within specific clauses.",

Each Participant shall use its reasonable efforts to provide occasional assistance to, and passively cooperate with, the other Participant, to partially implement this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'Parties' to 'Participants', 'regular meetings' to 'occasional meetings', 'specific plan' to 'flexible plan', 'reasonable best efforts' to 'reasonable efforts', 'immediate assistance' to 'occasional assistance', 'actively cooperate' to 'passively cooperate', and 'implement this Agreement' to 'partially implement this Agreement', creates conflicting obligations. It's unclear if 'Participants' is the same as 'Parties'.",

By changing these to 'Individuals', 'Stakeholders', 'details', 'completion', 'presence', 'substance', 'Contract', 'outside entity', 'Principals', 'statement', 'community', 'prior restraint', 'revelations', 'directorate', 'leadership cadre', 'allied personnel', 'intelligence', 'legal representatives', 'bookkeepers', 'monetary advocates', and 'capable bodies', the definitions and specific context are now very ambigious.",

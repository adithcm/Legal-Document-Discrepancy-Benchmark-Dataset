                "original_text": "1.36 “CytoDyn Know-How” means any and all Know-How Controlled by CytoDyn either or both as of the Effective Date or during the Term that is\nnecessary or useful to Commercialize any Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"CytoDyn Know-How\" to \"CytoDyn Information\" creates confusion. The original agreement consistently refers to \"CytoDyn Know-How\" regarding intellectual property. By using \"CytoDyn Information\" in one instance, it creates ambiguity about whether the scope of intellectual property is different from the defined \"Know-How.\"",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Commercialization\" to \"Marketing\" in this context creates ambiguity. While marketing is a part of commercialization, the change suggests Vyera's control is limited to marketing, potentially excluding other aspects of commercialization, creating a conflict with the definition of commercialization in Section 1.24.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Trademarks\" to \"Symbols\" introduces inconsistency. While in the first sentence, trademark is properly defined, the second sentence's shift to 'Symbols' can imply a distinction, creating a contradiction in relation to ownership and potentially diluting the strength of the legal protections for the Trademarks.",

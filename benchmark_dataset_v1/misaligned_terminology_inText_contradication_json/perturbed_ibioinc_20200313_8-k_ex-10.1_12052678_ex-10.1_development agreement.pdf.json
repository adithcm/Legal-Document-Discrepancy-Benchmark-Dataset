                "explanation": "The term 'Parties' is replaced with 'Entities' which can create uncertainty. The agreement begins defining the participants as 'Parties,' yet later may refer to them as 'Entities'. This makes it unclear if 'Entities' refers specifically to iBio and CC-Pharming, or if it encompasses other organizations involved in the project.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Product' is replaced with 'Item'. Throughout the contract, the deliverable is established as 'Product'.

                "explanation": "The term 'Party' is replaced with 'Signatory'. While technically similar, 'Signatory' typically refers to the act of signing the agreement. Using this interchangeably creates a potential ambiguity.

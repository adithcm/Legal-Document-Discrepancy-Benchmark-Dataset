The document doesn't explicitly define these new terms nor clarify if they are interchangeable with the original terms, creating confusion about the roles and responsibilities of Verizon ABS LLC and Cellco Partnership.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Depositor' to 'Transferor' and 'representations and warranties' to 'assurances and guarantees' creates ambiguity. The document uses “Contract” instead of “Agreement,”. It is unclear whether Transferor has the same liability as the original Depositor. Using 'assurances and guarantees' instead of the more legally precise 'representations and warranties' might weaken the enforceability of this section.",

                "explanation": "Changing “Depositor will deposit” to “Transferor may deposit” shifts the obligation. In the original text, the Depositor had a clear obligation to deposit the Required Reserve Amount. The changed text makes this deposit optional, creating uncertainty regarding the funding of the Reserve Account, which is critical for the security of the notes.",

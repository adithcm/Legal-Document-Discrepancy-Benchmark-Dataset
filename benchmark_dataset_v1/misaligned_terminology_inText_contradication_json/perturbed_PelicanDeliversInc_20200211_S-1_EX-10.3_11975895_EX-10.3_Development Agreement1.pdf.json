The modified text names 'Seattle Software Developers and Pelican Delivers,' but ambiguously suggests that undefined terms derive meaning from the current 'Statement of Work' instead of the main 'Agreement,' causing confusion and uncertainty in interpretation of key terms.",

The original text has used 'users' and 'customers' somewhat interchangeably up to this point, but now 'patrons' and 'clients' are introduced with no clear connection, making it uncertain who receives order updates and who can pick up in-store. Is a 'client' the same as a 'patron'?",

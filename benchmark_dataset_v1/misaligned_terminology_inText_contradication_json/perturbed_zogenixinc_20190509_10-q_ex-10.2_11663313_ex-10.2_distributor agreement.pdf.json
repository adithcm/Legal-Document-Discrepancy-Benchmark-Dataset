                "explanation": "Changing 'distributor' to 'supplier' introduces confusion about the role of Nippon Shinyaku. A distributor markets and sells, while a supplier provides products. This creates ambiguity regarding Nippon Shinyaku's core responsibilities, making it unclear if they primarily sell or just supply the product to others who sell.",

                "explanation": "Replacing “Distributor” with \"the exclusive vendor\" creates uncertainty. The contract consistently refers to “Distributor” (defined as Nippon Shinyaku Company, Ltd.), but using “exclusive vendor” without defining it introduces ambiguity. This makes enforcement difficult as it’s unclear if 'the exclusive vendor' refers to the same entity, potentially affecting liability and obligations.",

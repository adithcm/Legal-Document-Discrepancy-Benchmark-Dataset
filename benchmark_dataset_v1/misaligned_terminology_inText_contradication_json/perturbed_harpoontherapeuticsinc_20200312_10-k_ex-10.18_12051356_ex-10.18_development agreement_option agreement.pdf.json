Harpoon shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, attack, dispute, or contest the validity of or ownership of such Product Trademark anywhere in the Territory or any registrations issued or issuing with respect thereto or use in their respective businesses, any Trademark that is confusingly similar to, misleading or deceptive with respect to or that dilutes any (or any part) of the Product Trademarks.",

Harpoon shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, attack, dispute, or contest the validity of or ownership of such Product Trademark anywhere in the Territory or any registrations issued or issuing with respect thereto or use in their respective businesses, any Brand that is confusingly similar to, misleading or deceptive with respect to or that dilutes any (or any part) of the Product Trademarks.",
                "explanation": "The original text refers to 'Trademark,' while the modified text substitutes 'Brand' in the same sentence. This creates a contradiction, as it's unclear whether 'Product Trademark' and 'Brand' are intended to refer to the same concept. This could cause confusion over whether Harpoon is restricted from using similar brands, Trademarks, or both.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses 'rights,' but the modified text replaces it with 'entitlements' without defining that those are the same. This change creates a contradiction because it raises questions about whether every 'right' granted under the contract is an entitlement in the event of bankruptcy. Rights are typically legal abilities or permissions, entitlements are often legally granted access to benefits or conditions.",

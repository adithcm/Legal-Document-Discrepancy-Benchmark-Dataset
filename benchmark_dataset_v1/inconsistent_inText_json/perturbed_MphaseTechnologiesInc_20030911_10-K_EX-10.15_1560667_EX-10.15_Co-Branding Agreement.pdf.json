                "original_text": "11. The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Either party wishing to terminate the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the desired date of termination.",
                "changed_text": "11. The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Either party wishing to terminate the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the desired date of termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lucent may terminate this agreement at any time without notice if mPhase breaches any term of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding termination. Originally, both parties needed to provide 30 days' notice. The added sentence allows Lucent to terminate immediately for any breach, creating uncertainty and conflicting terms about the termination process and notice period.",

Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods. mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to the current quality of their Goods.\n8. If Lucent determines that mPhase's Goods are no longer maintained at the current level of quality, Lucent shall so notify mPhase, in writing, and Lucent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "7. Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods. mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to a level deemed acceptable by Lucent.\n8. If Lucent determines that mPhase's Goods are no longer maintained at the current level of quality, Lucent may immediately terminate this Agreement. Lucent is not required to provide any written notice to mPhase.",
                "explanation": "The original clauses specify that mPhase must maintain the 'current level of quality' and Lucent must provide written notice before termination. The changed text allows Lucent to determine what is an 'acceptable level' of quality and removes the requirement for written notice before terminating the agreement. This creates a contradiction because the determination of quality level is unilaterally shifted to Lucent, and they are no longer required to give notification before termination.",

                "explanation": "The change adds a clause that allows mPhase to refuse inspections if they deem them too onerous, directly contradicting the original agreement that mPhase 'agrees to allow' inspections. This creates uncertainty about whether Lucent can actually conduct inspections and enforce compliance.",

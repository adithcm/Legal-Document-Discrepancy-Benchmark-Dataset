                "original_text": "16. All Members will contribute their respective Capital Contributions fully and on time.",
                "changed_text": "16. All Members will contribute their respective Capital Contributions; BorrowMoney.com, Inc will contribute their capital contribution fully and on time. JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go will contribute their capital contribution within 60 days of receiving an invoice from the Venture.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the timing of capital contributions. Section 16 originally states that all members must contribute fully and on time. The modified version specifies that JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go has 60 days after receiving an invoice, effectively creating different deadlines. This leads to uncertainty on enforcement as there are contradicting terms for when the capital contribution should be made.",

Any Member can call a special meeting to resolve urgent issues that require a vote and that cannot wait for the next regularly scheduled meeting. When calling a special meeting, all Members must be provided with reasonable notice. Where a special meeting has been called, the meeting will be restricted to the specific purpose for which the meeting was called.",
                "changed_text": "25. Regular Member meetings will be held quarterly. Minutes of the meetings will be maintained on file.\n26. Any Member can call a special meeting to resolve urgent issues that require a vote and that cannot wait for the next regularly scheduled meeting. When calling a special meeting, BorrowMoney.com, Inc must provide all Members with a 24-hour notice, while JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go requires 7 days’ notice. Where a special meeting has been called, the meeting will be restricted to the specific purpose for which the meeting was called.",
                "explanation": "The modified section 26 creates a conflict in the notice period required for special meetings. The original clause mentions 'reasonable notice' for all members. The modified version sets different notice period requirements for BorrowMoney.com, Inc (24 hours) and JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go (7 days). This ambiguity causes uncertainty as it is not clear which notice period prevails, leading to potential disputes about the validity of special meetings and their decisions.",

                "original_text": "39. In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Venture will be determined based on the fair market value appraisal of all Venture assets (less liabilities) in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Members. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Members. A withdrawing Member’s interest will be based on the proportion of their respective capital account less any outstanding liabilities a Member may have to the Venture. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Venture despite the withdrawal of any individual Member.",
                "changed_text": "39. In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Venture will be determined based on the fair market value appraisal of all Venture assets (less liabilities) in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) by an independent accounting firm agreed to by BorrowMoney.com, Inc only. An appraiser will be appointed within 30 days of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Members, except JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go, who can request a secondary independent audit within 15 days. A withdrawing Member’s interest will be based on the proportion of their respective capital account less any outstanding liabilities a Member may have to the Venture. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Venture despite the withdrawal of any individual Member.",
                "explanation": "The original section 39 requires all members to agree on the independent accounting firm for valuation. The changed text states that BorrowMoney.com, Inc solely agrees on the firm. Further, it grants JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go the right to request a secondary audit, effectively challenging the initial appraisal's binding nature. This creates conflicting stipulations regarding the appraisal process and its binding effect, causing enforcement uncertainty. It's no longer clear if the first appraisal is definitive or if JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go's secondary audit takes precedence.",

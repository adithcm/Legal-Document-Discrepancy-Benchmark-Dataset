Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Event of Default will not be deemed to have\noccurred until fifteen (15) days after the non-defaulting party has provided the defaulting party with written notice specifying the\nEvent of Default and such Event of Default remains uncured.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Event of Default will not be deemed to have\noccurred until fifteen (15) days after the non-defaulting party has provided the defaulting party with written notice specifying the\nEvent of Default and such Event of Default remains uncured. However, failure to pay outstanding invoices within five (5) business days of notice of default automatically voids this cure period.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Section 11.3 initially provides a 15-day cure period for any Event of Default. The added sentence shortens the cure period to five business days for defaults related to payment of invoices, creating uncertainty about which cure period applies to payment defaults.",

                "explanation": "Section 5 initially states that no payment is due. The added sentence allows Licensee to charge a fee for technical support if the WLIB Programs don't meet standards defined elsewhere. This contradicts the original 'no payment' term, creating uncertainty regarding payment obligations.",

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and in the\nabsence of a timely cure pursuant to Section 11.3, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement, effective immediately\nupon written notice to the defaulting party. However, Licensee may only terminate this agreement for an Event of Default by Programmer if the event severely impacts broadcasting quality.",
                "explanation": "Section 11.4 states the non-defaulting party may terminate the agreement upon an Event of Default if it goes uncured. The added sentence adds a condition of \"severely impacts broadcasting quality\", which only applies to Licensee when terminating due to Programmer's Event of Default.

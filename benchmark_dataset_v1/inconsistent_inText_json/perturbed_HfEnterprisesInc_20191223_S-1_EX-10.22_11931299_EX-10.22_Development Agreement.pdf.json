As payment for Developer’s satisfactory performance of the services set forth in Schedule 1 hereto\n(the “Technology Development Services”), DSS shall pay Developer the sum of US $23,000 per month, for the duration of the Term hereof, with\npayments to commence on March 1, 2018.",
                "changed_text": "1.2. Development Fees. As payment for Developer’s satisfactory performance of the services set forth in Schedule 1 hereto\n(the “Technology Development Services”), DSS shall pay Developer the sum of US $23,000 per month, for the first three months of the Term hereof, with\npayments to commence on March 1, 2018. Subsequent payments will be determined based on project milestones achieved, as defined and agreed upon by both parties in writing, no later than the 15th of the preceding month.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states a fixed monthly payment for the duration of the term. The modified clause introduces a condition where payment changes after the first three months and depends on milestones to be defined later. This directly contradicts the fixed payment term, creating ambiguity and potential disputes regarding payment amounts and timing after the initial period.",

The Initial Term shall automatically renew for one-month periods thereafter unless either party provides 30-\ndays advance notice of termination, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, DSS reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time, with no less than 5 days written notice. For purposes hereof, the Initial Term, together with any\nextension or renewal terms, shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the “Term”.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the contract automatically renews for one month unless a 30 day notice is given. The added sentence introduces a clause that DSS can terminate with 5 days notice. This creates a direct contradiction because it's now unclear what the actual notice period is. It also contradicts that it can be terminated pursuant to section 2.2 only.",

                "explanation": "The original clause gives sole ownership of improvements to DSS. The added clause specifies that if an improvement is jointly invented and patented, then the developer retains ownership of those. This creates an in-text contradiction about who owns the improvements. The language \"shall assign in the future to DSS all rights it may acquire by operation of law\" is then contradicted by the previous sentence.",

Heritage shall not, however, purchase ingredients or packaging materials in excess of those required [***].”\nb. Section 3(c) of the Agreement is amended so that whereas it previously read:\n“Heritage shall charge Premier [***] as set forth in Schedule C.”\nit now reads:\n“Heritage shall charge Premier [***] as set forth in the relevant Schedule C or Schedule C-1.”",

                "explanation": "This creates a conflict in payment terms by stating in 3(b) to use Schedule C or C-1, but 3(c) only says Schedule C-1. It's unclear which schedule determines the payment. This could lead to disputes over which pricing applies to which products.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction. While Schedule A-1 is incorporated, a new clause states that products on A-1 have unilaterally determined quality standards. This conflicts with Section 3(h), which stipulates that *all* products must conform to Premier's specifications, introducing ambiguity and uncertainty regarding quality requirements and compliance.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict by stating that the original agreement remains in effect, but then allowing Heritage to decide which parts conflict and thus, are overridden. This contradicts the original agreement's intent and introduces uncertainty as it gives Heritage unilateral power to change the agreement outside of the amendment's specified changes.",

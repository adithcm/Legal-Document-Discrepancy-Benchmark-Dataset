All payments due to either party\nhereunder shall be made in immediately available U.S. funds, without set-off or\ncounterclaim, free and clear of (and without deduction for or grossed up for, as\napplicable), any taxes, duties, charges, withholdings, restrictions or\nconditions of any nature imposed or levied by any governmental taxing or other\nauthority.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment term from '30 days' to '60 days' creates an in-text contradiction with Section 8.2, which states that either party may terminate the agreement 'immediately upon written notice to the other party in the event any material breach of a material term of this Agreement by such other party that remains uncured 30 days in the case of a breach of a payment obligation'. This makes it unclear whether a 30-day or 60-day period is the acceptable payment deadline.",

                "explanation": "By altering the interest rate on late payments from '1% per month' to '2% per month', the contract now faces a potential enforcement issue. This introduces uncertainty since parties might dispute which rate is valid, leading to disagreements and potential legal challenges during enforcement.",

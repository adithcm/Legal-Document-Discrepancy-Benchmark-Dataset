                "changed_text": "Payments called for by this Section 5 which are not\nreceived within five (5) business days after the date upon which payment is due\nwill bear interest at a rate equal to the lesser of one and one-half percent (1-\n1/2%) per month or the maximum legal rate permitted under the controlling Laws.\nPayment of such interest shall not cure or excuse any breach of any underlying\npayment obligation.\n\nHowever, payments not received within fifteen (15) business days of the due date will not incur any interest charges.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. The original text states that late payments accrue interest after 5 business days. The added sentence stipulates that payments made within 15 business days will not be charged interest, creating confusion about when interest charges apply and undermining the enforcement of the initial late payment penalty.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the payment deadline for royalties. The original text states that royalties are due within 30 days after the end of each year. The added sentence extends the payment deadline to 90 days if the royalty amount is less than $[***].

                "original_text": "(6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly\ninsofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not\nthe case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100\nEUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the\nAffiliate's participation in the Program.",
                "changed_text": "(6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly\ninsofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not\nthe case, the sum due can be retained indefinitely, regardless of the total value reached, even after the termination of the\nAffiliate's participation in the Program.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding when retained Advertising Cost Compensation is paid out. The original text states it will be paid out at the latest upon termination if the 100 EUR/USD threshold isn't met. The modified text states it can be retained indefinitely, even after termination, regardless of the value. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes about when and if the affiliate will receive their compensation.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by removing the option to terminate the agreement through the Control Panel, while keeping the general statement that either party can cancel at any time. This makes the acceptable methods of termination unclear, creating confusion and potential disputes if one party attempts to terminate via the Control Panel.",

                "explanation": "The original text states element 5 can retain the final payment for a reasonable time, with a minimum of 30 days. The modification increases the minimum retention period to 90 days after the end of the respective quarter. This contradicts the initial statement of '30 days', leading to confusion and disputes. If one section mentions a minimum retention period of 30 days, and another section states 90 days, there's a conflict in the contract.",

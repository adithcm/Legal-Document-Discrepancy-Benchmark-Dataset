                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by adding a clause that allows PB to delay payments by up to six months, which conflicts with the previously established payment deadlines and the interest clause, thus creating uncertainty about the enforceability of the original payment terms.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the termination clause. While Section 14.2.1 allows for termination due to material breach, including non-payment, the added sentence states that SFJ waives its termination right if the non-payment stems from the payment delays permitted in the modified Section 6.3. The core issue is whether payment delays qualify as a material breach, and it introduces uncertainty in terms of enforceability.",

The term “Control” as utilized herein means the\npossession, directly or indirectly, of the power to influence the decisions of a Person, whether through management, ownership, by contract, or otherwise; provided, however, in no event shall Hydraspin be\ndeemed an Affiliate of the Distributor.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Control\" requires the power to *direct* management and policies, implying significant authority. The changed definition uses the phrase \"power to *influence* the decisions\", which is much broader and could include entities with minimal authority. This weakens the concept of 'Affiliate', making it unclear who is bound by Affiliate-specific clauses elsewhere in the contract.",

The requested delivery date shall\nbe no less than 120 days from the date the Order is accepted by Hydraspin. Hydraspin will not unreasonably reject any Order for\nProducts. Hydraspin will accept or reject each Order submitted by Distributor within ten (10) days after receipt of the Order.

                "explanation": "The original text allows the distributor to cancel an order if products are not delivered within 60 days of the delivery date. The modified text changes this cancellation window to 180 days. This creates a contradiction regarding when the distributor has the right to cancel an order due to late delivery, creating uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original states Hydraspin retrieves the products at its own cost, while the modified text shifts this cost to the Distributor. In addition to this, the original text stipulates that the distributor is entitled to payment in three business days of a Change of Control event, while the edited text extends this to thirty days. This creates a timing conflict in payment. Finally, the original provides the distributor the 'greater' of two options related to payment, while the modified text uses the 'lesser', creating a financial conflict.",

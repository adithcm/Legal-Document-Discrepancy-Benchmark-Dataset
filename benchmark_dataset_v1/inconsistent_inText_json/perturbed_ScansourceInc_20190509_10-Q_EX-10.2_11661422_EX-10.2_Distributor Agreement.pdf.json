Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order.

Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, purchase orders are fully changeable and cancellable by Distributor, with no penalties, once accepted by Xplore.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that purchase orders are 'non-changeable and non-cancellable' in one sentence, then asserting they are 'fully changeable and cancellable' in the next. This creates uncertainty about the distributor's rights regarding purchase orders, potentially leading to disputes.",

Distributor is required to maintain thirty (30) days of stock in Distributor’s inventory to support sales.

                "explanation": "This perturbation contradicts the obligation of maintaining 30-day inventory: The first sentence states 'commercially reasonable efforts', while the second one says 'Distributor is required'. These obligations are in conflict and create doubt.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'Such prices are exclusive of all federal, state...' is replaced by 'Such prices are inclusive of all federal, state...'. This is a conflict between who is responsible for paying such taxes, which creates ambiguity.",

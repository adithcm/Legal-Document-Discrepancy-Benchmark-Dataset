                "original_text": "Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, ExxonMobil agrees to pay FCE the amount of each invoice under this Agreement within thirty (30) days following ExxonMobil's receipt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if ExxonMobil has a good faith dispute regarding any amounts invoiced by FCE, ExxonMobil may withhold payment for the disputed amount, provided that ExxonMobil pays the undisputed amount and notifies FCE in writing of the specific amount and nature of the dispute promptly upon receipt of FCE’s invoice in which case the Parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith. The Parties shall endeavor to resolve such dispute within fifteen (15) days of notice of the dispute, and ExxonMobil shall remit payment to FCE within fifteen (15) days of resolution of such dispute.",
                "changed_text": "Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, ExxonMobil agrees to pay FCE the amount of each invoice under this Agreement within sixty (60) days following ExxonMobil's receipt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if ExxonMobil has a good faith dispute regarding any amounts invoiced by FCE, ExxonMobil may withhold payment for the disputed amount, provided that ExxonMobil pays the undisputed amount and notifies FCE in writing of the specific amount and nature of the dispute promptly upon receipt of FCE’s invoice in which case the Parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith. The Parties shall endeavor to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days of notice of the dispute, and ExxonMobil shall remit payment to FCE within thirty (30) days of resolution of such dispute.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that ExxonMobil has 60 days to pay invoices, while also mandating disputes be resolved within 30 days, and payment remitted within 30 days after resolution, which is now impossible to follow consistently. This inconsistency would create uncertainty and potential disputes over payment deadlines and late fees.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that emails are deemed delivered whether they are confirmed or not, creating uncertainty on whether the email has been properly delivered. This change also conflicts with standard legal practice, causing uncertainty on what the procedure to deliver is.",

Such books, records and accounts will be maintained for a period of at least three (3) years following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, provided there are no pending disputes between the Parties.

Such books, records and accounts will be maintained for a period of at least one (1) year following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, regardless if there are pending disputes between the Parties. In the case of a dispute, the books, records, and accounts will not be maintained following resolution of such dispute.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several contradictions. First, it shortens the record-keeping period to one year, conflicting with the original three-year requirement. Second, it removes the condition that the three-year retention applies only if there are no pending disputes. Third, it states that no records need to be maintained after dispute resolution, directly contradicting the original requirement to maintain records for one year after dispute resolution. These contradictions create ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the duration of record-keeping obligations, potentially hindering auditing processes and dispute resolution.",

Todos shall invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to\nthe Reseller, and the Reseller shall pay such sums by no later than thirty (30) days from the date of shipment.

Todos shall invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to\nthe Reseller, and the Reseller shall pay such sums by no later than sixty (60) days from the date of shipment. All payments made to Todos shall be\nin New Israeli Shekels.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states payment is due within 30 days. Later, another clause will contradict this, creating uncertainty about the payment deadline.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states Reseller is fully responsible for all taxes, however, it is now contradicted by a subsequent clause where Todos reimburses 50% of sales taxes. This creates ambiguity regarding who ultimately bears the tax burden and to what extent.",

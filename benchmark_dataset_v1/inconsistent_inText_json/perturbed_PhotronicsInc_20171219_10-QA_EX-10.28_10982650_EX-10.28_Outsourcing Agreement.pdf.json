Payments for Products delivered in accordance with the Purchase Orders, and any other to be made by the Company to Suppliers hereunder, shall be made in the Applicable Currency within [***]from the shipment of the applicable Products delivered.",

Payments for Products delivered in accordance with the Purchase Orders, and any other to be made by the Company to Suppliers hereunder, shall be made in the Applicable Currency within [***] from the date of the invoice, however, all invoices exceeding USD 1,000,000 will be paid within 15 days.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by introducing a separate payment term for invoices exceeding a certain amount. The original clause states a general payment term ([***] from shipment), while the modification introduces a shorter payment term (15 days) for high-value invoices, causing confusion and uncertainty about which payment term applies in specific situations.",

This warranty does not apply to any Product failures resulting from misuse, storage in or exposure to environmental conditions inconsistent with those specified in the applicable specifications or documentation, modification of the Product by anyone other than the relevant Supplier. If a Product fails to comply with the foregoing warranty, the relevant Supplier shall, at its option, either [***]such Product, or, in the event the foregoing options are not commercially practicable, [***]to the Company any amounts paid for the applicable Product.

If a failure occurs due to a manufacturing defect, the supplier must provide a full refund to the company, no other options are acceptable.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by adding a mandatory refund requirement for manufacturing defects. The original clause allows the supplier to choose between replacement or refund. The modification removes that choice for manufacturing defects, potentially conflicting with the supplier's preferred remedy under the original clause and creating uncertainty about which remedy applies.",

                "original_text": "Each of the Suppliers may terminate its obligations to supply a particular Product under this Agreement by giving written notice of the end of life of such Product to the Company at least [***]before the effective date of such termination (a “Product EOL Notice”), provided that (a) the relevant Supplier shall supply, and the Company shall purchase, such Product ordered pursuant to this Agreement until the effective date of such termination and including any accepted Purchase Orders outstanding on the effective date of termination, and (b) the relevant Supplier is [***]to its other [***] with respect to such Product. When the Company becomes aware that any of its customers will finish purchasing any type of the Products, the Company shall promptly notify the Supplier(s) thereof. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company has a long term supply agreement with a customer and the Suppliers (i) has confirmed in writing its intention to [***] hereunder and (ii) are actually providing Product in support of such supply agreement, neither Supplier can, to the extent of its confirmation, to supply the Company until such s[***]; provided however that, if a Shareholder terminates the [***], such Shareholder can immediately terminate [***].",

Notwithstanding the above, a supplier may terminate immediately, and without notice, if the Company is more than 90 days late on payments.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradictory termination clause. The original section outlines a specific process for ending the supply of a product due to end-of-life, requiring [***] notice. The added sentence allows immediate termination without notice if payments are overdue by 90 days. This creates uncertainty as to which termination clause takes precedence - does a supplier need to provide [***] notice for EOL, or can they simply terminate immediately for late payment, regardless of EOL considerations?",

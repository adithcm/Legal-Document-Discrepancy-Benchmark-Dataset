                "original_text": "A.  Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement on the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof.",
                "changed_text": "A.  Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement within 30 days of the invoice date, regardless of the payment schedule outlined elsewhere.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding payment terms. Section A now specifies a 30-day payment window, conflicting with the original text which refers to 'the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof', implying adherence to the Master Franchise Agreement's schedule. This could lead to disputes about whether the 30-day term overrides the original payment schedule.",

Without affecting the Guarantors’ obligations under this Guarantee, Franchisor, without notice to the Guarantors, may extend, modify, or release any indebtedness or obligation of Master Franchisee, or settle, adjust, or compromise any claims against Master Franchisee. Guarantors waive notice of amendment of the Master Franchise Agreement and notice of demand for payment or performance by Master Franchisee.",
                "changed_text": "E.  Without affecting the Guarantors’ obligations under this Guarantee, Franchisor, without notice to the Guarantors, may extend, modify, or release any indebtedness or obligation of Master Franchisee, or settle, adjust, or compromise any claims against Master Franchisee. Franchisor must notify Guarantors of amendment of the Master Franchise Agreement related to financial and payment obligations of the Master Franchisee.",
                "explanation": "Here, the changed text now says that Franchisor 'must notify' Guarantors when the initial text explicitly stated 'Guarantors waive notice'. This creates a contradiction about whether notice is required for changes to the Master Franchise Agreement, specifically related to financial obligations. This contradiction causes enforcement problems.",

Guarantors’ obligations under this Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect, and shall be unaffected by: (1) the unenforceability of the Master Franchise Agreement against Master Franchisee; (2) the termination of any obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement by operation of law or otherwise; (3) the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, or other liquidation of Master Franchisee, including, without limitation, any surrender or disclaimer of the Franchise Agreement by the trustee in bankruptcy of Master Franchisee; (4) Franchisor’s consent or acquiescence to any bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency, or any other creditor’s proceedings of or against Master Franchisee, or by the winding-up or dissolution of Master Franchisee, or any other event or occurrence which would have the effect at law of terminating the existence of Master Franchisee’s obligations prior to the termination of the Master Franchise Agreement; or (5) by any other agreements or other dealings between Franchisor and Master Franchisee having the effect of amending or altering the Master Franchise Agreement or Master Franchisee’s obligations under this Guarantee, or by any want of notice by Franchisor to Master Franchisee of any default of Master Franchisee or by any other matter, thing, act, or omission of Franchisor whatsoever.",
                "changed_text": "F. Guarantors’ obligations under this Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect, except if the Master Franchise Agreement is deemed unenforceable due to Franchisor's gross negligence; (1) the unenforceability of the Master Franchise Agreement against Master Franchisee; (2) the termination of any obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement by operation of law or otherwise; (3) the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, or other liquidation of Master Franchisee, including, without limitation, any surrender or disclaimer of the Franchise Agreement by the trustee in bankruptcy of Master Franchisee; (4) Franchisor’s consent or acquiescence to any bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency, or any other creditor’s proceedings of or against Master Franchisee, or by the winding-up or dissolution of Master Franchisee, or any other event or occurrence which would have the effect at law of terminating the existence of Master Franchisee’s obligations prior to the termination of the Master Franchise Agreement; or (5) by any other agreements or other dealings between Franchisor and Master Franchisee having the effect of amending or altering the Master Franchise Agreement or Master Franchisee’s obligations under this Guarantee, or by any want of notice by Franchisor to Master Franchisee of any default of Master Franchisee or by any other matter, thing, act, or omission of Franchisor whatsoever.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradiction. While the original clause states that the guarantor's obligations are unaffected by the unenforceability of the Master Franchise Agreement, the modified clause introduces an exception for cases where the unenforceability is due to the Franchisor's gross negligence. This contradicts the subsequent listed scenarios where the guarantor's obligations remain in effect regardless. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the enforceability of the guarantee under specific circumstances, leading to potential legal disputes.",

Payment terms for these Product invoices shall be [***]. For Product produced at Heritage facilities, Heritage shall invoice Premier on the date the Products are loaded onto Premier’s carrier. Payment terms for all these Product invoices shall be [***]. Failure by Premier to meet payment terms of any invoice shall result in interest being imposed on any unpaid balance at the rate of [***] per month, pro rata on a daily basis for partial months, accrued from its due date or in the event such rate exceeds that permitted to be charged by law, the maximum rate permitted by law.",

The original text states interest accrues from the due date, while the modified text states it accrues from 60 days after the due date. This introduces ambiguity and potential disputes over the calculation of late payment penalties.",

In the event that Premier has defaulted in its payment obligations hereunder, and failed to cure such default following notice as set forth in Section 11(a), Heritage shall have no obligation to deliver such releasable Product to Premier.

                "explanation": "This change creates an inconsistency regarding Heritage's rights to the releasable product upon termination if Premier defaults on payments. The original text states that Heritage cannot resell or otherwise use the releasable product, whereas the modified text allows them to use the product for other clients.

The modified version creates an exception for payment terms, prioritizing the invoice issued by Heritage. This directly contradicts the initial assertion, potentially leading to disputes on payment amounts, deadlines, and methods, as purchase orders might specify different terms.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the payment deadline for royalties. Initially, payments are due within 30 days after the end of each calendar month, now it's changed to 60 days. This introduces ambiguity about the correct payment timeline, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces contradictions within the confidentiality clause. The standard of care for protecting confidential information changes from 'reasonable and appropriate' to 'commercially reasonable'. Furthermore, the permitted use of confidential information expands to include exploring potential business opportunities, conflicting with the original restriction to only performing obligations under the agreement. The condition of the third party information disclosure is also changed by adding the requirement of prior written consent. This creates uncertainty about the scope and limitations of confidentiality.",

                "explanation": "The added sentence grants Lifeway the right to assign the agreement to its subsidiaries without needing Individual's consent, contradicting the initial statement that 'Neither party will assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party'. This creates an in-text contradiction regarding the assignment clause, causing ambiguity about whether Individual's consent is actually required in all assignment scenarios.",

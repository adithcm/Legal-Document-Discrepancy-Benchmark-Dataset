                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction. Section 3 initially states that the Second Amendment prevails in case of conflict. The modified version now states the opposite: the original Agreement prevails. This creates significant uncertainty about which terms govern the contract, specifically when reading the entire document, and it is unclear which clauses should be followed.",

                "explanation": "The original section 4 ratifies the entire agreement except where explicitly modified. The modified section introduces ambiguity by requiring modifications to be 'specifically identified and listed below.' But there is no real specific ID, introducing uncertainty as to which parts of the agreement the amendment truly modifies, despite the earlier mention of Section 2.A and B.",

                "explanation": "The original text refers to modifying provisions regarding [***] of the term thereof. This is vague, as [***] is redacted. The changed text makes it explicit that the parties desire to change the term and termination conditions. However, the agreement never discusses termination conditions, creating a direct contradiction between the stated intention and the actual content of the amendment. This causes confusion as to which aspects of the term are being modified and creates uncertainty around termination rights, which are otherwise absent in the actual document.",

Each party shall keep a record of all sales and shall submit, together with the royalty statements, a quarterly summary report of such sales.

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment terms for royalty statements. The first sentence states that payments should be made within **sixty (60) days**, while the 'notwithstanding' clause later says payments will be done in **fifteen (15) days** after receipt for VGSL and other CSP revenue. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment deadline and could lead to disputes.",

                "original_text": "(f) Late Payments: If a party does not receive the applicable royalty payment as specified on or before the thirtieth day after the close of any calendar quarter, the party owing such royalty shall pay interest with respect to any royalties owed from day to day until the date of payment at a rate of 5% above U.S. Prime Rate on an annual basis. Interest on royalties owed calculated in accordance with this Paragraph shall accrue after as well as before any judgment. Neither the acceptance of any payment or royalty statement nor the deposit of any check shall preclude a party from questioning the correctness of any such payment or royalty statement at any time.",
                "changed_text": "(f) Late Payments: If a party does not receive the applicable royalty payment as specified on or before the sixtieth day after the close of any calendar quarter, the party owing such royalty shall pay interest with respect to any royalties owed from day to day until the date of payment at a rate of 10% above U.S. Prime Rate, compounded monthly. No interest will be charged if payment is made within the calendar quarter following the period in which royalties were earned. Neither the acceptance of any payment or royalty statement nor the deposit of any check shall preclude a party from questioning the correctness of any such payment or royalty statement at any time.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by setting the late payment term different than the one set up in 7(d) to be within 60 days. Additionally, the interest rate is changed, and an exception is made for no interest within the next calendar quarter, creating potential inconsistencies and legal ambiguities.",

                "explanation": "This edit creates an in-text contradiction concerning the guarantee forfeiture upon termination. Previously, the licensee had to pay a portion of the guarantee if termination occurred in the second year. Now, it receives a refund, conflicting directly with the earlier provision and introducing ambiguity regarding financial penalties.",

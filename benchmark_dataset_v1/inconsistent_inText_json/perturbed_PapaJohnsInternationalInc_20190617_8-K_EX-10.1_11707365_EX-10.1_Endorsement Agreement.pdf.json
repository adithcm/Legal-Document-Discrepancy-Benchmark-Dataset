                "original_text": "The Agreement may be extended for one (1) year upon the parties’ mutual agreement in writing, it being specifically understood the services to be performed by CELEBRITY (on behalf of ABG) and remuneration to ABG in connection with the same shall be negotiated in good faith.",
                "changed_text": "The Agreement may be extended for one (1) year upon the parties’ mutual agreement in writing, it being specifically understood the services to be performed by CELEBRITY (on behalf of ABG) and remuneration to ABG in connection with the same shall be negotiated in good faith. However, PJI reserves the right to unilaterally extend the agreement for an additional year at its sole discretion, with remuneration to ABG being the average of the previous three years' payments.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the extension of the agreement. The original text states that the agreement may be extended for one year upon mutual agreement, while the added text states that PJI can unilaterally extend the agreement. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as it is unclear whether mutual agreement is required or if PJI can extend the agreement unilaterally.",

Except as specifically provided herein, PAPA JOHN’S hereby acknowledges and agrees that, both during the Term and at any and all times thereafter, PAPA JOHN’S has no right to, and PAPA JOHN’S shall not, affix or attach any of the Personality Rights, in any manner, to any of PAPA JOHN’S products or services (including, without limitation, Products) (e.g., either directly on any products or on any packaging therefor, etc.). For purposes of this Agreement, “Tie-In Program” shall be defined as any program or plan developed around a particular product or property and designed primarily to generate additional income related to such product or property (e.g., traffic builders, cross-promotions, third party programs involving the use of a premium or a third party’s product and/or service), including, without limitation: (i) any program primarily designed to attract the consumer to purchase a product or service other than or in addition to the Products; and/or (ii) any cross-promotion with a third party and/or its products or services.",

However, PAPA JOHN's may use the Celebrity Endorsement in connection with any local store marketing tie-in program with approval needed only from the local franchisee.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits PAPA JOHN'S from using Personality Rights in Tie-In Programs without ABG's approval. The added text allows local franchisees to approve the use of Celebrity Endorsement for local store marketing tie-in programs. This creates a direct contradiction, making it unclear which approval process should be followed for such programs. It leads to uncertainty regarding the level of control ABG retains over the use of Celebrity Endorsement and raises enforceability issues.",

However, ABG agrees that the sole remedy for any breach of this contract is limited to monetary damages, not to exceed $10,000.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows ABG to pursue injunctive or equitable relief in case of a breach by Papa John's, implying a broader range of remedies. The added text restricts ABG's remedies to monetary damages only, capped at $10,000. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the type and extent of remedies available to ABG in case of a breach, making it unclear whether injunctive relief can be sought or if monetary damages are the only recourse. This contradiction directly impacts the enforceability of the agreement.",

Overdue payments shall accrue interest, at a fixed rate of 5% per month, from due date until paid, and the owing party is solely responsible for legal fees, regardless of collection.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. Initially, interest on overdue payments was set at the lesser of 1 1/2% per month or the maximum allowable interest under applicable law. The modified clause sets a fixed interest rate of 5% per month, which could be higher than the legal maximum. The original mentions the owing party shall pay the owed party's cost of collection(including reasonable attorneys' fees), whereas the changed text states that owing party is solely responsible for legal fees, regardless of collection, introducing uncertainty.",

A party obligated to make payments hereunder shall keep for 3 years proper records and books of account relating to the computation of such payments.  Once every 12 months, the party receiving payment or its designee may inspect such records to verify reports.  Any such inspection will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the inspected party's business activities.  The inspected party shall immediately make any overdue payments disclosed by the audit plus applicable interest.

The inspected party shall have 30 days to make any overdue payments disclosed by the audit without applicable interest.  Such inspection is at the inspected party's expense regardless of outcome.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces contradictions regarding the audit rights. The original clause limits record-keeping to 3 years and inspections to once every 12 months, requiring non-interference with business activities and immediate payment of overdue amounts plus interest. The modified clause requires indefinite record keeping, allows unannounced inspections at any time that can be disruptive, and gives 30 days to pay overdue payments without interest. The original mentions the inspecting party's expenses that are only reimbursed if payments owed exceed 5% but the changed text states the inspected party is always at the cost of the inspection, regardless of the audit outcome.",

                "original_text": "WHEREAS, Vivint Solar and Vivint are affiliate business entities, under the common control and ownership of 313\nAcquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Vivint Solar and Vivint are affiliate business entities. WHEREAS, Vivint Solar and Vivint may be deemed affiliates if they engage in similar business activities, as determined by the mutual agreement of both parties.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by presenting two different criteria for defining affiliate status. The original text defines it by common control and ownership of 313 Acquisition, LLC, while the modified text suggests affiliate status can also be determined by engaging in similar business activities and mutual agreement. This creates uncertainty about which definition should apply and could lead to disputes over the scope of the agreement.",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the “Sales\nTerm” as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar\nDeveloper, LLC (the “Term”).”",

Notwithstanding the previous sentence, this agreement may be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice.”",
                "explanation": "The added sentence introduces a contradiction. The original text defines the term of the agreement based on the 'Sales Term' in another agreement. The added sentence allows either party to terminate with 30 days' notice, regardless of the 'Sales Term'. This creates uncertainty about the actual duration of the non-solicitation obligations.",

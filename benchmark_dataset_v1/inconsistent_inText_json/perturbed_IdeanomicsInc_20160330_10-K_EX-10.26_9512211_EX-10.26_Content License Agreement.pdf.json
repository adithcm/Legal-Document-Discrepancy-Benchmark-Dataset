                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(c) “Affiliate(s)” shall mean an entity controlling, controlled by or under common control\nwith a party. \"Control,\" for purposes of this definition, means direct or indirect ownership or\ncontrol of more than 50% of the voting interests of the subject entity.",
                "changed_text": "(c) “Affiliate(s)” shall mean any entity that is affiliated with, works in conjunction with, or has a strategic partnership with either party. \"Control,\" for purposes of this definition, requires a formal written agreement approved by both parties, regardless of ownership percentage. The presence or absence of such an agreement will be the sole determinant of affiliation.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by redefining 'Affiliate'. The original definition specifies control as owning over 50% of voting interests. The modified definition broadens the scope to include strategic partnerships, removing the ownership requirement, and introduces a subjective element by requiring a 'formal written agreement' for control, creating ambiguity and potential disputes.",

                "changed_text": "7. Term and Termination.\n(a) The Term of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall commence on the Effective Date listed above\nand continue for twenty (20) years, unless sooner terminated as provided in Section 7(b) [Term and\nTermination]. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time, for any reason, with thirty (30) days written notice to Licensee.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a direct contradiction regarding the contract's term. Section 7(a) initially establishes a 20-year term, subject to the conditions in 7(b). The added sentence allows the Licensor to terminate the agreement at any time for any reason with 30 days' notice, effectively negating the 20-year term and creating uncertainty about the contract's duration.",

Limitation of Liability.\nEXCEPT FOR THE ABOVE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS AND FOR BREACHES OF SECTION 14, NEITHER\nPARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS), WHETHER IN AN\nACTION OR ARISING OUT OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION EVEN IF SUCH PARTY\nHAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of Licensee's material breach of Section 2, Licensor shall be entitled to all direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, and punitive damages.",
                "explanation": "The initial clause restricts liability for incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages. The added sentence creates an exception, stating that in the event of Licensee's material breach of Section 2, Licensor is entitled to all damages, including those previously restricted. This contradiction introduces uncertainty regarding the limitation of liability, potentially leading to disputes over the extent of damages recoverable in case of a breach.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that NVOS *will* issue stock upon reaching a profit target. The modified text adds a clause stating that NVOS is not obligated to issue the stock if it determines it would negatively impact its financial standing, thus contradicting the previous obligation. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as it is unclear whether the stock issuance is guaranteed or contingent on NVOS's subjective financial assessment.",

                "explanation": "In section 12.1, the distribution of profits is based on NVOS's audited review. However, in section 12.2, the review is now conducted by HGF and the distribution timeframe changes from three months to six months. This directly contradicts section 12.1 and leads to ambiguity on whose review is required for dividend distribution, creating potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "Article 8.1 states the agreement is renewed upon *mutual understanding* within two years of the initial term expiring. Article 8.2 introduces that the 5 year term is *automatic* unless a written notice is given 6 months before. This contradicts the requirement for mutual understanding, implying that the contract will automatically renew even if one party doesn't agree to the renewal.",

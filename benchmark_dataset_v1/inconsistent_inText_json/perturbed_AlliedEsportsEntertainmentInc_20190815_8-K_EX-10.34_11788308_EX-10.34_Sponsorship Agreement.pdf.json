                "original_text": "5.2 Without limitation of any other provision of this Agreement, failure by Allied to comply with the provisions of Sections 5.1 shall be deemed as a material breach of this Agreement and Newegg has the right to terminate this Agreement subject first to the cure provisions in Section 14.1 and be discharged from any further obligation to pay the Sponsorship Fee. If any portion of the Sponsorship Fee shall have previously been paid for any period following such termination by Newegg, the Sponsorship Fee shall be prorated and Allied shall immediately refund the portion corresponding to the unused period of the Term.",
                "changed_text": "5.2 Without limitation of any other provision of this Agreement, failure by Allied to comply with the provisions of Sections 5.1 shall be deemed as a material breach of this Agreement and Newegg has the right to terminate this Agreement subject first to the cure provisions in Section 14.1 and be discharged from any further obligation to pay the Sponsorship Fee. If any portion of the Sponsorship Fee shall have previously been paid for any period following such termination by Newegg, the Sponsorship Fee shall be non-refundable, and Allied is not obligated to return any portion of it.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction regarding the refund of the Sponsorship Fee upon termination due to Allied's breach. Section 5.2 originally stated that the fee would be prorated and refunded, but the modified version states that the fee is non-refundable. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty about the financial consequences of termination.",

However, if Newegg terminates the agreement for convenience, they will be subject to a termination fee equal to 50% of the remaining Sponsorship Fees.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding termination for convenience. The original text allows termination for convenience with 60 days' notice. The modified text adds a termination fee for Newegg, creating conflicting terms. This could lead to disputes over whether the original 'termination for convenience' clause is still valid without penalty for Newegg or if the added termination fee applies.",

The modified text allows Allied to assign the agreement to subsidiaries without Newegg's consent, creating a conflicting term.

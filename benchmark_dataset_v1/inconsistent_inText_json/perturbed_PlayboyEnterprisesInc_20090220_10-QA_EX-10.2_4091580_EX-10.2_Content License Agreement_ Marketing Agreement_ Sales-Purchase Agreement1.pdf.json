EFS shall pay a royalty (“Royalty”) to Client to be calculated and paid as follows: (a) the Royalty shall be determined based upon the percentage applicable to the Merchandise Gross Margin (pursuant to the chart in Exhibit 10, attached hereto and hereby incorporated by reference); (b) multiplied by the Net Merchandise Sales (as defined below) as applicable in each case for the applicable Calendar Quarter or Year (each as defined below). The Royalty calculation period shall begin upon the first order received by EFS via any order channel (e.g., on a Website, via mail, fax or telephone) and shall be paid to Client within fifteen (15) days following the conclusion of each calendar quarter (“Calendar Quarter”) based on the calendar year (“Year”), as calculated on the actual Merchandise Gross Margin and Net Merchandise Sales (each as defined below) for such Calendar Quarter.",

The modification extends the deadline to 45 days. This inconsistency creates uncertainty about when the royalty payment is actually due, potentially leading to disputes.",

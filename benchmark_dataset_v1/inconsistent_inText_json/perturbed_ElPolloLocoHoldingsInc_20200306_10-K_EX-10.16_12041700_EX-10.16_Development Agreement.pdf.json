If Developer has not obtained approval and entered into a binding lease or purchase agreement for each site for El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) to be developed under this Agreement by the applicable Site Commitment Date, Developer shall be in default of its obligations under the Development Schedule and Franchisor shall be entitled to exercise its rights and remedies under this Agreement, up to and including termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "2.15. Developer acknowledges that time is of the essence in this Agreement. If Developer has not obtained approval and entered into a binding lease or purchase agreement for each site for El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) to be developed under this Agreement by the applicable Site Commitment Date, Developer shall be in default of its obligations under the Development Schedule, however Franchisor will provide an automatic 60-day extension without penalty to allow Developer additional time to finalize agreements, and termination of this Agreement is not an available remedy for missing the initial Site Commitment Date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction by stating that while time is of the essence and missing the Site Commitment Date constitutes a default, the Franchisor provides an automatic 60 day extension and termination is not a remedy. This contradicts the original text where missing the deadline immediately triggers default and allows for termination, thus creating uncertainty about the consequences of failing to meet the initial deadline.",

In such event, the Development Fee shall be forfeited to Franchisor in consideration of the rights granted in the Territory up to the time of termination.

In such event, 50% of the Development Fee shall be returned to the Developer in consideration of the rights granted in the Territory up to the time of termination. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, unless earlier terminated by either party, this Agreement shall expire on ______, 20___, and all rights of Developer herein shall cease, and all unapplied or unused Development Fees paid pursuant to Section 3 hereof shall be refunded to Franchisor. The Franchisor is required to allocate unapplied or unused development fees to the Developer upon the end of the contract.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation creates an in-text contradiction by first stating the Development Fee is forfeited to Franchisor upon termination by the Developer, but then later indicating that the unapplied or unused Development Fees shall be refunded to the developer. This creates uncertainty and inconsistency. On top of this 50% of the Development Fee shall be returned to the Developer in consideration of the rights granted in the Territory up to the time of termination.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces several contradictions. Firstly, the original text specifies a 45-day period for the initial meeting after a written request, while the changed text says the dispute must be resolved in one week. Secondly, the original text mandates non-binding mediation, while the changed text specifies binding arbitration. Thirdly, the original text states the mediation meeting place is mutually agreeable, while the changed text says it will be selected by the Franchisor. Lastly, the original text allows the mediator to meet with both parties, while the changed text limits meetings to only the Franchisor, creating uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "10.\nThis Agreement shall be in effect until March 18. 2021, unless sooner terminated by either party upon (30) days written notice, without cause.\n10a. Notwithstanding the above, Principal may terminate this agreement immediately without cause.",
                "explanation": "Section 10 initially states that either party can terminate the agreement with 30 days written notice. Adding section 10a allows the Principal to terminate immediately without notice, which contradicts the 30-day notice period. This creates uncertainty about the conditions required for termination.",

Payment to be made upon shipment.\n11a. All payments for orders accepted prior to termination must be received within 15 days of the termination date, regardless of shipment date.",
                "explanation": "Section 11 states that payment is due upon shipment. Section 11a then introduces a conflicting deadline of 15 days from the termination date, irrespective of when the shipment occurs. This creates confusion over when payment is actually due, especially if shipments are delayed beyond the 15-day mark.",

Discount may vary depending on product volume ordered or\npromotions.\n9a. Principal reserves the right to unilaterally change the discount rate at any time, with no prior notification to Distributor.",
                "explanation": "While section 9 states that the discount may vary based on volume or promotions, adding section 9a gives the Principal the right to unilaterally change the discount rate without any notification. This contradicts the implication in Section 9 that changes to the discount would be related to specific events (volume or promotions) and introduces uncertainty and unpredictability in the applicable discount.",

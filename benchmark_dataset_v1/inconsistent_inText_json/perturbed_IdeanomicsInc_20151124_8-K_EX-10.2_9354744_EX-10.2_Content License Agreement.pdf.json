                "original_text": "(a) The Term of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall commence on the Effective Date listed above and continue for twenty (20) years, unless sooner terminated as provided in Section 7(b).\n\n(b) This Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party, effective immediately upon written notice, if the other party: (i) becomes insolvent; (ii) files a petition in bankruptcy; or (iii) makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after the date that it receives written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within ninety (90) days after the date that it receives written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party.",
                "explanation": "Changing the cure period from 30 to 90 days creates an inconsistency. While the initial term is set for 20 years, the ability to terminate for a material breach is now subject to a longer cure period, potentially leading to disputes over the enforceability of termination rights. This creates uncertainty about when termination can occur.",

                "explanation": "The modification removes the requirement for Licensor's consent for Licensee to assign rights to its affiliates, while keeping the requirement for the other party's approval for assigning the agreement in its entirety, creating an imbalance. This conflicting language regarding assignment creates ambiguity about what requires consent, and can lead to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'except for a quarterly fee of $10,000 payable to Licensor' directly contradicts the initial statement that 'No royalty or fees of any kind shall be owed by Licensee.' This creates a clear in-text contradiction that could lead to disputes over payment obligations.",

                "original_text": "3.2 Payment. All payments hereunder will be in US Dollars and are due and payable within thirty (30) days after the date of invoice. iPass may terminate or modify these payment terms with reasonable notice, when, in its reasonable discretion, iPass believes that its payments may be at risk. All rights of Channel Partner are expressly made conditional upon timely payment, without the right of set off, of all amounts due by Channel Partner under the Agreement. Without limiting iPass’ other available rights and remedies, iPass reserves the right to suspend or to terminate any Services ten (10) days after sending written notice of a payment that is thirty (30) or more days past due. iPass may include on an invoice, and Channel Partner agrees to pay for: (i) any Services used within one hundred eighty (180) days before the date of the invoice; and (ii) any corrections to amounts invoiced within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the original invoice. If Channel Partner reasonably disputes an invoiced amount, Channel Partner may: (a) withhold such amount from Channel Partner’s payment, provided that Channel Partner gives iPass written notice of the dispute and the reason for such dispute within thirty (30) days after the date of invoice, and pays all invoiced amounts not subject to such dispute by the due date; or (b) in the event that the invoiced amount has already been paid in full, submit a claim to iPass within sixty (60) days following the date of the original invoice. The parties will cause their authorized representatives to meet within fifteen (15) days after Channel Partner’s notice of dispute to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. If such representatives have not resolved the dispute within fifteen (15) days after their first meeting, the parties will either decide mutually to continue negotiations or, if either party does not desire to continue negotiations, each party may exercise its available remedies with respect to the disputed amounts. To the extent a dispute resolution requires payment of disputed amounts, Channel Partner shall pay such disputed amounts promptly after the dispute is resolved.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the initial payment due date from 30 days to 60 days, while the subsequent clause regarding suspension/termination for payments 30+ days past due remains unchanged, and the timeline for dispute resolution in different aspects has been changed. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual payment timeline and enforcement actions.",

                "explanation": "By changing the late fee calculation, the text introduces an inconsistency in the late fees interest that channel partner need to pay. This will change the risk profile of the contract and the economic consequences of late payment.",

                "explanation": "The modified text reduces the notification period for non-renewal from 60 days to 30 days while leaving the rest of the paragraph and related termination clauses unchanged. This creates an in-text contradiction as the operational implications and planning horizons for both parties are significantly impacted by the shortened notification period, potentially leading to disputes and uncertainty in enforcement if other sections of the contract implicitly or explicitly rely on a 60-day period.",

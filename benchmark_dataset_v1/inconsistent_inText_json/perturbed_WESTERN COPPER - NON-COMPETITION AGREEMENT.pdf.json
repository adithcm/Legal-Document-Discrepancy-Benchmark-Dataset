                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' focuses on control. Replacing 'controlled' with 'influenced' introduces ambiguity. Influence is subjective and harder to define than control. This contradicts later sections that depend on a clear definition of 'Affiliate' for obligations.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction. The initial clause restricts Mining Activities. The added clause permits it under specific conditions (less than 5% equity holding). This leads to uncertainty about whether Western Copper can invest in mining companies within the area of non-competition.",

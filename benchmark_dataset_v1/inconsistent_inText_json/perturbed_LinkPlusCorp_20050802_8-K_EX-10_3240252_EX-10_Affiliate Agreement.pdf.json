                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding the payment deadline. Section 3.5.1 initially states that payments are due within 45 days of the close of each calendar quarter. However, the modified version extends this period to 60 days. This creates a contradiction because Section 3.5.2 says that payments not received within 30 days after the *original* due date will bear interest. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes, as it's unclear whether interest applies after 30 days from the original 45-day deadline or the extended 60-day deadline.",

It changes Section 3.5.2 to impose interest on payments not received within 15 days, while concurrently altering Section 3.5.3 to consider payments a material breach only after 45 days.

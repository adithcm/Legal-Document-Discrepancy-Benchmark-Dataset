Vyera shall pay each of the following non-refundable, non-creditable payments to CytoDyn upon achievement of each of the following events with respect to the Licensed Product. Each milestone payment by Vyera pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be payable only one time.",

Vyera shall pay each of the following non-refundable, non-creditable payments to CytoDyn upon achievement of each of the following events with respect to the Licensed Product. Each milestone payment by Vyera pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be payable multiple times as milestones are achieved for each subsequent indication.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by changing the payment terms in different sections of the contract. The original text states that each milestone payment is payable only one time, however, the modified text states that milestone payments are payable multiple times as milestones are achieved for each subsequent indication. This creates uncertainty regarding which terms should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.",

All payments due to a Party under this Agreement shall be made in U.S. Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account designated by the receiving Party.

The original text states that simple interest shall accrue on any sum due to a Party if payment is not received on time, whereas the modified text states that interest only accrues if the amount is over $1,000,000.

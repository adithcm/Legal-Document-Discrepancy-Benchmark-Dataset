                "original_text": "1.1 “Affiliate” of AFSL, FSL, TPH-A or TPH, as the case may be, means a Person or group of Persons: (a) which owns or Controls, directly or indirectly, AFSL, FSL, TPH-A or TPH; (b) which is owned or Controlled, directly or indirectly, by AFSL, FSL, TPH-A or TPH; or (c) which is owned or Controlled, directly or indirectly, by any Person described in Section 1.1(a) or (b).",
                "changed_text": "1.1 “Affiliate” of AFSL, FSL, TPH-A or TPH, as the case may be, means a Person or group of Persons: (a) which owns or Controls, directly or indirectly, AFSL, FSL, TPH-A or TPH; (b) which is affiliated or associated with AFSL, FSL, TPH-A or TPH, without requiring ownership or control; or (c) which has a business relationship with any Person described in Section 1.1(a) or (b).",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by broadening the definition of 'Affiliate.' The original definition is based on ownership or control, while the modified definition includes entities that are merely affiliated or have a business relationship, creating ambiguity and potentially conflicting obligations.",

                "original_text": "1.13 “Control” means the power, right or authority to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a Person, or to elect a majority of the board of directors or similar governing body of a Person, whether through the ownership of securities or similar ownership interest, by contract or otherwise, and references to “change of control” include the transfer, disposition or relinquishment, whether directly or indirectly, of Control.",
                "changed_text": "1.13 “Control” means the ability to influence, guide, or participate in the decision-making processes of a Person, whether through direct involvement, advisory roles, or contractual agreements. References to 'change of control' include any alteration in the power dynamics or decision-making hierarchy that affects a Party's influence over the Company.",
                "explanation": "The altered definition of 'Control' introduces ambiguity. The original specifies 'power to direct management or elect a majority of the board,' establishing a clear threshold. The modified version uses vague terms like 'influence' and 'affects a Party's influence,' making it unclear what constitutes a change of control and leading to potential disagreements.",

During the term of this Agreement, TPH-A/TPH shall be responsible for the costs and expenses agreed by the Parties to maintain and/or procure the equipment for wafer processing specified in the Appendix 2 attached hereto and as amended from time to time upon the mutual agreement of the Parties (the “GaN Equipment”). At TPH’s sole option, TPH or TPH-A may purchase the GaN Equipment by completion of payment of the purchase price or depreciation cost for such equipment as set forth in Appendix 2.",

During the term of this Agreement, AFSL/FSL shall be responsible for the costs and expenses agreed by the Parties to maintain and/or procure the equipment for wafer processing specified in the Appendix 2 attached hereto and as amended from time to time upon the mutual agreement of the Parties (the “GaN Equipment”). At TPH’s sole option, TPH or TPH-A may purchase the GaN Equipment by completion of payment of the purchase price or depreciation cost for such equipment as set forth in Appendix 2.",
                "explanation": "This creates a direct contradiction regarding who is responsible for the costs and expenses related to maintaining and procuring the GaN Equipment. The original text assigns this responsibility to TPH-A/TPH, while the modified text assigns it to AFSL/FSL. This will undoubtedly lead to disputes over financial obligations.",

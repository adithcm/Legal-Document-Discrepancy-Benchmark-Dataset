Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the term for Mr. and Mrs. Smith, In Her Shoes, Idiocracy (Oww My Balls) and Ice Age II, will expire December 31, 2007.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the expiration dates for different properties. The first part of the clause extends the term for all listed properties until March 31, 2008. The added sentence then shortens the term for a subset of those properties (Mr. and Mrs. Smith, In Her Shoes, Idiocracy, and Ice Age II) to December 31, 2007. This creates uncertainty about when the rights for these specific properties expire, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates an in-text contradiction. While the first part of the sentence reaffirms that the original agreement remains valid except where explicitly amended, the addition of 'However, any clauses pertaining to revenue sharing will be null and void' directly contradicts this. Revenue sharing agreements are likely fundamental aspects of the original agreement, and voiding them implicitly modifies numerous other sections of the original agreement. This creates ambiguity about which parts of the original agreement remain in effect, potentially leading to disputes over payment obligations and calculations.",

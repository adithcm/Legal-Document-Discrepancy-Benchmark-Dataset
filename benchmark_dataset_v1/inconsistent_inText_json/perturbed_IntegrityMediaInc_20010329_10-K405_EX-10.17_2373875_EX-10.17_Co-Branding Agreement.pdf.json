                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction in the payment terms. Originally, account statements were due within 60 days of the quarter's end. Now, they are due within 90 days. This introduces ambiguity as to which deadline is applicable.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces several contradictions. The notice period for inspections changes from 30 days to 15 days, the number of inspections allowed per accounting period changes from one to two, and the period for which books can be inspected is reduced from two years to one year. This creates uncertainty regarding inspection rights.",

                "original_text": "3. Notices. Any notice required under this Agreement to be given by either Party to the other Party shall be in writing in the English language. Any required notice shall be effective two business days after it is sent by a recognized international courier service to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and any receipt issued by the courier service shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice.",
                "changed_text": "3. Notices. Any notice required under this Agreement to be given by either Party to the other Party shall be in writing in the English language. Any required notice shall be effective five business days after it is sent by a recognized international courier service to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and any receipt issued by the courier service shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the effective date of notices. The original text specifies two business days, while the modified text changes it to five business days. This creates ambiguity about when a notice is officially considered received, potentially affecting deadlines and obligations tied to the notice.",

Dispute Resolution.\n(a) All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall to the extent possible be settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties within fifteen (15) days from the date of written notice by either Party of the existence of such dispute, and, failing such amicable settlement, shall be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“Rules”). To the extent there is any conflict between the Rules and the Federal Arbitration Act as it pertains to such arbitration, the Rules shall prevail.",

Dispute Resolution.\n(a) All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall to the extent possible be settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties within thirty (30) days from the date of written notice by either Party of the existence of such dispute, and, failing such amicable settlement, shall be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“Rules”). To the extent there is any conflict between the Rules and the Federal Arbitration Act as it pertains to such arbitration, the Federal Arbitration Act shall prevail.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces two contradictions. First, the negotiation period is extended from fifteen (15) days to thirty (30) days. Second, the order of precedence between the ICC Rules and the Federal Arbitration Act is reversed, creating uncertainty as to which rules govern the arbitration process.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the interest rate fixed by the arbitrator should not be *lower* than the prime commercial lending rate, setting a minimum. The modified text states that the rate should not be *higher* than the prime rate, setting a maximum. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the acceptable range for the interest rate and whether the rate should be capped or have a minimum.",

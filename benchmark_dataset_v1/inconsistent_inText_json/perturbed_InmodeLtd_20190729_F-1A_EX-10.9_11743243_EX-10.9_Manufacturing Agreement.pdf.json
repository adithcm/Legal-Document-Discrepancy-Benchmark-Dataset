                "explanation": "This modification introduces contradictory terms related to the Finished Goods Inventory (FGI). In section 7.4.2, the replenishment time is changed from sixty (60) days to thirty (30) days, requiring faster restocking. Simultaneously, section 7.4.3 extends the holding period before mandatory customer purchase from three (3) months to six (6) months. This creates a conflict between the urgency to replenish the FGI and the extended timeframe for the customer to be obligated to buy the held inventory, which can cause disagreements over inventory levels and financial commitments.",

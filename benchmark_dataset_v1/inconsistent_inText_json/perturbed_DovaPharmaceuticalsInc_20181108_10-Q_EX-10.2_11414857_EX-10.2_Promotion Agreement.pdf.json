Notwithstanding the previous sentence, Valeant shall have 90 days following the end of each calendar quarter to submit the detail report.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating two different timelines for Valeant to submit detail reports. The first part of the section says that the report should be provided within [***] days. The added sentence specifies that Valeant has 90 days to submit this report. This introduces uncertainty, potentially leading to disputes.",

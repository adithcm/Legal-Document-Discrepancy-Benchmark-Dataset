                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment upon adoption. The changed text adds a 30-day deadline, potentially conflicting with other implied payment terms. If, for example, Stage 7 is contingent on Stage 6, this could create a situation where Party A is obligated to move forward with Stage 7 before the 30-day payment window for Stage 6 closes.",

                "explanation": "The original text states no refunds if non-architect reasons cause termination and full refunds if architect reasons cause termination. The changed text allows for negotiated refunds in the former and reduces the refund to 50% with a service quality stipulation in the latter, creating a contradiction in the original, absolute terms.",

Should both Parties be unable to reach an agreement within one month through negotiation, they are required to attend mediation facilitated by a mutually agreed-upon mediator before considering arbitration. Arbitration is only available after unsuccessful mediation in Miaoli County and the arbitration result shall be compulsory.\nII.

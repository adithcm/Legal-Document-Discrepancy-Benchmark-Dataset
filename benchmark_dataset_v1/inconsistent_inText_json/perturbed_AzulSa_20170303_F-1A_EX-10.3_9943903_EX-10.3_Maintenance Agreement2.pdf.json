The Parties shall make their reasonable endeavours to settle the Dispute amicably by a committee composed of one (1) management representative of each Party (the “Representatives”). Such committee shall be created by the Parties within [*****] from the date of receipt of the Notice of Dispute.",
                "changed_text": "5.2 Arbitration: in the event of a dispute arising out of or relating to this Amendment, including without limitation disputes regarding the existence, validity or termination of this Amendment (a “Dispute”), either Party may notify such Dispute to the other through service of a written notice (the “Notice of Dispute”). The Parties shall immediately proceed to arbitration, bypassing any preliminary negotiation attempts. The arbitral tribunal will be composed of one (1) arbitrator selected solely by the Repairer. Such arbitrator shall be appointed within [*****] from the date of receipt of the Notice of Dispute.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict regarding the dispute resolution process. The original text outlines an amicable settlement attempt before arbitration, while the modified text mandates immediate arbitration with a unilaterally selected arbitrator, removing the opportunity for negotiation and favoring one party. This creates uncertainty as to which procedure must be followed, hence creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

In case the two (2) arbitrators appointed by the Parties do not agree on this choice with [*****] from the date the last arbitrator is appointed, the third arbitrator will be appointed by the ICC Court.",
                "changed_text": "5.2.1 The arbitrator selected by the Repairer shall have sole authority to determine the outcome of the Dispute. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, with no option for appeal or further review. The arbitration proceedings will adhere to a process determined solely by the Repairer, without any required adherence to the Rules and Conciliation of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce or any other international arbitration body.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the original process for arbitration, which involves a three-arbitrator panel and adherence to ICC rules. The changed text gives the Repairer's chosen arbitrator absolute power and ignores established arbitration rules, creating a direct conflict. This inconsistency generates ambiguity about the arbitration process, particularly whether there is any avenue for an unbiased arbitration process.",

This includes but is not limited to payment terms, dispute resolution, and termination clauses.",
                "explanation": "This clause creates a further contradiction by specifying that in any conflicting instance the terms most favourable to the Repairer shall prevail. This directly undermines the intent of the agreement to be mutually beneficial, and creates doubt regarding enforceability.",

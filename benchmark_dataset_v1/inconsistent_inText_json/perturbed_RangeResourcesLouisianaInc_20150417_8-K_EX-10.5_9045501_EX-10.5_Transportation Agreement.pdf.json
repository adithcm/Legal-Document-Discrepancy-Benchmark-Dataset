All payments are due on the later of: (1) within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice; (2) the twenty-seventh (27th) of the month following receipt of the invoice, or; (3) if the twenty-seventh (27th) of the month following receipt of the invoice is not a Business Day, on the next Business Day thereafter.",

All payments are due: (1) within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice; (2) the payments will be accepted up to the thirtieth (30th) of the month following receipt of the invoice, or; (3) if the thirtieth (30th) of the month following receipt of the invoice is not a Business Day, payments can be made up to the next three (3) Business Day thereafter.",

At any time, upon the request of Carrier, Shipper shall, within ten (10) days of such request, provide information to Carrier that will allow Carrier to determine Shipper’s capacity to perform any financial obligations that could arise from the transportation of that Shipper’s Product under the terms of this Tariff, including the payment of transportation charges, equalization obligations, the value of any loss allowance, and any negative Shipper balance positions.",

                "explanation": "The modified text introduces an in-text contradiction by altering the timeframe within which the Shipper has to respond to information request. The text originally states it should be within 10 days, but after modification, it is increased to 30. This is a contradiction and creates ambiguity.",

The original text states that interest may be charged, while the modified text states that no interest will be charged.

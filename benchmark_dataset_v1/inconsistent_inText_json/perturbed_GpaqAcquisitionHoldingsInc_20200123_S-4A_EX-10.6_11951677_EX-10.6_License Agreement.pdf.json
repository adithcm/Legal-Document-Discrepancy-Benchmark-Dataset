                "changed_text": "1.2\n“Affiliate” with respect to the Village Media Company shall mean any of HOFV and any of the following entities so long as it is\ndirectly or indirectly controlled by, or is under common control, with HOFV: HOF Village Stadium, LLC; HOF Village Parking, LLC;\nHOF Village Land, LLC; HOF Village Youth Fields, LLC; HOF Village Hotel I, LLC; HOF Village Sports Business, LLC; Youth\nSports Management, LLC; HOF Village Parking Management I, LLC; HOF Village Residences I, LLC; HOF Village Center for\nExcellence, LLC; HOF Village Center for Performance, LLC; HOF Experience, LLC; and JCIHOFV Financing, LLC. “Affiliate” with\nrespect to PFHOF shall mean any entity that is directly or indirectly associated with, has a business relationship with or has previously collaborated with PFHOF.

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by altering the definition of 'Affiliate' concerning PFHOF. The original definition specifies control as 'fifty percent (50%) or more' equity or the power to direct management. The modified definition broadens the scope to any entity 'directly or indirectly associated with, has a business relationship with or has previously collaborated with PFHOF' and lowers the control threshold to 'twenty percent (20%) or more' equity. This contradicts other contract sections that may rely on the original, stricter definition of 'Affiliate' to determine rights and obligations, potentially leading to disputes over which entities qualify as affiliates and what rights/obligations they possess.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms for the Annual Guarantee. The original text states that the first payment is due on the Effective Date. The modified text, however, dictates that the first payment is due within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date. This discrepancy creates ambiguity regarding the precise due date of the initial payment, leading to potential disputes and uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This modification affects the cure period for a material breach, specifically excluding non-payment. Originally, if the breach couldn't be cured within 30 days, an extension of up to ninety (90) days was permitted if good faith efforts were ongoing. The changed text extends this maximum extension period to one hundred and eighty (180) days. This creates a conflict because the original 90-day limit is superseded, introducing uncertainty about the permissible duration of the cure period and creating a potential dispute on enforceability.",

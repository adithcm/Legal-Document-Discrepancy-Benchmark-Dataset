                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction with section 4.5, which states that payment for amounts due shall be made within three (3) Business Days. Section 4.1 now allows for a 30-day payment window while 4.5 maintains a 3-day window, causing uncertainty.",

If at any time an Event of Default (as defined below) has occurred and is continuing, the Defaulting Party shall have ten (10) days after receipt of written notice from the Non-Defaulting Party speci- fying the default, within which to cure any such default, unless such default is not susceptible of cure within such ten (10) day period in which case the Defaulting Party shall have such additional time as may be accepted by the Non-Defaulting Party (in its sole discretion), provided that the Defaulting Party initiates cure proceedings promptly and thereafter diligently pursues cure to completion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the cure period exceed thirty (30) days. Upon the expiration or lapse of all notice and cure rights if the default remains uncured the Non-Defaulting Party may terminate this JSMA with immediate effect.",

This conflict causes confusion over the definitive time frame allowed for curing a default, undermining the enforceability of the termination clause.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Producer shall have thirty (30) days from the payment date to dispute the amount of any revenue share payout or any such claim or dispute is hereby waived by the Producer.",
                "changed_text": "The Producer shall have sixty (60) days from the end of the quarter to dispute the amount of any revenue share payout or any such claim or dispute is hereby waived by the Producer.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by changing the time frame in which the Producer is allowed to dispute revenue share payouts. Originally, the Producer had 30 days from the payment date, but the modified text allows for 60 days from the end of the quarter, which can cause confusion as to when the deadline for disputes occur and creating uncertainty on which term to use.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",

                "changed_text": "Producer agrees that ConvergTV has the exclusive right to exercise the rights granted to it under this Agreement with respect to the Program, including those in Section 1, within the Licensed Territory. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Producer retains the right to license the Program to other distributors for non-competing platforms.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by granting ConvergTV exclusive rights but then allowing the Producer to license the Program to other distributors. This creates uncertainty about the extent of ConvergTV's exclusivity.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Producer shall take all reasonable steps to protect all copyrights pertaining to each Program from infringement and will institute such actions and proceedings as may be reasonable to prevent any unauthorized use, reproduction, exhibition or exploitation by third parties of the Program or any part thereof, or the material on which the Program is based which may be in contravention of the rights and license granted to ConvergTV herein.",
                "changed_text": "Producer shall take all reasonable steps to protect all copyrights pertaining to each Program from infringement. However, ConvergTV will be solely responsible for instituting actions and proceedings to prevent any unauthorized use, reproduction, exhibition or exploitation by third parties of the Program or any part thereof, or the material on which the Program is based which may be in contravention of the rights and license granted to ConvergTV herein.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by initially stating that the Producer will take reasonable steps to protect copyrights, but then shifting the sole responsibility of instituting legal actions to ConvergTV. This contradiction creates confusion and uncertainty regarding who is ultimately responsible for protecting the Program's copyright.",

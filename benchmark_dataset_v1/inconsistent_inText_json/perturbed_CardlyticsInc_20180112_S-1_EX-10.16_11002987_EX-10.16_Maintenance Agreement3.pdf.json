                "original_text": "This Schedule (“Schedule”) is made as of the effective date set forth above to that Software License, Customization, and Maintenance Agreement, by and between Cardlytics, Inc. (“Supplier”) and Bank of America, N. A, (“Bank of America”), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (“SLCMA”). Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned in the SLCMA.",

(“Supplier”) and Bank of America, N. A, (“Bank of America”), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (“SLCMA”). Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned in this Schedule, regardless of definitions in the SLCMA.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by stating that capitalized terms will now be defined within the schedule itself, regardless of any definitions found in the Software License, Customization, and Maintenance Agreement (SLCMA). This directly conflicts with the original clause that explicitly states capitalized terms not defined in the schedule take their meaning from the SLCMA, creating ambiguity about where to find the correct definitions.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the second 'WHEREAS' clause. Originally, the clause stated the parties wanted to add the Supplier Offer Placement System Software *to* the SLCMA. Now, it states the desire to offer placement opportunities *independent* of the SLCMA. This conflicting statement now creates uncertainty as to whether these placement opportunities are governed by the original SLCMA or a separate agreement, generating ambiguity in contract enforcement.",

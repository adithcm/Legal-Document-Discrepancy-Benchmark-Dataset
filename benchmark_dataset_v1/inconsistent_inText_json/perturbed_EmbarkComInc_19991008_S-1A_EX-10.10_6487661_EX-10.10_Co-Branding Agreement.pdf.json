Late payments will incur a 10% penalty fee, with the exception of the December 31, 2000 payment, which must be made precisely on time without any grace period. Failure to make the December 31, 2000 payment on time will result in an additional 20% penalty.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding late payment penalties and grace periods. While generally allowing a 30-day grace period and 10% penalty, it specifies no grace period and an increased 20% penalty for the final payment. This creates uncertainty about which payment terms should be enforced and how strictly they will be applied.",

                "explanation": "The modification introduces an in-text contradiction regarding the termination notice period. The original text specifies a 60-day notice for both parties, while the change adds a clause specifying different notice periods (30 days for Snap and 90 days for United).

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradiction in the assignment clause. The original clause requires consent for assignment, except for specific scenarios like assignment to an affiliate or successor. The modified clause adds that Snap may assign the agreement to a third party without United Airlines' consent due to strategic restructuring. This contradicts the general consent requirement and creates uncertainty about when consent is needed for assignment, especially concerning third-party entities, leading to ambiguity and possible legal disputes.",

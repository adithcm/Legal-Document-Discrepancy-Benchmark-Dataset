                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' is based on direct or indirect control through ownership. The modified definition broadens it to include any entity with a business relationship, regardless of ownership, creating a contradiction. The definition of \"control\" is also widened, creating further ambiguity. This impacts clauses relying on a clear definition of 'Affiliate'.",

                "explanation": "The original text refers to Attachment 1 for fee and payment terms. The modified text specifies a fixed amount and payment timeframe, contradicting the reference to a separate agreement. The addition of \"negotiated separately on a quarterly basis\" adds further uncertainty and contradicts the fixed price. This creates uncertainty as to which payment terms apply.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the conditions under which Women.com can increase the payment schedule. The original text specifies sixty (60) days' notice and a maximum increase of twenty percent (20%) within a twelve (12) month period. The modified text contradicts this by specifying thirty (30) days' notice, a maximum increase of fifty percent (50%), and that the increase may happen once in six (6) months, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes over the payment terms.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the Receiving Party must return the Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy it as per Disclosing Party's instruction, while the modified text states that the Receiving Party can choose to destroy the documents at its own discretion instead, creating a contradiction.

                "original_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Change\nin Control\" means a merger or consolidation of the party with, or any sale of\nall or substantially all of the assets of such party to, any other person,\ncorporation or entity, unless as a result of such merger, consolidation or sale\nof assets the holders of such party's voting securities prior thereto hold at\nleast fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting\nsecurities of the surviving or successor corporation after such transaction.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines \"Change in Control\" as maintaining at least fifty percent (50%) of voting power post-transaction, while the modified text changes this to seventy-five percent (75%). This creates a contradiction, significantly altering the threshold for what constitutes a Change in Control and potentially affecting provisions related to assignment and other rights tied to this definition.",

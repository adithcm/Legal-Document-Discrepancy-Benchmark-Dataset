                "original_text": "2. Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a thirty-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\").",
                "changed_text": "2. Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a thirty-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, ESSI reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, with only a 15-day written notice to Talent.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding termination. The original clause requires a 30-day notice for termination, while the added sentence allows ESSI to terminate with only a 15-day notice and without cause. This creates uncertainty and ambiguity about the actual termination terms.",

Equity Payment: ESSI will provide Talent with one-million (1,000,000) shares of restricted common stock issued within thirty business days of execution of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Originally, the equity payment was to be provided within ten business days. This change extends the period to thirty business days, contradicting the immediate obligation established initially and creating uncertainty about the actual due date for the equity.",

                "explanation": "Originally, Talent had five business days to give written approval, but the modified term extends it to ten business days. This directly contradicts the original clause. Now there is conflicting information about how long Talent has to give written approval.",

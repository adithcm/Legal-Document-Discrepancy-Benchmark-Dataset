Stryker shall pay to Conformis the following milestone payments for the development\nwork to be conducted hereunder if and when the following milestones are met, as follows:\n(a) Milestone #1 - Within thirty (30) days following the date on which Stryker receives the first prototype of the Patient-\nSpecific Instrumentation delivered to it by Conformis in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a\ntotal of two million U.S. dollars ($2,000,000); and\n(b) Milestone #2 - Within thirty (30) days following the date on which there is a design freeze of the Patient-Specific\nInstrumentation for the KIB Product in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a total of three\nmillion U.S dollars ($3,000,000).",

Stryker shall pay to Conformis the following milestone payments for the development\nwork to be conducted hereunder if and when the following milestones are met, as follows:\n(a) Milestone #1 - Within forty-five (45) days following the date on which Stryker receives the first prototype of the Patient-\nSpecific Instrumentation delivered to it by Conformis in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a\ntotal of two million U.S. dollars ($2,000,000); and\n(b) Milestone #2 - Within thirty (30) days following the date on which there is a design freeze of the Patient-Specific\nInstrumentation for the KIB Product in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a total of three\nmillion U.S dollars ($3,000,000).",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction. Section 3.5(a) originally stated that payment for Milestone #1 would be made within 30 days of Stryker receiving the prototype. This modification changes it to 45 days. Now there is a discrepancy in payment times for the same type of milestone. It is not clear how it should be.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that payments are non-creditable except as set forth in the Other Agreements. The modified text contradicts this by stating that payments may be creditable at Stryker's sole discretion. This creates ambiguity as to whether Conformis can rely on payments being non-creditable and introduces uncertainty about whether a credit might be applied retroactively or unexpectedly.",

                "explanation": "The change is in direct contradiction with the orginal excerpt. The orginal excerpt claims that Section 7.3(a)(iv) survives termination of the contract, but in the edited version, I made sure it DOES NOT survive termination. This creates an in-text contradiction and would leave the audience confused.",

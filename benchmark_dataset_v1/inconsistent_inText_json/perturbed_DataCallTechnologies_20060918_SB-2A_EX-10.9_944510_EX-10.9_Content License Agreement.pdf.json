                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by extending the payment terms to 60 days after receipt of the invoice in Appendix 2, while the rest of the contract is silent regarding the payment deadline, thus creating potential for dispute over which deadline is valid.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by modifying the automatic extension period of the agreement from half a year to one year and changing the notification period for termination from 60 to 90 days in section 7.1. This conflicts with other possible sections of the agreement (implied or explicit) that depend on the original value of the extension and notification periods, creating ambiguity and potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a direct contradiction by stating that there *is* a sell-off period in section 7.5 and then stating there is *no* sell-off period in section 7.6.

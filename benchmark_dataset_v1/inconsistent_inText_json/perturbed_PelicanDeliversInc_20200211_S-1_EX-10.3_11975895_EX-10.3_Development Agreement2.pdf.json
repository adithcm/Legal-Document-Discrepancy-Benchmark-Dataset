Any Change\nRequest shall be sufficient to identify, with clarity, any objection, correction, change or amendment to such Milestone Deliverable.

                "explanation": "The change creates a contradiction by initially stating the client has ten (10) calendar days for the acceptance test, but later in the paragraph it mentions fifteen (15) days for the developer to correct deficiencies after a change request, and then another ten (10) for the client to re-evaluate. The ambiguity in the initial acceptance test period creates uncertainty.",

For any such activities, NeuroBo shall pay to Dong-A [***] ([***]%) of the fees as agreed by the Parties within [***] days prior to conducting such activities by Dong-A, and shall pay the balance due within [***] days after delivery by Dong-A to NeuroBo of the deliverables as agreed by the Parties.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by altering the payment deadline for the remaining balance due for additional activities. The original text specifies '[***] days' after delivery, while the modified text sets a fixed deadline of '90 days' after delivery. This creates uncertainty about which payment term should be enforced, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction regarding interest on late payments. The original clause states that interest will accrue at a specific rate on overdue amounts. The modified clause stipulates that no interest will be charged on any late payments. This inconsistency presents a clear conflict in the terms, leading to disputes over financial obligations.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the termination clause. Originally, if a breach couldn't be cured within the initial period, the breaching party had to start remedy efforts. The modified version removes the obligation to start remedy efforts, directly contradicting the original intent and creating ambiguity about requirements for avoiding termination after a breach.",

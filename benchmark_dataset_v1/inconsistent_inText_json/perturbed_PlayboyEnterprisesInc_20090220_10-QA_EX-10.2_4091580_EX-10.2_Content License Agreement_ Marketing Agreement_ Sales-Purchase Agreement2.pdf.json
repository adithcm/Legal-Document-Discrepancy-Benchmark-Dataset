                "original_text": "This Contract may not be modified or terminated except in writing, and no claimed modification, termination or waiver \nshall be binding unless also signed by an authorized representative of Playboy.",
                "changed_text": "This Contract may not be modified except in writing, and no claimed modification or waiver shall be binding unless also signed by an authorized representative of Playboy. Termination of this contract, however, may be initiated by the Purchaser with 30 days written notice to the Supplier. Playboy's signature is not required for termination by the Purchaser.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding contract termination. The original clause states that the contract cannot be terminated except in writing and signed by Playboy. The modified clause allows the Purchaser to terminate with 30 days' notice without Playboy's signature, creating ambiguity and potential disputes over the termination process and validity.",

                "changed_text": "Supplier agrees that no production or manufacture of any merchandise covered by this Contract will commence until this Contract has been signed, dated and returned by Supplier to Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, production may commence immediately upon verbal authorization from Purchaser, provided that the written and signed contract is received within 14 days. Supplier further agrees that it will not produce, cause to be produced or assist in the production of more units than are specified by Purchaser nor will Supplier produce, cause to be produced or assist in the production of any product or item not specifically requested by Purchaser using any or all of the Playboy Properties or any trademark, copyright, designations, names, phrases, designs or symbols similar to any or all of the Playboy Properties during or at any time after the completion of merchandise requested by this Contract.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding when production can commence. Initially, the signed contract is a strict requirement. The modification allows verbal authorization to override this, contingent on receiving the written contract within 14 days. This could lead to disputes if the written contract is not received, but production has already begun, making the enforceability uncertain.",

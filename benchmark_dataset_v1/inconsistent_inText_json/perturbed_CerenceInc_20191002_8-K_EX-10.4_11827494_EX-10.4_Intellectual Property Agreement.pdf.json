Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of the\nrights, interests or obligations under this Agreement, including the licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement, shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by\noperation of Law or otherwise by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any purported assignment without such consent shall\nbe void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Party to this Agreement (or any of its successors or permitted assigns) (a) shall enter into a consolidation\nor merger transaction in which such Party is not the surviving entity and the surviving entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of such Party’s\nassets, (b) shall transfer all or substantially all of such Party’s assets to any Person or (c) shall assign this Agreement to such Party’s Affiliates, then, in\neach such case, the assigning Party (or its successors or permitted assigns, as applicable) shall ensure that the assignee or successor-in-interest\nexpressly assumes in writing all of the obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement, and the assigning Party shall not be required to seek\nconsent, but shall provide written notice and evidence of such assignment, assumption or succession to the non-assigning Party. Subject to the\npreceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and\nassigns. No assignment permitted by this Section 8.01 shall release the assigning Party from liability for the full performance of its obligations under this\nAgreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the licenses granted in this Agreement extend to products, services or other activities of the\nassignee existing on or before the date of the transaction described in clauses (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, except to the extent that they were\nlicensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such transaction.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that in case of a merger, asset transfer or affiliate assignment, the assigning party *shall ensure* that the assignee assumes all obligations. The modified text changes this to say the assigning party *may, at its sole discretion, decide whether* the assignee assumes obligations. This creates a direct contradiction, as one clause mandates assumption of obligations while the other makes it optional, leading to uncertainty in enforcement. The original text requires ensuring the assumption, the modified text grants the assignor discretion to determine whether assumption occurs. This directly contradicts the original intention and creates ambiguity about each party's obligations and potential remedies.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the license granted by Nuance to SpinCo is 'perpetual and irrevocable'. However, the modified text adds a clause stating 'This license is valid for 5 years from the distribution date after which it is automatically terminated.' This directly contradicts the original 'perpetual and irrevocable' term, creating uncertainty about the actual duration of the license and making enforcement ambiguous. If the original term is 'perpetual and irrevocable', the added time limitation directly contradicts this statement as the termination point is a temporal end and not indefinite.",

The modified text allows each party to choose between Delaware courts or the court within the Nuance headquarters jurisdiction. This directly contradicts the exclusivity provision, creating ambiguity and uncertainty regarding where disputes will be resolved. If one section states exclusive jurisdiction in one location and another section grants the right to choose an alternate jurisdiction, the exclusive term is effectively voided. This can lead to jurisdiction battles, increasing costs and delays in dispute resolution.",

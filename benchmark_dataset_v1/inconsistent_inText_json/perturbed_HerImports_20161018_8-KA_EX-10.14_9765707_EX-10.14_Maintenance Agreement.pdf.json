                "original_text": "1. EXTENSION OF SERVICE AGREEMENT. Subject to all other terms and conditions set forth herein, as of the date of this agreement, LEADER maintain the software for an additional five years.",
                "changed_text": "1. EXTENSION OF SERVICE AGREEMENT. Subject to all other terms and conditions set forth herein, as of the date of this agreement, LEADER shall maintain the software for an additional five years, provided that EZJR provides written notice of its intent to terminate this agreement after the first three years with no penalty.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Section 1 states that LEADER will maintain the software for an additional five years. The added clause allows EZJR to terminate the agreement after three years without penalty, which contradicts the original five-year commitment. This creates uncertainty about the actual duration of the service agreement.",

The compensation to LEADER shall be: 3,000,000 shares of EZJR’s unregistered restricted common stock which shall be issuable upon the closing; however, if the software fails to perform to EZJR's satisfaction, as determined solely by EZJR, LEADER will only receive 1,000,000 shares.",
                "explanation": "This modifies the compensation clause to introduce a contradiction. The original text clearly states the compensation as 3,000,000 shares. The added clause states that the compensation can be reduced to 1,000,000 shares based on EZJR's subjective satisfaction. This creates ambiguity about the actual compensation LEADER will receive, making the enforcement of the compensation term uncertain.",

However, if any legal action or other proceeding is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement, or because or arising out of an alleged dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and other costs incurred in that action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it or he may be entitled.",
                "changed_text": "11. ATTORNEYS’ FEES. Each party will pay its or his own legal fees and other expenses in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the sale of Assets in accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any dispute arising under Sections 1 or 2 of this agreement, each party shall bear its own attorney's fees, regardless of the outcome of the proceeding.",
                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction within the attorney's fees clause. The original text states that the prevailing party in a legal action related to the agreement is entitled to recover attorney's fees. The added clause states that for disputes arising under Sections 1 or 2 (which were modified), each party bears its own attorney's fees regardless of who wins. This creates conflicting instructions on attorney's fees, leading to uncertainty about which term will be enforced if a dispute arises under the modified sections.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces an in-text contradiction by changing the payment deadlines for Structured Payments and Maintenance Fees within the same section. Initially, Structured Payments had a 60-day payment window, and Maintenance Fees had a 90-day window. The modified text reverses these deadlines, creating ambiguity and potential disputes over which payment terms should be enforced. This is inconsistent with the original intention to ensure Structured Payments are prioritized for immediate compensation.",

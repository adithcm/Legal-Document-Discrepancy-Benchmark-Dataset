Bank of America reserves the right to\npay prior to the expiration of the sixty (60) day period. If Bank of America pays within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice\nby Bank of America, a discount of two percent (2%) will be subtracted from the total invoice amount for Services.",

Bank of America reserves the right to\npay prior to the expiration of the sixty (60) day period.

Initially, Bank of America is supposed to pay within **60 days** of receiving a valid invoice. After the change, the payment is supposed to be made in **90 days** of a valid invoice receipt, thereby contradicting the initial clause.",

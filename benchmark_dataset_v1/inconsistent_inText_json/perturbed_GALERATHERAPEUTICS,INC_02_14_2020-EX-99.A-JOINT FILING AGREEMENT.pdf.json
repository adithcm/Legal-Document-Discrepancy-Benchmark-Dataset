                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained thereinÍ¾ but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein. Each party is also responsible for ensuring the completeness and accuracy of information concerning the other persons making the filing, regardless of their knowledge or belief regarding its accuracy.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction. The original text states that no party is responsible for the accuracy of information concerning other parties unless they have reason to believe it is inaccurate. The modified text imposes a blanket responsibility on each party to ensure the accuracy of all information, directly conflicting with the original clause.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto. This Agreement shall be automatically terminated if any party undergoes a change of control, irrespective of written notice.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the termination clause. The original text states the agreement remains in effect until revoked by written notice. The added sentence introduces an automatic termination upon a change of control, regardless of whether written notice is provided. This creates ambiguity as to how the agreement can be terminated.",
                "location": "Paragraph 1"

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. However, only the first signed counterpart will be considered the original and legally binding document.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that all counterparts constitute the same agreement. The added sentence restricts legal validity to only the first signed counterpart. This is an in-text contradiction creating confusion over which version of the agreement is legally binding.",

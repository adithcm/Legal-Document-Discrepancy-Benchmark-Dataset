                "original_text": "During each year of this agreement, Dr. Murray will be paid no later than the 30st day of January based on the cumulative Net Sales of the Dr. Murray Products for the preceding 12 months based upon the following scale:",
                "changed_text": "During each year of this agreement, Dr. Murray will be paid no later than the 30st day of January based on the cumulative Net Sales of the Dr. Murray Products for the preceding 12 months based upon the following scale. Payment can also be made no later than February 28th of the same year, subjected to the discretion of EHN.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline for the annual royalty. The initial clause mandates payment by January 30st, while the addition suggests that payment could be made later up to February 28th, creating an uncertainty about which deadline is binding. It is not specified what conditions would cause the February 28th payment to be allowed and makes this highly discretionary and uncertain. Further, adding “subjected to the discretion of EHN” creates imbalance as it gives full control to the paying party, making the contract lopsided and contradictory.",

                "changed_text": "The Services Term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive two-year terms thereafter unless written notice is given by either party to the other, indicating that party's intention not to renew the Services Term of this Agreement. However, EHS or EHN can terminate the agreement with only 30 days notice, regardless of the renewal term.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the notice period required for terminating the Services Term. The original clause states that 90 days' notice is required to prevent automatic renewal. The added sentence contradicts this by allowing EHS or EHN to terminate with only 30 days' notice, creating uncertainty about the actual notice period. This means there are effectively two different notice periods written into the contract, creating in-text contradictions. The contract now contains contradictory deadlines.",

However, EHS and EHN reserve the right to pursue litigation in any court of their choosing, regardless of the outcome of mediation or arbitration proceedings.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the dispute resolution process. The original clause mandates binding arbitration after mediation. The added sentence allows EHS and EHN to pursue litigation even after mediation or arbitration, effectively undermining the binding nature of the arbitration clause and creating uncertainty about the dispute resolution mechanism. This adds an in-text contradiction by creating conflicting resolution processes.",

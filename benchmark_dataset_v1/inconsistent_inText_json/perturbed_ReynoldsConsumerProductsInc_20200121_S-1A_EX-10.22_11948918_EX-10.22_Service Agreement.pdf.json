Recipient shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Fees shown on an invoice no later than the last business day of the month Recipient received such invoice unless disputed in accordance with Section 5.7. Any amount not received from the invoiced Party within such period shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate, from and including the last date of such period to, but excluding, the date of payment.",
                "changed_text": "Section 5.4 Payment. Recipient shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Fees shown on an invoice no later than 45 days after the Recipient received such invoice unless disputed in accordance with Section 5.7. Any amount not received from the invoiced Party within such period shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate, from and including the last date of such period to, but excluding, the date of payment.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the payment deadline is the last business day of the month the invoice is received. The modified text changes the payment deadline to 45 days after invoice receipt, creating a direct contradiction and uncertainty about when payment is actually due. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over late payment penalties.",

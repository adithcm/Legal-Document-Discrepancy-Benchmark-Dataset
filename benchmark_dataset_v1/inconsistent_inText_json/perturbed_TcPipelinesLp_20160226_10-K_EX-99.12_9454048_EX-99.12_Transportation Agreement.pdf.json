                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction because while the term is defined as ending on October 31, 2017, the added clause suggests it can be terminated earlier. Section 16 does not exist, which creates uncertainty about the conditions for earlier termination and conflicts with the defined term.",

However, in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Shipper may pursue claims against the Transporter's management officials and employees.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that while generally there is no personal liability, an exception exists for gross negligence or willful misconduct. This contradicts the initial statement of no personal liability and creates ambiguity about when the limitation of liability applies, and under what circumstances Shipper can pursue claims against management.",

However, any changes to the Rate Schedule that increase rates by more than 10% within a 12-month period shall require Shipper's written consent.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a condition requiring the Shipper's written consent for rate increases exceeding 10% within a year. This directly contradicts the previous statement that the agreement is subject to changes filed under the Natural Gas Act, which would typically not require individual shipper consent. This creates an inconsistency regarding how rate changes are implemented and whether the Shipper has veto power over certain increases.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces specific deadlines for each payment phase, which were not present in the original contract. While seemingly providing more clarity, these deadlines now conflict with the original wording which only states triggers for payment based on deliverable completion. If the deliverables are delayed, it's unclear whether the fixed payment deadlines still apply, creating ambiguity and potential for dispute.",

However, for any failure to meet a payment deadline outlined in section 3.1, the non-breaching party may immediately terminate the agreement without any notice or cure period.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a specific exception to the general termination clause. While the original clause requires a 30-day notice and cure period for any material breach, the modified clause allows for immediate termination without notice for failure to meet a payment deadline. This creates a contradiction, as it is now unclear whether the 30-day cure period applies to payment defaults, or if the non-breaching party can immediately terminate.",

However, if the agreement administrators from both parties provide explicit consent via email, specific milestones laid out in section 3.1 can be extended.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states that all modifications must be in writing. The added sentence states that agreement administrators from both parties can extend specific milestones laid out in section 3.1 via email. This perturbation is an in-text contradiction because email is not written and signed by authorized representatives of the parties. This leads to in-text contradiction, because one section of the contract prevents electronic records being used as modifications whereas another explicitly allows it.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment deadline in section 4(a) to 'sixty (60) days' while the original text specifies 'thirty (30) days'. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the actual due date for payments and when late fees may apply.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction regarding payment terms. Section 4(a) now states that payment is due 'upon receipt of WebMD's invoice,' conflicting with the original term of 'thirty (30) days after the receipt of WebMD's invoice.'

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original interest policy on late payments.

This inconsistency will lead to confusion and potential disputes over whether interest applies to late payments.",

                "original_text": "Subsequent contributions will be provided by Kiromic to the common fund upon presentation of individual purchase orders and/or proofs of expenditure\n—which will be paid for each time starting upon the successful IPO (Initial Public Offering) of the Kiromic’s common shares.",
                "changed_text": "Subsequent contributions will be provided by Kiromic to the common fund upon presentation of individual purchase orders and/or proofs of expenditure\n—which will be paid within 30 days of receipt of invoice, regardless of the success of any IPO.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction regarding the payment terms. The original text specifies that payments are contingent upon a successful IPO, while the modified text stipulates payments within 30 days of invoice, irrespective of the IPO's outcome. This creates uncertainty about when Kiromic is obligated to make contributions.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contingency on Molipharma's payments. Originally, payments are made 'for each time' upon presentation of documentation. The modification makes these payments conditional on Molipharma receiving sufficient grant funding, potentially delaying or preventing payment even with proper documentation. This conflicts with the initial statement of undertaking to financially support the program.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Kiromic may withdraw at any time with no notice period.",
                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction by stating that the parties may only withdraw for serious reasons and with 30 days notice, but then granting Kiromic the right to withdraw at any time with no notice period. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual withdrawal terms, especially regarding Kiromic's obligations.",

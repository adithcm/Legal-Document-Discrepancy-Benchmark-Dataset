                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "ii.\tPayment to CSA no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of invoice from CSA. CSA shall submit invoice to the Company no later than thirty (30) days after Company provides CSA with the list of the sales of Product (containing the Property with such supporting information that may be required or requested to be disclosed).",
                "changed_text": "ii.\tPayment to CSA no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of invoice from CSA. CSA shall submit invoice to the Company no later than fifteen (15) days after Company provides CSA with the list of the sales of Product (containing the Property with such supporting information that may be required or requested to be disclosed).",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting payment terms. The original clause specifies payment within 30 days of invoice receipt, with the invoice to be submitted within 30 days of sales list provision. The modified clause now stipulates payment within 60 days of invoice receipt but shortens the invoice submission timeframe to 15 days. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the actual payment deadline, potentially leading to disputes.",

The period of license granted shall be for the Term and shall extend for a period of twenty four (24) months or until terminated as per clause 8 herein. It is agreed that the Term may be extended upon mutual agreement between the parties.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be effective as of the date of execution by both parties. The period of license granted shall be for the Term and shall extend for a period of twelve (12) months or until terminated as per clause 8 herein. It is agreed that the Term may only be extended by Company with written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the term length and extension conditions. The original text specifies a 24-month term with mutual agreement for extensions. The modified text reduces the term to 12 months and allows only the Company to extend the term with written notice. This creates uncertainty about the actual term length and the extension requirements, potentially leading to disagreements.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict regarding the review period and approval method for materials. The original text allows Talent seven days for review and requires written approval from CSA. The modification extends the review period to fourteen days and changes the approval method to verbal. This ambiguity about the review timeline and approval format could result in disputes over whether approval was properly granted.",

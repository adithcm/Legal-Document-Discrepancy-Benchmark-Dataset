                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the forfeiture of the guarantee. The original clause states an unconditional forfeiture. The modified clause introduces an exception based on a notice of dispute, creating uncertainty about whether the guarantee is truly forfeited in all cases.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction with the 'on or before' deadline. The modified text introduces a conditional extension of the payment deadline, creating ambiguity about the definitive payment date. This affects enforcement as it is now unclear when late payment penalties, if any, would apply.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by granting Fox discretion to delay royalty payments based on sales targets, conflicting with the original clause's seemingly straightforward remittance process. This makes royalty payments conditional and creates ambiguity about when Licensee is entitled to receive them.",

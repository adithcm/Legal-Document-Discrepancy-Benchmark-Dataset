                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.5 \"Control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a\nperson or entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 \"Control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to influence the management or policies of a person or entity, whether through ownership of any amount of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the definition of 'Control'. The original definition implies a significant level of power to 'direct or cause the direction' of management, while the modified definition broadens it to 'influence' and any amount of voting securities. This contradicts other sections relying on a stricter definition of control for determining obligations or liabilities.",

                "changed_text": "3.1 Either Party may terminate this Agreement by giving the other Party thirty (30) days' prior written notice. However, Licensor may terminate this agreement with only 10 days written notice should the licensee be found to be in violation of any local, state or federal regulation.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction in the notice period required for termination. While both parties originally needed to give 30 days notice, the modified version allows the Licensor to terminate with only 10 days notice under specific circumstances. This inconsistency introduces uncertainty about which termination clause applies.",
                "location": "Article 3.1"

                "original_text": "2.10.2 Licensor shall have the sole right, though it is under no obligation, to bring any action for any past, present and future infringements of its intellectual property rights in the Licensed Mark.",
                "changed_text": "2.10.2 Licensor shall have the sole right, and is under obligation, to bring any action for any past, present and future infringements of its intellectual property rights in the Licensed Mark if it is deemed necessary.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the Licensor has the right, but no obligation, to pursue infringements. The modified clause now states that the Licensor has the right and the obligation to bring action if they deem it necessary. This is a direct contradiction, creating uncertainty about the Licensor's responsibilities regarding trademark enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in payment terms. The original text states the remaining $3,100 is due 'on completion of the Scope of Work', implying the entire project. The modified text states the remaining $3,100 is due 'within 15 days of the completion of Stage 1 of the Scope of Work'. This creates ambiguity as to when the final payment is due, potentially leading to disputes. The text doesn't define when the \"completion\" happens, Stage 1, all stages, therefore makes an uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction related to project completion dates. The original text sets a defined project timeline ending on May 3, 2018. The added sentence guarantees completion by June 15, 2018. This directly contradicts the initially established project timeline, creating confusion and uncertainty about the actual deadline for project completion. This could result in legal disputes if the project finishes after May 3, 2018, but before June 15, 2018.",

The surcharge for rush work will be determined on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Company, but will never exceed the standard hourly rate of $40.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the surcharge calculation for rush work. The original text states that the surcharge is the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%). The modified text states that the surcharge is determined on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the company, but will never exceed $40. This contradicts the original agreement on how the surcharge is calculated, creating ambiguity and uncertainty. The original clause established a clear calculation, while the altered text gives company discretionary control and an upper limit, opening possibilities for dispute.",

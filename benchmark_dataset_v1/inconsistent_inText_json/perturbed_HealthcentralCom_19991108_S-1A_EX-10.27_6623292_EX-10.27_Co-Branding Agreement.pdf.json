                "changed_text": "(a) HCI shall pay MLX a guaranteed fixed sum of [*] US per annum during the\n     Initial Term of this Agreement to be paid out as a monthly payment of [*]\n     US (the \"Monthly Payment\"). This Monthly Payment shall be due by the 10th\n     day of each month; however, if HCI provides a detailed report justifying a delay, the payment can be extended to the 25th day of the month.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the monthly payment is due by the 10th day of each month. The modified text adds a clause that allows HCI to extend the payment deadline to the 25th day of the month if they provide a report justifying the delay. This creates a conflict as the initial deadline is no longer absolute, leading to uncertainty in enforcement. If HCI can delay payment simply by providing a \"report,\" this undermines the original payment terms.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that remittances and accounting reports will be provided within 60 days of the end of each quarter. The modified text adds a clause that allows for an indefinite extension of the deadline if the report requires information from a third party. This creates a contradiction, making the original deadline non-binding in certain circumstances and causing uncertainty. It would be difficult to determine when the clause is triggered, and would introduce uncertainty to enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states a 30-day cure period for breaches of material terms. The modified text introduces an exception, extending the cure period to 90 days for breaches specifically related to content delivery. This creates a contradiction, as it's unclear which cure period applies to breaches involving both content and other aspects of the agreement. This adds uncertainty in enforcement, allowing for arguments about which timeframe is valid.",

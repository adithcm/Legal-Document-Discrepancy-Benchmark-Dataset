                "original_text": "8.01. XSPA shall pay to Calm on a monthly basis an amount equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Retail Price for all Products sold in the Stores in the Territory during the applicable month minus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of any commission actually paid or payable to XSPA employee(s) or contractor(s) attributable to sales of such Products during such month; provided that in no event shall such commission be greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the Retail Price for the applicable Product.",
                "changed_text": "8.01. XSPA shall pay to Calm on a monthly basis an amount equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Retail Price for all Products sold in the Stores in the Territory during the applicable month minus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of any commission actually paid or payable to XSPA employee(s) or contractor(s) attributable to sales of such Products during such month; provided that in no event shall such commission be greater than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Retail Price for the applicable Product.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the maximum allowable commission percentage for XSPA employees. The original text states a maximum commission of 15%, while the modified text allows for a maximum of 25%. This creates ambiguity in the contract regarding the permissible commission amount, potentially leading to disputes over payments.",

With respect to Products sold in Stores in the Territory, XSPA shall deliver to Calm within twenty (20) days after each calendar month, a statement (“Monthly Statement”) identifying (i) the total sales of each Product during said calendar month and (ii) the total commission paid to XSPA employees or contractors under Section ​8.02, which shall include a breakdown by each individual Product and Store. Each Monthly Statement shall be fully completed and signed and certified as accurate by one of XSPA’s senior officers.",

With respect to Products sold in Stores in the Territory, XSPA shall deliver to Calm within thirty (30) days after each calendar month, a statement (“Monthly Statement”) identifying (i) the total sales of each Product during said calendar month and (ii) the total commission paid to XSPA employees or contractors under Section ​8.02, which shall include a breakdown by each individual Product and Store. Each Monthly Statement shall be fully completed and signed and certified as accurate by one of XSPA’s senior officers.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a conflict by changing the deadline for XSPA to deliver the Monthly Statement to Calm. The original text requires delivery within 20 days, while the modified text extends the deadline to 30 days. This discrepancy creates uncertainty about the enforceable timeframe for submitting the statement.",

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Calm (at its sole expense) may engage a third party to audit XSPA’s inventory of any and all Product Collateral then on hand at each Store and XSPA shall promptly return or dispose of such inventory as instructed by Calm at Calm’s sole expense. In addition, if Calm does not provide XSPA with instructions within twenty (20) days of the termination or expiration of this Agreement, XSPA shall be permitted to dispose of any inventory of any and all Product Collateral then on hand at each Store. The Parties agree to promptly settle all accounting associated with such inventory of any and all Product Collateral then on hand at each Store upon termination or expiration of this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth herein, all of the rights granted hereunder shall automatically terminate and XSPA shall immediately cease the distribution, marketing and sale of Products and the Parties shall discontinue all use of the other Party’s Marks.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces two inconsistencies. First, it extends the period Calm has to provide disposal instructions to XSPA from 20 to 30 days. Second, it changes 'promptly settle all accounting' to 'settle all accounting...within 60 days', creating conflicting guidance on the required accounting settlement timeline.",

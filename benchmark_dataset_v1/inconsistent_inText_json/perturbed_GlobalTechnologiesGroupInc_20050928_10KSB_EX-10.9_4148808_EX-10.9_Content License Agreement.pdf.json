                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment terms. The first payment is changed to 'without any pro-ration,' contradicting the initial statement of 'pro-rated based on the number of days.' Also, the 'Last Payment' has been changed to 'third full month' instead of 'first full month' after termination and 'last three months' instead of 'last month' without pro-ration. Finally, the payments to IMNTV will be converted at the average exchange rate of the last month of the calendar quarter, no matter if it is approved by the administrative agency, making it contradict with the last sentence.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that a party is not in default for causes beyond their control, while the modified clause suggests they are not in default for causes *within* their control, which is contradictory. The termination clause is also modified, extending the waiting period to one-hundred-twenty (120) days and three-month notice period. This creates an internal conflict, as it is now unclear under what conditions a party is actually considered in default due to external events.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction. Originally, if the price increased, Bank of America would receive a full refund. Now, they only receive 50% of the previously paid amount, creating uncertainty about the actual refund policy upon price increases.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a payment term of 30 days from acceptance, but then allows for a different, agreed-upon schedule that supersedes the 30-day term. This creates a contradiction as to when payment is actually due, potentially leading to disputes.",

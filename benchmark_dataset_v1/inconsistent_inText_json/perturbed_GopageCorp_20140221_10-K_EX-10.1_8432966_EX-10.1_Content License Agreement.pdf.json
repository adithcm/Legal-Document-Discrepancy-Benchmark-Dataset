                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction regarding the refundability of the license fees. The original clause states they are non-refundable, but the changed clause says they are refundable within 30 days, creating uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction to the payment schedule. The original clause requires quarterly payments, but the added sentence allows for annual payments in advance for the first year. This conflicts with the reporting requirements tied to the original quarterly payment schedule and creates ambiguity on which payment terms are valid.",

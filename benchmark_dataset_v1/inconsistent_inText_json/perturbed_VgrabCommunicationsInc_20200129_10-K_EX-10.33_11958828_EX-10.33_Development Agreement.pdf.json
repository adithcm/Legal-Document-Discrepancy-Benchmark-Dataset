                "changed_text": "All Parties agreed the payment listed below are fair and just for the services being provided. Payment\nto the following individual below within 7 days upon completion and handover on the Project to VAL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, VAL shall have the option to extend the payment deadline to 30 days post-completion, subject to a 2% deduction from the total payment amount due to administrative overhead.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. The original clause states payment within 7 days, but the modified clause introduces an option for VAL to extend the deadline to 30 days with a penalty. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment terms and potential disputes.",

However, upon mutual written agreement, the parties may extend the term indefinitely without formal renewal, subject to satisfactory performance reviews conducted bi-annually.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction about the agreement period. The original clause defines a maximum period of six months, but the modification introduces the possibility of indefinite extension, which conflicts with the initial term limitation. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes about the actual duration of the agreement.",

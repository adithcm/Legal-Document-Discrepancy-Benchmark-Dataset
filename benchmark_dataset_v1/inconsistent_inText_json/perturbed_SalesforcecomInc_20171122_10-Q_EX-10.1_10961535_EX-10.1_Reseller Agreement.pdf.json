This Sub-Reseller Agreement is effective as of the later of the dates beneath the Parties’ signatures below (“Sub-Reseller Effective Date”), provided, however, that the dates of the Parties’ signatures are not separated by a period of time greater than ten (10) business days. If such period is greater than ten (10) business days then this Sub-Reseller Agreement shall be deemed null and void and to be of no effect.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the validity period of the agreement. The original text states the agreement is void if the signature dates are separated by more than ten business days. The modified text extends this period to fifteen business days, creating ambiguity and uncertainty as to the enforceable deadline for signing the agreement. This inconsistency creates uncertainty in enforcement, as it's unclear which deadline applies.",

                "original_text": "Reseller must ensure that Sub-Reseller complies with the terms of the Agreement applicable to Reseller as if Sub-Reseller were an original party to the Agreement and any breach by Sub-Reseller of the Agreement will be deemed a breach by Reseller. Sub-Reseller is not be a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement.",

Any breach by Sub-Reseller of the Agreement may be deemed a breach by Reseller, at Salesforce's sole discretion. Sub-Reseller may be considered a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, depending on the specific circumstances.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces two contradictions. First, it changes a definite breach ('will be deemed') to a discretionary one ('may be deemed at Salesforce's sole discretion'), creating uncertainty about the consequences of a Sub-Reseller's breach. Second, it directly contradicts the statement that Sub-Reseller is *not* a third-party beneficiary, by stating they *may* be, depending on the circumstances. This introduces ambiguity that could lead to disputes about the Sub-Reseller's rights and obligations.",

The terms and conditions herein contained constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Sub-Reseller Agreement, except for any pre-existing agreements or oral commitments made by Salesforce representatives. These pre-existing agreements and oral commitments will be documented and attached as an addendum to this agreement within 30 days of the Sub-Reseller Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the 'Entire Agreement' clause, which explicitly states that the current document supersedes all previous agreements. By allowing exceptions for pre-existing agreements and oral commitments, the modified text creates uncertainty about which terms govern the relationship. This directly undermines the purpose of the Entire Agreement clause and could lead to disputes over conflicting terms.",

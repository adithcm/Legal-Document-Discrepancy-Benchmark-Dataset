                "changed_text": "MA shall make payment for all Technology within 60 days of receiving the invoice, regardless of the terms in Schedule A of this Agreement, and provide upon resale of any part of the Technology, two (2) signed copies of the Company License Agreement/Client Registration Card between Company and Client.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction. The original text refers to payment terms outlined in Schedule A. The modified text introduces a fixed 60-day payment window, overriding any specific terms in Schedule A. This creates uncertainty about which payment deadline is enforceable, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.",

A LATE PAYMENT CHARGE of one and one-half percent (1 ½%) or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, of the outstanding balance due to Company per month will be imposed on all overdue accounts.",

No LATE PAYMENT CHARGE will be imposed on any overdue accounts.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a late payment charge of 1.5% per month. The modified text directly contradicts this by stating that no late payment charges will be applied. This introduces a clear inconsistency, making it unclear whether late payments will incur penalties, potentially leading to disputes.",

The modified text directly contradicts this by stating that termination can occur with no prior notice.

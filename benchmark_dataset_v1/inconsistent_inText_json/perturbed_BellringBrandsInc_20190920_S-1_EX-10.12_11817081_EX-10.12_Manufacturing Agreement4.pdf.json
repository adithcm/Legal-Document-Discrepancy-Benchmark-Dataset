Heritage and Premier are each referred to herein as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties.”",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (“Heritage”) Premier Nutrition Corporation (“Premier”) is effective as of July 3, 2019 (“Third Amendment Effective Date”) and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (“Agreement”). Heritage and Premier are each referred to herein as a “Party”. One Party is referred to as 'Premier,' and together both are called the “Parties.”",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by first defining both entities as 'Parties' and later redefining Premier as the singular 'Party'. This contradicts the original intent of treating Heritage and Premier equally, introducing legal uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by stating that the original terms remain in full force, but then allowing them to be superseded by potentially undocumented verbal agreements. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty in enforcement, as it becomes unclear which terms are legally binding.",

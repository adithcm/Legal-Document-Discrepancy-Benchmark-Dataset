The original clause specifies that royalty payments should be made within thirty (30) days of delivering the report, while the modified clause extends this to forty-five (45) days. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual payment deadline, leading to potential disputes and uncertainty in enforcement.",

The Agreement may be terminated by either Party by written notice to the other at any time if the other Party (the “Breaching Party”) is in material breach or default of any of its obligations hereunder or any of its representations or warranties as follows: (i) the terminating Party shall send a written notice of the material breach or material default to the Breaching Party and (ii) the termination shall become effective a) thirty (30) days after sending notice of the breach if the breach is non-payment of amounts due hereunder, such as milestone, minimum royalty or royalties amounts and b) sixty (60) days after sending notice of the breach for all other breaches unless the Breaching Party has cured any such material breach or material default prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) or sixty (60) day period as the case may be; or if for non-payment breaches such material default or material breach is not capable of being cured within such sixty (60) day period and the Breaching Party has commenced activities reasonably expected to cure such material breach or material default within such sixty (60) day period and thereafter uses diligent efforts to complete the cure as soon as practicable, but in no event shall such period exceed ninety (90) days.",

                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates a thirty (30) day cure period for non-payment breaches. By modifying the clause to state forty-five (45) days, there's now an in-text contradiction. It's unclear whether a non-payment breach provides a 30-day or 45-day cure period. The later clause that addresses breaches not capable of being cured still references the original 60-day period adding to the confusion. This creates potential disputes regarding termination rights and the Breaching Party's obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates a thirty (30) day period for ETON to transfer all rights and licenses back to Aucta following a termination under section 11.2 or 11.3. This modification increases that transfer window to sixty (60) days, creating a direct contradiction. Both the original thirty (30) day period and the modified sixty (60) day period now exist in the text, creating uncertainty and potential for conflict over which timeframe is enforceable.",

                "original_text": "3.5. Due Date for Payment. Your Royalty payments and Advertising Contributions are due by the first (1st) day after the end of each\nPeriod (or the next business day if the first day is a Sunday or federal holiday) (as of the Agreement Date, the due date is Monday of each week).\nYou must pay all other amounts due to us as specified in this Agreement or, if no time is specified, such amounts are due upon receipt of an invoice\nfrom us.",

Your Royalty payments and Advertising Contributions are due by the first (1st) day after the end of each\nPeriod (or the next business day if the first day is a Sunday or federal holiday) (as of the Agreement Date, the due date is Monday of each week).\nYou must pay all other amounts due to us as specified in this Agreement within 10 days of receipt of an invoice from us.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment term for amounts due outside of Royalty payments and Advertising Contributions. The original text states that such amounts are due upon receipt of an invoice. In contrast, the modified text specifies a 10-day payment window from the invoice date. This introduces potential conflicts in the enforcement of payment deadlines.",

Time is of the essence.",
                "explanation": "Here, the deadline for opening the Franchised Business post-authorization is changed from 'six (6) months' to 'twelve (12) months.' This creates a direct contradiction, as different sections could refer to either deadline, leading to confusion about compliance.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation modifies the advertising approval clause. The original states that if no response is received within 10 days, the material is disapproved. Now, the text says that within 30 business days without response it is approved. This creates an enforcement challenge.",

                "original_text": "2.3 The first Development Fees payment shall be due forty-five days after the end of the Calendar Quarter in which the first Sale of a Development Product took place. Thereafter, WPD shall furnish to CNS Development Fees no later than forty-five days after the end of each Calendar Quarter for the Sale of Development Products through the end of such Calendar Quarter and shall further furnish CNS with a written statement setting forth an accounting showing the calculation of the Development Fees.",
                "changed_text": "2.3 The first Development Fees payment shall be due thirty days after the end of the Calendar Quarter in which the first Sale of a Development Product took place. Thereafter, WPD shall furnish to CNS Development Fees no later than forty-five days after the end of each Calendar Quarter for the Sale of Development Products through the end of such Calendar Quarter and shall further furnish CNS with a written statement setting forth an accounting showing the calculation of the Development Fees.",
                "explanation": "This introduces an in-text contradiction by stating that the first Development Fees payment is due in thirty days, while subsequent payments are due in forty-five days. This creates ambiguity regarding the correct payment deadline, potentially leading to disputes over late payment penalties for the initial payment. One section says 30 and the other says 45.",

In exchange for the payment by WPD of the Development Fee to CNS, CNS hereby agrees to pay WPD the following payments: (i) within thirty Business Days from the date of this Agreement, CNS will make an upfront payment of $225,000 to WPD; and (ii) within thirty days of the verified achievement of the Phase II Milestone, (such verification shall be conducted by an independent third party mutually acceptable to the parties hereto), CNS will make a payment of $775,000 to WPD.",

                "explanation": "A contradiction in payment terms arises. The clause states CNS will make an upfront payment within 'forty-five Business Days', while later specifying Phase II Milestone payment within 'thirty days'. This introduces uncertainty regarding the payment timeline for the upfront payment and can lead to disputes. There are two different timelines to complete the payment.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding the cure period for a material breach. The original text states a thirty (30) day cure period, while the modification changes this to sixty (60) days, creating an inconsistency in the time allowed to rectify a breach before termination. This affects legal certainty and creates a dispute.",

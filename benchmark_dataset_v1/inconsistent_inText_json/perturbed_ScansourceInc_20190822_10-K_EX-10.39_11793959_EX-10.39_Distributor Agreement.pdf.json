If the Agreement\nexpired prior to the Amendment Effective Date, any orders received and Products and Services purchased between the date of expiration and the\nAmendment Effective Date shall be in all respects deemed made under the Agreement as in effect prior to this Amendment. The parties further\nagree that if Distributor places Purchase Orders after the expiration of the Agreement, and Cisco accepts such Purchase Orders, then any such\nPurchase Orders shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Agreement; provided, however that acceptance by Cisco of any Purchase\nOrder placed after the Agreement has expired will not be considered as an extension of the term of the Agreement nor a renewal thereof.\nNotwithstanding Cisco’s right to extend the term of the Agreement, each party acknowledges that the Agreement shall always be interpreted as\nbeing limited in duration to a definite term and that the other party has made no commitments whatsoever regarding the renewal of the Agreement\nbeyond those expressly agreed in writing.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction. The original text states that accepting purchase orders after the agreement's expiration does not extend the term. The modified text then states the opposite - that accepting a purchase order does extend the agreement's term, creating uncertainty about the agreement's expiration.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the frequency of returns. The original text states one return per quarter, whereas the modified text states two returns per quarter, creating ambiguity on how many returns the distributor is allowed.",

                "explanation": "The addition of the '30-day cure period' directly conflicts with the 'immediately upon written notice' clause. This creates uncertainty about whether a breach allows for immediate termination or requires a cure period, potentially leading to disputes over termination rights and obligations.",

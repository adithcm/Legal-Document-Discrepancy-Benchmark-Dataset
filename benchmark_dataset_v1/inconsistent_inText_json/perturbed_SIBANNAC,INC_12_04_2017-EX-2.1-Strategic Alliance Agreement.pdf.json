                "original_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 60 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict in payment terms. The original text states 'payable NET 30 days', while the modified text states 'payable NET 60 days'. This contradiction creates ambiguity as to when Bravatek should be paid, potentially leading to disputes over the payment deadline.",

Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice.",

Such notice must be given thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the original term. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict in the notice period required for non-renewal. The original text specifies 'ninety (90) days' notice', but the modified text changes this to 'thirty (30) days' notice' for non-renewal, while keeping the termination notice at 90 days. This introduces ambiguity and potential disputes regarding the required notice period for non-renewal versus outright termination.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a discrepancy in the indemnification clauses. COMPANY is only required to indemnify Bravatek for 'intentional misconduct', while Bravatek must indemnify COMPANY for both 'negligence or intentional misconduct'. This creates an imbalance, potentially leading to disputes over the scope of indemnification obligations depending on the nature of the claim.",

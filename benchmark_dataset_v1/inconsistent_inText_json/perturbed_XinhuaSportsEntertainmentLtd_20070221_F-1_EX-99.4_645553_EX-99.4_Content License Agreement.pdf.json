                "changed_text": "AFFILIATES means any company, corporation, partnership, joint venture or\nother entity that has a business relationship with XFN, regardless of control.\nFor avoidance of doubt, an affiliate requires explicit written approval by XFN to be considered such for the purposes of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliates' is based on control. The modified definition broadens this to any business relationship, creating uncertainty about which entities qualify as affiliates and how this status is determined. Requiring 'explicit written approval' directly contradicts the original definition's automatic inclusion based on control.",

The payment schedule shall be by\nfive (5) instalments of US$220,000 each. The first instalment will be\neffect on condition that XFN can raise at least US$1.1 million additional\nfunding in 2002.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the rights and obligations of the Parties, XFN shall\npay to CEIS US$1.1 million (United States Dollars One Million and One\nHundred Thousand) for a term of twenty (20) years, in cash or such other\nconsideration as the Parties may agree. The payment schedule shall be determined by XFN at its sole discretion, but shall not exceed five (5) instalments of US$220,000 each. The first instalment will be\neffect on condition that XFN can raise at least US$1.1 million additional\nfunding in 2002.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a 'payment schedule shall be by five instalments'. The changed text states that 'payment schedule shall be determined by XFN at its sole discretion'. This introduces a direct conflict: one clause dictates a fixed payment schedule, while the other gives XFN complete control, potentially leading to disputes over payment timing and amounts.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows XFN to terminate with 30 days' notice. The added text imposes a US$500,000 penalty for early termination, creating a contradiction. The original clause implies free termination, while the modified one significantly restricts this right financially, causing uncertainty about the actual cost of termination.",

                "explanation": "The addition of the sentence 'This allowance is only applicable for the first year of the Non-Compete Period; after which, all such ownership must be divested.' introduces a contradiction. The original clause allows for a passive investment of up to 5% in a competing business for the entire two-year Non-Compete Period. The added sentence limits this allowance to only the first year, forcing divestment after that. This creates uncertainty about the seller's obligations and potential breach of contract.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of\nBuyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their\nrespective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by\nmeans of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former\nemployees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the\nNon-Solicit Period.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that general solicitations are permitted, but the Sellers cannot hire any employees as a result of these solicitations during the Non-Solicit Period. The modified text contradicts this by allowing the Sellers to hire employees during the Non-Solicit Period as a result of general solicitations, provided that those employees were not directly involved in product research. This creates a contradiction regarding the conditions under which hiring is permitted during the Non-Solicit Period.",

Each Seller agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, the damage to Buyer will be\ninestimable and that therefore any remedy at Law or in monetary damages shall be inadequate for breaches of Section 1(a) and 1(b). For breaches of all other sections, the parties agree that monetary damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy. Accordingly, the parties agree that Buyer shall, in\naddition to monetary damages incurred by reason of any such breach or potential breach of Section 1(a) or 1(b), without the necessity of posting any bond or similar\ninstrument (and Sellers hereby irrevocably waive any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar\ninstrument) be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) against the Sellers for breach of this Agreement.

                "explanation": "The added text states that for breaches of sections other than 1(a) and 1(b), monetary damages are the exclusive remedy. The original text allows for injunctive relief (including specific performance) and monetary damages for *any* breach of the agreement. This directly contradicts the new restriction, creating uncertainty about the available remedies for specific types of breaches and potentially invalidating parts of the original injunctive relief clause.",

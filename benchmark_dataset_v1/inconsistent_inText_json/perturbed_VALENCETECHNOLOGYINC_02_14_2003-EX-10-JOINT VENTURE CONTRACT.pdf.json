                "original_text": "Article\n2\n\"Affiliate\" means, in relation to Party A, any enterprise or other entity which,\ndirectly or indirectly, controls, or is controlled by, Party A; the term\n\"control\" meaning ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the registered\ncapital or voting stock or the power to appoint the general manager, factory\nchief or other principal person in charge of an enterprise or other entity.",
                "changed_text": "Article\n2\n\"Affiliate\" means, in relation to Party A, any enterprise or other entity which is associated, loosely affiliated or has a cooperative agreement with Party A; the determination of affiliation will be decided on a case by case basis without any ownership requirements. There will be no specific requirements or thresholds for being considered an affiliate, allowing for broad interpretation.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by redefining \"Affiliate.\" The original text defines it based on control (50% ownership), while the changed text broadens the definition to loosely affiliated and cooperative entities with case-by-case determination. This conflicts with other sections relying on the original definition to determine rights and obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Article\n2\n\"Affiliate\" means, in relation to Party B, any company that Party B decides to designate as an affiliate. Party B has sole discretion in designating affiliates, and such designation does not require any specific level of control, ownership, or influence. The term \"control\" as it relates to affiliates of Party B is not applicable.",
                "explanation": "The modified text contradicts the original definition of \"Affiliate\" for Party B. Originally, affiliation was defined by control (50% ownership, appointment of directors, etc.). The altered text gives Party B sole discretion to designate affiliates without any ownership or control requirements. This creates ambiguity because other sections might rely on the original definition when determining affiliate rights and obligations.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original confidentiality and non-compete intentions by allowing Party A and its affiliates to use the technology and know-how outside of Hebei Province, regardless of whether they are marketing Joint Venture products or doing something else, especially given the revised definition of Affiliate.",

The Manufacturer will notify the Customer when the goods are ready for shipment prior to the goods leaving the warehouse.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict in payment terms. Initially, the remaining 50% is due before the goods leave the warehouse. Now, the remaining 50% is due 30 days AFTER the customer receives the goods. This creates uncertainty about when the final payment is actually due, causing potential disputes and uncertainty of enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The conflict arises because Section 7.2 provides 21 days for rectification of a breach, but Section 7.3(a) now provides only 10 days for rectification of a material breach before termination rights are triggered. This creates ambiguity as to which timeframe applies, making it unclear when termination is permissible and creating uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The agreement initially states that it will be renewed for ten (10) year terms automatically. The altered text specifies that the renewal term will be five (5) years.

                "explanation": "The modified text extends the payment deadline for royalties from 45 to 60 days after the quarter ends. This contradicts the original 45-day deadline, causing uncertainty and potential payment disputes.",

                "explanation": "The modified text adds a condition that Theismann can only terminate the agreement after 6 months, contradicting the original clause that allowed termination at any time. This introduces uncertainty about when Theismann can validly terminate the agreement.",

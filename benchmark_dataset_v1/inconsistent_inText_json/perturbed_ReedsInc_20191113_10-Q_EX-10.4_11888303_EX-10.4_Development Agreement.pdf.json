                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for the longer of the first\nanniversary of the Effective Date or the duration of the Manufacturing and Distribution Agreement (the “Term”). The Term may be extended by\nwritten agreement of the parties.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for the longer of the first\nanniversary of the Effective Date or the duration of the Manufacturing and Distribution Agreement (the “Term”). The Term may be extended by\nwritten agreement of the parties. \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Reed's reserves the right to unilaterally terminate this agreement at any time, for any reason, with 30 days written notice to Company.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by stating the agreement continues for a specified term and can be extended by mutual agreement, while simultaneously giving Reed's the right to unilaterally terminate at any time with 30 days' notice. This contradicts the initial term and creates uncertainty regarding the actual duration of the agreement.",

The Deliverables shall be considered\nto be Confidential Information (as defined below) of Reed’s. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company may use the work product and deliverables for internal research purposes related to similar alcohol-based products 12 months after termination of the agreement. This Section 6 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by initially restricting Company from using the Work Product, Products, or Deliverables in perpetuity, but then allowing Company to use them for internal research purposes after 12 months from termination. This creates ambiguity regarding the extent of the perpetual restriction, which can lead to disputes over the use of the deliverables.",

If Reed's approve of the result without vote, then the result will automatically pass.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by initially requiring agreement from both Reed’s and Company for final Recipes, Deliverables, and Specifications. It then introduces a condition where Reed’s can unilaterally approve the result without a formal vote, contradicting the initial requirement for mutual agreement and creating uncertainty around the decision-making process.",

Payment to the Distributor for the sale of the Products to Customers shall be as follows:\n(i) Company will pay Distributor (or its Assignee) Ten Percent (10%) of the Master Distributor Override generated by each\nCustomer Kiosk Location. (Master Distributor Override (\"MDO\") shall mean Total Revenue per Customer Kiosk Location collected by\nSRXS from third party payors and patient cash payments). This 10% of the total revenue generated is payable only if the EBITDA is a\npositive EBITDA and exceeds the 10% of the revenue. In cases of a positive EBITDA but shortage of funds compared to the 10% of the\nrevenue, Distributor will take less than 10%. If the EBITDA is negative, no payments will be made to Distributor. Additionally, it will be the\nsole responsibility of Distributor to make a full disclosure of the 10% MDO to all its clients.\n(ii) The MDO will be payable within ninety (90) days from the date of the transaction (First Month payable by the end of ninety\n(90) days from the end of the month).\n(iii) For each Customer Kiosk contracted and implemented by Distributor, Company shall also pay a management fee of 40% of\nNet Income (Net Income for this purpose is defined as EBITDA less percentage paid to the client. The balance is then split 40%/60% to A3\nDevelopment Group, LLC and Smart RX Systems, Inc. respectively). Net Income is defined as total Customer revenue collections less all\nincurred expenses, and is the distributable cash generated by each Customer location. These payments will also follow the payment policy\noutlined in 4.1 above.",

                "explanation": "The payment terms are contradicted by changing the payment period for the MDO from 90 days to 30 days, while the subsequent paragraph regarding the management fee states that payments follow the policy in 4.1, this leads to a contradiction in the payment deadline of the management fee. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes over the applicable payment timeline.",

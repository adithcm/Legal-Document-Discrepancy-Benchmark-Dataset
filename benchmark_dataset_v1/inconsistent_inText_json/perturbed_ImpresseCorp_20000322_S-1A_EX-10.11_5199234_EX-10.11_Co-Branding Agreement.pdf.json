Impresse shall pay the fees set forth in Sections\n4.2  [SLOTTING FEES], 4.3  [BANNER/NEWSLETTER PURCHASE COMMITMENT] and 4.4  [HOSTING FEE] as an aggregate, totaling $[*] payable in four equal\nquarterly installments of $[*] beginning on May 31, 2000 and thereafter on\nAugust 31, 2000 November 30, 2000 and February 28, 2001, respectively.",

However, if Impresse experiences a revenue shortfall of 15% or more in any quarter, the payment for that quarter may be deferred by up to 90 days with no penalty.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding payment deadlines. The original clause specifies fixed payment dates. The added sentence allows for a 90-day deferral under certain conditions, creating uncertainty about the actual due dates and potentially conflicting with other clauses that might reference the original payment schedule, creating ambiguity about when payments are definitively due.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no interest shall accrue on payments deferred under the provisions outlined in Section 4.5.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction regarding interest on late payments. The original clause mandates interest on all late payments. The added exception removes interest for deferred payments under section 4.5. This creates uncertainty and disputes can arise as to whether or not interest should be accrued if the payments are deferred according to Section 4.5.",

However, failure by Impresse to make timely payments, even if deferred under Section 4.5, shall constitute immediate grounds for termination by VerticalNet, without any cure period.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation creates a contradiction regarding the termination conditions related to payment. Section 5.2 outlines a cure period for breaches. The added text allows VerticalNet to terminate immediately for payment failures by Impresse even if the payment is deferred per Section 4.5, thereby bypassing the standard cure period and creating ambiguity about the termination process and undermining the clause about deferred payments in Section 4.5.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by reducing the non-compete radius from three (3) miles to one (1) mile during the Post-Term Period. This conflicts with the original intent of protecting Franchisor's market and creates uncertainty regarding the enforceable scope of the non-compete agreement.",

However, for employees terminated without cause, the Post-Term Period shall be one (1) year.",
                "explanation": "This changes the definition of the 'Post-Term Period' from two (2) years to five (5) years, creating a direct contradiction with the previous definition and increasing the scope of non-compete obligations. Additionally, the introduction of a one-year Post-Term Period for employees terminated without cause introduces another layer of ambiguity and inconsistency, potentially leading to disputes over which period applies in specific situations.",

Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement may cause Franchisor irreparable injury, and Member may be required to pay court costs and attorney's fees incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement. However, injunctive relief shall not be available if the Member is no longer employed by the Franchisee.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces uncertainty regarding the availability of injunctive relief by changing 'will cause' to 'may cause' and 'agrees to pay' to 'may be required to pay'. It also adds a condition where injunctive relief is unavailable if the member is no longer employed. This creates a contradiction, as it's unclear when and under what circumstances injunctive relief can be sought, especially when conflicting with other sections where non-compete obligations exist regardless of employment status.",

                "original_text": "CHT shall pay any and all applicable taxes, however designated or incurred, which are payable by it pursuant to Applicable Law as a result of or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement including, without limitation, federal, provincial and local, excise, sales, use, goods and services, harmonized, value added and any similar taxes, except for any taxes based on Ehave’s net income.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by including taxes based on Ehave's net income as payable by CHT, while the original text explicitly excludes them. This creates uncertainty regarding tax obligations, leading to potential disputes over payment responsibilities.",

                "changed_text": "Where CHT fails to pay any amount in accordance with the payment terms set out in Schedule “6”, Ehave shall have the right, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to it, to charge, and CHT shall pay, interest on such overdue amounts at the rate of 1% per month calculated daily, compounded monthly (12.68% per annum) for the first 30 days after the due date. After 30 days, no further interest will be accrued.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces a contradictory condition on interest accrual. The original clause states interest accrues without a time limit, but the modification limits it to 30 days, creating uncertainty about the total interest payable and potentially leading to disputes over payment amounts.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction by stating the term is both \"in perpetuity\" and \"five (5) years\". This direct conflict about the contract's duration introduces significant ambiguity, leading to potential disputes about the agreement's validity after five years.",

All such reports shall be considered Confidential Information of MMT. Concurrent with the delivery of the applicable Quarterly Report, MMT shall pay to SIGA in Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account designated by SIGA in writing in advance of such payment the net result of Quarterly Collected Revenues, minus the corresponding Promotion Fee, and minus any applicable Credit Amount for such Calendar Quarter (all amounts as calculated in the Quarterly Report, and the payment of the net result being a “Quarterly Payment”).",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces an in-text contradiction regarding MMT's obligation to provide a Quarterly Report. The original text states that MMT 'shall' deliver the report within [***] days after each quarter. The modified text adds a clause stating that MMT is not obligated to deliver the report if there are no Quarterly Collected Revenues. This creates ambiguity. Is the report due regardless, even if it shows no revenue, or is it only due when there is revenue to report? This could lead to disputes if SIGA expects a report even with no revenue.",

                "explanation": "Here, the contradiction concerns the delivery of the Final Report. The original text mandates MMT 'shall' submit a Final Report. The modified text adds a sentence stating that MMT is not obligated to deliver the Final Report if no First Commercial Sale has occurred. This leads to uncertainty. Does MMT always have to provide a report, or is the report conditional on a commercial sale happening? SIGA might expect a report even without a commercial sale, to document any activity, creating conflict.",

The modified text removes these limitations, then adds a sentence that the audit can cover any time period. This creates a contradiction because the original text limits the scope of the audit, while the modified text expands it significantly.

                "changed_text": "a.As of the VNBJ Closing, the JV Agreement shall immediately cease to have any application or effect with respect to VNBJ, all rights and obligations with respect to VNBJ under the JV Agreement shall terminate. However, specific clauses related to intellectual property rights and confidentiality with respect to VNBJ shall remain in effect for a period of five (5) years following the VNBJ Closing, as detailed in Schedule A. All references to “Company” or “Companies” in the JV Agreement (either in the body of the JV Agreement or its schedules and other attachments) shall read and be interpreted to mean VNBZ and/or ANRA except as the context otherwise requires.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Article 1.1 states that the JV Agreement ceases to have any application or effect with respect to VNBJ as of the VNBJ Closing. However, the modified text then states that specific clauses (intellectual property, confidentiality) remain in effect for five years, contradicting the initial statement of complete termination. This creates uncertainty about the extent of the agreement's termination and could lead to disputes over which clauses are still enforceable.",

However, any claims for breaches of representations or warranties must be made within six (6) months of the relevant closing date; otherwise, such claims are waived. This limitation does not apply to claims of gross negligence or willful misconduct.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction. While Article 1.4 states that termination does not release parties from liability for breaches prior to the closings, the added clause imposes a six-month limitation on claims for breaches of representations or warranties. This contradicts the initial statement of non-release from liability, effectively limiting the time frame within which such liability can be pursued. This creates ambiguity about the extent of liability and could lead to disputes over the enforceability of pre-closing breaches after six months.",

However, Article 3 (Governing Law) shall become effective immediately upon execution of this Amendment by all parties, regardless of whether the VNBJ Closing or VNBZ Closing occur.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradiction in the effectiveness of the amendment. The original text states the entire amendment becomes effective only upon the VNBJ and VNBZ Closings. The modified text then states that Article 3 (Governing Law) becomes effective immediately, regardless of the closings. This creates ambiguity about when different parts of the agreement become legally binding, potentially leading to disputes about which jurisdiction governs the agreement if the closings do not occur.",

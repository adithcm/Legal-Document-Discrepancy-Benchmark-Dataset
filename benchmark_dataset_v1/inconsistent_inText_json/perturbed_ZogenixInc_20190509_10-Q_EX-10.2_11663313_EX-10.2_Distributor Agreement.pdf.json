                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear calculation for the transfer price during the distribution term and a different calculation *after* the distribution term. The modification removes the Fully-Burdened Manufacturing Cost component from the calculation of the transfer price *after* the distribution term, but *only* mentions the net sales and not the manufacturing cost, creates a conflict and ambiguity. It could be argued that both apply or only one, but uncertainty in enforcement is very present.",

The modified text states payments are considered made when *initiated* by the payor. This creates a direct conflict about when a payment is officially considered complete, which is crucial for determining late fees, compliance with deadlines, and potential breach of contract.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that interest accrues from the date payment is due. The modified text says interest accrues from *thirty (30) days after* the date payment is due. This clearly contradicts the original term about when interest begins to accrue, leading to disputes about how and when late fees are applied.",

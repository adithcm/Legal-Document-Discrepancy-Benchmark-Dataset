                "original_text": "4.2 Payment for the Products shall be in U.S. Dollars, or such other currency as STAAR may require in its sole discretion, and made within thirty (30) days of STAAR’s invoice. Late payments shall be subject to an interest charge of 1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.",

Late payments shall be subject to an interest charge of 1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces an in-text contradiction by changing the payment deadline from 30 days to 60 days. This creates uncertainty about the actual deadline for payments and when late fees should be applied, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change modifies the time STAAR must wait before disposing of products due to the Distributor failing to take delivery from 30 days to 15 days, creating a contradiction with the payment terms. The Distributor now has less time to address the failure to take delivery before STAAR can dispose of the products.",

The first excerpt stated eighty percent (80%) while the changed excerpt now states fifty percent (50%), meaning the inventory is purchased with that price.",

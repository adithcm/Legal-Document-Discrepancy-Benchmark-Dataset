                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding interest on late payments. The original text states interest is paid at LIBOR + 4 points, while the modified text states no interest is charged unless the payment is over 90 days late, and then it's calculated at Prime + 5. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes.",

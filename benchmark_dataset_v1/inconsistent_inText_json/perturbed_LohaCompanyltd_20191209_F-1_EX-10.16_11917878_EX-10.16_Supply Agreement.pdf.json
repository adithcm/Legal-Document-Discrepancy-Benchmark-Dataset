                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. Section 11 now states the letter of credit must be opened within 60 days, conflicting with the original requirement of 30 days, creating uncertainty and potential for disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original contract states that the Letter of Credit should be valid for 90 days after shipment, however, now it has been changed to 60 days. This in-text contradiction creates conflict and uncertainty in payment deadlines, because the buyer may expect 90 days, and the seller expects 60 days, making the contract dubious.",

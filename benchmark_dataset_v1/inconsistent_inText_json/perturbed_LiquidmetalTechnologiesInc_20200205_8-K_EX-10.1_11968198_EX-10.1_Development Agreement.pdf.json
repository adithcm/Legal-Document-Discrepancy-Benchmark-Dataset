Eutectix may issue an invoice for Liquidmetal Products any time after the shipment thereof to Liquidmetal.\nPayment terms are net 30 days after the date of the invoice, or the date of receipt by Liquidmetal of the invoice if the invoice is\nreceived more than 10 days after the date of the invoice. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Order or as otherwise\nagreed in writing by the Parties, payment shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",

Eutectix may issue an invoice for Liquidmetal Products any time after the shipment thereof to Liquidmetal.\nPayment terms are net 30 days after the date of the invoice, or the date of receipt by Liquidmetal of the invoice if the invoice is\nreceived more than 10 days after the date of the invoice. However, for all invoices exceeding $100,000 USD, payment terms are net 60 days from the invoice date. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Order or as otherwise\nagreed in writing by the Parties, payment shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by establishing different payment deadlines based on the invoice amount. The original clause specifies a net 30-day term, while the modified text introduces a net 60-day term for invoices over $100,000. This contradiction creates uncertainty regarding which deadline applies to large invoices, potentially leading to disputes.",

Unless Liquidmetal notifies Eutectix that the Liquidmetal\nProduct does not meet the Specifications within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Liquidmetal Product, then the\nLiquidmetal Product shall be deemed Accepted. However, for any acceptance period which requires destructive testing, acceptance will be deemed to occur 15 days after the completion of such destructive testing.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by adding an additional acceptance condition based on destructive testing. While the original clause deems acceptance after 30 days of receipt, the modified text introduces another trigger for acceptance which is \"15 days after the completion of destructive testing\". This creates ambiguity as to which acceptance timeline takes precedence and which conditions will be triggered for different acceptance requirements.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that 'Eutectix shall pay all transportation costs for valid returns'. By changing it to 'Liquidmetal shall pay all transportation costs', we have an explicit contradiction. This changes the financial responsibility for returns.",

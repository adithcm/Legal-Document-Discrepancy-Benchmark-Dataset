                "original_text": "2.1 Term of Agreement Except as otherwise provided herein, the term of this Agreement is three (3) years from the Execution Date (“Cooperation Period”). The Parties may negotiate for an extension of this Agreement six (6) months before the expiration of the Cooperation Period.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Term of Agreement Except as otherwise provided herein, the term of this Agreement is three (3) years from the Execution Date (“Cooperation Period”). The Parties may negotiate for an extension of this Agreement six (6) months before the expiration of the Cooperation Period. However, this agreement shall automatically renew for an additional two years unless either party provides written notice of termination at least one year prior to the original expiration date.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a three-year term with an option to negotiate an extension. The added sentence introduces an automatic renewal clause unless a one-year termination notice is provided. This creates a contradiction as it's unclear if the agreement requires negotiation for extension or automatically renews, leading to potential disputes about the agreement's lifespan and termination conditions.",

                "changed_text": "3.2 Assignment of Rights and Obligations Neither Party shall assign any rights or obligations provided herein without the prior written consent of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tsinghua Unigroup may assign its rights and obligations to any of its subsidiaries without obtaining ChipMOS's consent, provided that Tsinghua Unigroup remains ultimately liable for the performance of the assigned obligations.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits assignment without prior written consent from the other party. The added sentence creates an exception allowing Tsinghua Unigroup to assign its rights to subsidiaries without ChipMOS's consent, as long as Tsinghua Unigroup is liable. This contradicts the initial restriction, leading to uncertainty about which assignment rules apply and if ChipMOS has the right to approve assignment to Tsinghua Unigroup subsidiaries.",

However, the foregoing restriction shall not apply to disclosure made to the board of the directors, management team, and relevant employees who need to know such information, attorneys, accountants, financial counsel, and competent authorities for the purposes of performing this Agreement.",

However, the foregoing restriction shall not apply to disclosure made to the board of the directors, management team, and relevant employees who need to know such information, attorneys, accountants, financial counsel, and competent authorities for the purposes of performing this Agreement. Furthermore, ChipMOS may disclose confidential information to potential investors without prior consent from Tsinghua Unigroup.",
                "explanation": "The original text prohibits disclosure to third parties before a public announcement, with specific exceptions. The added sentence allows ChipMOS to disclose confidential information to potential investors without Tsinghua Unigroup's consent. This creates a contradiction, making it unclear whether ChipMOS needs consent for disclosing information to all third parties, or if potential investors are an exception. It introduces uncertainty about the confidentiality obligations, potentially undermining the overall intent of the confidentiality clause.",

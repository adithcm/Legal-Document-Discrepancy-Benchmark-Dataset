                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Except for article 3.1 hereabove, payments shall be made by wire transfer to the bank nominated by Licensor, in maximum 45 days after the issuance by NLS of the corresponding invoices,\nIn the event any payment due under this Agreement is not made at the agreed term and/or for the corresponding full amount, a\nlate payment charge of ten percent (10 %) p.a. is due, calculated on a pro-rata basis of the number of days between the date at\nwhich the outstanding amount was due for payment to Licensor and the date is actually paid.",
                "changed_text": "Except for article 3.1 hereabove, payments shall be made by wire transfer to the bank nominated by Licensor, in maximum 60 days after the issuance by NLS of the corresponding invoices.\nIn the event any payment due under this Agreement is not made at the agreed term and/or for the corresponding full amount, a\nlate payment charge of ten percent (10 %) p.a. is due, calculated on a pro-rata basis of the number of days between the date at\nwhich the outstanding amount was due for payment to Licensor and the date is actually paid.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment deadline from 45 days to 60 days. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, as the clause specifying late payment charges does not specify which deadline to consider.",

                "explanation": "The modification from 45 days to 90 days introduces a conflict with section 3.6, creating ambiguity in the payment schedule and making enforcement unclear.",

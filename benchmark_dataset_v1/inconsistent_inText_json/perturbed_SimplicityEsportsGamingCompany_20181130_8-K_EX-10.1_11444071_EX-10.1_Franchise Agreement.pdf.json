                "original_text": "8.2 Termination by Franchisor with Notice. Franchisor may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to Franchisee upon the occurrence of any of the following:\n(a) Franchisee fails to make any payment required under or in connection with this Agreement;",

Franchisor may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to Franchisee upon the occurrence of any of the following:\n(a) Franchisee fails to make any payment required under or in connection with this Agreement; however, termination for non-payment will only be valid if payment is not received within 10 days of the original due date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the termination process for non-payment. Section 8.2 states that the Franchisor can terminate with 30 days' notice for failure to make any payment. The added clause stipulates that termination is only valid if payment is not received within 10 days of the original due date, creating a discrepancy in the conditions for termination and the time frame the franchisee has to react. It is unclear whether the franchisee has 30 days to cure or only 10.",

Franchisee or third party sub –franchisees shall be under an obligation to set up at least 6 (six) Smaaash Centres during the first Contract Year. However, the franchisee can extend this to the second contract year if approved in writing by the Franchisor.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction about the time frame for setting up Smaaash Centers. The first sentence says 6 centers need to be set up in the first contract year or \"any other time period as may be provided by Franchisor.\" The addition provides an option to extend to the second contract year if approved, but fails to include the \"any other time period as may be provided by Franchisor\" clause from the first sentence. This is contradictory to the opening statement.",

However, either party may terminate this Agreement by and upon notice to the other if the other is unable to perform any of its material obligations for a period of thirty (30) days by reason of a Force Majeure.",

However, either party may terminate this Agreement by and upon notice to the other if the other is unable to perform any of its material obligations, **including payment obligations**, for a period of thirty (30) days by reason of a Force Majeure.",
                "explanation": "Section 10.7 initially states that the Force Majeure clause does not apply to the 'failure to make timely payments'. However, the added phrase 'including payment obligations' within the second sentence creates a direct contradiction. Now, the force majeure clause implicitly can be used as defense for late payments, which it initially negated. This introduces legal uncertainty. ",

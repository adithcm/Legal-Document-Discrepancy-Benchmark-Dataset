                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict in termination clauses. The original clause 4(a)(2) allows the client to cancel with only 7 days notice, while the new clause 4(a)(5) allows the developer to cancel with 90 days notice for any reason. This creates uncertainty about which termination terms are enforceable, specifically regarding the required notice period. In text contradiction occurs.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a conflict in the payment schedule. By specifying that the downpayment is paid upon 'execution of this agreement,' it could conflict with other potential interpretations about when the agreement is 'executed', and the amount to be paid for the last payment is divided into two payments to be paid at different times. This creates uncertainty about the precise timing of the first payment and final payment terms. In text contradiction occurs.",

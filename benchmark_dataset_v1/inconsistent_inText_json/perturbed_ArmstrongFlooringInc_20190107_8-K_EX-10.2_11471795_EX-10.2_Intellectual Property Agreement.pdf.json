The period may be extended by mutual agreement in writing for successive one-year terms.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the Arizona Trademark License Term as a fixed 24-month period. The changed text introduces an extension clause, creating a contradiction. It's now unclear whether the term is strictly 24 months or potentially longer, leading to uncertainty in enforcement regarding trademark usage rights beyond the initial term.",

The changed text replaces this with a 'commercially reasonable timeframe, not to exceed one hundred and eighty (180) days' standard. This introduces a contradiction by allowing for flexibility in the deadline, creating uncertainty and potential disputes regarding compliance with the original 30-day requirement.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes fixed terms for the Arizona and Diamond Licensed Trademarks and perpetuity for Copyrights, Know-How and Patents. The modified text introduces exceptions: the Arizona Trademark License Term can be extended, the Diamond Trademark License Term can be terminated earlier, and the licenses to Copyrights, Know-How and Patents can be terminated in cases of gross negligence. This creates contradictions regarding the duration and irrevocability of the licenses, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

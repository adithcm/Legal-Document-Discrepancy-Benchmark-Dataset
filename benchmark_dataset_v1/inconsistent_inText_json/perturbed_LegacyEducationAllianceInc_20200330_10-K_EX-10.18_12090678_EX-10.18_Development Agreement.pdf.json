                "original_text": "9.3 Base Royalties and Marketing Royalties shall be paid monthly to T&M within 15 days after the end of the applicable month. Payments will be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "changed_text": "9.3 Base Royalties and Marketing Royalties shall be paid monthly to T&M within 15 days after the end of the applicable month, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by both parties, in which case payments can be extended up to 90 days. Payments will be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding payment deadlines. Section 9.3 initially specifies that royalties must be paid within 15 days. By adding the clause allowing for payment extensions up to 90 days with written agreement, it creates uncertainty. It is unclear which deadline applies, potentially leading to disputes over late payment penalties and the enforcement of the original 15-day requirement.",

The Term shall automatically renew thereafter for successive 5-year terms unless either party provides prior written notice of termination not less than 90 days prior to\nthe end of such five-year term.",
                "changed_text": "11.1 The Term shall commence upon the Effective Date and shall continue for an initial term of five (5) years. The Term shall automatically renew thereafter for successive 5-year terms unless either party provides prior written notice of termination not less than 90 days prior to the end of such five-year term; however, LEA may terminate the agreement at any time with 30 days written notice, without penalty.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict between the original renewal terms and a new allowance for LEA to terminate with only 30 days' notice without penalty. The original clause requires 90 days' notice for non-renewal, implying a commitment to the 5-year terms. The new clause undermines this commitment, creating ambiguity about the actual termination requirements and potential liabilities for early termination by LEA.",

However, the indemnifying party's liability shall not exceed $10,000 regardless of the damages.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a liability cap that directly conflicts with the open-ended indemnification obligation outlined in the original clause. The original clause states that a party must indemnify the other against \"any and all damages,\" while the addition caps that liability at $10,000. This creates uncertainty about the extent of indemnification and renders the enforceability of the original clause questionable, as a claimant's actual damages could far exceed the cap.",

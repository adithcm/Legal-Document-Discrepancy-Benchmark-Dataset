The revised text allows the Licensee and its affiliates to use the Licensed Mark for internal documentation, directly contradicting the broad restriction in the original clause.

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the conditions under which the Licensee can terminate the agreement. Originally, the Licensee could terminate with 60 days' notice. The modified text states the Licensee can terminate at any time with no advanced notice and adds a condition under which termination can occur. This introduces uncertainty regarding the actual termination procedure, it also does not specify if the Licensee can terminate for any reason or the specified reason.",

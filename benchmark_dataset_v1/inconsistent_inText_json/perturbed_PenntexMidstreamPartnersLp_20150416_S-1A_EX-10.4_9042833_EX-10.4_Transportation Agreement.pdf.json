                "original_text": "Within fifteen (15) calendar Days following receipt of each of Transporter’s invoices and statements, Customer shall make payment to Transporter of all undisputed amounts by wire transfer, in accordance with the account information provided to Customer, unless another form of payment is agreed to in writing by the Parties. Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid.",
                "changed_text": "Within fifteen (15) calendar Days following receipt of each of Transporter’s invoices and statements, Customer shall make payment to Transporter of all undisputed amounts by wire transfer, in accordance with the account information provided to Customer, unless another form of payment is agreed to in writing by the Parties. Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within thirty (30) calendar days, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by stating that payment is due within 15 days, but then allowing 30 days before interest accrues. This introduces ambiguity regarding the actual payment deadline and when late fees apply.",

                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction by shortening the dispute window from 24 months to 6 months in a section that defines how invoices will be handled. This contradicts other sections that may assume a longer dispute timeframe, creating uncertainty for both parties.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation creates a contradiction by changing the notice period from thirty to ninety days for terminating the contract after the initial 15-year term. This inconsistency causes confusion about the correct procedure for terminating the agreement, leading to possible legal disagreements if one party acts on the 30-day notice while the other expects 90 days.",

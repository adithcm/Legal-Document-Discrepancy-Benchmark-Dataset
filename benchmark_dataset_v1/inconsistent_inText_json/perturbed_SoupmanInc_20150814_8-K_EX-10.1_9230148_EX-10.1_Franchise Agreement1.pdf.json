The Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us in the manner provided in Section 4.3 of this Agreement by the fifteenth(15 th ) day of each calendar month based on royalty fees generated and received during the previous calendar month.",
                "changed_text": "4.2.1 You shall pay to us a royalty fee based on revenue generated by Unit Franchisees (the “Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee”) equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of aggregate royalty fees paid to you by Unit Franchisees in the Master Territory pursuant to their Unit Franchise Agreements. The Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us in the manner provided in Section 4.3 of this Agreement by the last day of each calendar quarter based on royalty fees generated and received during the previous calendar quarter.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in payment deadlines. The original text specifies payment by the fifteenth of each month, while the modified text states payment by the last day of each quarter. This creates uncertainty regarding the actual due date for royalty payments, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "changed_text": "4.4 Interest on Overdue Amounts\n\nAny payment not actually received by us on or before the Fifteen (15 th ) day of each month (or the next business day if the Fifteen(15 th ) of any month is not a business day) shall be deemed overdue, however, no interest shall be charged if the payment is received within thirty (30) days of the due date. After the thirty (30) day grace period, you shall pay to us, in addition to the overdue payment, interest on such overdue amount at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less.",
                "explanation": "The modified text contradicts the original terms regarding interest on overdue amounts. While the original states that any payment not received by the 15th is overdue and subject to interest, the modified text introduces a 30-day grace period with no interest, creating confusion on when interest applies.",

Furthermore, you must provide thirty days written notice before the effective date of termination.",
                "explanation": "This change presents a clear contradiction regarding the Master Franchisee's ability to terminate the agreement. The original text explicitly denies the franchisee the right to terminate, while the modified text grants them the right to terminate under specific conditions (failure of the Franchisor to uphold the minimum requirements as stated in section 9) with a 30 day written notice. This creates direct conflict on termination rights.",

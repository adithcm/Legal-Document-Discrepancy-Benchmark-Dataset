                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment terms. Initially, HDS is required to pay invoices within ten (10) business days of receipt. By changing it to thirty (30) business days in subsection (a), an inconsistency is created, making it unclear which payment deadline should be enforced. This could lead to disputes over late payment penalties and the interpretation of the payment obligations.",

                "explanation": "The modification introduces an in-text contradiction regarding the termination notice period. HDS now requires thirty (30) days' notice to terminate while Celebrity requires only ten (10). This discrepancy creates uncertainty about the actual notice period required for termination, potentially leading to disputes. The contrasting terms favor different parties, making the enforcement ambiguous.",

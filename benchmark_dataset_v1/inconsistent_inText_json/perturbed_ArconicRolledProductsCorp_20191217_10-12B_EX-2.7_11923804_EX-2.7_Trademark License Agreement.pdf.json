                "original_text": "In the event that Licensee has not taken appropriate steps to restore such quality within one-hundred twenty (120) days after notification by Licensor, Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that Licensee has not taken appropriate steps to restore such quality within thirty (30) days after notification by Licensor, Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by shortening the timeframe allowed for the Licensee to rectify quality issues. The original text granted 120 days, while the modified text only allows 30 days before Licensor can terminate the agreement, creating ambiguity and uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict with the original contract by shortening the time-frame to remedy a breach. Originally 120 days, the allotted time is now 60 days. This creates an inconsistency within the contract.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such consent of Licensor is required under this Agreement in the event of a Change of Control of Licensee so long as: (a) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person assumes all the obligations of the Licensee by operation of Law or pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the LicensorÍ¾ and (b) the licenses granted herein shall not be transferrable or sublicensable to Affiliates of such Person unless such Affiliates were Affiliates of Licensee prior to such Change of Control.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, such consent of Licensor is always required under this Agreement in the event of a Change of Control of Licensee. The Licensor has the right to deny any Change of Control, regardless of circumstances.",
                "explanation": "This edit creates a conflict by contradicting the original clause that allowed assignment without consent in a Change of Control scenario. The modified text now states that Licensor consent is *always* required and Licensor can always deny a change of control. This causes an in-text contradiction by reversing the original exception, introducing ambiguity regarding the conditions under which the agreement can be assigned and which party holds controlling rights during a change in company ownership.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in payment terms. Originally, running royalty payments were due within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter. Now, this section specifies 60 days. This conflicts with the late payment clause (4.5), creating uncertainty as to when late fees will actually apply.",

                "explanation": "This change further exacerbates the contradiction. The original clause specified that late payments accrue interest starting on the tenth day after the due date.

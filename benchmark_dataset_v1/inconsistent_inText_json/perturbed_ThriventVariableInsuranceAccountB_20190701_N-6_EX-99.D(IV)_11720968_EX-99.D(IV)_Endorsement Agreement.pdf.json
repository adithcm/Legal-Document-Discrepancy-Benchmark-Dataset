If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member’s fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the time allowed for making an extra payment to maintain solvency. The original text gives 60 days, while the modified text states 30 days. This discrepancy creates uncertainty in enforcement, as it is unclear which deadline applies.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction in dividend policy. The original text states it is not expected that dividends will be credited. The modified text, while stating the same expectation, indicates a surplus will be distributed as additional benefits. This implies dividends *will* effectively be paid, creating conflicting information regarding dividend disbursement and potentially disputable terms.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction concerning the transfer of membership rights. The original text explicitly states membership rights cannot be transferred. The modified text states that ownership including those rights can be transferred, but with limitations on future benefits. This introduces conflicting statements about the assignability of membership, potentially leading to disputes over membership benefits and privileges after transfer.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates an in-text contradiction. The original text states that the affiliate will receive commission payments for all approved accounts placed during the term of the agreement, whereas the changed text limits the commission payments to approved accounts placed only during the first 30 days of the agreement term. This creates uncertainty about the duration for which commission will be received.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces conflicting requirements. The original text states that the affiliate can select or remove links at any time without Chase's approval. The changed text, however, adds a requirement of a 30-day written notice for removing links. This makes enforcement uncertain as it is unclear if the affiliate needs to inform Chase to remove Links.",

However, changes to the referral fees are guaranteed for the first year of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces an in-text contradiction. While Chase reserves the right to change all terms and conditions, the addition that referral fees are guaranteed for the first year creates a conflict. It is unclear whether the change in referral fees are not allowed during the first year or whether referral fees can always be changed. This creates uncertainty and the text is internally inconsistent.",

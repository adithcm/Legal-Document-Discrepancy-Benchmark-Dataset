                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction. Section 6.2 initially specifies a single payment term ([*****] days from shipping date) for all Products. The modification adds an exception for 'specific high-demand Products listed in Appendix H,' where payment is due 'net 15 days from the invoice date.' This creates an ambiguity: it's unclear which payment term applies to high-demand Products, leading to potential disputes and uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct conflict regarding warranty obligations. Section 10.1 initially states that Distributor passes through Cisco's limited warranties. The added sentence mandates that for Products shipped after a specific date, the Distributor must offer an 'extended warranty for two years beyond Ciscoâ€™s standard warranty.' This contradicts the original clause, causing uncertainty about the actual warranty commitment the Distributor is responsible for.",

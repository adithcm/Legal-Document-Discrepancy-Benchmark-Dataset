                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. The original contract states invoices must be paid within 30 days, but this is modified to 60 days. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes over when payments are actually due.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradiction regarding when interest accrues on late payments. Section 4.7 was changed to 60 days to pay, but Section 4.10 has the interest accruing after 90 days if there is no good faith dispute. This makes it unclear what the grace period is, before interest payments begin.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction in the termination clause, as the prior written notice to terminate was changed to 30 days. The previous clauses of payments being due in 60 days with interest accruing at 90 days, may incentivize a party to terminate after 30 days. There is now ambiguity as to how long the notice period is to terminate without the failure of a milestone.",

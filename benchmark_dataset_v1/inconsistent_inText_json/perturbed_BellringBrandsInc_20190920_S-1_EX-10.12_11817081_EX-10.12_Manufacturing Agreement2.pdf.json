The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a “Contract Period”).",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019\" a contradiction is created. The first statement implies a condition for MAOV from July 1, 2019 onwards, which is the approval of Heritage's facility, while the edited statement removes the condition, making the purchase of MAOV obligatory, regardless of the facility's approval. This creates uncertainty about Premier's purchase obligation if the facility isn't approved.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction because while stating all other terms remain in effect, it carves out 'payment terms.' However, it doesn't specify which payment terms are changed or superseded. This creates ambiguity, because Section 1 defines the MAOV, which directly impacts the payment obligations. This leads to uncertainty about whether previous payment schedules or terms related to order volume are still valid, potentially leading to disputes over invoice amounts and payment deadlines.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that 'Premier will be required to purchase [***]', while the modified text changes this to 'Premier has the option to purchase [***]'. This creates a direct contradiction regarding whether the purchase during the specified six-month period is mandatory or optional. This uncertainty makes enforcement problematic, as it's unclear whether Premier is legally obligated to purchase the specified amount or can choose not to.",

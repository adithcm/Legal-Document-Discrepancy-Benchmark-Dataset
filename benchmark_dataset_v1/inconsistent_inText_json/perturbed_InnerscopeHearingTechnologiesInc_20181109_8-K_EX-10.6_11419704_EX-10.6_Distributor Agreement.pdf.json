Distributor shall pay half (1/2) of the purchase price prior to\nshipment and the remaining balance 30 days after shipment of the Products. Payments received\nafter the 30 day calendar period will be subject to a late fee of 1.5% of the invoice amount. All\npayments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "changed_text": "b.\nErchonia shall submit invoices to Distributor after or concurrent with shipment of Products to\nDistributor at the delivery address. Distributor shall pay half (1/2) of the purchase price prior to\nshipment and the remaining balance 60 days after shipment of the Products. Payments received\nafter the 30 day calendar period will be subject to a late fee of 1.5% of the invoice amount. All\npayments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction. The clause states that the remaining balance is due 60 days after shipment, but then specifies late fees will apply after 30 days, creating ambiguity regarding the actual payment deadline and enforcement of late fees.",

                "explanation": "The statement 'Prices will remain in effect for the period of the initial 2 year term' contradicts section 6(a) which specifies an initial term of three (3) years, creating uncertainty regarding the duration of fixed pricing and potentially leading to disputes over price adjustments after 2 years, rather than 3.",

                "changed_text": "United States Only",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Worldwide' to 'United States Only' directly contradicts section 2(j) which states 'Distributor shall not sell or export the Products outside the United States without prior written consent of Erchonia.' Now, it is an absolute restriction instead of a conditional one, creating a contradiction.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Amounts not received within ten (10) days following their respective due dates shall be assessed a late charge equal to one and one-half percent (1 _%) per month of the overdue amount until paid, commencing on the eleventh day.",
                "changed_text": "Amounts not received within ten (10) days following their respective due dates shall be assessed a late charge equal to one and one-half percent (1 _%) per month of the overdue amount until paid, commencing on the eleventh day. However, no late charges will be assessed if payment is received within 30 days of the due date, regardless of the initial 10-day period.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that late charges apply after 10 days but then creating an exception where no late charges apply if paid within 30 days. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as it's unclear when the late charge actually applies.",

However, Company reserves the right to charge North a nominal fee for shipping and handling of these Endorsed Products.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction as it initially states the products are delivered 'at no charge', but then allows for a 'nominal fee' for shipping and handling. This makes the 'no charge' aspect ambiguous and potentially unenforceable.",

North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Company to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by North within seven (7) business days after receipt thereof. North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Company will be advised of the specific grounds for the disapproval.",

North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Company to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by North within seven (7) business days after receipt thereof. However, Company retains the right to use the Advertising Materials even if disapproved by North if, in Company's sole discretion, the disapproval is unreasonable.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict by granting North approval rights initially, then allowing the Company to override that approval based on a subjective assessment of whether the disapproval is 'unreasonable.' This undermines the approval clause and creates uncertainty in its enforcement.",

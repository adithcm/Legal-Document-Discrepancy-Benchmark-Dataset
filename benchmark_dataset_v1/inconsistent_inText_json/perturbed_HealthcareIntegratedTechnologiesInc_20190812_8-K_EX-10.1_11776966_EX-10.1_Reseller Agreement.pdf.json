                "original_text": "If Reseller fails to submit Orders with an aggregate value equal to or greater than the MOQ, then Reseller shall pay Supplier a sum equal to the shortfall, within 30 days after the end of the Initial Term. Upon payment of such amount, Seller shall deliver the Products paid for to Reseller in a commercially reasonable timeframe (and in no event any later than 150 days from the date such payment is received in full) to be sold by Reseller in accordance with this Agreement as contemplated by the last sentence of Section 12.4.",
                "changed_text": "If Reseller fails to submit Orders with an aggregate value equal to or greater than the MOQ, then Reseller shall pay Supplier a sum equal to the shortfall, within 60 days after the end of the Initial Term. Upon payment of such amount, Seller shall deliver the Products paid for to Reseller in a commercially reasonable timeframe (and in no event any later than 90 days from the date such payment is received in full) to be sold by Reseller in accordance with this Agreement as contemplated by the last sentence of Section 12.4.",

It also changes the maximum delivery timeframe from 150 to 90 days. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment and delivery terms, potentially leading to disputes.",

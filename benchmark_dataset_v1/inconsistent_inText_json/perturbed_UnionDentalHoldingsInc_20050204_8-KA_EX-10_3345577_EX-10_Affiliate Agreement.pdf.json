                "original_text": "a. Term. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect until either Party informs the other Party with thirty (30) day prior written notice of termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "a. Term. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect until either Party informs the other Party with thirty (30) day prior written notice of termination of this Agreement.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, UDC reserves the right to terminate this agreement with only 10 days written notice should they deem it necessary.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the termination notice period. The original clause stipulates a 30-day notice, while the added sentence allows UDC to terminate with only 10 days' notice, creating uncertainty about the actual notice period required. This creates an in-text contradiction.",

All confidential information is to be destroyed but back-up tapes may be retained by the party.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that upon termination of the agreement, no copies or back-up tapes are to be retained. The added sentence directly contradicts this by stating that back-up tapes may be retained. This creates an uncertainty about whether back-up tapes should be destroyed or retained. This creates an in-text contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that UDC shall not exercise any specific control or direction over the methods by which the Business Affiliate performs services. The modified text directly contradicts this by granting UDC the right to exercise control and direction. This creates a significant ambiguity and uncertainty about the true nature of the relationship between the parties and their respective rights and obligations. This creates an in-text contradiction.",

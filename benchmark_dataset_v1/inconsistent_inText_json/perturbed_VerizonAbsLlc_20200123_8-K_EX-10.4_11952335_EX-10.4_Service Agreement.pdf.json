The original text states that the Servicer *may* deposit collections on the second Business Day *before* each Payment Date, giving the servicer discretion. The changed text states that the Servicer *shall* deposit collections on the second Business Day *following receipt of collections*, creating a contradiction as the Servicer has no longer discretion and different timeline on when collections must be made.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document, immediately upon the resignation of Cellco as Servicer pursuant to this Section 7.1, Cellco, in its individual capacity, will be required to assume the obligations of the Servicer to acquire Receivables as set forth in Sections 3.4 and 4.7 of the Master Trust Receivables Transfer Agreement and Sections 2.5 and 2.6 of this Agreement without further action.",

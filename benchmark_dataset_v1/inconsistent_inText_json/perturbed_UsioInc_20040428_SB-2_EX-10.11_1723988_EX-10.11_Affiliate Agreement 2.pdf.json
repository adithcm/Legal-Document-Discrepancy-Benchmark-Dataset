The  term  (\"Term\")  of  this Agreement shall be for one hundred eighty  days  (180)  from  the  date set forth below unless Network 1 or Visa or MasterCard  or Harris Bank doesn't approve Affiliate's ISO application, in which case,  the  Term  will  be  3 years. This Agreement will automatically renew for successive  one-year  terms  unless  terminated by either party by providing the other  with  30  days  written notice that this Agreement will not be renewed or Affiliate  enters  into  a  Processing  agreement  with  Network  1  and  an ISO Sponsorship  agreement  with  Harris  Bank  in  which  case  this Agreement will automatically  terminate  concurrent  with  the  execution  of  such agreements.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Network 1 reserves the right to extend the initial term indefinitely by providing written notice to Affiliate within 15 days prior to the end of the initial term. This extension will be at Network 1's sole discretion and does not require Affiliate approval.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the term of the agreement. The original clause states a specific term length and renewal conditions. The added sentence gives Network 1 the unilateral right to extend the initial term indefinitely, effectively nullifying the original term length and creating uncertainty about the agreement's duration. This creates a legal issue, because the term is not actually agreed upon.",

                "explanation": "The original payment clause specifies that payments will be made on or before the 25th of each calendar month. The altered clause states that payments will be made within 5 business days of Network 1 receiving payment from the Member Bank, regardless of the merchant's payment status. This creates a contradiction because one clause sets a fixed date for payment, while the other ties the payment deadline to Network 1's receipt of funds, potentially accelerating or delaying payment beyond the 25th, introducing ambiguity and uncertainty.",

Upon termination due to an uncured default  by  Affiliate,  or  termination for cause pursuant to Section 5.02  [TERMINATION]D all Affiliates  fees  shall  cease  to  be  accrued  and  paid  immediately upon the occurrence  of  said  event.

                "explanation": "The original clause outlines specific conditions for continued payments to the Affiliate after termination. The added sentence introduces the option for Network 1 to pay a lump sum as a 'full and final settlement,' which contradicts the original clause's obligation for continued payments. This creates ambiguity about whether the Affiliate is entitled to ongoing fees or if Network 1 can unilaterally terminate the payment obligation with a one-time payment, potentially leading to a dispute.",

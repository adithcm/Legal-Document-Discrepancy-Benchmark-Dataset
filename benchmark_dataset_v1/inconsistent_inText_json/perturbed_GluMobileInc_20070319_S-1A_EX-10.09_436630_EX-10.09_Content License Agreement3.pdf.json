Royalty: In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox, or such other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n(a) From the first unit sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee’s Gross Receipts\n(as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee’s sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.\n(“IA2 Audio and Video Royalty”).  For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may not recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2\nGuarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "changed_text": "1. Royalty: In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox, or such other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n(a) From the first unit sold until one million units are sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee’s Gross Receipts (as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee’s sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products. After one million units are sold, the royalty rate decreases to ***** percent (*****%).\n(“IA2 Audio and Video Royalty”). For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may recoup 20% of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that the royalty rate changes after one million units are sold, contradicting the initial statement that the royalty rate is fixed 'from the first unit sold.' Additionally, allowing recoupment of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee contradicts the original clause explicitly forbidding it, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Except as herein expressly amended, the Agreement in all other respects is hereby ratified; however, in cases of discrepancies with prior amendments, this amendment supersedes all previous agreements on the matter. The Agreement shall continue in full force and effect for the initial term, unless terminated earlier as per Section 15 of the Original Agreement, which is now modified to allow either party to terminate with 30 days written notice without penalty.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction. While it initially states the original agreement is ratified, it then states this amendment supersedes prior agreements in cases of discrepancy. Furthermore, modifying Section 15 to allow termination with 30 days' notice directly contradicts the original terms governing termination, which may have involved penalties or longer notice periods. This creates uncertainty about which termination clause applies.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by stating that VGSL and other CSP payments should be treated 'in the same manner' as before, but then immediately altering that treatment by splitting the payments and designating a portion as a non-refundable advance. This contradicts the original intention of consistent treatment and creates ambiguity regarding how these payments should be accounted for.",

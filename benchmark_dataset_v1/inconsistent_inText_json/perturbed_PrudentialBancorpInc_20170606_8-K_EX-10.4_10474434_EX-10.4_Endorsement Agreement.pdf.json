However, in no case shall the beneficiary receive less than $50,000 regardless of the calculation.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original clause states the beneficiary receives the lesser of two calculated amounts. The added sentence guarantees a minimum payout of $50,000, potentially overriding the 'lesser of' clause and creating ambiguity about the actual payout amount.",

However, if the Employer terminates the agreement within the first year, they are liable for a penalty equal to 10% of the initial premium payments made.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction. The original clause allows termination at any time with written notice, implying no penalty. The added sentence introduces a penalty for the Employer if termination occurs within the first year. This creates uncertainty about the actual terms of termination and whether a penalty applies.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction. Initially, the Employer retains possession, with temporary access granted to the Employee for specific purposes like endorsements, with prompt return expected. The added sentence allows the Employee to retain the policy for up to 30 days for personal review. This directly contradicts the 'promptly returned' clause, creating ambiguity regarding possession rights and duration.",

                "explanation": "Section 5.7 originally stated payments should be made within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter. Changing this to 90 days creates a direct conflict with the audit clauses in section 5.8, which are dependent on timely and regular payments for accurate record reconciliation, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Original section stated payment should be made 15 days after month end. Changing this to 45 days introduces a conflict. Now different payment deadlines apply for different types of fees within the same larger 'Payment' section of the agreement. This creates ambiguity regarding which payment term is applicable, potentially leading to legal disputes.",

                "explanation": "Changing audit notice period from 7 business days to 180 business days and audit frequency from once a year to once every five years creates a contradiction. Also, the records should be maintained for one year after termination instead of two. This conflict makes it unclear when audits can occur, undermining NETTAXI's ability to verify payments and resolve discrepancies effectively. The ambiguity in audit timing introduces legal uncertainty.",

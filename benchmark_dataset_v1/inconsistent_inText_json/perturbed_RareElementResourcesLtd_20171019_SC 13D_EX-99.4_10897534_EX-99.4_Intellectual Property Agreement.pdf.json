The royalty fee shall be 5% of gross sales, payable quarterly.",

Investor will not assign to any Third Party any rights under this IP Agreement not specifically transferable by its terms without the prior written consent of Company, such consent may be withheld at Company's sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the foregoing: (1) such rights are assignable by Investor to an Affiliate of Investor, but only with explicit approval from the board of directors, and (2) Investor’s rights in Investor Improvements and Joint Improvements shall be assignable by Investor only to a direct competitor of the Company following a mandatory arbitration decision.",

The original text states consent cannot be \"unreasonably withheld\", implying an obligation to consent under reasonable circumstances, but the change says consent may be withheld in \"Company's sole discretion.\" This creates uncertainty and potential disputes regarding assignments. Additionally, assigning rights in improvements only to a competitor after arbitration conflicts with the initial aim to benefit both parties.",

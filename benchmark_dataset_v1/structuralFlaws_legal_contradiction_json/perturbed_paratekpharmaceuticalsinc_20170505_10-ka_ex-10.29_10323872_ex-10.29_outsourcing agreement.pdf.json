                "explanation": "The original dispute resolution clause mandates arbitration in Delaware according to ICC rules. By placing it in the 'Publicity' section, its enforceability is reduced because it is not where parties would typically expect to find it. Relocating required legal information will introduce a structural flaw. In several jurisdictions, dispute resolutions must be in their own section.",

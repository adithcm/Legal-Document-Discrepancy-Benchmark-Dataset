All expenses and costs attributable to the\nforegoing provision shall be borne by S2K in accordance with Section 2 and Section 5 herein. S2K shall remain liable for any representations made\nby it or contained in materials produced and approved by S2K for use in marketing the Funds.\n(a) As described in the Fund’s Prospectus, the Fund may impose a sales charge “load” in connection with the purchase of shares\nof the Fund, a portion of which will be paid to S2K pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Prospectus.\n(b) In consideration of the marketing, sales and other related activities provided by S2K, the Distributor may compensate S2K for\nsuch services on each Fund’s behalf and at the direction of each such Fund.

                "explanation": "Moving the compensation terms into the section about Fund Materials obscures the financial terms of the agreement. Compensation is a fundamental aspect of any agreement, so hiding it in a section about marketing materials makes it harder to find and understand, thus reducing its enforceability.",

                "original_text": "Any doubt that arises, in the frame of this Agreement, will be settled through arbitration in equity, in compliance with the Spanish Law of Arbitration, Ley 60/2003, both parties agreeing to obey the decision. For the designation of the arbitrators and the management of the arbitration, the following rules will apply:\n\n\nThere will be three arbitrators, solicitors. Each party will designate one, and these two will designate a third one.\n\n\nThe place of arbitration will be Madrid.\n\n\nIt will be governed by the laws of Spain and the language of the process will be Spanish.\n\n\nThe arbitrators will dictate the decision within three months of the notice of the parties’ acceptance.",
                "changed_text": "Any doubt that arises, in the frame of this Agreement, will be settled through arbitration in equity; however, the decision to arbitrate will be based on mutual agreement. For the designation of the arbitrators and the management of the arbitration, the following rules will apply:\n\n\nThere will be three arbitrators, solicitors. Each party will designate one, and these two will designate a third one.\n\n\nThe place of arbitration will be Madrid.\n\n\nIt will be governed by the laws of Spain and the language of the process will be Spanish.\n\n\nThe arbitrators will dictate the decision within three months of the notice of the parties’ acceptance.",
                "explanation": "The restructuring of the sentence introduces contradiction—the first part states arbitration is mandatory, but the latter part allows for 'mutual agreement' on whether to proceed with arbitration. This contradicts the original clause's strict arbitration requirement, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The inclusion of 'but the decision to transmit its copies will be optional and decided by EIT' introduces a contradiction. While EIT is obligated to hand over data, it can decide if they have to transmit their copies. This contradicts the original clause's requirement to deliver all the data and copies to the customer.",

Both parties agree not to spread or use directly, through third parties or other companies, information about the other party to which they have access in the frame of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'but either party has the right to share or use the terms of the contract to any subsidiaries or parent companies' creates a contradiction within the clause. The initial part establishes a strict confidentiality obligation, while the added phrase allows disclosure to subsidiaries or parent companies, which can weaken the original intention of complete confidentiality.",

Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter if the Company sees fit. Beginning on the first full quarter [three (3) month period] of the Agreement, or at any time thereafter, the Company may reassess this arrangement. The following per Unit conversion shall apply ONLY if the Company decides to proceed with the donation:",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states a donation will be made. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by stating the donation is at the discretion of the company, undermining the enforceability of the original financial commitment.

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates provision of sales reports on request. The changed clause transforms this obligation into a discretionary action, allowing for the provision of unreliable information. This undermines the NFLA-NC's ability to verify donation amounts, creating a legal contradiction by diminishing transparency and accountability.",

The modified clause introduces ambiguity by suggesting verbal agreements are acceptable for 'smaller issues', undermining the original requirement for written consent.

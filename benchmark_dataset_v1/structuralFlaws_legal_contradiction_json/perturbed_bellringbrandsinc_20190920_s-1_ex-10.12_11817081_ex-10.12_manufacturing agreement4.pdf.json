                "explanation": "By adding the dispute resolution clause to the 'WHEREAS' section, which is usually introductory and not considered part of the binding terms, it reduces the clause's enforceability. Standard legal practice requires dispute resolution clauses to be prominently displayed in a specific section of the agreement.",

However, this clause shall only apply if there is adequate marketing budget for the goods to be sold as identified in Schedule C-1.",
                "explanation": "By including terms regarding public disclosure and tying it to a contingency in Schedule C-1 in a general clause addressing the original agreement, its clarity and discoverability are diminished. Terms of confidentiality should be clear and concise.",

                "changed_text": "(g)\tEach Station, by the terms of this contract, shall be entitled to invoke the protection against duplication of Service programming imported under the compulsory copyright license, but that protection is optional.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'but that protection is optional,' the mandatory nature of the protection against duplication is undermined, creating a legal contradiction. FCC rules regarding copyright protection don't allow for optional enforcement by the station.",

                "explanation": "Modifying the closed captioning requirement to 'some programming, as determined by Network's discretion' directly contradicts the legal mandate for full-time closed captioning. Similarly, making V-chip ratings 'if deemed applicable' undermines the requirement to encode program ratings.",

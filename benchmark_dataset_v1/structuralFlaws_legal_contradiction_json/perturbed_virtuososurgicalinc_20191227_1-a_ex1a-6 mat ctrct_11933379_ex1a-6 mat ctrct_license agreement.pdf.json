                "explanation": "Moving the record-keeping and audit clause from 'Payments, Royalty and Reporting' (Section 4) to 'Miscellaneous' (Section 9) reduces its prominence and discoverability. Financial audit rights are generally expected to be located within financial sections of a contract. Relocating this detail could make it less likely for the licensee to be aware of their responsibilities, and increase ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "Moving the product liability insurance requirement to the 'Termination by Company' section obscures its importance. This section focuses on when the contract ends, not on ongoing operational requirements. This makes it harder for the licensor to monitor compliance and increases the risk of the licensee overlooking the essential insurance obligation.",

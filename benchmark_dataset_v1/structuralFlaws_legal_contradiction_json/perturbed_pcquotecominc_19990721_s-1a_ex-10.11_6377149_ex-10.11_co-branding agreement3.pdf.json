The original introduction of the document becomes mixed with the recitals, which are normally distinct sections of the contract.

By removing the direct statement that the Second Amendment prevails in case of conflict, and replacing it with an obligation for 'good faith' interpretation that lacks any specific guarantee, it introduces uncertainty and reduces the legal weight of the amendment. The original text has a clause that has changed and has made the text more ambiguous.",

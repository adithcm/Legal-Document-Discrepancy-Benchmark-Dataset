All persons affected by this Agreement specifically consent to the personal jurisdiction of and venue in said courts. No action, case, suit or proceeding, regardless of form, arising out of or related to this Agreement, may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after the cause of action has arisen, or in the case of nonpayment, more than two (2) years from the date of the last payment. ALL ACTIONS, CASES, SUITS AND PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE HEARD WITHOUT A JURY.

All persons affected by this Agreement specifically consent to the personal jurisdiction of and venue in said courts. No action, case, suit or proceeding, regardless of form, arising out of or related to this Agreement, may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after the cause of action has arisen, or in the case of nonpayment, more than two (2) years from the date of the last payment. In the spirit of collaboration, the parties agree that disputes may be resolved through non-binding mediation before pursuing formal legal action.

                "explanation": "Inserting a clause about non-binding mediation introduces ambiguity regarding the waiver of jury trial. The original clause explicitly waives the right to a jury trial. Adding mediation implies a step before formal proceedings, potentially confusing the enforceability of the jury trial waiver and whether parties are truly committed to forgoing a jury trial.",

However, no legal action may be pursued if a good faith effort for resolution has been demonstrated.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'However, no legal action may be pursued if a good faith effort for resolution has been demonstrated' introduces a subjective condition that undermines the right to legal action for payment recovery. The vagueness of 'good faith effort' creates uncertainty and could be used to delay or prevent enforcement of payment obligations. The addition of a requirement for 'good faith effort' directly contradicts the party's right to pursue legal action.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'However, either party may terminate this agreement with 30-day notice to the other, irrespective of other terms' creates a contradiction with the original 'perpetuity' clause. The original clause suggests a lasting, indefinite agreement, modifiable only by mutual agreement. This abrupt right to terminate irrespective of terms diminishes the initial intent of a perpetual agreement.",

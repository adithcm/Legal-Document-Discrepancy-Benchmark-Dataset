                "explanation": "The addition of 'However, the method of dispute resolution will be determined by mutual agreement between both parties at the time a dispute arises' directly contradicts the clause specifying Ohio law, leading to uncertainty about the applicable dispute resolution process and diminishing the enforceability of the jurisdiction clause.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'however, this clause does not apply if compliance negatively impacts the Distributor's business operations' creates a loophole that undermines the anti-bribery compliance clause. It suggests that the distributor can disregard anti-bribery laws if compliance is deemed detrimental to their business, thereby weakening the enforceability of the entire clause.",

                "explanation": "Adding '; however, the supplier is not obligated to provide indemnity if the distributor is at fault.' creates a contradiction by adding ambiguity to the indemnity clause. While 'wilful misconduct' is specified, the clause's added phrase means there is now an ambiguity in defining 'fault' and contradicts the original intent of protection for the distributor from damages.",

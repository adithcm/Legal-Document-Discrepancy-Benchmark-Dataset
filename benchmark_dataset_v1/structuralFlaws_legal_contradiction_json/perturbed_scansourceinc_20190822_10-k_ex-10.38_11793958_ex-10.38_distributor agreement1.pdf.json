In any suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement the prevailing party will have the right to recover from the other its costs and reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys incurred in connection with the suit or proceeding, including costs, fees and expenses upon appeal, separately from and in addition to any other amount included in such judgment. This provision is intended to be severable from the other provisions of this Agreement, and shall survive expiration or termination and shall not be merged into any such judgment",

                "explanation": "Changing the attorneys' fees clause from allowing the prevailing party to recover costs to each party bearing their own costs. This introduces a legal contradiction by deviating from standard legal practice, where the winning party is often entitled to recover legal fees, impacting the enforceability of the clause.",

                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause from a potentially more relevant section (like dispute resolution) to the introductory section makes it less conspicuous and harder to find, potentially hindering its enforceability. Standard practice is to place dispute resolution mechanisms in clearly labeled sections for easy identification.",

                "explanation": "The liability clause should normally be placed within a section addressing limitations or liability itself. Placing it here, at the end of the signature block, makes it less noticeable. This could make a party believe it was added after initial review. This clause typically warrants its own separate section of considerable length and should never be near signatures.",

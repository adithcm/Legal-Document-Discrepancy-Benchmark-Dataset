To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and except as otherwise stated in this Agreement: (a) the foregoing Warranty is exclusive; and (b) all other terms, representations, undertakings, rights, remedies and warranties are excluded, whether express or implied (including but not limited to any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or against infringement). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the exclusive remedy for breach of the Warranty shall be, at STAAR’s option, the repair or replacement, at STAAR’s expense, of the non-conforming Product; provided that Distributor notifies STAAR of the non-conformity and returns the non-conforming Product within the Warranty Period. Products may only be returned by Distributor when accompanied by a return material authorization number issued by STAAR. Shipping expenses for Products returned by Distributor will be prepaid by Distributor. STAAR shall pay for the return or replacement shipment to Distributor of Products repaired or replaced under the Warranty. For Products returned for repair or replacement that are not covered under Warranty, STAAR’s standard repair charges shall be applicable in addition to all shipping expenses. The above Warranty is contingent upon proper installation, use and maintenance of the Products and does not apply to Products which have been misused, mishandled, adulterated, repaired or modified without STAAR’s written approval. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, STAAR shall not be responsible for any incidental or consequential loss, damage, or expense which arises directly or indirectly from the use of any Product. Without limiting the above, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Distributor’s sole remedy in contract or in tort (including in negligence) and STAAR’s liability shall be limited to the repair or replacement of any Product which is returned to and found to be defective or non-conforming by STAAR.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Governing Law. The Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Florida in the United States of America, and venue for any such legal action shall be in the Circuit Court or County Court in Orlando, FL or the U.S. District Court having jurisdiction over Orlando, FL.",
                "changed_text": "Governing Law. In the spirit of partnership, the Parties may mutually decide on the governing law and jurisdiction in case of disputes, unless otherwise specified in addenda. The Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Florida in the United States of America, and venue for any such legal action shall be in the Circuit Court or County Court in Orlando, FL or the U.S. District Court having jurisdiction over Orlando, FL.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'Parties may mutually decide', it introduces ambiguity and contradicts the original clause which clearly states Florida law governs and specifies jurisdiction. This makes enforcement less certain.",

Company represents and warrants to North that it will comply with all rules, regulations, laws, orders, decrees and ordinances of the United States, each state and political subdivision thereof, and each and every foreign country having legal jurisdiction over any aspect of Company’s activities under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the use of North’s Likeness in advertisements for and on behalf of the Company.",

Company represents and warrants to North that it will comply with all rules, regulations, laws, orders, decrees and ordinances of the United States, each state and political subdivision thereof, and each and every foreign country having legal jurisdiction over any aspect of Company’s activities under this Agreement, to the best of its knowledge and ability, including, but not limited to, the use of North’s Likeness in advertisements for and on behalf of the Company.",
                "explanation": "The 'to the best of its knowledge and ability' significantly weakens the original warranty. Compliance is now dependent on the company's subjective understanding, making it difficult to prove non-compliance and weakening North's protection under this clause.",

                "explanation": "The 'or through documented email correspondence' addition undermines the requirement for a 'written instrument duly executed'. Email lacks the formal signing process and evidentiary weight of a duly executed document, making amendment disputes more likely and enforcement harder.",

                "explanation": "The original text's arbitration clause has been removed and replaced with a statement indicating all disputes will be solved in a court of law. Moving this clause to be near the section on public announcements makes it less likely to be noticed and undermines the enforceability of the original intent for dispute resolution. This will likely be challenged, and possibly voided in court, due to its lack of prominence and clarity.",

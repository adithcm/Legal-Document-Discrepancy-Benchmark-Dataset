                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement will be governed by the substantive laws of the State of New York, without regard for its conflict of laws provisions.\nWaiver of Jury Trial\nThe parties waive any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The clause explicitly waiving the right to a jury trial is directly contradicted by granting the right. This introduces substantial ambiguity and potential unenforceability regarding the dispute resolution process.",

Notwithstanding the above, either party will be liable to the other for special, incidental, or indirect damages or for any consequential damages (including lost profits or savings), even if they are not informed of the possibility.",
                "explanation": "The clause initially disclaims liability for consequential damages but then directly contradicts itself by stating that either party WILL be liable for such damages, regardless of prior notice.

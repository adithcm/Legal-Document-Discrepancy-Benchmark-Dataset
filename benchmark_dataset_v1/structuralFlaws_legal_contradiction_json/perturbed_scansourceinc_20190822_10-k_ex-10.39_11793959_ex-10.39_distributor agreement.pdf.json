                "original_text": "Distributor remains responsible for undertaking appropriate and reasonable measures to ensure that its own relevant subcontractors, consultants, agents or representatives who interact with government​ affiliated organizations comply with applicable anti-corruption laws;",
                "changed_text": "Distributor remains responsible for undertaking appropriate measures to ensure that its own relevant subcontractors, consultants, agents or representatives who interact with government affiliated organizations comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, provided that such measures do not cause undue financial burden.",
                "explanation": "Adding the clause 'provided that such measures do not cause undue financial burden' weakens the enforceability of the compliance requirement. It introduces ambiguity as to what constitutes 'undue financial burden,' potentially allowing the distributor to justify non-compliance based on cost, thereby creating a loophole in the anti-corruption obligations. This contradicts the intent of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which emphasizes strict compliance.",

For other available regional hotline numbers, please consult Cisco's internal directory.",
                "explanation": "Removing the direct contact to the email 'ethics@cisco.com' and replacing it with 'Cisco's internal directory' makes it less accessible. There is no link to direct email or phone number for regional hotlines. By obfuscating the specific reporting channels, it potentially discourages whistleblowing, weakening compliance and contradicting the spirit of anti-corruption laws.",

                "explanation": "Replacing the URL with 'details of which are available upon request' reduces the accessibility and transparency of Cisco's anti-corruption compliance guidelines. It creates a hurdle for Distributor to readily access and understand their obligations. This weakens the enforceability of the compliance requirement and contradicts the intent of promoting awareness and adherence to anti-corruption laws.",

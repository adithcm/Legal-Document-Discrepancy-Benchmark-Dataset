If any action is brought among the parties with respect to this Agreement or otherwise, by way of a claim or counterclaim, the parties agree that in any such action, and on all issues, the parties irrevocably waive their right to a trial by jury.

If any action is brought among the parties with respect to this Agreement or otherwise, by way of a claim or counterclaim, the parties agree that in any such action, and on all issues, the parties may consider waiving their right to a trial by jury.",
                "explanation": "The change replaces 'irrevocably waive their right to a trial by jury' with 'parties may consider waiving their right to a trial by jury', removing the mandatory waiver and introducing ambiguity.

                "explanation": "By changing 'will be entitled' to 'may be entitled', the entitlement of the prevailing party to recover attorney's fees becomes discretionary rather than mandatory.

Severability clauses are designed to ensure that the rest of the contract remains valid if one part is found invalid.

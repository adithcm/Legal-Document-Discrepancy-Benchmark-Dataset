                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services for convenience at any time in accordance with the Section entitled “Termination” of the Agreement. If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, Bank of America shall have the right to reinstate the Maintenance Services without paying any reinstatement fee.",
                "changed_text": "Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services for convenience at any time in accordance with the Section entitled “Termination” of the Agreement. If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, Bank of America may, at the Supplier's sole discretion, have the right to reinstate the Maintenance Services with a reinstatement fee determined by the Supplier.",
                "explanation": "By altering the terms of reinstatement after termination, this introduces a contradiction. The original clause allows Bank of America to reinstate maintenance services without a fee, whereas the modified clause makes reinstatement conditional on Supplier's approval and subject to a potentially arbitrary fee. This could violate fairness and good faith principles in contract law.",

                "changed_text": "The Software License and Maintenance will be provided at no charge, however, additional costs may be incurred for implementation and future consultation as determined by Cardlytics.",
                "explanation": "By adding a clause that costs may be incurred for implementation and future consultation, the original meaning of the statement that the Software License and Maintenance are 'at no charge' are now thrown into question, opening a contradiction. The added caveat introduces ambiguity, suggesting potential hidden costs that undermine the initial 'no charge' declaration. This undermines clarity for Bank of America and the enforceability of the clause.",

                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding anything set forth elsewhere in this Agreement (or below), the Maintenance Period shall be twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, excluding Bank of America holidays.",
                "explanation": "By changing the maintenance period to exclude Bank of America holidays, it introduces contradiction. The exclusion is in contrast with the original text where the maintenance period would include holidays. The enforcement of this clause would be difficult due to this contradiction.",

Vendor shall procure all approvals, bonds, certificates, insurance, inspections, licenses, and permits that such Laws require for the performance of this Agreement. Vendor shall create and maintain any necessary records and provide any certificate, affidavit or other information or documentation requested or as otherwise required by AT&T: (a) to show compliance by Vendor and its Subcontractors with Laws, (b) to comply or otherwise establish AT&T’s compliance with Laws or (c) to allow AT&T to timely respond to any complaints, filings, or other proceedings.",

Vendor shall comply with some Laws applicable to Vendor’s performance under this Agreement, including all Work contemplated herein and some Material, Services and Deliverables provided hereunder, and AT&T’s utilization of the Cell Sites. Vendor shall procure some approvals, bonds, certificates, insurance, inspections, licenses, and permits that some Laws require for the performance of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By using the words 'some Laws' instead of 'all Laws' reduces the Vendor's legal responsibility and introduces a contradiction by suggesting they don't need to comply with every law. This contradicts the original section's strict liability regarding legal compliance.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'govern all matters' to 'will probably govern most matters' introduces uncertainty and reduces the enforceability of the governing law clause. This weakens the contractual certainty.",

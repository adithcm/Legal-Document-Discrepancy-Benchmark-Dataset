Reed’s may issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect\nto this Agreement or the relationship of the parties, subject to Company’s prior approval of any such press release or other public announcement\nwhich shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, it being understood that such consent shall not be required in the case of any\npublic announcement required by any law, regulation, regulatory body or the rules of any exchange to which Reed’s is or may become subject.\nCompany shall not publicly identify Reed’s or use Reed’s name in any manner in connection with this Agreement without Reed’s prior written\napproval.\n10.

                "explanation": "The limitation of liability clause is moved to after the press releases section.

Failure of either party to exercise promptly any right, power or privilege granted by this Agreement, or to require strict\nperformance of any obligation undertaken by the other party pursuant to this Agreement, will not be deemed to be a waiver of such right, power or\nprivilege or of the right to demand subsequent performance of any and all such obligations undertaken by the other party.\n14. Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by, and any dispute arising hereunder shall be determined in accordance\nwith, the laws of State of Oregon (without giving effect to conflict of laws principles) including all matters of construction, validity and\nperformance. The parties agree that any claim or dispute arising under this Agreement shall be resolved by a court located in Hood River, Oregon.",
                "explanation": "The governing law and venue clause is moved within the waiver section and the location is modified to Hood River, Oregon. This is a structural flaw because governing law and venue clauses should not be mixed within sections about waivers, making it difficult to locate and enforce and creates a conflict of interest since the company's headquarters is in Oregon.",

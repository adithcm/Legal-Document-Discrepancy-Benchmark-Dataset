Without reference to choice or conflict of law principles, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA. The Parties unconditionally submit to exclusive jurisdiction of and accept as the exclusive venue for any legal proceeding involving this Agreement the state and federal courts located in the County of Los Angeles, California. Before any Party (the “Complaining Party”) may bring any legal proceeding against the other (the “Non Complaining Party”), the Complaining Party shall first make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve all disputes privately by notifying and providing to the Non Complaining Party of the Complaining Party’s complaints, reasons and supporting evidence for the complaints, and the reasonable steps Complaining Party would like the Non Complaining Party to take in order to address the complaints. If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles County, California, by an arbitrator of JAMS, in accordance with its arbitration rules and procedures then in effect. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing Party in any dispute involving this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the other Party its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees (including any fees for expert witnesses, paralegals, or other legal service providers). This Section 15.10 shall not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.",

Each Party shall be responsible for its own costs and expenses in connection with all matters relating to the negotiation and performance of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties.\n\n15.4 Assignment. Neither Newegg nor Allied shall have the right or power to assign or transfer any part of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior consent in writing of the other Party.\n\n15.5 Injunctive Relief. Each Party agrees that money damages for a breach of its obligations under the provisions of this Agreement protecting Confidential Information and those governing Intellectual Property Rights may be an inadequate remedy for the loss suffered by the other Party and the other Party shall have the right to obtain injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in order to prevent the breach, or further breach as the case may be, of any such obligation, without limiting the other Party’s right to pursue any and all remedies provided in such event by law or equity.\n\n15.6 Non-Waiver. All waivers must be in writing. No failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege.\n\n15.7 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the provision shall be modified as necessary to conform to such laws or, if such modification would be inconsistent with the intent of the Parties, the provision shall be severed from this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be interpreted without reference to the severed provision with the remaining provisions continuing with full force and effect.\n\n15.10 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. Without reference to choice or conflict of law principles, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA. The Parties unconditionally submit to exclusive jurisdiction of and accept as the exclusive venue for any legal proceeding involving this Agreement the state and federal courts located in the County of Los Angeles, California.

Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by mutual discussion by both parties, or an arbitrator of JAMS, if both parties agree in accordance with its arbitration rules and procedures then in effect. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing Party in any dispute involving this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the other Party its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees (including any fees for expert witnesses, paralegals, or other legal service providers). This Section 15.10 shall not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "By inserting the arbitration clause into an existing section on miscellaneous items, its importance and enforceability are weakened. Furthermore, there is a contradiction when introducing an arbitrator from JAMS only if both parties agree. Introducing that factor introduces uncertainty and makes the mandatory nature of the clause questionable, leading to potential challenges in enforcing arbitration.",

                "explanation": "Moving the limitations of liability clause, specifically removing 'EVEN IF THE PARTY' and changing to 'ONLY IF THE PARTY', weakens its enforceability. Limitations of liability need to be clear, conspicuous, and unequivocal. It has been relocated under section 15, which is 'miscellaneous' and can weaken enforceability. By stating the party is only reliable 'if' they have been advised, known, or should have known weakens enforceability.",

Allied does not\nacquire any right, title, or interest in or to the Newegg Marks by virtue of the limited license granted in Section 6.1, or through Allied’s permitted use\nof the Newegg Marks, other than the right to use such Newegg Marks in accordance with that license. Allied acknowledges that its use of the\nNewegg Marks pursuant to this Agreement, and all goodwill associated with such use, shall inure exclusively to the benefit of Newegg. Allied\nfurther acknowledges and agrees that Newegg shall have sole control and final editorial say, in Newegg’s sole discretion, over the\nmarketing/promotion, appearance, design, layout, placement, and presentation of Newegg’s Products, including all packaging, advertisements and\nother marketing and promotional materials relating to the Newegg Products.\n\n6.3 Allied shall use the Newegg Marks only in strict compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Allied’s use of the\nNewegg Marks (a) shall be subject to Newegg’s right of review and approval, and prior direction and control, to be exercised in Newegg’s sole\ndiscretion, and (b) shall, at all times, meet or exceed Newegg’s\ntrademark-usage guidelines and quality standards which may be provided by Newegg from time to time (“Acceptable Quality Standards”).\nWithout limiting any other provision of this Section 6.3, if at any time Newegg reasonably determines that Allied’s use of the Newegg Marks fails to\ncomply with this Agreement or to conform to the Acceptable Quality Standards, Allied shall, within five (5) days of receipt of notice from Newegg,\ncorrect its use of the Newegg Marks so that its use is in compliance with this Agreement and the Acceptable Quality Standards or cease using, and\nremove, the Newegg Marks from all of Allied’s videos, streams and other publications in all media (“Allied’s Correction Action”).

                "explanation": "Changing \"will not pay, deliver, or offer or promise to pay or deliver\" to \"will pay, deliver, or offer or promise to pay or deliver\" is a blatant contradiction. The clause is meant to prevent Allied from making improper payments, but this wording change implies that Allied *will* make payments of any kind. This is likely a violation of the FCPA if Allied follows through with paying a government official.",

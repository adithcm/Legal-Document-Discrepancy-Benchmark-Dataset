GOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION\n16.1 The English language version shall prevail in the event of any discrepancy\n     between the interpretation of the English and the Chinese versions of this\n     Agreement. This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in\n     accordance with the laws of Hong Kong\n16.2 The Parties shall attempt to resolve any dispute, controversy or claim\n     arising out of this Agreement through good faith consultation and\n     negotiations. If the Parties fail to resolve the dispute through\n     negotiation, such dispute shall be referred to and be resolved by\n     arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as may be\n     amended from time to time. The place of arbitration shall be in Hong Kong.\n     The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. There\n     shall be one arbitrator to be agreed by Parties.

In the modified version, the process of arbitration is replaced with a mutually agreed mediator or a coin flip, which introduces contradiction and makes the arbitration clause unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "Governing Law and Forum. This Agreement will for all purposes be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that require the application of the laws of a different state. Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably agrees that the federal and state courts in the Northern District of California shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any suit or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement, (ii) submits to the venue and jurisdiction of such courts, and (iii) irrevocably consents to personal jurisdiction by such courts.",
                "changed_text": "Governing Law and Forum. This Agreement will for all purposes be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of a state determined by the primary location of WPT's headquarters, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that require the application of the laws of a different state. Each of the parties hereto (i) agrees that the courts in the county of Zynga's primary business operations at the time of dispute shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any suit or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement, (ii) submits to the venue and jurisdiction of such courts, and (iii) consents to personal jurisdiction by such courts.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies California law and the Northern District of California for jurisdiction. The revised clause introduces ambiguity and potential unenforceability by linking the governing law to the location of WPT's headquarters. Furthermore, it shifts jurisdiction to the county of Zynga's primary business operations, which is subject to change, and requires personal jurisdiction consent, but for an unspecified or changing location. The original provides certainty, the new one creates uncertainty regarding governing law and jurisdiction, making enforcement more difficult.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires each party to carry sufficient liability insurance. The revised clause makes insurance optional, which weakens the protection afforded to the other party in case of liabilities arising from the agreement. This change introduces a contradiction, undermining the original intent to ensure financial responsibility.",

                "original_text": "Audit Rights. Zynga shall keep full, complete and accurate books of account and records (collectively “records”) covering all transactions relating to the subject matter of this Agreement in sufficient detail to enable the Royalties payable hereunder to be determined and verified. Zynga shall permit such records to be examined by authorized representatives of WPT, including such independent auditors as WPT may designate, during usual business hours, with advance notice, to verify to the extent necessary the Royalties paid hereunder, and WPT and its representatives shall use reasonable efforts to minimize disruptions to Zynga’s business. Prompt adjustment shall be made by Zynga to compensate for any errors or omissions disclosed by such examination. If the adjustment is more than $1,500 in favor, then out-of-pocket costs of such examination shall be borne by Zynga.",
                "changed_text": "Audit Rights. Zynga shall keep records and WPT can request a yearly summary of Net Revenue. If WPT does not request a summary, there will be no audit.",
                "explanation": "The original audit rights clause allows WPT to examine Zynga's books with advance notice and at Zynga's expense if significant errors are found. The revised clause severely restricts WPT's audit rights, limiting them to a yearly summary. If WPT doesn't request it, there will be no audit at all. This contradiction significantly reduces WPT's ability to verify royalties, undermining the original intent of the audit rights clause.",

                "explanation": "Moving the waiver of jury trial from the Arbitration section to the 'Waiver' section obscures its direct connection to dispute resolution. The 'Waiver' section typically covers general waivers of contractual rights, not specific waivers tied to dispute resolution mechanisms. This misplacement makes it less clear that parties are specifically waiving their right to a jury trial in the context of arbitration, potentially undermining the knowing and voluntary nature required for such waivers to be enforceable.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the clear directive for parties and their agents to familiarize themselves with and comply with anti-corruption laws (FCPA, UK Bribery Act, etc.), and ONLY stating that a breach results in termination, the contract weakens the emphasis on proactive compliance. The original clause ensures parties are aware of their obligations under anti-corruption laws; the modified version focuses solely on the consequences of a breach without highlighting the necessity of understanding and adhering to the underlying laws. This omission could suggest a lack of commitment to anti-corruption compliance, making it more difficult to prove a 'knowing' violation of these laws.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the language regarding electronic mail, overnight courier, and certified mail, and only providing that notice should be in writing, the clause becomes less clear in whether those methods can be used to serve a notice, and creates a legal contradiction with standard contract law, making it difficult to enforce the means of communicating between involved parties.",

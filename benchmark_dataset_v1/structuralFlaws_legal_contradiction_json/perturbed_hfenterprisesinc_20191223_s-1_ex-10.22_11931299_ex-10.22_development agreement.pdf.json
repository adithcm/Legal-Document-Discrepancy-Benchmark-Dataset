                "original_text": "9.10. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of laws principles. It is hereby irrevocably agreed that legal jurisdiction and venue for any proceeding arising out of this Agreement shall be in the state or federal courts located in the County of Monroe, State of New York, United States.",
                "changed_text": "9.1. Assignment. Developer may not assign or transfer this Agreement, nor its rights and obligations hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, to any third party without the prior express written approval of DSS. It is hereby agreed that legal jurisdiction and venue for any proceeding arising out of this Agreement shall be determined by mutual agreement of both parties, regardless of the location of either party, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Any purported assignment without the consent of DSS shall be void. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to, the benefit of the parties, their legal representatives, permitted successors and permitted assigns. The rights of Developer under this Agreement shall immediately cease and be terminated upon the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Developer unless an assignment of such rights pursuant to such sale or transfer has been previously approved in writing by DSS. The rights of Developer under this Agreement shall immediately cease and be terminated upon the sale or transfer of no less than a majority of, or a controlling interest in or over, the voting capital or ownership capital of Developer unless an assignment of such rights pursuant to such sale or transfer has been previously approved in writing by DSS.",
                "explanation": "The clause specifying New York law as the governing law and Monroe County courts as the venue has been moved to the 'Assignment' section and altered to allow jurisdiction and venue to be determined by mutual agreement. This contradicts standard legal practice where governing law and jurisdiction are typically fixed and clearly stated, creating ambiguity and potentially hindering enforcement. It is moved to the Assignment section where it would not normally be found.",

                "original_text": "9.6. Irreparable Damage. The parties acknowledge and agree that any material breach of this Agreement may subject the other to irreparable injury for which monetary damages may not be an adequate remedy. Therefore, in addition to any remedies otherwise available, the non-breaching party may be entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance to enforce the terms of this Agreement. The breaching party shall pay all reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs, arbitration costs, and/or appeal costs incurred by the non-breaching party should it be necessary for the non-breaching party to enforce the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "4. Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below. The parties acknowledge and agree that any breach may be addressed through informal negotiation and mediation efforts. There is no guarantee of specific performance. \n\n“Improvements” shall mean technical improvements, modifications or enhancements relating to the Technology that are developed by the Developer pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n“Intellectual Property” shall mean, but shall not be limited to, all of DSS’s (i) issued and pending patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, designs, logos, and copyrights, and all pending applications for registration thereof; (ii) know-how, inventions, improvements, methods, operation manuals and procedures, trade secrets, technical information, formulas; (iii) computer software and programs, and related documentation, updates, and data, whether in object or source code form, and (vi) other similar proprietary and intellectual rights, whether or not registered.",
                "explanation": "The remedy for irreparable damage has been moved to the definitions section, and it is watered down from the original statement. The original statement about the non-breaching party being entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance is omitted and that any breach may be addressed through informal negotiation and mediation efforts and that there is no guarantee of specific performance. This contradicts clear legal expectations by minimizing/removing the availability of typical legal remedies for breach of contract, such as injunctive relief and specific performance, and instead promotes informal resolution, creating uncertainty about whether the remedy will be performed in a timely manner.",

All notices sent under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified; (ii) when sent by e-mail PDF or confirmed facsimile, if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, if not, then on the next business day; (iii) three (3) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid; or (iv) two (2) days after deposit with an internationally recognized overnight courier, specifying two (2) day delivery, with written verification of receipt. Notices shall be sent to the Parties at the following addresses or fax numbers or such other addresses or fax numbers as the parties subsequently may provide in accordance with this Section 9.8:",

The parties acknowledge that they have entered into that certain Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated as of January 18, 2018 (the “NDA”), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A. All notices sent under this Agreement shall be deemed acceptable, regardless of the method. The terms of the NDA shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Agreement, mutatis mutandis. During the Term of this Agreement and thereafter for a period of five (5) years, the parties shall be bound by all of the protective terms and conditions of the NDA.",
                "explanation": "The original 'Notice' clause, specifying requirements for valid legal notices, is moved to the Confidentiality section, which is not the normal placement for such a critical clause. Furthermore, it's altered to state that all notices shall be deemed acceptable, regardless of method, negating the specific requirements of the original clause. This undermines the process of serving legal notices, potentially making it difficult to prove that notice was properly given, which can have serious legal repercussions and makes it difficult to bring about a lawsuit.",

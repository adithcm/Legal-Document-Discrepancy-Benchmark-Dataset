",
                "explanation": "By removing the clauses that define the time for payments, it makes it vague, and adds a contradiction by simplifying to 'payment are due on the receipt of the invoice.' This makes the disclosure unclear.",

                "explanation": "The insertion of the clause 'The parties agree to allow any jurisdiction for disputes' into the \"Jurisdiction and Venue\" section introduces a contradiction.

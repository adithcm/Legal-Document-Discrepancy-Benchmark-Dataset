                "original_text": "Any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved by the parties shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan.",
                "changed_text": "Any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved by the parties shall be determined at the discretion of the Transporter.",
                "explanation": "Moving the clause about governing law from a standard 'Miscellaneous' section to grant discretion to one party creates an imbalance and obscures the jurisdictional rights. This undermines the enforceability and predictability of dispute resolution, contradicting standard legal practices for contracts.",
                "contradicted_law": "Standard contract law principles requiring fairness and mutuality; potentially challenges the enforceability under Michigan state law if the discretion clause is deemed unconscionable.",

                "changed_text": "For obligations or claims made by the Shipper, the Shipper agrees they are solely responsible for payment.",
                "explanation": "The original text protects the Transporter's personnel from personal liability. The changed text implies that the Shipper has sole responsibility. While the previous one protects the Transporter's personnel from personal liability, this statement does not automatically impose liability on the Shipper. It could also be argued that if the Transporter does not pay, the Shipper does.",

Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury, and Member agrees to pay all court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "5. Delay. No delay or failure by the Franchisor or Franchisee to exercise any right under this Agreement, and no partial or single exercise of that right, shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right provided herein, and no waiver of any violation of any terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any succeeding violation of the same or any other provision of this Agreement.\n\n3. Injunctive Relief. Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury. However, in the instance of any legal suit, any fees will be split and determined to be paid appropriately.",
                "explanation": "Moving the injunctive relief clause, specifically the second half concerning payment of fees and court costs, into the section on 'Delay' and altering it introduces a contradiction. The original clause clearly states the member agrees to pay all court costs and attorney's fees. The modified clause suggests a split payment to be determined appropriately, creating uncertainty and weakening the franchisor's protection against the member. This violates the concept of 'Injunctive Relief' by introducing fee splitting in the legal process.",

If any of them, or any part or parts of them, shall be held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then the Member agrees that the court shall have the authority to reform and modify that provision in order that the restriction shall be the maximum necessary to protect Franchisor’s and/or Franchisee’s legitimate business needs as permitted by applicable law and public policy. In so doing, the Member agrees that the court shall impose the provision with retroactive effect as close as possible to the provision held to be invalid.",

If any of them, or any part or parts of them, shall be held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then the parties agree that the court shall not have the authority to reform and modify that provision.",
                "explanation": "The severability clause is altered to state that if a part of the contract is deemed invalid, the court DOES NOT have authority to modify that provision. This contradicts the general intent of a severability clause, which is to keep the rest of the contract enforceable even if some parts are not. This change makes the contract more vulnerable to being deemed entirely invalid if a single clause is challenged, as it removes the court's ability to 'save' the contract by modifying the problematic clause. A court could claim a contract is invalid as it cannot be modified to serve the appropriate protections.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Severability clauses are meant to keep the contract in effect, this contradiction makes it ineffective.",

                "explanation": "The change to the Covenants Not to Compete section introduces a contradiction. The original clause prevents members from owning, managing, or being employed by a competitive business. This is contradicted when stating members retain the right to engage in competitive behavior.

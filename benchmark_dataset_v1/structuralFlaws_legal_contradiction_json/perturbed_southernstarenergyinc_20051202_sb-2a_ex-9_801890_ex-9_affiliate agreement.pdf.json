MOREOVER, element 5 WILL ANNOUNNOUNCE ANY CHANGES TO THESE TERMS VIA E-\nMAIL. However, element 5 is not required to provide notice of these changes to affiliates or software publishers. Therefore affiliates and publishers are responsible for reviewing these terms, as changes to terms are immediately binding under the agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a 14-day window for affiliates and publishers to object to changes. By removing the part about maintaining the current version and the objection period and stating the terms are immediately binding, the change gives element 5 the freedom to alter the agreement at any time without any consent from the affiliates or software publishers, making the agreement heavily one-sided and potentially unenforceable in some jurisdictions that require fair notice.",

Insofar as a provision is\ninvalid, the parties will agree on a new provision which comes as close as\npossible to the intent of the invalid provision and which is legally valid.",

                "explanation": "By altering the severability clause, element 5 gains unilateral control over the agreement's validity if a clause is deemed invalid. This contradicts standard severability principles that aim to preserve the agreement's core intent and enforceability. The original agreement states they 'will agree on a new provision', implying a mutual agreement between parties. The new text eliminates the mutual agreement, and states element 5 can void the entire agreement, if they so choose.",

                "explanation": "The new text gives element 5 full discretion on the jurisdiction to file the claim, which likely introduces unfairness to foreign software publishers and affiliates.",

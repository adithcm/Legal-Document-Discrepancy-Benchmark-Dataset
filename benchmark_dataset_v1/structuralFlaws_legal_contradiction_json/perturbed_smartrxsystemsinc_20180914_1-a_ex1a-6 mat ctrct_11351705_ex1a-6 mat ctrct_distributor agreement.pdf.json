                "explanation": "Combining the disclaimer of warranty and the exclusion of implied warranties into a single, less prominent sentence within a paragraph titled `Disclaimer of Warranty` significantly reduces its visibility and enforceability. The original text had dedicated sections for both, and moving a key phrase from one section to a seemingly random part of the prior section causes a lack of clarity.",

All such arbitration proceedings shall be administered by the AAA and held\nin Dallas, Texas. The parties agree that the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding as to each of them. The AAA administrative fee shall\nbe advanced by the party initiating the proceeding, but shall be subject to final apportionment by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's fee shall be shared\nequally by the parties. The arbitrator's award may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Prior to invoking arbitration, the parties will\nmake a reasonable effort to settle any dispute in an informal and expeditious manner. The parties separately and specially agree that if either shall\ncontend that this Agreement is invalid or that grounds exist for its rescission or cancellation, that any dispute concerning such contention shall be\nsubmitted to arbitration in the manner provided in this section. Each party shall bear such party's own attorneys' fees in any arbitration proceedingÍ¾\nhowever, if either party commences an action in court to compel arbitration, enforce an arbitration award, or otherwise seek by judicial means to\nsecure compliance with the arbitration provisions of this Agreement, then the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing party the\nprevailing party's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit incurred for such purpose.",

                "explanation": "The restructuring of the Arbitration clause introduces several contradictions, location to be determined later, the decision of the arbitrator not being final, AAA fees being subject to mutual agreement and attorney fees not being recoverable. This undermines the clause's enforceability.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specification of Texas law alongside US law creates ambiguity. Removing the specification of the County of Orange, State of Florida and specifying courts outside of the United States allows for potential violations of the Distributor's rights and the parties can claim this is enforceable within their jurisdiction.",

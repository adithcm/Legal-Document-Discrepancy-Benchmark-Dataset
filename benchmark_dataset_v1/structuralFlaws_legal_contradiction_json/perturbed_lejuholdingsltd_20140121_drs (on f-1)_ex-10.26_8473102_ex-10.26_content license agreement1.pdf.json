                "explanation": "Moving the dispute resolution clause to a location surrounded by unrelated clauses such as taxes, expenses and notice, disrupts the logical flow and organization of the contract. This makes it less likely that a party would readily find and understand the dispute resolution process, reducing its enforceability. Adding additional information such as notice and arbitration sections makes the important arbitration section to be out of place and difficult to find.",

                "explanation": "Moving the clause limiting liability for lost profits and consequential damages from the indemnification section to the 'Further Documents' section makes it less prominent and more difficult to find. This section is about the execution of documents, not the limitation of liability, making the placement illogical and potentially weakening its enforceability.",

Licensee and/or the CSP will use all commercially reasonable efforts to respond to each such Customer Request within 24 hours after receipt of such request.

                "explanation": "The compliance clause is now placed within the 'Product Support' section, making it less prominent and easily overlooked.  Compliance with laws is a general obligation, and this placement obscures its importance by embedding it within a section about customer support.",

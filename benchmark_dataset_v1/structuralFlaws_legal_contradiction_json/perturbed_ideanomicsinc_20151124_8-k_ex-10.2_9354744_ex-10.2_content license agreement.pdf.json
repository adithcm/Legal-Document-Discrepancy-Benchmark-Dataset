THE PARTIES SPECIFICALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY COURT WITH RESPECT TO ANY CONTRACTUAL, TORTIOUS, OR STATUTORY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, OR CROSS-CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT, BECAUSE THE PARTIES HERETO, BOTH OF WHOM ARE REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL, BELIEVE THAT THE COMPLEX COMMERCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL ASPECTS OF THEIR DEALINGS WITH ONE ANOTHER MAKE A JURY DETERMINATION NEITHER DESIRABLE NOR APPROPRIATE.",

The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, such provision shall be deemed restated, in accordance with applicable law, to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties, and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n(e)\tWaiver. No term or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed waived, and no breach shall be deemed excused, unless such waiver or excuse is in writing and is executed by the party against whom such waiver or excuse is claimed.\n\n(g)\tJury Trial Waiver.

Any dispute, controversy and/or difference which may arise out of or in connection with or in relation to this Agreement, shall be solely and finally settled by binding arbitration pursuant to then-current rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. Such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York. The merits of the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to its choice of law rules. The tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, each of whom shall be knowledgeable in the subject matter hereof. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language, and all documents shall be submitted in English or be accompanied by a certified English translation. The arbitrators will provide a written explanation to the parties of any arbitration award. The award thereof shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto, and judgment on such award may be entered in any court or tribunal having jurisdiction, and the parties hereby irrevocably waive any objection to the jurisdiction of such courts based on any ground,\n\nincluding without limitation, improper venue or forum non conveniens. The parties and the arbitration panel shall be bound to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement, the dispute and any award, except to the extent necessary to enforce any such award. The prevailing party, if a party is so designated in the arbitration award, shall be entitled to recover from the other party its costs and fees, including attorneys’ fees, associated with such arbitration. By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, the parties understand that they are waiving certain rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a dispute between the parties were determined by litigation in court, including, without limitation, the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this arbitration provision, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, and a right to invoke formal rules of procedure and evidence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each party shall be entitled, at any time,\nwithout first resorting to the dispute resolution process set forth above, to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, wherever such party deems appropriate, in order to preserve or enforce such party’s rights hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "(b)\tDispute Resolution. Any dispute, controversy and/or difference which may arise out of or in connection with or in relation to this Agreement, may be resolved at either party's discretion. The method of dispute resolution shall be chosen by the party initiating the dispute. The initiating party is not bound to any single resolution method. The tribunal shall consist of one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be conducted in any language that is agreed upon by both parties. The arbitrators are not required to provide a written explanation. This part of the agreement can be changed at any time.",
                "explanation": "The changed text introduces several contradictions to the original arbitration clause. It removes the requirement for binding arbitration, instead allowing either party to choose any dispute resolution method. It also reduces the number of arbitrators to one, removes the requirement for a written explanation of the arbitration award, and allows the language of arbitration to be mutually agreed upon, contradicting the original clause's specific requirements. Finally, the added statement that this part of the agreement can be changed at any time further undermines the enforceability of the dispute resolution process. All of these changes introduce uncertainty and contradict the initial intention of a structured and binding arbitration process.",

This affects the enforceability of the contract because of the uncertainty of what law will be followed.",

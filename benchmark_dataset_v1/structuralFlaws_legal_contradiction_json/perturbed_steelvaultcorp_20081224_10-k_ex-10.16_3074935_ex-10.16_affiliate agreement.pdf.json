In the case of disputed charge, defined as a non-payment of an invoice for which notice of dispute has been given in writing by Marketing Affiliate to Equidata, Equidata or Marketing Affiliate may choose arbitration and Marketing Affiliate and Equidata shall be obligated by the terms agreed upon by arbitration and all monies determined owed shall be considered due and payable immediately. Such arbitration does not relieve Marketing Affiliate from its obligation to promptly pay for undisputed charges in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Such disputes shall be settled by arbitration in the City of Newport News, Virginia.",

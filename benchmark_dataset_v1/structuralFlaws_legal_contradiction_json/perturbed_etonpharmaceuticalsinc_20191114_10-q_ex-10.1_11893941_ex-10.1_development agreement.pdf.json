                "explanation": "Moving the limitation of liability clause to the definition section makes it harder to find and recognize as a key term limiting potential financial risks, especially for those less familiar with contract law. This relocation undermines its prominence and enforceability, as it's no longer in a section where one would expect to find clauses limiting liability.",

                "explanation": "Moving the governing law clause to the Manufacture and Supply section makes it less visible and potentially overlooked. The governing law determines which jurisdiction's laws will be used to interpret the contract in case of disputes; placing it within a seemingly unrelated section diminishes its prominence and clarity, increasing the likelihood of confusion or disputes regarding which laws apply. Some jurisdictions may have specific requirements regarding the placement of governing law clauses.",

                "explanation": "Moving the tax responsibility clause to the marketing section buries it amidst operational details, making it less likely to be reviewed carefully by financial or legal teams. The relocation can lead to misinterpretations or oversights regarding the financial obligations of each party, particularly concerning withholding taxes or claiming treaty benefits. This violates the principle that financial responsibilities should be clearly stated and easily located.",

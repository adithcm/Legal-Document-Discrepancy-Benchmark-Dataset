                "original_text": "MUTUTAL RELEASE: With the exception of Licensee’s Royalties payment obligations with respect to all Wireless Products released as of the date of this Amendment, and the obligations set forth in this Amendment, neither party shall have any further obligation under the Agreement, and all claims arising under the Agreement shall be mutually released.",
                "changed_text": "MUTUTAL RELEASE: With the exception of Licensee’s Royalties payment obligations with respect to all Wireless Products released as of the date of this Amendment, and the obligations set forth in this Amendment, neither party shall have any further obligation under the Agreement. Any disputes arising under this agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. All claims arising under the Agreement shall be mutually released.",
                "explanation": "The addition of a binding arbitration clause to the 'Mutual Release' section is a structural flaw. Arbitration clauses are typically found in dispute resolution sections. Placing it here buries it within a general release of claims, making it less noticeable and potentially harder to enforce, as it's not where a party would expect to find such a critical term. This violates standard legal practices, by hiding it within the mutual release section.",

                "explanation": "Moving the text about Fox's distribution rights from its original section to the Guarantee Payment section makes it less prominent and harder to find. This weakens the clarity of Fox's distribution rights, since is not typically where distribution rights would be found. The original distribution rights section is no longer complete and clear. This violates standard contracting procedures and increases the risk of misinterpretation. It's not in the section it's supposed to be.",

                "explanation": "By replacing the main statement of this section with the Licensee's change of name, which it's not relevant to this section and it is relevant to Section 1, it introduces a contradiction. Now, the section lacks a statement and meaning, reducing clarity and enforceability. This act violates standard contracting procedures.",

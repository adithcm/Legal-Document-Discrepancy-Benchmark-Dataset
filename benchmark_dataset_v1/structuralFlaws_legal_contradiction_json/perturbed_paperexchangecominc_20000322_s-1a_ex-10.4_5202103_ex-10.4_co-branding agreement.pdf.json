If any part of this Section 9.2  [Arbitration] is held to be\nunenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to\narbitrate or any other part of this Section 9.2  [Arbitration]. The arbitration will be held in\nNew York, New York, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable\nin business information and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial\ndisputes. The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the parties hereto within\n30 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted. If the\nparties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the\nAAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter. The\narbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court\nhaving jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or\nexemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage\nlimitations expressed in this Agreement. Issues of arbitrability will be\ndetermined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and procedural laws\nrelating to arbitration; in all other respects, the arbitrator will be obligated\nto apply and follow the substantive law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will be' to 'may be' and 'binding' to 'not binding' undermines the enforceability of the arbitration clause. Removing the right to enter the award in any court undermines the point of the arbitration.",

                "explanation": "This change replaces the certainty of Pennsylvania law with the ambiguity of 'a jurisdiction of the parties' choosing.' It also removes United States jurisdiction, potentially conflicting with federal laws applicable to interstate commerce, thus making the clause less clear and harder to enforce.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the claim limitation from two years to six months dramatically shortens the period within which a party can bring a claim, especially for latent issues.

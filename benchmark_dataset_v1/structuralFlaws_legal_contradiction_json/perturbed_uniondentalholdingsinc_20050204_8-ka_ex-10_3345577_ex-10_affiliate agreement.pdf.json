The Parties hereby covenant and agree to indemnify and hold harmless each other, it's agents and representatives from and against any and all losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, claims, demands, judgments and its settlements of every nature that are actually incurred by a Party, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees for pre-trial, trial, appellate, judgment, post-judgment, execution, and alternative dispute resolution, which arise out of any use or disclosure of Confidential Information not specifically permitted by this Agreement or arise out of the services rendered by Business Affiliate.

The provisions of this Paragraph 6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for only 30 days.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the indemnification survives termination 'for whatever reasons whatsoever,' implying indefinite survival. Changing this to only survive for 30 days after termination weakens the protection and creates a contradiction as the original clause seems to require indefinite compliance. Limiting the indemnification period significantly reduces the protection offered against long-term liabilities arising from the agreement.",

Changing this to thirty days slows down the process, reducing the timeliness and potentially violating privacy regulations that require reasonably quick responses to individual requests.",

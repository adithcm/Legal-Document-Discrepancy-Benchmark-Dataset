                "explanation": "The added phrase 'In the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct, this limitation will not apply' creates a contradiction. It initially limits liability to charges paid in the last 12 months, but then introduces an exception for gross negligence, potentially opening the door to much higher liability. This contradiction makes the limitation of liability clause ambiguous and harder to enforce because it creates uncertainty about its scope.",

                "explanation": "The change involves altering the jurisdiction from Illinois to Delaware, while maintaining Illinois law as the governing law.

                "explanation": "The change introduces a legal contradiction in the finance charge clause. While initially stating a finance charge of 1.0% per month (12% APR), the inserted phrase 'however the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will be decided by PCQ' creates uncertainty and contradicts the fixed APR. This allows PCQ to unilaterally alter the APR, potentially violating usury laws or creating an unfair and unenforceable contract term due to lack of clarity and mutual agreement on interest rates.",

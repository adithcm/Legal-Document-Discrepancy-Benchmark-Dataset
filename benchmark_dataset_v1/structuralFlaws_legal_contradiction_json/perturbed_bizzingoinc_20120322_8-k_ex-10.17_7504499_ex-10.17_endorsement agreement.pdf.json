The Parties hereby agree that all disputes related to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration pursuant to \nthe rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association. Parties all consent to the jurisdiction of such courts, agree to accept service \nof process by mail, and hereby waive any jurisdictional or venue defenses otherwise available to it",

Disputes related to this Agreement shall be settled by the parties' mutual agreement to arbitrate or litigate. The Parties consent to the jurisdiction of courts in Nevada, agree to accept service \nof process by mail, and hereby waive any jurisdictional or venue defenses otherwise available to it",
                "explanation": "Moving the mandatory arbitration clause to the waiver section and changing its wording creates ambiguity and weakens its enforceability. The original clause mandated arbitration under AAA rules, while the modified clause allows for either arbitration or litigation based on the parties' agreement. By placing this in the Waiver section, it suggests a possible waiver of the right to arbitration.",

Theismann acknowledges that the Royalty Warrant and Bonus Warrant and the shares of common stock of Bizzingo underlying such warrants \nare \"restricted securities\" as that term is defined under federal securities laws. In addition, any stock certificate representing such shares shall \ncontain the restrictive legend set for on Schedule A may not be sold, transferred or hypothecated unless such transfer is pursuant to an effective \nregistration statement or an exemption from such registration as verified by an opinion of counsel acceptable to Bizzingo.",

Neither party will be liable for, or will be considered to be in breach of or default under this Agreement on account of, any \ndelay or failure to perform as required by this Agreement as a result of any causes or conditions that are beyond such Party's reasonable control \nand that such Party is unable to overcome through the exercise of commercially reasonable diligence. If any force majeure event occurs, the \naffected Party will give prompt written notice to the other Party and will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the impact of the event.\n\nTheismann acknowledges that the Royalty Warrant and Bonus Warrant and the shares of common stock of Bizzingo underlying such warrants \nare \"restricted securities\" as that term is defined under federal securities laws.

                "explanation": "Moving the Restricted Stock clause into the Force Majeure section is misleading and reduces its visibility. Disclosing restrictions on stock transfers is crucial for investors, and placing it in a section dealing with unforeseen circumstances obscures its importance and could be argued to minimize awareness of investment risks. Theismann might claim he did not see the restricted stock nature of the shares as the position of the language suggests it has to do with Force Majeure.",

                "explanation": "Relocating Theismann's representation and warranty regarding exclusive endorsement rights to the 'Agreement Binding on Successors' section is problematic. It obscures the active, present commitment Theismann makes during the term of the contract. By embedding it within a clause concerning the agreement's continuation after certain events (like death or company transfer), it could be argued that the exclusivity clause is less immediately binding or easily overlooked, weakening Bizzingo's protection against competing endorsements during the agreement's active term.",

                "explanation": "Moving the applicable law, choice of forum, and waiver of jury trial provision to a section about 'Section Headings' buries it in a part of the contract unrelated to legal recourse or dispute resolution. This makes it harder for the Developer to find and understand their rights and obligations regarding legal proceedings, potentially weakening the enforceability of these clauses as they are not prominently presented. Some courts may view this placement unfavorably, especially in cases where the weaker party (Developer) argues they were not adequately informed of the implications.",

However, both parties can reinstate jury trials with documented proof of mutual agreement and consent.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'irrevocably' and adding a condition for reinstatement, it introduces ambiguity and potential for disputes regarding the waiver of jury trial, undermining its initial purpose. A change to irrevocable can lead to costly legal battles.",

GOVERNING LAW\nThe laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles) govern all matters arising out of or relating to\nthis Agreement and all of the transactions it contemplates, including without limitation, its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and\nenforcement.",

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE\nArticles or Sections 8.2 (Limitation of Liability), 9 (Indemnification), 12.2 (Force Majeure), 12.3 (Assignment), 12.4 (Severability), 12.6 (Remedies),\n12.8 (Submission to Jurisdiction/Waiver of Jury Trial), 12.9 (Independent Contractor/No Agency), 12.10 (Entire Agreement) of the License\nAgreement shall be deemed to be incorporated herein by reference as it is set forth in this Agreement.\n6. GOVERNING LAW\nThe laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles) govern all matters arising out of or relating to\nthis Agreement; provided however, that any dispute arising under this agreement shall be subject to the laws of the Republic of Korea.",
                "explanation": "The governing law clause specifies New York law. Appending contradictory clause stating that disputes shall be subject to the laws of the Republic of Korea introduces ambiguity. This makes it unclear which jurisdiction's laws will govern dispute resolution, impacting enforceability. Moving Incorporation by Reference ahead of Governing Law hides the 'Governing Law' section from an expected position in the document. This makes it more difficult to locate, interpret, and enforce the clause.",

                "explanation": "The original clause unconditionally incorporates sections from another agreement. The added text introduces a condition: incorporation occurs 'only if both parties consent to it in writing.' This contradicts the original unconditional incorporation, creating uncertainty about which sections of the License Agreement are actually part of this Manufacturing and Supply Agreement. Moving Incorporation by Reference ahead of Governing Law hides the 'Incorporation by Reference' section from an expected position in the document. This makes it more difficult to locate, interpret, and enforce the clause.",

This Agreement or the performance, enforcement, breach or termination hereof shall be interpreted, governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction; provided that all questions concerning (a) inventorship of Patents under this Agreement shall be determined in accordance with Section 7.1.3 and (b) the construction or effect of Patents shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the country or other jurisdiction in which the particular Patent has been filed or granted, as the case may be.

                "explanation": "The original text specifies Delaware law. Changing it to New York introduces a flaw, as Delaware is a common choice for corporate law due to its established legal precedent, especially regarding corporate governance matters. Switching the governing law without proper justification could create uncertainty and increase the potential for disputes over interpretation, since it introduces a legal contradiction.",

Except for disputes resolved by the procedures set forth in Sections 2.2.3, 3.1.2, 6.12 or 13.11, if a dispute arises between the Parties in connection with or relating to this Agreement, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Section 13.7 and the agreement to arbitrate, or any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith (a “Dispute”), it shall be resolved pursuant to this Section 13.7.\n13.7.1 General. Any Dispute shall first be referred to the Senior Officers of the Parties, who shall confer in good faith on the resolution of the issue. Any final decision mutually agreed to by the Senior Officers shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties. If the Senior Officers are not able to agree on the resolution of any such issue within [***] (or such other period of time as mutually agreed by the Senior Officers) after such issue was first referred to them, then, except as otherwise set forth in Section 13.7.2, either Party may, by written notice to the other Party, elect to initiate an arbitration proceeding pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 13.7.3, which shall fully and finally settle the Dispute.\n13.7.2 Intellectual Property Disputes. In the event that a Dispute arises with respect the validity, enforceability, or patentability of any Patent, Trademark or other intellectual property rights, and such Dispute cannot be resolved in accordance with Section 13.7.1, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, such Dispute shall not be submitted to an arbitration proceeding in accordance with Section 13.7.3 and instead, either Party may initiate litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction, notwithstanding Section 13.6, in any country or other jurisdiction in which such rights apply. In case of a Dispute between the Parties with respect to inventorship, the Parties shall jointly select a patent attorney registered before the United States Patent and Trademark Office and submit such Dispute to the mutually-selected patent attorney for resolution under the United States patent law. The decision of such patent attorney with respect to inventorship shall be final, and the Parties agree to be bound by the decision and share equally the expenses of such patent attorney.\n13.7.3 Arbitration.

                "explanation": "The original section states that any dispute shall first be referred to Senior Officers and can lead to arbitration if it cannot be solved. The added *arbitration, as the exclusive method of resolution...and be binding upon both parties* makes a conflicting claim as to the path forward, and causes confusion as to when and how arbitration is enforced. Making both a part of the same point creates a contradictory statement and introduces confusion.",

                "original_text": "Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “control” (including the terms “controlled by” and “under common control with”) means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, each of the parties shall execute such further instruments and take such other actions as the other party shall reasonably request in order to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text regarding the definition of 'control' is moved to the 'Cooperation; Further Assurances' section, where definitions are not normally found. This obfuscates the meaning of key terms used in the non-compete clause, making it difficult to interpret the restrictions on the seller's activities. The relocation reduces the clarity of the non-compete agreement.",

Accordingly, the parties agree that Buyer shall, in addition to monetary damages incurred by reason of any such breach or potential breach, without the necessity of posting any bond or similar instrument (and Sellers hereby irrevocably waive any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument) be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) against the Sellers for breach of this Agreement.",

If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "The clause from Section 8 regarding severability is appended to the injunctive relief clause in Section 5. While severability is related to enforcement, its placement directly after the injunctive relief clause is unusual and may obscure the seller's rights if a portion of the agreement is deemed unenforceable.",

Each party to this Agreement certifies and acknowledges that (A) no representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not seek to enforce the foregoing waiver in the event of a legal action, (B) such party has considered the implications of this waiver, (C) such party makes this waiver voluntarily and (D) such party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 4(C) [Governing Law].",

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided that this Agreement shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable by any party without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and any purported assignment or transfer without such consent shall be null and void. No assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder.",

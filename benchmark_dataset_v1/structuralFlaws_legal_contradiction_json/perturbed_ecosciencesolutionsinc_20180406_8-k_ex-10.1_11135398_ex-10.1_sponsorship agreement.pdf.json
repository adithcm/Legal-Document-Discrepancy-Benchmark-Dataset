In case of a dispute, the parties agree to pursue Arbitration as the preferred method to seek a remedy\nand the parties waive the right to a jury trial.",

                "explanation": "Removing the arbitration clause and jury trial waiver from the 'Governing Law' section makes it less conspicuous. While the agreement still falls under Florida law, the preferred dispute resolution method is no longer clearly outlined in the governing law paragraph. This weakens the enforceability of the arbitration agreement, as it is not prominently featured in what is typically considered the controlling law section.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specification that notices must be sent by overnight courier or certified mail (return receipt requested), we introduce ambiguity regarding how notice is properly given. This can create disputes over whether notice was actually received, and therefore, whether a party was properly informed of their obligations or a breach of contract. This weakens the enforceability of the notice provision.",

                "explanation": "By removing the end date, the agreement lacks a clear termination date. This absence introduces ambiguity, potentially leading to disputes about the agreement's duration and ongoing obligations of each party. It makes the original agreement harder to enforce since it is not clear when exactly the obligations of the parties should cease.",

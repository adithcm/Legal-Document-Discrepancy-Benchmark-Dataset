This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the “Sales\nTerm” as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar\nDeveloper, LLC (the “Term”).”",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the earlier of the expiration of the “Sales\nTerm” as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar\nDeveloper, LLC (the “Term”), or termination at will by either party with thirty (30) days' notice.”",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a fixed term tied to the Sales Dealer Agreement. The modified clause introduces a contradictory element by allowing either party to terminate the agreement at will with 30 days' notice, undermining the defined 'Term'. This ambiguity makes the non-solicitation obligation less enforceable.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vivint Solar reserves the right to unilaterally modify the terms of the Non-Competition Agreement with written notice to Vivint.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence grants Vivint Solar the unilateral right to modify the agreement, creating a legal contradiction. The original text states the agreement continues in full force and effect, implying mutual agreement for changes, while the added sentence allows Vivint Solar to alter the terms without Vivint's consent. This weakens the enforceability of the entire agreement.",

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies exclusive jurisdiction in San Mateo County, California. By adding 'unless both parties mutually agree to an alternative jurisdiction,' a contradiction is introduced, potentially voiding the exclusive jurisdiction clause.

                "explanation": "The original clause puts a clear limit on liability related to damage fees over a 6-month period. The change, by inserting 'unless damages are associated with confidentiality breach' attempts to make this limitation less clear, and cause possible unlimited liability concerning that type of breach, which makes the clause contradict itself to a degree and reduce enforceability.",

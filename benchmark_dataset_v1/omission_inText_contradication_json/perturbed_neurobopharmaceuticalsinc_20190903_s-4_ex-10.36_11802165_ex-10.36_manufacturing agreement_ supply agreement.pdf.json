                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'in conformity with the specifications separately agreed upon between the Parties and attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Product Specifications”)', the obligation to adhere to specific product specifications is removed. However, Section 3.2 later references the 'Product Specifications' when discussing the certificate of analysis, creating a contradiction: Dong-A is required to provide a certificate showing compliance with specifications that are not explicitly defined or required in the manufacturing process itself.",

Dong-A shall provide NeuroBo with all available information and technical assistance necessary for NeuroBo to perform the Product Test expeditiously. If the Product Test indicates that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo is deficient in quantity or does not meet the Product Specifications, NeuroBo shall notify Dong-A thereof in writing within the [***]-day period together with results of the Product Test. If the quantity is deficient, Dong-A shall immediately ship the sufficient amount of additional Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to cover the deficiency. If Dong-A does not agree that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, the Parties shall refer their disagreement for decision by an independent testing laboratory agreed by the Parties. The decision by the independent testing laboratory shall be conclusive and binding on both Parties, and the losing Party shall bear the costs of the independent testing laboratory. If Dong-A agrees that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, or if the decision by the testing laboratory confirms that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, (i) Dong-A shall arrange for the return from NeuroBo of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo at Dong-A’s expense, and (ii) without waiting for the return, Dong-A shall promptly replace the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo at no additional cost to NeuroBo.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'which shall be separately agreed in writing by and between Dong-A and NeuroBo and attached hereto as Exhibit B, as may be amended by the Parties’ agreement in writing from time to time', the contract no longer specifies how Product Test Methods will be determined. Section 3.3 references the Product Test and Methods while exhibit B is not required, creating a contradiction. This omission creates uncertainty in enforcement because while the process of testing is maintained, there is no explicit agreement on testing methodology.",

                "explanation": "By changing the original text, there is a missing Schedule that defines the price and there is a missing process to define the price. Now, the new text makes it seem as though only Dong-A has control of the price, but that is missing from the other contexts from the contract, which states there should be mutual agreement and defined prices. This creates uncertainty and contradict the purpose of 'DEFINITIONS' that is set in section 1.",

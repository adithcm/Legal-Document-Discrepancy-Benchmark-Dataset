If any Royalties or other amounts owed to us are not paid in full by the due date, we have the right to charge interest on the overdue amount at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, if less than 1.5%) from the date such amount was due until paid in full. Unpaid interest charges will compound annually. In addition, we will have the right to charge a late fee for each occurrence of a payment that is more than 30 days past due, which fee will be $100 for the first such occurrence, $200 for the second such occurrence, and $300 for the third and each subsequent occurrence during the Term of this Agreement. The late fee is to compensate us for our administrative costs incurred in enforcing your obligation to pay us.",

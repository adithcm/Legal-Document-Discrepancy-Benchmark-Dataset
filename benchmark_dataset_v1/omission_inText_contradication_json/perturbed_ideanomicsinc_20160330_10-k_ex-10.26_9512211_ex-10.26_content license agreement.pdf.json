The\nReports will be delivered in a format that is mutually agreed upon by the parties.

                "explanation": "By removing the specific details about the content of the reports, the distribution channels, sub-licensee information and mutual approval clause and adding Licensee's discretion, there is a contradiction because it's vague and gives more power to Licensee. The Licensor's ability to monitor the use of their content is undermined, and there is less enforcement on what to report.",

A contradiction is introduced. In the original agreement, specific conditions are set that allow a party to terminate immediately and provide time for a party to remediate. Now, the Licensee can terminate easier by removing key terms, but the Term is still set for twenty (20) years.",

The party seeking indemnification\n(the “Indemnified Party”) will give prompt notice to the indemnifying party (the “Indemnifying\nParty”) of any claim for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement;\nprovided, however, that failure to give prompt notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of\nany liability hereunder (except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual material\nprejudice by such failure). The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate (at the Indemnifying\nParty’s expense) in the defense of any claim for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification\nunder this Section 13. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and\nto participate in (but not control) any such action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel\nwill be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless: (i) the employment of counsel by the\nIndemnified Party has been authorized by the Indemnifying Party; (ii) the Indemnified Party has\nbeen advised by its counsel in writing that there is a conflict of interest between the\nIndemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense of the action (in which\ncase the Indemnifying Party will not have the right to direct the defense of the action on behalf\nof the Indemnified Party); or (iii) the Indemnifying Party has not in fact employed counsel to\nassume the defense of the action within a reasonable time following receipt of the notice given\npursuant to this Section 13, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of such counsel will be\nat the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any\nsettlement of an action effected without its written consent (which consent will not be\nunreasonably withheld or delayed), nor will the Indemnifying Party settle any such action without\nthe written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or\ndelayed). The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any\nsettlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or\nplaintiff to the Indemnified Party a release from all liability with respect to the claim.",

                "explanation": "The modification removes the section describing the conditions under which the Indemnified Party can seek separate counsel at the Indemnifying Party's expense. This change reduces the protection afforded to the Indemnified Party, especially in cases where a conflict of interest exists or the Indemnifying Party fails to adequately defend the claim. If another section refers to this indemnification but assumes the ability to seek independent counsel under certain circumstances, a contradiction is created.",

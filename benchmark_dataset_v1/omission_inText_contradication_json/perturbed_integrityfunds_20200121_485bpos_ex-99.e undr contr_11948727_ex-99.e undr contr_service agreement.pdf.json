                "original_text": "In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive the excess, if any, of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as underwriter. The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the “Plan”) adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive compensation as mutually agreed upon. The Fund may pay Integrity distribution and/or service fees; such arrangements will be handled separately.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to the 'Shareholder Services Plan (the “Plan”)' and replacing the specific fee structure with a vague 'compensation as mutually agreed upon' and 'handled separately' introduces ambiguity. Section 2.3 still mandates that 'The Fund shall pay to Integrity, as set forth in the Registration Statement, any distribution and service fee authorized by the Plan.', thus the omitted information from Section 1.7 now contradicts Section 2.3, because the term 'the Plan' is still used despite the earlier removal.",

                "original_text": "Integrity will bear all expenses in connection with the performance of its services and the incurring of distribution expenses under this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, “distribution expenses” of Integrity shall mean all expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited to, the following:\n(a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, including, but not limited to, office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services;\n(b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising;\n(c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund;\n(d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund;\n(e) costs involved in obtaining whatever information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and\n(f) sales commissions and other fees paid, together with related financing costs to brokers, dealers or other selling entities with a dealer agreement in effect for the sale of Fund Shares.\nDistribution expenses, however, shall not include any expenditures in connection with services which Integrity, any of its affiliates, or any other person has agreed to bear without reimbursement.",
                "changed_text": "Integrity will bear reasonable expenses in connection with its services under this Agreement. A committee will be formed to approve specific expense categories.",
                "explanation": "By removing the detailed definition of 'distribution expenses' in Section 1.8 and replacing it with a vague reference to 'reasonable expenses', it introduces uncertainty. The subsequent mention of a 'committee' does not clarify what these expenses are and what the Fund needs to take care of. This omission now contradicts Section 1.9, which still requires Integrity to provide reports to the Treasurer and Investment Advisor 'showing the distribution expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan and the purposes therefore'. Without the initial definition, the report lacks necessary scope, creating an inconsistency.",

This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) on 60 days’ written notice, by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or (b) on 90 days’ written notice by Integrity. This Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).",

This Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its assignment.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific requirement for annual approval by the Board of Trustees and the 'Qualified Trustees' the contract now omits the critical approval process. Section 8.5 states: 'This Agreement may not be amended or modified in any manner except by both parties with the same formality as this Agreement and as may be permitted or required by the 1940 Act.' Without the renewal process, the clause contradicts that the contract needs both parties' approval, since it says the agreement shall continue automatically. Without the requirement to have that formal agreement, it creates an inconsistency.",

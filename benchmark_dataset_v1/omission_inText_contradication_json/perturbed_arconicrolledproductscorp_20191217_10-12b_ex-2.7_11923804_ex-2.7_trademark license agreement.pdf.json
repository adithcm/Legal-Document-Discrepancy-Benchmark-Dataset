Licensor on behalf of itself and its Affliates hereby grants to Licensee the limited licenses to use and have used the\nLicensed Mark: (i) for the Licensed Products as set forth on Schedule 2; and (ii) as set forth on Schedule 1, concerning agreements entered into by\nLicensee prior to the Effective Date (“Existing Agreements”). For the avoidance of doubt, Licensor also grants to Licensee and its subsidiaries and\naffiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide royalty-free license for continued use of the Licensed Mark for the production and sale of inventory\ncontaining the Licensed Mark applied to such products during the Transition Period as set forth in section 8.2 of the Separation and Distribution\nAgreement and in Schedule 2 of this Agreement. Licensee will not, however, use the Licensed Mark except for the production and sale of inventory\nas provided in this Section 1.1 and in Section 8.2 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Schedule 2 of this Agreement. For avoidance of\ndoubt, to the extent that any of the licenses granted by the terms of this Agreement include any right to sublicense, such right to sublicense shall\nextend to Licensee’s subsidiaries and joint venturers.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit grant of a non-exclusive, worldwide royalty-free license for continued use of the Licensed Mark during the Transition Period, which is also referenced in section 8.2 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Schedule 2. Removing this explicit grant while those sections still refer to it creates an internal inconsistency regarding the licensee's rights during the transition period. There would be a question whether the licensee has a right to use the licensed mark during the transition period, what is the royalty rate and also if it could be used worldwide.",

Licensor, as owner of the Licensed Mark, shall have the right at all times to control and approve\nthe nature and quality of the Licensed Products (and the Licensed Mark thereon), and to inspect Licensee’s business operations upon reasonable\nprior notice for the purpose of ensuring that a high level of quality of the Licensed Products is being maintained by Licensee. At Licensor’s\nreasonable request during each calendar year, Licensee shall submit samples to Licensor, at no cost to Licensor, and shall not materially depart\ntherefrom without Licensor’s prior express written consent. The Licensed Products, as well as all promotional, packaging and advertising material\nrelative thereto, shall include all appropriate legal notices as required by Licensor. No more frequently than once per year, a third party auditor\nchosen by Licensor and approved by Licensee, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, shall be entitled at any time on reasonable notice\nto the Licensee to enter, during regular business hours, any premises used by the Licensee or its manufacturers for the manufacture, packaging or\nstorage of the Licensed Products, to inspect such premises, all plant, workforce and machinery used for manufacture, packaging or storage of\nLicensed Products and all other aspects of the manufacture, packaging and storage of Licensed Products (“Access Rights”). Prior to exercising\nsuch Access Rights, the third party auditor shall enter into a nondisclosure agreement with Licensee that, among other terms deemed acceptable by\nLicensee and such third party auditor, shall: (a) limit the content of any report made by the third party auditor to Licensor to a description of the\nmanner in which, and the conditions under which, the Licensed Mark are used by Licensee or its manufacturers; and (b) prevent the disclosure of\nany of Licensee’s trade secrets and/or Confidential Information. To the extent reasonably practicable, all Licensed Products shall include notices on\nlabeling and packaging for the Licensed Products stating that the Licensed Mark is owned by Licensor and used by Licensee under license from\nLicensor. The Licensed Products shall be of a quality commensurate with previous production or the samples approved by Licensor. If the quality\nof a class of the Licensed Products falls below such standards, Licensee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to restore such quality. In the\nevent that Licensee has not taken appropriate steps to restore such quality within one-hundred twenty (120) days after notification by Licensor,\nLicensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This removes the entire section that allows for a third-party auditor to inspect the licensee's premises. This introduces a contradiction because Licensor retains the right to approve the quality of Licensed Products, but removes the mechanism for independent verification. Because the Access Rights section has been removed, even though the Licensor can still enforce the quality and have licensee to send samples, the removal of third party to come to the premises and conduct the audit will hinder the Licensor from maintaining Quality Control. There will be doubt on how the Licensor can audit the production facility, whether that access has been granted or revoked.",

Section 4.1 now states the agreement continues indefinitely, while Schedules 1 and 2 likely specify finite durations. This contradiction introduces ambiguity regarding the actual term length.",

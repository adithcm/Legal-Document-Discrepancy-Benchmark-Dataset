                "original_text": "“Business” means an online real estate media platform in the PRC that (i) provides information and updates related to real estate, home furnishing and construction in the PRC and provides real estate, home furnishing and construction advertising services, and (ii) operates a business-to-business and business-to-consumer Internet platform targeting participants in the PRC real estate industry, in each case, as currently conducted or contemplated to be conducted on the websites owned or operated by Licensee or any of Licensee’s Affiliates in the PRC.",
                "changed_text": "“Business” means activities generally related to real estate advertising and information services.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Business' specifies its scope, including providing specific information and operating defined internet platforms. The modified definition removes these specifics, broadening the definition. However, later sections (e.g., 2.1(a) referencing 'connection with the Business') still operate under the assumption of the original detailed scope. This creates a contradiction because the 'Business' could now mean something significantly different, leading to uncertainty in enforcement regarding the types of activities covered by the license.",

                "explanation": "The original definition includes content owned by Licensor and certain third-party content sublicensable without additional fees or violations. The modified definition omits the specific inclusion of third-party content and the conditions for its inclusion. However, subsequent sections (e.g., 4.1 referencing 'its third party providers') still imply the existence of third-party licensed content. This creates an inconsistency, as the definition no longer explicitly covers this content, but other sections rely on its inclusion, creating uncertainty about the scope of licensed content and obligations related to third-party providers.",

Licensor shall make available to Licensee the Licensed Content in substantially the same manner and with substantially the same speed and efficiency as such Licensed Content was made available to SINA Leju prior to the Effective Date, namely through Licensor’s content database, but in no event with less speed, efficiency, or a lesser level of access than Licensor provides with respect to its own operations. Licensee agrees to use the Licensed Domain Names only in accordance with such content distribution policy that Licensor uses in connection with its own business, and as may be established by Licensor and communicated in writing in advance to Licensee from time to time or as may otherwise be agreed to by the Parties from time to time, provided that Licensee shall be afforded the same period of time to implement any such content distribution policy as is afforded to Licensor’s Affiliates and other third parties.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides specific standards for content distribution: same manner, speed and efficiency as provided to SINA Leju, using Licensor's content database, and affording Licensee the same implementation period for content distribution policies as Licensor's affiliates. The modified version replaces these objective standards with vague language: 'commercially reasonable efforts' and 'reasonable content usage guidelines.' This creates uncertainty because the specific obligations regarding content distribution are removed, but the general concept of content distribution remains. The contradiction arises because the level of service previously guaranteed is no longer specified, potentially leaving Licensee without recourse if the content delivery is substandard, while still being bound by general 'usage guidelines'.",

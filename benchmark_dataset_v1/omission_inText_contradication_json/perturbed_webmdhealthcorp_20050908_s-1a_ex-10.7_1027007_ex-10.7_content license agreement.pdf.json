                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to 'Exhibit A', where the specific content is defined, but without altering the mention of 'Content' elsewhere, creates uncertainty. The contract states that WebMD will provide 'some content,' making it unclear which content is actually being licensed. Further sections may depend on a concrete understanding of the content being licensed.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific interest rate and replacing it with 'as determined by WebMD' contradicts the intention of a fixed agreement. While it mentions 'interest charge' other sections assume a predefined value of the interest in order to enforce them",

                "explanation": "By changing 'Content' to 'some materials,' the scope of the trademark license becomes ambiguous. 'Some materials' is less defined than content, while the trademark license is explicitly for identifying the origin of the 'Content' other sections may assume the correct usage of the Mark.",

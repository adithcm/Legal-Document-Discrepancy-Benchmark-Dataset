                "original_text": "1.2 Covenants of Parties (1) Tsinghua Unigroup covenants to follow the Share Subscription Agreement to subscribe for, via the Subscriber, in compliance with the requirements of Taiwan’s laws and regulations relating to securities transactions and PRC investment in Taiwan, at the Subscription Price per Share (as defined in the Share Subscription Agreement), 299,252,000 common shares through private placement from ChipMOS, and Tsinghua Unigroup shall comply with, and shall cause the Subscriber to comply with the content of the Share Subscription Agreement, Taiwan’s laws and regulations concerning securities transactions and PRC investments in Taiwan so that ChipMOS may make use of the Total Subscription Price (as defined in the Share Subscription Agreement) to replenish operating capital, recruit talents, and upgrade its technologies related to the semiconductor assembly and testing services, to create profits for each of the Parties and its shareholders.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the references to the 'Share Subscription Agreement' and 'Subscription Price per Share' introduces ambiguity. While Tsinghua Unigroup is still obligated to subscribe for shares, the specifics regarding the price and compliance with the Share Subscription Agreement are now omitted. This creates a potential contradiction if other sections assume adherence to the original terms of the Share Subscription Agreement.",

The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (“Dispute Notice”) to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall each select one (1) arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. All language used in such proceedings shall be Mandarin Chinese. The Parties agree to keep the content of the dispute and the proceeding of the arbitration confidential. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney’s fees).",

The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific details regarding the 'Dispute Notice,' the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, the number of arbitrators, the language of the proceedings, and the allocation of arbitration costs, the modified text creates significant ambiguity. While the agreement still stipulates arbitration, the absence of procedural details renders the enforcement of this clause uncertain. Later clauses might assume the 'Dispute Notice' process still exists, leading to a contradiction.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Section 3.11 and the specific exceptions of 'board of the directors, management team, financial counsel, and competent authorities', the confidentiality clause becomes more vague. Previously, Section 3.11 outlined the procedure for public announcements, and excluding specific parties from confidentiality obligations allowed a clear execution of the agreement. Now, it is unclear when a public announcement can be made (contradicting the original intent of coordinated announcements), and the absence of specific entities like 'board of directors' creates confusion about their disclosure rights.",

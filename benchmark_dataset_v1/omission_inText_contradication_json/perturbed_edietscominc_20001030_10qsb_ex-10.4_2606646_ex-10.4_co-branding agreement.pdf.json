Women.com shall make available to eDiets and eDiets shall purchase from Women.com advertising and promotional inventory in the amounts and at the rates specified in Exhibit B hereto and in accordance with the terms specified in Exhibit D hereto. If Women.com does not deliver at least 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for Advertsing Promotions as set forth on Exhibit B (11,250,000 per quarter; 45,000,000 per year); 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for the Diet Center Logo as set forth on Exhibit B (3,250,000 per quarter; 13,000,000 per year); and 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for Other Campaigns as set forth on Exhibit B (3,000,000 per quarter; 12,000,000 per year) each quarter following the Launch Date, within sixty (60) days of the end of the applicable quarter, Women.com shall deliver an amount equal to the under-delivery within the same campaign elements, including newsletters, promotions, exclusive sponsorships, targeted rotations, ROS, channel and sub-channel center logo placements, or mutually agreed upon comparable elements. If Women.com does not deliver the shortfall within sixty (60) days of the end of the applicable quarter, eDiets may terminate this Agreement in its entirety immediately or authorize Women.com to deliver the shortfall within an extended number of days to be mutually agreed upon by the parties (the \"Make Good Period\"). Should eDiets elect to terminate this Agreement, Women.com shall reimburse eDiets within thirty (30) days of the date of such termination for all pre-paid impressions or other promotions not delivered as of the date of termination. Women.com agrees that if eDiets elects to extend the Agreement the monthly fee due and payable during the Make Good Period will be recalculated and reduced to reflect the changes in the revised delivery schedule.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific details and guarantees regarding impression numbers and advertising rates as specified in Exhibit B and D, the clause becomes highly ambiguous. The term \"satisfactory amount\" is not defined, creating uncertainty in enforcement. The lack of defined rates also contradicts the payment schedule outlined in Exhibit C, creating further inconsistencies.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific restrictions and examples of competitive activities creates ambiguity. The term 'reasonable efforts' is subjective and difficult to enforce. Removing the definition of \"Competitive Company\" also creates uncertainty. The original clause defines specific prohibited activities (custom mini-sites, content integration, discounts, editorial endorsements). The modified clause replaces these with a vague general avoidance, making it difficult to determine if a breach has occurred and thus undermining the protection for eDiets.",

                "explanation": "By removing the detailed requirements regarding quality control standards, copyright/trademark notices, and prohibitions on challenging the other party's marks, the modified clause becomes much weaker. The lack of specific guidelines allows for potential misuse of trademarks. The original clause provides clear obligations regarding trademark protection. By omitting these, the modified text introduces ambiguity, leaving the door open for disputes about what constitutes 'basic branding guidelines' and a 'confusingly similar' mark.",

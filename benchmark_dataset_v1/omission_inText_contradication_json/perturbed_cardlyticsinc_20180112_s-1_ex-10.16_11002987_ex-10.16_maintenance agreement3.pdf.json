(“Supplier”) and Bank of America, N. A, (“Bank of America”), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (“SLCMA”).

(“Supplier”) and Bank of America, N. A, (“Bank of America”), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (“SLCMA”). Each capitalized term used but not fully defined herein shall follow common business practices.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that all capitalized terms not defined in the Schedule have the meaning assigned in the SLCMA. The modified text removes the connection and references only common business practices, potentially contradicting specific definitions within the SLCMA and making those definitions unenforceable under this schedule.",

                "explanation": "By removing the direct reference to the SLCMA and the specific software agreement, the changed text makes the purpose of the agreement vague. This now contrasts with the section where the attached Schedule [A] is incorporated into the SLCMA. The removed sentences create an inconsistency, because the document now references Schedule A being incorporated into the SLCMA, yet there is no prior definition for this Schedule in the current agreement, nor a reference to the overarching SLCMA.",

                "explanation": "The original statement explicitly ties Schedule [A] to the SLCMA and a specific software system (Offer Placement System Software). The revised statement removes the link to the SLCMA and only vaguely refers to 'potential software collaboration areas'. This change creates uncertainty regarding the enforceability and scope of Schedule [A]. By removing the purpose of the attachment, it is up to interpretation.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific limitations regarding hardware, agents, users, etc., the contract becomes vague. While it still references the Purchase Order, the omission introduces ambiguity about the exact extent of the license, especially if a separate section refers to specific user limits but the Purchase Order lacks details, leading to a contradiction.",

NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT: (1) CUSTOMER HAS NO LICENSE OR RIGHT TO USE ANY ADDITIONAL COPIES OR UPGRADES UNLESS CUSTOMER, AT THE TIME OF ACQUIRING SUCH COPY OR UPGRADE, ALREADY HOLDS A VALID LICENSE TO THE ORIGINAL SOFTWARE AND HAS PAID THE APPLICABLE FEE FOR THE UPGRADE; (2) USE OF UPGRADES IS LIMITED TO CISCO EQUIPMENT FOR WHICH CUSTOMER IS THE ORIGINAL END USER PURCHASER OR LESSEE OR WHO OTHERWISE HOLDS A VALID LICENSE TO USE THE SOFTWARE WHICH IS BEING UPGRADED; AND (3) THE MAKING AND USE OF ADDITIONAL COPIES IS LIMITED TO NECESSARY BACKUP PURPOSES ONLY.",

                "explanation": "Removing the numbered clauses that specifically restricts the use of upgrades to the original end user, when other clauses still imply upgrades can be received, the omission introduces a contradiction on how upgrades are to be treated, thus there is uncertainty in enforcement.",

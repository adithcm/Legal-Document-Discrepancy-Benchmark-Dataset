                "changed_text": "1.17\n“IMSI” means an identifier.",
                "explanation": "By changing the definition of 'IMSI' to a broader term, we introduce ambiguity. Later sections relying on the specific definition of 'International Mobile Subscriber Identity' will become unclear, creating an internal contradiction. This affects the enforcement of clauses where IMSI is referenced.",

In addition, T-Mobile shall provide second line customer care support to the back office of ELEPHANT TALK’s customer support organization, according to Appendix 1, 2 and 6.",

                "explanation": "Removing T-Mobile's obligation to provide second-line support creates a contradiction if other sections (specifically Appendix 6 - SLA) still refer to T-Mobile's responsibilities regarding second-line support. The definition of 'Customer Care Support' now lacks clarity, potentially leading to disputes over the level of support T-Mobile is obligated to provide. The contract still mentions Customer care in other sections.",

                "explanation": "By removing the designated contacts for each party, it becomes unclear where formal communications should be sent. This is an issue as this omission now contradicts sections relying on these designated contacts. This ambiguity hinders effective communication and enforcement.",

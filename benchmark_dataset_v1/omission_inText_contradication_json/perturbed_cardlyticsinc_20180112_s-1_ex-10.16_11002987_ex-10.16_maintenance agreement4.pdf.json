                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' regarding Maintenance Fees creates ambiguity. The original text implies an obligation to pay maintenance fees, whereas the modified text suggests it is optional, potentially contradicting other clauses relating to payment obligations.",

                "explanation": "The text modification removes the explicit definition of the Maintenance Period duration (24/7 including holidays), replacing it with a vague statement about a 'subsequent amendment'. This creates an inconsistency because the original 120-day warranty period is still referenced, but the maintenance period is now undefined, leading to uncertainty in enforcement. Other sections referring to the Maintenance Period are now ambiguous without the defined duration.",

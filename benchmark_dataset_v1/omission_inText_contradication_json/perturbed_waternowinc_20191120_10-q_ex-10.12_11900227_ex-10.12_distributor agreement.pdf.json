                "original_text": "“Performance Benchmarks” shall mean the following requirements necessary for Distributor to maintain the exclusivity granted in Section 2.1 hereof: (a) the execution of contracts to deploy Products in 25 new locations approved in advance by Hydraspin (“Customer Locations”) during each 12 month period following the Effective Date and (b) all Customer Locations in the aggregate shall generate an average of 7,500 barrels of fluid per day on a trailing 12 month basis. Customer Locations must be available for installation within 90 days of approval by Hydraspin to be applied toward the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmark. All Customer Locations in excess of 25 secured during an applicable 12 month period shall be credited toward the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmark for the subsequent 12 month period.\nIf this Agreement is extended beyond the Initial Term, as hereinafter defined, the number of Customer Locations to be secured to maintain exclusivity during the pendency of the Agreement shall be increased to 50 from 25.",
                "changed_text": "“Performance Benchmarks” shall mean requirements necessary for Distributor to maintain exclusivity. Details of the Performance Benchmarks shall be outlined in Exhibit C, subject to periodic review and amendment by Hydraspin at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines specific performance benchmarks. The modified text replaces this definition with a vague reference to 'Exhibit C' and grants Hydraspin the unilateral right to amend the benchmarks. This introduces an in-text contradiction because Section 2.1 still refers to 'satisfaction of the Performance Benchmarks' as a condition for maintaining exclusivity, but the benchmarks are now undefined within the body of the agreement and subject to change by one party, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "“Net Revenue” means the revenue derived from the sale of the Hydrocarbons resulting from the Products, calculated according to Hydraspin's proprietary accounting methods.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear definition of 'Net Revenue' with specific deductions. The modified text removes these specifics and states that it is calculated according to Hydraspin's proprietary accounting methods. While Section 6 refers to Distributor Share and Hydraspin share, the uncertainty of Net Revenue calculation creates in-text contradiction that creates uncertainty for enforcement",

                "original_text": "5.1 Orders. Distributor shall order Products from Hydraspin by submitting purchase orders and an installation plan identifying the number(s) and type(s) of Products ordered, the requested delivery date(s) (each, an “Order”). The requested delivery date shall be no less than 120 days from the date the Order is accepted by Hydraspin. Hydraspin will not unreasonably reject any Order for Products. Hydraspin will accept or reject each Order submitted by Distributor within ten (10) days after receipt of the Order. Any Orders not expressly rejected by Hydraspin within such ten (10) day period shall be deemed accepted by Hydraspin. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributor may cancel any Order for Products that are not delivered within sixty (60) days after the delivery date specified therein.\n5.2 Delivery; Storage; Risk of Loss. Hydraspin shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver Products to Customers by the delivery dates specified in Distributor’s Orders. Products shall be delivered directly to the Customer. All costs and expenses of shipping, freight, delivery, transportation and storage, including, without limitation, insurance covering the Products during transportation and while stored at any facility will be borne solely by Hydraspin and the Distributor shall not be liable therefor. Risk of loss shall be borne entirely by Hydraspin, even while Products are in the possession or control of Distributor or any customer, and the Distributor and the customers shall not be liable therefor, except solely in the case of Distributor’s or any customer’s intentional misconduct or gross negligence. Hydraspin may request Distributor to store Products at Distributor’s facilities, and Distributor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate Hydraspin’s storage requests; provided, that Hydraspin shall bear the full risk of loss with respect to Products stored at Distributor’s facility and Distributor shall not be liable therefor, except solely in the case of Distributor’s intentional misconduct or gross negligence.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall coordinate product needs with Hydraspin to ensure timely delivery.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a detailed order and delivery process. The modified text is vague, merely stating that the Distributor should coordinate needs. Section 5.2 refers to the shipping cost will be borne by Hydraspin but with this changed text, it does not follow through. Since the obligation to deliver is no longer defined, the allocation of shipping costs becomes ambiguous, contradicting the apparent intent in Section 5.2. This creates uncertainty in enforcement regarding delivery responsibilities and associated costs.",

                "original_text": "5.05. Calm or its authorized designees shall be the sole suppliers to XSPA of XSPA’s requirements for Products, Gifts, Shopping Bags, Uniforms and Inserts (collectively, “Product Collateral”) for each Store throughout the Territory. Calm shall use reasonable efforts to fulfill all of XSPA’s requirements for Product Collateral in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event that inventory of any Product Collateral in any Store falls below fifty percent (50%) of the initial amount of such Product Collateral provided to such Store, XSPA shall use best efforts to advise Calm in sufficient detail to enable Calm to ship additional inventory of such Product Collateral to such Store. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, as between the Parties, Calm shall retain legal title to any and all Product Collateral (other than Uniforms) until sold in a Store in the Territory or otherwise disbursed in a Store in the Territory (in the case of Gifts, Inserts and Shopping Bags) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event Calm identifies any issue with any Product Collateral making it unsuitable for use as contemplated by this Agreement or issues a recall with respect to any Product, XSPA shall promptly return any and all affected Product Collateral to Calm or its authorized designees upon receiving notice of such issue or recall.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of ‘Product Collateral’ that includes Gifts, Shopping Bags, Uniforms and Inserts, and shortening the provision that addresses Product supply and returns, while keeping the clause referencing ‘Product’ which references Exhibits, creates uncertainty. This makes it unclear whether XSPA is obliged to return only the Products, or the other Product Collateral defined earlier. It creates an internal contradiction as the first part of section 5.05 references broader range of item but the subsequent clause applies to only Products. The enforcement of the return policy becomes ambiguous.",

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, and considering that Calm or its authorized designees shall be the sole supplier of Product Collateral under Section 5.04 of this Agreement, Calm shall pay (or reimburse XSPA upon receipt of payment to a third party) for all costs associated with (a) the design, manufacture, shipping, distribution and installation, as applicable, of Product Collateral and other marketing materials and bulkhead signage as set forth in Section ​4.01, (b) the creation of training materials and the costs associated with training (excluding cost of labor for any XSPA employee) pursuant to Section ​6, (c) obtaining and maintaining approval of, and the creation, installation, maintenance and removal of any bulkhead signage advertising pursuant to Section 4.01(a), and (d) the design, manufacture, shipping and installation of in-store marketing changes to any Store. \nNotwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Calm shall not be obligated to reimburse XSPA for any such costs described in the previous sentence of this Section 8.03 incurred by XSPA above $500.00 unless Calm has provided prior written approval of such cost (including via email).",

                "explanation": "By removing 'Product Collateral and other marketing materials and bulkhead signage as set forth in Section 4.01', the agreement creates an internal contradiction. Calm's payment obligations become ambiguous. The agreement refers to Section 4.01 which outlines marketing materials and signage. However, since these specific obligations are removed from Section 8.03(a), it's unclear if Calm still needs to bear those costs. This creates an enforcement uncertainty, potentially leading to disputes regarding financial responsibilities for marketing and signage.",

                "explanation": "By removing ‘including with respect to all Product Collateral’ from insurance policy, the section becomes ambiguous. Earlier in the document the Product Collateral was defined in section 5.05, by removing it in insurance clause, the XSPA might not be required to cover such risk. This contradiction could lead to financial risk related to the collateral. The insurance obligation is not clear anymore, leading to problems.",

                "changed_text": "\"Net Amount at Risk\" will mean the total face amount of the policies.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'reduced by the Cash Value of the Policies' from the definition of 'Net Amount at Risk,' the contract no longer specifies how to calculate the actual amount at risk. This omission creates ambiguity, particularly when calculating the payout to the Employee's beneficiary per Article IV, which relies on the 'Net Amount at Risk'.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific formula for calculating the beneficiary's payout and replacing it with 'an amount as determined by the Employer,' the contract introduces significant uncertainty and contradicts the intended purpose of providing a clear, predefined benefit. It creates an internal contradiction as page 6 defines a calculation process, but now it is at the Employer's disgression.",

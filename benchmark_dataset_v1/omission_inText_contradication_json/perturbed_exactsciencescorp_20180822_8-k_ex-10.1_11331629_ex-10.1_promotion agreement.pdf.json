                "explanation": "By removing the specific tie of Incentive Compensation to sales of products and its components, the definition becomes vague. Section 3.4(a) requires Pfizer to ensure that Incentive Compensation weighting directly tied to the Product is not less than a certain percentage. With the modified definition, it's unclear how to measure whether Pfizer is meeting this requirement, creating an in-text contradiction.",

Commencing on the Launch Date, each of Exact and Pfizer shall implement the sales Detailing plan set forth in the applicable Annual Marketing Plan and the Sales Deployment Plan. In the case of Pfizer, Pfizer shall ensure that (i) the number of Details in a Calendar Year by Pfizer Sales Representatives is not less than six hundred twenty-five thousand (625,000) Details (for the remainder of 2018 Calendar Year following the Launch Date, Pfizer shall deliver one hundred forty thousand (140,000) Details) and (ii) if the Product is Promoted by Pfizer Sales Representatives (A) in position 2 or higher, the Incentive Compensation weighting directly tied to the Product shall not be less than thirty percent (30%) of Incentive Compensation available to be earned by such Sales Representative in the applicable Calendar Quarter and (B) in position 3 or lower, the Incentive Compensation weighting directly tied to the Product shall not be less than twenty-five percent (25%) of Incentive Compensation available to be earned by such Sales Representative in the applicable Calendar Quarter. If Pfizer delivers less than five hundred sixty-two thousand five hundred (562,500) Details in a Calendar Year, then the Promotion Fee due Pfizer for such Calendar Year shall be reduced by the applicable percentage set forth in the table on Exhibit 3.4(a), with such reduction to be deducted from remittance of the Promotion Fee for the last Calendar Quarter of such Calendar Year; provided that if such deduction exceeds the amount payable for such Calendar Quarter then Exact shall apply any such remaining deduction to the Promotion Fee for the next Calendar Quarter or Calendar Quarters, as necessary until the total deduction has been applied. If Pfizer delivers less than four hundred fifty thousand (450,000) Details in a Calendar Year, in addition to percentage reduction of the Promotion Fee set forth in the table on Exhibit 3.4(a), Exact shall have the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 8.3(b), which termination shall not be subject to the right of Pfizer to cure such breach. In no event shall Pfizer owe any monies to Exact for Detail shortfalls under this Agreement other than to refund the Promotion Fee owed to Exact due to Detail shortfall in accordance with this Section 3.4(a).\nEach Party shall be responsible for its own Sales Representatives costs attributable to the Product, including base salary and Incentive Compensation, normal travel and entertainment expenses, cost of fleet vehicles and other expenses normally associated with Promotion of products and services similar to the Product.",

                "explanation": "By removing the section that mentions specifically the requirements that Pfizer has for the details that the sales representative should be doing and their incentive compensation, it creates uncertainty if Pfizer is actually complying with what was first established in the contract. Therefore, this could lead to a potential breach of contract. This is directly related to the previous omission.",

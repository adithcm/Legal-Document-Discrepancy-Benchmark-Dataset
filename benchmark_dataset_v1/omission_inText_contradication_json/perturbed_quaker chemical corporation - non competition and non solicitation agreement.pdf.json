                "original_text": "(b) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the “Non-Compete Period”), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer’s capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall:\n(i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, not more than five (5%) percent collectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged;\n(ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in such Seller’s business as conducted on the Effective Date and reasonable extensions thereof, which may include routine, day-to-day transactions with any entity, and\n(iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller acquires control after the Effective Date provided that the acquired business did not receive more than $25,000,000 of its aggregate net sales (as measured during the 12 full calendar months prior to such acquisition) from product lines included within the definition of Company Business.\nEach Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “control” (including the terms “controlled by” and “under common control with”) means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",

                "explanation": "By removing the exceptions (i), (ii), and (iii) to the non-compete clause, the contract becomes internally contradictory. The main clause prohibits competition, but later sections might assume the existence of these exceptions, especially if business activities occur that would have been permitted under the original exceptions. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as to what constitutes a breach of the non-compete agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"from any entity on Schedule 1 hereto,\" the contract introduces an ambiguity. The clause now prohibits any acquisition of a competing business, regardless of the entity from which it is acquired. If Schedule 1 is still referenced elsewhere in the document (e.g., in a definition section or another clause), the omission creates a contradiction: Does the prohibition apply to *all* entities, or only those that *would have been* on Schedule 1? This impacts the scope of the non-compete restriction.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the definition of 'control' creates ambiguity in Section 1(b) and 1(c) (as modified above). The contract refers to 'control' of a business but provides no clear definition. This ambiguity can lead to disputes regarding whether a seller's actions constitute 'control' and therefore a violation of the non-compete clause. If the term 'control' is also used in defining 'Combined Business', the entire scope of the agreement becomes unclear, because the level of control someone should have for competing business it's vague.",

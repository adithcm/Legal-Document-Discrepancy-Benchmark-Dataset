                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "b) “CONTRACT TERRITORY” shall be any State in which Berkshire currently, or at any time during the Contract Period, offers Banking Services.",
                "changed_text": "b) “CONTRACT TERRITORY” shall be limited to the state of Massachusetts, irrespective of where Berkshire offers Banking Services.",
                "explanation": "By explicitly limiting the 'CONTRACT TERRITORY' to Massachusetts, it contradicts the original intent where the territory could expand based on Berkshire's service offerings. This creates uncertainty as marketing campaigns and endorsement usage are now geographically limited regardless of Berkshire's actual operational footprint. This could lead to disputes regarding the scope of Auriemma's endorsement obligations and Berkshire's rights to use his identification.",

                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "a) Berkshire shall use the Auriemma Identification only in such a form and manner as is specifically approved by Auriemma and, upon the reasonable request by Auriemma, shall use any reasonable legends, markings, and notices of trademark rights or registration reasonably specified by Auriemma, or any other notice of Auriemma’s ownership, including copyright.",
                "changed_text": "a) Berkshire shall use the Auriemma Identification at its sole discretion. Auriemma may provide guidelines, but Berkshire is not obligated to follow them.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for Auriemma's specific approval, the modified text contradicts Section 8, which states that both parties will take steps to protect the Auriemma Identification. If Berkshire can use the identification without Auriemma's approval, it undermines his ability to protect his brand and likeness, creating a contradiction. This introduces uncertainty around brand control and could lead to damages if Auriemma's image is negatively impacted.",
                "location": "7. AURIEMMA’S APPROVAL"

            {
                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "8. PROTECTION OF THE AURIEMMA IDENTIFICATION. Berkshire and Auriemma agree that they will take all necessary steps during the Contract Period and thereafter to protect the Auriemma Identification in connection with the Endorsement Services.",
                "changed_text": "8. PROTECTION OF THE AURIEMMA IDENTIFICATION. Berkshire will take steps it deems necessary to protect its interests related to the Auriemma Identification.",
                "explanation": "Removing Auriemma's obligation to protect his own identification, while still referring to the 'Auriemma Identification' creates an inconsistency. The agreement initially suggests a mutual responsibility. If Auriemma is no longer obliged to protect his Identification this directly contradicts section 7 and creates uncertainty on his rights regarding his Identification. This creates ambiguity about who is responsible for addressing potential infringements or misuse, impacting enforcement.",

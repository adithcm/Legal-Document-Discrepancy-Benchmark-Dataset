                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.  Definitions.  A  Confidential  Information@  shall  mean  any  and  all\ninformation  that a Party may reasonably  expect to remain  confidential and not\nshared with the general public at any time or that information that is protected\nby law.",
                "changed_text": "1. Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Information\" shall mean any data exchanged between the parties.",
                "explanation": "By changing the definition of 'Confidential Information' to simply 'Information' and removing the clause about information 'protected by law', the agreement creates ambiguity. Later sections refer to responsibilities regarding 'Confidential Information,' but the definition has been narrowed, creating uncertainty about whether legally protected information is still covered by those responsibilities. This omission undermines the legal protection intended and creates a conflict in interpretation. The enforcement related to 'Confidential Information' mentioned in the agreement becomes uncertain.",

                "original_text": "7. Miscellaneous.\n     a.  Survival.  The  respective  rights  and  obligations  of  Business\nAffiliate  and UDC under the  provisions  of  Sections  3(g)  [Responsibilities of the Parties] and 3(h)  [Responsibilities of the Parties] and 6\n     shall survive the termination of this Agreement indefinitely.",
                "changed_text": "7. Miscellaneous.\n     a. Survival. The respective rights and obligations of Business Affiliate and UDC under the provisions of Section 6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement indefinitely.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Sections 3(g) and 3(h), while those sections still exist and outline responsibilities related to Confidential Information, the agreement introduces a contradiction. Section 7(a) now states that only Section 6 survives termination, implying that the obligations in 3(g) and 3(h) do not. This weakens the enforceability of those clauses after the contract ends, as one section asserts their survival while another implicitly denies it. This creates a direct internal contradiction regarding the longevity of certain obligations.",

            {
                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "f. Business  Affiliate  acknowledges  that the Business  Affiliate has\n     read,  understood  and accepted the terms and  conditions in UDC's Business\n     Affiliate manual, the terms and conditions of which are hereby incorporated\n     into this agreement by reference.",
                "changed_text": "f. Business Affiliate acknowledges that the Business Affiliate has read and understood the general principles underlying UDC's business operations.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause incorporating the 'UDC's Business Affiliate manual' into the agreement by reference, it now becomes unclear which specific rules and conditions the Business Affiliate is bound by. The reference to the manual implied acceptance of its detailed terms, which are no longer incorporated. Other sections, like those outlining responsibilities regarding confidential information, may assume adherence to procedures defined in the manual. Without the explicit incorporation, the enforceability of rules previously located in that manual is weakened, creating a contradiction in intent and application.",

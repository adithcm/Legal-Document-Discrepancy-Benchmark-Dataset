Title to Material furnished by Vendor shall vest in AT&T immediately and automatically upon Location Acceptance (as defined in the Build Addendum) or, if after Location Acceptance of a Cell Site, with respect to any Material provided in connection with the Maintenance Addendum, when actually installed or incorporated in the Work; provided, if the Material was paid for or provided by AT&T prior to incorporation into the Work, title shall always be vested in AT&T; provided, further, in both cases Vendor shall retain risk of loss and damages to all of the Material (including all AT&T Provided Equipment (as such term is defined in the Build Addendum)) until Location Acceptance and thereafter to the extent such Material is in the custody or control of Vendor.",
                "changed_text": "3.40 Title and Risk. Title to Material furnished by Vendor shall vest in AT&T according to a schedule to be mutually agreed upon by both Parties. Vendor shall retain risk of loss and damages to all of the Material until such transfer of title.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty regarding when the title to materials transfers. The original text clearly defines it as immediately upon Location Acceptance. The modified text references 'a schedule to be mutually agreed upon,' which may not exist, creating ambiguity. This contradicts the definitions of 'Location Acceptance' in section 2.0, which assumes title transfers after this process.",

Vendor shall coordinate such access with AT&T’s designated representative prior to visiting such premises. Vendor will ensure that only Vendor Persons will be allowed to enter AT&T’s premises by using AT&T systems, such as the NFSD portal. If AT&T requests Vendor or its Subcontractors to discontinue furnishing any person provided by Vendor or its Subcontractor from performing Work on AT&T’s premises or at any Cell Site, Vendor shall immediately comply with such request. Such person shall leave AT&T’s premises or Cell Site promptly, and Vendor shall not furnish such person again to perform Work on AT&T’s premises without AT&T’s written consent. The Parties agree that, where required by governmental regulations, Vendor will submit satisfactory clearance from the U.S. Department of Defense and/or other federal, state, or local authorities.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the phrase 'Following Location Acceptance and in connection with the Maintenance Addendum' which means the paragraph is not refering to location acceptance and can be interpreted in any way. Because of it, it creates uncertainty around requirements for accessing the cell sites, making it unclear whether vendor needs to wait for formal acceptance. This contradicts other sections that define vendor responsibilities during pre-acceptance phases.",

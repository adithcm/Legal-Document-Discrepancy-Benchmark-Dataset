                "changed_text": "2.7 “Sponsorship Rights” means the bundle of rights, services and deliverables Allied will provide to Newegg. Schedule 4 outlines potential deliverables, but their provision is subject to Allied's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit link to Schedule 4 and Section 5 regarding Allied Marks licenses. The original text clearly defines Sponsorship Rights as those in Schedule 4 and Section 5, providing certainty. The modified text makes the deliverables discretionary and removes the certainty of the license, creating ambiguity and contradicting any sections that assume Newegg is guaranteed the rights specified in the original Schedule 4.",

Allied acknowledges and agrees that Newegg shall not pay any fees or royalties for the license of the Allied Marks, except the Sponsorship Fee specified in Schedule 3.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Allied aims to provide Newegg opportunities to use, publicly display, transmit, broadcast, stream, distribute and reproduce the Allied Marks in mutually agreed-upon forms and manners for the purposes of this Agreement during the Term. Specific usage details will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original clause grants a clear, defined license. The modified text replaces this with an intention to provide *opportunities* for usage, making the license uncertain and subject to future agreement. This creates a contradiction because other sections of the contract may rely on the existence of the original, concrete license, such as sections regarding termination rights if the license isn't provided, or marketing obligations based on the license's scope. Removing 'non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-transferable, and non- sublicensable worldwide license' also removes important constraints, like Newegg not having to pay royalties.",

Refund or Reduction of Sponsorship Fee\n8.1 Without limitation of other rights of Newegg under this Agreement, the Parties agree to negotiate a reasonable reduction and, where applicable, the refund of the Sponsorship Fee to reflect any material restriction in the benefit or value of the Sponsorship Rights to Newegg, including as a result of any change in any laws or regulatory provisions which has an adverse impact on the value of the Sponsorship Rights.\n8.2 If Allied fails to perform or provide the Sponsorship Rights in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Newegg shall, without limiting its other rights or remedies, have one or more of the following rights:\n(a) to refuse to accept any subsequent performance of the Sponsorship Rights which Allied attempts to make; and\n(b) where Newegg has paid in advance for Sponsorship Rights that have not been provided by Allied, to have such sums\nrefunded by Allied.",
                "changed_text": "8. Refund or Reduction of Sponsorship Fee\n8.1 The parties may discuss a reduction in the Sponsorship Fee in the event of unforeseen circumstances. Such discussions shall be at the sole discretion of Allied.\n8.2 In the event Allied is unable to provide specific Sponsorship Rights, Newegg may, at Allied's sole discretion, receive alternative benefits.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides Newegg with a right to a reduction or refund of the Sponsorship Fee if Sponsorship Rights are restricted or not provided. The modified text replaces this with discretionary discussions and alternative benefits determined solely by Allied. This is a direct contradiction, as it removes Newegg's guaranteed remedy and places it entirely at Allied's discretion. Other sections of the contract likely assume Newegg has recourse to a refund or reduction, which is no longer the case, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

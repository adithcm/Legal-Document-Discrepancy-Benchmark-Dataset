                "original_text": "12.1 Distributor shall have the option to return to Cisco, for credit, up [*****] of the dollar value of Products from the Wholesale Price List (or, if\nno Wholesale Price Lists exists for Distributor's Territory, then the applicable price list)\nshipped to Distributor, net of credits, less returns to Cisco, in the preceding [*****] period (the \"Balancing Cap\") of the\npreceding Cisco fiscal quarter. The above-referenced cap shall be determined based on all Product purchases made under\nthis Agreement. The responsibility to manage the Balancing Cap shall rest solely upon Distributor. Distributor shall be\nentitled to return Product once per quarter, provided such returns do not exceed the Balancing Cap. \"Dead on Arrival\"\nand Obsolete Products returned pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement shall be excluded from calculation of the\nBalancing Cap. Cisco shall credit Distributor's account in the amount of the price paid by Distributor therefore, less any\nprice protection credits issued to Distributor related to the Product returned (the \"Return Credit\").",

Cisco shall credit Distributor's account in the amount of the price paid by Distributor.",
                "explanation": "By removing the \"Balancing Cap\" clause and the specifics of Wholesale Price List, the section now lacks a clearly defined limit or valuation method for returns. The term 'Balancing Cap' is still referenced in relation to dead on arrival products, creating an inconsistency. This omission creates uncertainty in enforcement, as there's no longer a set method to calculate return credit value, making the process ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific inclusion of anti-corruption laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) from clause (a), and the URL for more information, the contract becomes ambiguous regarding the distributor's obligations related to anti-corruption. While (b) states compliance with 'Applicable Laws', the explicit reference is removed, making it less clear that anti-corruption measures are a critical part of compliance. This change reduces legal certainty in enforcing anti-corruption measures.",

                "explanation": "By removing the detail that Cisco provides on-line anti-corruption training is available and free of charge, the document creates an inconsistency. Clause (e) still mandates training, but removes the readily available avenue that was explicitly mentioned. This creates ambiguity about how Distributor is expected to fulfill this training requirement which can lead to challenges during an audit. Because 'Applicable Laws' can include many things, and the exact training that is expected has been removed, there is now ample room for disagreement during enforcement, particularly regarding what constitutes adequate compliance training.",

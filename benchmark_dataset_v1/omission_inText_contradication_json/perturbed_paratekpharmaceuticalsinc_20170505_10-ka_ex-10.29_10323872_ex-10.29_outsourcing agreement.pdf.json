                "explanation": "By changing the definition of 'Master Batch Record' to be a record of manufacturing activities, and removing the phrase 'the complete detailed Manufacturing and control instructions and specifications for the Manufacturing Process for the Product, as defined by the applicable validation protocol and cGMP Requirements,' the rest of the agreement now has contradictions. As the term is used elsewhere, but the actual details of what the Master Batch Record entails has been omitted.",

                "explanation": "By changing the definition of 'Quality Agreement' to 'shall mean an agreement about the quality of product', that differs from being 'that certain Quality Agreement Relating to Contract Manufacturing Services by and between Customer and Supplier, dated [* * *];' as the original definition was. This creates an ambiguity because it's not clear what its implications are. Other sections use the original Quality Agreement definition and now a new, contradictory definition is created.",

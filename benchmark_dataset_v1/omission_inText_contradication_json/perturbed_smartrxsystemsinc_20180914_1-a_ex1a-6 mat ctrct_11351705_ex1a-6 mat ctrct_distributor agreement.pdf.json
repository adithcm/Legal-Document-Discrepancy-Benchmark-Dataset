                "original_text": "4.1 Payment. Payment to the Distributor for the sale of the Products to Customers shall be as follows:\n(i) Company will pay Distributor (or its Assignee) Ten Percent (10%) of the Master Distributor Override generated by each\nCustomer Kiosk Location. (Master Distributor Override (\"MDO\") shall mean Total Revenue per Customer Kiosk Location collected by\nSRXS from third party payors and patient cash payments). This 10% of the total revenue generated is payable only if the EBITDA is a\npositive EBITDA and exceeds the 10% of the revenue. In cases of a positive EBITDA but shortage of funds compared to the 10% of the\nrevenue, Distributor will take less than 10%. If the EBITDA is negative, no payments will be made to Distributor. Additionally, it will be the\nsole responsibility of Distributor to make a full disclosure of the 10% MDO to all its clients.\n(ii) The MDO will be payable within ninety (90) days from the date of the transaction (First Month payable by the end of ninety\n(90) days from the end of the month).\n(iii) For each Customer Kiosk contracted and implemented by Distributor, Company shall also pay a management fee of 40% of\nNet Income (Net Income for this purpose is defined as EBITDA less percentage paid to the client. The balance is then split 40%/60% to A3\nDevelopment Group, LLC and Smart RX Systems, Inc. respectively). Net Income is defined as total Customer revenue collections less all\nincurred expenses, and is the distributable cash generated by each Customer location. These payments will also follow the payment policy\noutlined in 4.1 above.\n(iv) The Payment(s) to Distributor or its Assignee, as set forth herein, shall be further set forth in each Class A Series Agreement,\nalong with the respective ownership interest for both the Company and the Distributor (or its Assignee) for each respective Kiosk\nLocation which shall have its own separate Series, as defined by the Texas Business Organizations Code for Series Limited Liability\nCompanies, and as set forth in the Company's Operating Agreement.\n(v) The Payments set forth in Section 4.1(i) and 4.1(iii) above will reflect the following:\nThe Parties further agree that to the extent a Pharmacy Kiosk is located in a medical facility that is subject to the Stark\nLaw (or similar State Stark Law), that such medical facility may not be able to fulfill any Federal Healthcare Program (\"FHP\")\n(Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare) prescription, but rather the Pharmacy Kiosk will bill such FHP prescriptions through a separate\nbilling system. The Parties cannot share such FHP revenues with the Healthcare Facility Investors who are subject to the\napplicable Stark Laws, but Company and A3 Development Group, LLC shall share in the EBITDA on a 60/40 basis respectfully.",

Payment to the Distributor for the sale of the Products to Customers shall be determined at the sole discretion of the Company, based on performance metrics.

                "explanation": "By removing the specific payment terms and replacing them with a vague reference to 'performance metrics', while leaving the payment policy reference in section 4.1(iii) creates an ambiguity. The policy 4.1 (i) is never defined and it says that performance metrics are provided seperately but they are never added. This leads to a contradiction between the initial promise of a defined payment structure (10% MDO) and the reality of a discretionary payment system controlled by the Company, undermining the distributor's ability to predict or enforce payment amounts.",

                "explanation": "By removing the word Exclusivity and Exclusive and changing the text to distribution oppurtunites it breaks the original promise. The modified text contradicts the initial definition, creating uncertainty regarding the scope of the distributor's rights. The contract now states that other distributors can be appointed at any time, causing the meaning to be reversed.",

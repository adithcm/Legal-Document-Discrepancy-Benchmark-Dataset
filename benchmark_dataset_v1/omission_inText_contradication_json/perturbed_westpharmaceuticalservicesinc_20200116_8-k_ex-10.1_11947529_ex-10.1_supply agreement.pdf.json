                "changed_text": "Title to Product and risk of loss shall pass to Buyer at a location to be determined later.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies the transfer of title and risk of loss at the seller's facilities. The changed text removes the clear point of transfer and introduces ambiguity, leading to disputes about when the buyer assumes responsibility. This omission creates uncertainty in enforcement, especially in cases of damage during transit.",

Buyer assumes all risk whatsoever as a result of the use of the products purchased, whether used singly or in combination with other substances or in any process.",

Buyer assumes all risk whatsoever as a result of the use of the products purchased, whether used singly or in combination with other substances or in any process.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the products must meet the Seller's standard specifications, giving the buyer a basis for quality control. Removing this clause creates a contradiction because the buyer has no guaranteed quality of the products they are purchasing, making enforcement ambiguous if the product is substandard. The removed clause gave the buyer a guaranteed baseline for quality.",

Defective or nonconforming Product shall be replaced by Seller without additional charge, or in lieu thereof, at Seller's option, Seller may refund the purchase price upon return of such Product at Seller's expense and such refund or replacement shall constitute Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy.",

Defective or nonconforming Product shall be replaced by Seller without additional charge, or in lieu thereof, at Seller's option, Seller may refund the purchase price upon return of such Product at Seller's expense and such refund or replacement shall constitute Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that a claim must be made within 150 days after the Buyer's receipt of the product. The revised text removes this time constraint, meaning that there is no limit on how long after the Buyer received the product to make a claim. This creates ambiguity because now the Seller doesn't know when a claim is considered valid or waived.",

MA shall submit an annual marketing plan to Company outlining, among other things, activities and staffing directed at attaining mutually agreed upon annual sales quotas. The Annual Quota is defined in Schedule A of this Agreement. The annual marketing plan shall be devised solely by MA and MA shall not be required to follow an operating plan, standard procedure, training manual, or its substantial equivalent, published by Company.",

The annual marketing plan shall be devised by MA and MA shall follow an operating plan, standard procedure, training manual, or its substantial equivalent, published by Company.",
                "explanation": "The original text says 'Annual Quota is defined in Schedule A', but the changed text removes the word 'Annual' before 'Quota' and removes the word 'mutually agreed upon' before 'annual sales quotas', also the changed text says 'MA shall follow an operating plan, standard procedure, training manual, or its substantial equivalent, published by Company' to contradict the original saying 'MA shall not be required to follow an operating plan, standard procedure, training manual, or its substantial equivalent, published by Company.', creating uncertainty on how it will be enforced.",

The modified text now grants such warranties without defining their scope, duration, or limitations, leading to a direct contradiction.

The modified text removes this specific percentage, making the late payment charge undefined.

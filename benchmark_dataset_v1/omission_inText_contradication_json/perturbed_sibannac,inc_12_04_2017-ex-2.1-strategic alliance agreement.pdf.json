                "original_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, payable NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "explanation": "The clause specifying the lead-finder fee range (10%-20% of project revenue) and the factors influencing the exact fee is omitted. This creates uncertainty because while a 'lead-finder fee' is mentioned, the specific amount or how it's determined is no longer defined, making enforcement contentious. Later references to 'lead-finder fee' will lack a concrete financial basis.",

COMPANY and Bravatek agree to maintain in strict confidence and not to disclose or disseminate, or to use for any purposes other than performance of the projects, the Confidential Information disclosed.\n\nThe obligation of non-disclosure shall not apply to the following:\n\na.\nInformation at or after such time that is publicly available through no fault of either party\n\nb.\nInformation at or after such time that is disclosed to either party by a third party entitled to disclose such information\n\nc.\nInformation which is required by law to be disclosed to federal, state or local authorities.",

COMPANY and Bravatek agree to maintain in strict confidence and not to disclose or disseminate, or to use for any purposes other than performance of the projects, the Confidential Information disclosed.",
                "explanation": "By removing the exceptions (a, b, c) to the confidentiality clause, the definition of what constitutes 'Confidential Information' becomes overly broad. This introduces contradiction because in practice, some information may legally need to be disclosed (e.g., under subpoena), directly conflicting with the absolute non-disclosure obligation now stated. A blanket confidentiality clause without exceptions is inherently difficult to enforce and contradicts standard legal practices.",

                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof, and will be automatically renewed for one (1) additional twelve month period unless either party shall notify the other in writing of its intention not to renew. Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the automatic renewal clause creates ambiguity. Without the renewal provision, it's unclear whether the agreement automatically terminates after the initial 12 months, even though a termination clause with 90-day notice exists. This omission contradicts the intention implied by the survival of the termination clause and creates uncertainty around the agreement's lifespan beyond the initial term.",

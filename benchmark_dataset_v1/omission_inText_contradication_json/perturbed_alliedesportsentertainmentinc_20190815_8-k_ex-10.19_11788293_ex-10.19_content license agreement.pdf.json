                "original_text": "Royalty. Zynga will pay to WPT ten percent (10%) of the cumulative Net Revenue (as defined in Section 3.b. of the Additional Provisions) (“Royalty”) from the WPT-branded Zynga Poker Tournament Mode or other such use of the WPT brand on the Zynga platform. Zynga shall not be required to pay the Royalty to the extent offset by the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments previously paid to WPT during the Term. Conversely, Zynga shall not be required to make Annual Minimum Guarantee payments to the extent offset by the Royalty previously paid to WPT during the Term.",
                "changed_text": "Royalty. Zynga will pay to WPT a percentage of the cumulative Net Revenue (“Royalty”) from the WPT-branded Zynga Poker Tournament Mode or other such use of the WPT brand on the Zynga platform. Zynga shall not be required to pay the Royalty to the extent offset by the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments previously paid to WPT during the Term. Conversely, Zynga shall not be required to make Annual Minimum Guarantee payments to the extent offset by the Royalty previously paid to WPT during the Term.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific royalty percentage (10%) creates an ambiguity. While the term \"Royalty\" is still used, the actual percentage is no longer defined in this section, even though Section 3 refers to it. This creates an internal contradiction, making royalty calculation uncertain.",

                "explanation": "By removing the distinction between Zynga US and Zynga Ireland and replacing it with 'Zynga's internal distribution policies', we introduce ambiguity regarding which entity is responsible for specific regions. Other sections referencing the defined responsibilities of each entity now become unclear regarding which 'Zynga' is responsible. This creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

By removing this information, the original text, which may reference 'Zynga Indemnified Parties' or specific breaches, becomes unclear, introducing significant risk and uncertainty.",

In the event that Customer elects to extend the Initial Term of the Agreement or of a Facility Addendum,\nthe Price for each applicable Product in any Extension Period shall be one hundred percent (100%) of Manufacturer’s Standard\nProduct Materials Cost plus one hundred and ten percent (110%) of Manufacturer’s Standard Conversion Cost of such Product, each\nfor the initial Fiscal Year of the first Extension Period with respect to such Product. During each Extension Period, the Price of such\nProduct may be adjusted as set forth in Section 3.2; provided that the initial Fiscal Year of the first Extension Period shall operate as\nthe Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year (as defined below).",

In the event that Customer elects to extend the Initial Term of the Agreement or of a Facility Addendum,\nthe Price for each applicable Product in any Extension Period shall be determined by mutual agreement of the parties, considering market conditions at the time of extension.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity in price determination for extension periods. While Section 3.1(a) references a specific calculation method, the changed Section 3.1(b) replaces this with a vague 'mutual agreement' based on 'market conditions'. This creates a contradiction as the contract now simultaneously suggests two different ways to calculate the price, making enforcement uncertain because the price is a key term, and the removal of that calculation and addition of undefined metric cause a great amount of perturbation.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'Customer-Owned Improvements and Developments' from the scope of the license and subsequent clauses, this change contradicts Section 8.2(b), which explicitly assigns ownership of these improvements to the Customer. This creates uncertainty because while Customer owns these improvements, the manufacturer's right to use them is no longer clearly defined, making the contract internally inconsistent.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific details of what 'Technical Support' entails (supply of a technical package, host site visits, etc.), and replacing it with a general statement that the terms will be mutually agreed upon later, this contradicts other parts of Section 2.10 that still reference these specific forms of support. This lack of a definite clause makes the nature of Technical Support uncertain and creates an internal inconsistency as previously mentioned support is no longer defined.",

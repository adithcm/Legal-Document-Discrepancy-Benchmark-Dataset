Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark solely and exclusively as a component of Licensee’s own corporate name and in connection with marketing the investment management, investment consultation and investment advisory services that Investment Advisor may provide to Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this License, and except as provided above, neither Licensee nor any affiliate, owner, director, officer, employee or agent thereof shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivative thereof in the Territory without the prior express written consent of Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion and shall not use the Licensed Mark for any purpose outside the Territory. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'in connection with marketing the investment management, investment consultation and investment advisory services that Investment Advisor may provide to Licensee' from the license grant, the scope of permissible use of the Licensed Mark becomes ambiguous. The Licensee is still allowed to use the mark, but the removal of the explicit connection to marketing advisory services creates uncertainty if the Licensee wants to use the trademark for marketing materials.",

In order to preserve the inherent value of the Licensed Mark, Licensee agrees to use reasonable efforts to ensure that it maintains the quality of the Licensee’s business and the operation thereof equal to the standards prevailing in the operation of Licensee’s business as of the Effective Date. The Licensee further agrees to use the Licensed Mark in accordance with such quality standards as may be reasonably established by Licensor and communicated to the Licensee from time to time in writing, or as may be agreed to by Licensor and the Licensee from time to time in writing.",

                "explanation": "Removing the second sentence of Section 2.1 eliminates the Licensor's ability to unilaterally set quality standards. This creates a contradiction because the Licensee is required to maintain quality, but there is no clear mechanism or standard to define or enforce 'quality' beyond the initial standard at the Effective Date. This creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Mark shall cease, and Licensee shall immediately delete the term “Palmer Square” from its corporate name and shall discontinue all other use of the Licensed Mark. For twenty-four (24) months following termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall specify on all public-facing materials in a prominent place and in prominent typeface that Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'is no longer associated with Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim' limits the scope of the required disclaimer post-termination. Now, Licensee doesn't need to disclaim its association with Licensor. This makes future legal interpretation and enforceability vague.",

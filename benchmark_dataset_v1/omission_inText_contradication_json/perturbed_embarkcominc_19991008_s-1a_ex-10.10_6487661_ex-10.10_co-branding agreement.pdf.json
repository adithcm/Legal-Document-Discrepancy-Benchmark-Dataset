                "explanation": "The reference to Section 2.2 for the development of Co-Branded Pages is removed. However, Section 2.2 is still present in the contract, creating a contradiction regarding where the specifications for developing Co-Branded Pages are defined. This creates uncertainty in determining the exact procedure for creating the Co-Branded Pages.",

This makes it unclear who is considered a 'Client' for non-solicitation purposes.",

Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees, during the term of this Agreement (except pursuant to this Agreement) and for a period of 12 months thereafter, not to solicit any Client Introduced by the other party in connection with an assignment on Covered Businesses involving Japanese Companies where all principal parties involved are located within Covered Regions.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, this provision shall not prevent any party from soliciting or otherwise contacting any Client (i) for any purpose other than working on or obtaining an assignment on Covered Businesses involving Japanese Companies in Covered Regions where all principal parties involved are located within Covered Regions or (ii) with whom such party (or its employees or consultants) has had a pre-existing relationship, including, but not limited to, a pre-existing contractual or business relationship, prior to the Introduction of such Client in connection with an assignment covered by this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Removing the limitations of \"Introduced by the other party in connection with an assignment on Covered Businesses involving Japanese Companies where all principal parties involved are located within Covered Regions\" expands the scope of the non-solicitation clause. This conflicts with the modified definition of \"Client\" in Section 3.5, creating ambiguity about which clients are protected by the non-solicitation agreement. Does it apply to all clients of either party or just clients they've jointly worked with? How do we deal with Clients that pre-existed the agreement?",

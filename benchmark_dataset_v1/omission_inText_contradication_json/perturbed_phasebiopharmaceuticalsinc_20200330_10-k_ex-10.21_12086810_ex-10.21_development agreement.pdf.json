                "original_text": "1.1.42 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means with respect to the performance of activities under this Agreement by a Party (as pertains to its role in conducting the Clinical Trials): reasonable, diligent, good-faith efforts to accomplish such objective which are consistent with industry standards for companies of comparable size as that of such Party. “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” requires, with respect to a particular task or activity in making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, exporting, developing (including seeking regulatory approvals or applicable pricing or reimbursement approvals) or otherwise commercializing the Product, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such task or activity to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis; (ii) set and consistently seek to achieve specific and meaningful objectives for carrying out such task or activity; and (iii) make and implement decisions and allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives in accordance with established timelines; provided, however, that, to the extent that the performance of a Party’s obligations hereunder is adversely affected by the other Party’s breach in performing its obligations hereunder, the impact on the first Party of such performance failure by the other Party will be taken into account in determining whether the first Party has used its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to perform any such affected obligations.",
                "changed_text": "1.1.42 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means efforts made in good faith. To the extent that the performance of a Party’s obligations hereunder is adversely affected by the other Party’s breach in performing its obligations hereunder, the impact on the first Party of such performance failure by the other Party will be taken into account in determining whether the first Party has used its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to perform any such affected obligations.",
                "explanation": "The change removes the specific requirements of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts,' like assigning responsibility, setting objectives, and allocating resources. Other sections of the agreement, like 2.3.1 which references this definition, now become ambiguous. Without a clear definition, enforcing the obligation to use 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' becomes difficult because it is vague.",

                "original_text": "2.3.1 The Timeline. The timeline for conducting the Clinical Trials is attached as Exhibit I hereto (the “Timeline”). In conducting the Clinical Trials, the Parties will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to complete each activity specified on the Timeline (each, a “Clinical Trial Activity”) by the date specified for such Clinical Trial Activity on the Timeline. The Parties will notify the JDC in writing upon completion or achievement of each of their designated Clinical Trial Activities.",
                "changed_text": "2.3.1 The Timeline. The timeline for conducting the Clinical Trials is attached as Exhibit I hereto (the “Timeline”). In conducting the Clinical Trials, the Parties will endeavor to complete each activity specified on the Timeline (each, a “Clinical Trial Activity”) by the date specified for such Clinical Trial Activity on the Timeline. The Parties will notify the JDC in writing upon completion or achievement of each of their designated Clinical Trial Activities.",
                "explanation": "The change removes the specific reference to 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' and replaces it with 'endeavor,' weakening the obligation. Since 1.1.42 no longer has the original robust meaning, and this section was modified, this creates ambiguity because 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 still references the previous definition, creating in-text contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the approval of budgets for CROs and vendors allows PB to change those vendors and costs as it sees fit without approval. This change in the document leads to contradicting information, since some budget reviews require the 'Reasonable Commercially Efforts' which lacks a proper definition.",

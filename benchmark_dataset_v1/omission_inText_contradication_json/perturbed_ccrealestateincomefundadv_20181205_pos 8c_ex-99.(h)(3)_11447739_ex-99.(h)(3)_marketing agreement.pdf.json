This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of marketing activities performed without proper legal registration or specific agreements.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'broker-dealer related' from the first paragraph and 'specifically the AdLit Advertising Review System (“AdLit”), and that Distributor will base its reviews on: (i) the guidelines contained within Distributor’s Sales and Advertising Guide and Distributor’s Written Supervisory Procedures; (ii) rules and guidance issued by FINRA and the SEC related to communications with the public and/or communications to institutional investors, as those terms are defined in FINRA Rules 2210 and 2211 and in various other FINRA and SEC rules and interpretive material' from the second paragraph, the changed text creates ambiguity. The text removes the specific reference to FINRA and SEC regulations, creating the contradiction of what rules apply to the marketing reviews. This can introduce uncertainty as to the level of oversight needed and may contradict Section 9 which discusses fund material regulation.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'including proper registration and licensing with the SEC and or FINRA, as applicable' from (ii) and 'and FINRA, as applicable' from (iii), the modified section omits S2K's explicit obligation to maintain FINRA registration. This creates a contradiction, as the agreement elsewhere assumes S2K's adherence to FINRA regulations (e.g., regarding marketing materials in Section 2(b), and dealer reallowance fees in Exhibit B). This omission weakens Distributor's assurance of compliance and introduces uncertainty in the enforceability of FINRA-related provisions. It creates the contradiction that the contract requires S2K to follow FINRA, but doesn't require them to be registered with FINRA.",

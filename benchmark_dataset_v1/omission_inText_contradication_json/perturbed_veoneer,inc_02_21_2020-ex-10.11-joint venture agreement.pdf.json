                "original_text": "As of the VNBJ Closing, except as expressly set forth in this Amendment, the JV Agreement shall immediately cease to have any application or effect with respect to VNBJ, all rights and obligations with respect to VNBJ under the JV Agreement shall terminate and all references to “Company” or “Companies” in the JV Agreement (either in the body of the JV Agreement or its schedules and other attachments) shall read and be interpreted to mean VNBZ and/or ANRA except as the context otherwise requires.",
                "changed_text": "As of the VNBJ Closing, the JV Agreement shall immediately cease to have any application or effect with respect to VNBJ, all rights and obligations with respect to VNBJ under the JV Agreement shall terminate.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'all references to “Company” or “Companies” in the JV Agreement (either in the body of the JV Agreement or its schedules and other attachments) shall read and be interpreted to mean VNBZ and/or ANRA except as the context otherwise requires', the contract now creates ambiguity. Later sections might refer to 'Company' and 'Companies' without clear indication of whether they refer to only VNBZ and/or ANRA, or if VNBJ is still implicitly included under some circumstances. This creates uncertainty in the enforcement of clauses that use these terms.",

                "explanation": "Similar to the first change, omitting the phrase 'all references to “Company” or “Companies” in the JV Agreement (either in the body of the JV Agreement or its schedules and other attachments) shall read and be interpreted to mean VNBJ and/or ANRA except as the context otherwise requires' from this section regarding VNBZ creates ambiguity. Sections referencing 'Company' and 'Companies' become unclear in scope. The contract states that references to 'Company' will mean VNBJ and/or ANRA. Removing this creates ambiguity. Are there any clauses now referring to old definitions? This causes potential disputes and uncertain enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This edit creates an omission where VNBJ and VNBZ are no longer mentioned in the D&O Indemnity clause. However, the previous clauses (Article 1.a and 1.b) only terminated the agreement with respect to those entities. This change contradicts that Article 1.d states, 'the termination of the JV Agreement with respect to VNBJ, VNBZ or the Veoneer Parties shall not release any Veoneer Party or any Nissin Party from liability for the breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the JV Agreement that arise prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable.', as the edited Article 2.D&O Indemnity clause only discusses ANRA.",

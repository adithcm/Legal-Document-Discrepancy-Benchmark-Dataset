                "explanation": "By removing 'useful for the Development, Manufacture' and '(ii) is or becomes Controlled by SIGA or its Affiliates during the Term' from the definition of SIGA Know-How, the scope of knowledge that MMT is licensed to use for promotion is drastically reduced. This creates an inconsistency with later sections that assume a broader definition, thus limiting MMT's ability to effectively promote the product and creating a potential breach of contract if MMT relies on Know-How developed after the Effective Date or related to Development/Manufacture. Also, this change directly affects Article 7, which is related to Intellectual Property.",

MMT may prepare marketing, advertising, promotional materials and other communications relating to the Product for Promotion use in the Field in the Territory. All such materials shall be truthful and non-misleading, and in compliance with applicable Laws, and subject to review by SIGA through the JSC; provided that the final decision to use any approved materials will be at the sole discretion of MMT.\n(d) Subject to Section 4.2, SIGA shall provide reasonable assistance to MMT with respect to MMT’s conduct of Promotion activities with respect to the Product in the Field in the Territory as specifically set forth in the Business Plan, including providing responses to medical inquiries communicated to MMT’s sales representatives or other external-facing MMT representatives or received by MMT by letter, phone call or email or other means of communication, at MMT’s sole cost and expense; provided, however, SIGA shall solely be responsible for the costs and expenses associated with the response to any medical inquiries.\n(e) MMT will provide appropriate (as determined by MMT in its sole discretion) training (including regarding compliance with applicable Laws) of the MMT Promotion Personnel who will be communicating with potential customers about the Product.\n(f) Subject to Section 13.6, MMT may not use any subcontractor that is not a Permitted Sublicensee to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Several key changes introduce contradictions. Removing \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" weakens MMT's obligation, potentially conflicting with other clauses requiring diligence. Omitting \"Pfizer policies and practices regarding advertising, marketing, promotional and other Product-specific communications\" removes MMT's ability to adhere to their policies, creating liability issues if these policies are required in another section. Removing the review process by SIGA through the JSC on marketing materials and giving MMT total discretion can introduce the risk of unapproved communications. This change can affect Article 3 related to Governance.",

For each Active Country, SIGA shall prosecute (a) applications in respect of any SIGA Patents listed on Schedule 1, and (b) trademark registrations for the SIGA Trademarks listed on Schedule 2 (or such other Trademark in respect of the Products as mutually agreed by the Parties at the JSC), in each case ((a) and (b)), with the appropriate Governmental Authorities, provided that there are no Trademarks which may be substantially similar or Patents which may limit patentability, and provided further, if SIGA determines that it is not commercially reasonable to prosecute such Patents and Trademarks, SIGA shall consult with MMT in respect of the appropriate prosecution strategy in such Active Country. For clarity, any new Patent or Trademark filed and/or registered, as applicable, by SIGA, pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be deemed a SIGA Patent or a SIGA Trademark, respectively, and shall be subject to the grant of rights to MMT set forth in Section 2.1. SIGA’s obligation to make the filings described in the first sentence of this Section 7.3 shall not apply with respect to an Active Country if the Product is sold in such Active Country pursuant to a Special Access Approval or other Regulatory Approval, without the need to file for SIGA Patents or SIGA Trademarks in such country.",

                "explanation": "The significant omission of \"at its sole discretion\" from Section 7.2, in combination with removing the conditions for SIGA to prosecute trademark and patent applications in Section 7.3, puts SIGA under an obligation to take responsibilities for trademark and patent applications. Also, removing the clause relating to SIGA consulting with MMT in respect of the appropriate prosecution strategy can create disputes if MMT believes SIGA's chosen strategy is harming commercialization efforts.",

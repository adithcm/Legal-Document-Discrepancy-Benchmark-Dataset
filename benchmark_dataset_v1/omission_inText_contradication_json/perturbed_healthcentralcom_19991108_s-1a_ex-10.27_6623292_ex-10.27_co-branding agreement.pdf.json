Either Party shall have the right from time to time to audit and make extracts of the books and records of the other, insofar as said books or records pertain to the terms of this Agreement. Any such audit shall take place upon not less than seven (7) days advance written notice, during normal business hours of normal business days and at reasonable intervals. Any such audit shall be at the requesting Party's expense, unless the audit determines that the other party has underpaid by 10% or more. In the event that the calculation of payments herein is determined by a computer-based system, then the \"books and records\" shall include, without limitation, the machine-sensible data (e.g. punch cards, magnetic tapes, discsÍ¾",
                "changed_text": "Both Parties shall keep records of revenue generated as a result of the Co-Branded Site. Either Party may audit the other's records, as permitted by applicable law.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specified the conditions, process, and scope of auditing rights. The modified version removes all specifics, only stating that parties 'may audit' within legal limits. This creates ambiguity: can an audit be refused if 'applicable law' doesn't explicitly mandate access? The explicit seven-day notice and definition of 'books and records' are removed, creating enforcement uncertainty. It references records but doesn't define them so parties will have issues when enforcing the contract and creates issues with conflicting interpreations.",

                "original_text": "During the first six (6) months from the Launch date, the primary branding for the Co-Branded Site shall remain HealthyWay. In addition to the foregoing and subject to mutual design approval, a \"Powered By HealthCentral\" or such other appropriate tag line shall appear on the Co-Branded Site and shall be approximately 80% of the font size of the HealthyWay title and will be close to the HealthyWay brand. Thereafter, the HealthyWay and Health Central trademarks shall be co-branded in a mutually agreed upon method. The URL for the Co-Branded Site shall remain healthyway.sympatico.ca. A separate redirect URL may be set up for the Co-Branded Site, e.g. healthcentral.sympatico.ca.",
                "changed_text": "Branding for the Co-Branded Site shall be determined by mutual agreement. The URL for the Co-Branded Site shall remain healthyway.sympatico.ca.",
                "explanation": "The original text defined branding for the first six months and provided specifics regarding the 'Powered By HealthCentral' tag line. The revision removes these details, stating branding is 'determined by mutual agreement.' While ostensibly collaborative, this creates an enforcement problem: if parties disagree on branding *after* the initial six months, the contract provides no default, leading to potential breaches or deadlock. The removal of size specifications for the tag also gives way to issues with trademark or branding violations. This contradicts the initial specific requirements and creates uncertainty in long-term implementation and creates issues with conflicting interpreations.",

                "explanation": "The original specified MLX commitment with examples of the ads. By changing 'frequent and timely fashion' to 'various methods', as well as omitting all banner, link descriptions (persistent, in fold), and promotion, the contract now has no metrics or standards for MLX's advertising efforts. This weakens HCI's ability to enforce the promotion clause, since 'various methods' is vague. While it is clear a link is provided, parties can question the intent and purpose of all other removed considerations. This creates issues with conflicting interpreations.",

L.

                "explanation": "The omission of specific deductible expenses from the definition of \"Net Sales\" (taxes, discounts, rebates, REMS compliance costs, serialization expenses) creates an inconsistency. Section 6 which stipulates milestone payments and royalties relies on the 'Net Sales' metric. By removing the details of how the metric is actually calculated, it creates ambiguity over which deductions ETON can claim against Aucta's royalty payment and can cause disagreement on the milestone payouts as well.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the key phrase 'the failure to execute is solely caused by the refusal or inability of the proposed manufacturing organization to sign a reasonable agreement' creates a contradiction. Without that phrase, it leaves the 'effectiveness' of the agreement in limbo, by opening a possibility where even if ETON does not execute a commercial agreement, this contract is still effective. This is contradictory to the 'good faith' requirement outlined in several sections of the original contract.",

                "original_text": "SOFTWARE\nPC QUOTE 6.0-TM- for Windows on the Internet is a software application that\ndisplays market data information, provided via the digital Hyperfeed, in the\nform of quotes, charts, graphs, tables, board views, tickers and other\nanalytical tools.",
                "changed_text": "SOFTWARE\nSoftware refers to the programs provided under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies the software's capabilities (quotes, charts, etc.). The modified version removes these specifics, leading to uncertainty about what functionalities ABW is entitled to, especially if Schedule A (fee schedule) references specific features related to the original detailed definition. This creates a contradiction between the expectation of detailed functionality and the vagueness of the new definition.",

ABW will commence payment\nof a monthly fee for the right to permit access by ABW's clients to said\nSOFTWARE and HYPERFEED.",
                "changed_text": "ABW will commence payment of a monthly fee for access to services.",
                "explanation": "Removing the explicit reference to 'Schedule A' and the 'SOFTWARE and HYPERFEED' creates ambiguity. The original clause ties the commencement of payment to a specific fee schedule and the provision of specific services. The modified clause lacks these ties, making it unclear how the monthly fee is determined and what services it covers. This contradicts later sections that might reference Schedule A or specific service levels.",

                "changed_text": "Any payments which have not been received by PCQ within thirty (30)\ndays of the Invoice date shall be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific rate of 1.0% per month (12% APR), the contract now states there's a finance charge, but doesn't define its amount. This is an internal contradiction because the penalty for late payment is mentioned but left undefined.  It also makes enforcement difficult as the actual charge is not specified, therefore, becomes unenforceable",

                "explanation": "By omitting the specific list of equipment, the contract becomes ambiguous. Later sections refer to \"Licensed Equipment\" (e.g., Sections 2.5, 2.7, 5.4), but without a definitive list, it's unclear which equipment is subject to the license, creating uncertainty and potential disputes. The term \"Licensed Equipment\" is still used and is undefined creating in-text contradiction.",

In consideration of the license of Liquidmetal Technical Information and the Licensed Equipment granted by\nLiquidmetal, Eutectix agrees to pay Liquidmetal a cash royalty based on a percentage of the invoice price of any Licensed\nProducts (but not including Liquidmetal Products) sold by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees and for which payment was\nactually received by Eutectix. The cash royalty shall be an amount equal to six percent (6.0%) of the Net Sales Price of the\ninvoice price of any Licensed Products and for which payment was actually received by Eutectix (the “Liquidmetal Royalty”).\n“Net Sales Price” is defined as the gross invoice price actually received by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees on the sale\nof Licensed Products, less returns or refunds, but before deduction of cash discounts. The Net Sales Price shall be\ncommercially reasonable, and in no case shall the Net Sales Price be less than the cost of material consumed in a single\nmanufacturing cycle, divided by the number of Licensed Products produced by such single cycle. The Liquidmetal Royalty\nshall be paid in U.S. dollars within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, based on payments received for sales of\nLicensed Products made during a given quarter.

                "explanation": "By removing the specific definition of the cash royalty percentage and how the Net Sales Price is calculated, and replacing it with \"mutually agreeable parameters\" introduces significant ambiguity. The latter part of this section and subsequent sections such as 2.10 continue to refer to \"Liquidmetal Royalty\" and sales of \"Licensed Products\" as if a clear calculation method exists creating contradiction. The enforceability of the royalty payment becomes highly uncertain.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the reference to Schedule 2, which details the 'Minimum Insurance Requirements', Section 12.3 becomes vague and unenforceable. The contract still requires Eutectix to maintain insurance and Liquidmetal to approve the terms. Schedule 2 is mentioned in the change from original text, but is not a part of modified text. Since the schedule is removed and the phrase \"meeting or exceeding the minimum insurance requirements set forth on Schedule 2\" is removed, the reference to the schedule creates an in-text contradiction.",

Royalty: In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox, or such other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n(a) From the first unit sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee’s Gross Receipts\n(as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee’s sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.\n(“IA2 Audio and Video Royalty”).  For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may not recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2\nGuarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific royalty rate, the agreement still mandates a royalty payment, but the exact percentage is undefined. This creates uncertainty because while a payment is expected, the amount is now subject to interpretation, referencing the 'Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1)' without clearly stating the royalty rate.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Paragraphs 7(b)(ii) and 7(b)(iii) of the Agreement, the specific method for treating VGSL and other CSP payments is no longer defined within this amendment. The contract now ambiguously defers to 'standard industry practices,' which may be interpreted differently by each party and therefore cause dispute. A contradiction is created if other sections of the contract continue to mention paragraphs 7(b)(ii) and 7(b)(iii).",

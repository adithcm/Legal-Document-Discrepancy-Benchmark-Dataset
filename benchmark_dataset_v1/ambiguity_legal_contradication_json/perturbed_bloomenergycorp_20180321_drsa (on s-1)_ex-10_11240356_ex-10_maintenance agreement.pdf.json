                "original_text": "Operator shall ensure that operation, service and maintenance records concerning Operator’s activities hereunder are properly created and maintained at all times. Such records shall include, but not be limited to, the following:\n(i) a separate “Maintenance Specification Log” for each Bloom System in a paper or electronic format (with entries made for each\ninspection, including any discrepancies found during such inspection), a copy of which shall be submitted, in paper or electronic format, to\nOwner along with the corresponding Annual Reports;\n(ii) a Site service report completed in respect of each inspection, repair, replacement, service or other activity or observation made by\nOperator in connection with its responsibilities hereunder, detailing the nature of the problems detected and the specifics of the problem\nresolution and submitted to Owner within ten (10) Business Days of the date when a service technician is dispatched to the site in response\nto a Bloom System or BOF fault or routine inspection or service;\n(iii) an annual report submitted to Owner within forty-five (45) Business Days after the end of each calendar year (“Annual Report”)\ncontaining sufficient information, detail and documentation as may be requested by Owner relating to the operating performance of the\nBloom System for the preceding calendar year; and\n(iv) all records and data that must be timely produced and turned over to (A) DPL pursuant the QFCP-RC Tariff (including without\nlimitation, the Heat Rate calculations as set forth in QFCP-RC Tariff Section C., and monthly documentation of PJM Revenues as set forth in\nQFCP-RC Tariff Section H.) and the DPL Agreements, (B) PJM pursuant to the PJM Agreements or (C) the Owner’s Lender pursuant to the\nCredit Documents; and\n(v) such other reports and/or documentation prepared by Operator concerning its activities hereunder as may be reasonably required of\nan “Operator” of a Qualified Fuel Cell Project under the REPS Act and the QFCP-RC Tariff or as requested by Owner from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "Operator shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that operation, service and maintenance records concerning Operator’s activities hereunder are created and maintained. Such records may include the following:\n(i) a “Maintenance Specification Log” for each Bloom System in a format determined by the Operator (with entries reflecting inspections), a copy of which may be submitted to Owner along with the Annual Reports, if convenient;\n(ii) a Site service report completed when deemed necessary by Operator, generally detailing activities and observations, and submitted to Owner when practical;\n(iii) an annual report submitted to Owner containing information as Operator considers relevant relating to the operating performance of the Bloom System for the preceding calendar year;\n(iv) records and data shared with (A) DPL pursuant the QFCP-RC Tariff, (B) PJM pursuant to the PJM Agreements or (C) the Owner’s Lender pursuant to the Credit Documents, to the extent reasonably feasible; and\n(v) other reports and documentation prepared by Operator concerning its activities hereunder.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates specific record-keeping activities. The revised language introduces ambiguity by using terms like 'reasonable efforts,' 'may include,' 'when deemed necessary,' 'when practical,' and 'as Operator considers relevant.' This weakens the legal obligation to maintain and submit thorough and timely records, making it difficult to enforce specific requirements under the REPS Act and the QFCP-RC Tariff. Changing \"must be timely produced and turned over to\" to \"shared with...to the extent reasonably feasible\" makes it unclear if the operator is required to fulfill its obligation",

                "explanation": "The original text places a strict obligation on the Operator to maintain and comply with all permits. The modified language replaces 'shall be responsible...for maintaining and complying with' with 'shall endeavor to maintain and comply with.' This weakens the obligation, suggesting that the Operator will only make an effort to comply, rather than ensuring full compliance, which contradicts the requirements of Delaware state law for operating such facilities.",

These considerations do not create any additional obligations.",
                "explanation": "The original language creates a strong obligation for the operator to strictly adhere to a list of performance standards. The revised language uses terms like 'generally consider,' 'to the extent practical,' 'where feasible,' and 'as applicable,' making the obligation discretionary rather than mandatory. This contradicts standards set by Delaware regulations. The new language implies the Operator is not legally bound to adhere to the requirements, creating ambiguities and weakening the legal obligation.",

                "original_text": "(a) From and after the date hereof, each Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts\nto cause its or their respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning Buyer, the\nCompany and the Company Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such Seller can show that such information: (i) is generally available to and\nknown by the public through no fault of any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or (ii) is lawfully acquired by such Seller,\nany of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the date hereof from sources that are not prohibited from disclosing such\ninformation by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If any Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives are compelled to\ndisclose any information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, such Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing\nand shall disclose only that portion of such information that such Seller is advised by its counsel is legally required to be disclosed, provided that\nsuch Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will\nbe accorded such information.",
                "changed_text": "(a) From and after the date hereof, each Seller shall endeavor, and shall encourage its Affiliates, to maintain confidentiality regarding information concerning Buyer, the Company, and the Company Subsidiaries. Disclosure of such information may occur if (i) the Seller believes the information is generally available to the public, or (ii) the Seller obtains the information from sources they perceive as reliable. Should disclosure be necessary due to legal requirements, the Seller will inform Buyer and disclose only the information they feel is absolutely necessary, while perhaps seeking some form of confidential treatment if easily obtainable.",
                "explanation": "The original text places a clear obligation on the seller to maintain confidentiality using 'reasonable best efforts'. The modified text weakens this obligation by using 'endeavor' and 'encourage', which are less forceful. It also introduces subjectivity by allowing the Seller to determine what they 'believe' is public knowledge and what sources they 'perceive' as reliable, undermining the duty of confidentiality and creating ambiguity in required action. The phrase 'only the information they feel is absolutely necessary' introduces further subjectivity.",

                "original_text": "(b) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the “Non-\nCompete Period”), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer’s capital stock or any other interests in Buyer,\ndirectly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any\nbusiness which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged\nin any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall:\n(i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, not more than five (5%) percent\ncollectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged;\n(ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in such Seller’s business as conducted on the Effective Date\nand reasonable extensions thereof, which may include routine, day-to-day transactions with any entity, and\n(iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller acquires control after the Effective Date provided that the acquired\nbusiness did not receive more than $25,000,000 of its aggregate net sales (as measured during the 12 full calendar\nmonths prior to such acquisition) from product lines included within the definition of Company Business.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the “Non-Compete Period”), it should generally refrain from activities that directly compete with the Combined Business, considering their ownership of Buyer’s capital stock. Ideally, they will not own, manage, or control competing businesses outside of India, but this is subject to reasonable interpretation based on the specific circumstances. Specifically:\n(i) Sellers are generally allowed to own up to five (5%) percent of publicly traded securities of competing entities, unless such ownership significantly impacts the Combined Business.\n(ii) Sellers may continue engaging in their existing business activities, with extensions as they deem appropriate, which could include transactions with any entity.\n(iii) Restrictions may not strictly apply to businesses acquired after the Effective Date if their sales from relevant product lines are relatively insignificant.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces the firm 'shall not' with weaker language like 'should generally refrain', 'ideally', and 'may', making the non-compete obligation discretionary. The phrases 'reasonable interpretation based on the specific circumstances,' 'unless such ownership significantly impacts,' 'extensions as they deem appropriate,' and 'relatively insignificant' introduce ambiguity, allowing sellers to circumvent the non-compete clause based on subjective evaluations. This diminishes the enforceability of the clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pennsylvania law on non-compete agreements, which requires clear and unambiguous terms to be enforceable. Vague or subjective terms can render the agreement unenforceable, undermining the protection of the buyer's business interests.",

To this end, the parties agree that the covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be construed to extend in\ntime and territory and with respect to degree of participation only so far as they may be enforced in such jurisdiction, and that the covenants\ncontained in this Section 1 are to that end hereby declared divisible and severable. It being the purpose of this Section 1 to govern competition by\nthe Sellers and their respective subsidiaries, the non-competition covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be governed by and construed\naccording to the Law of all the jurisdictions in which competition in breach of this Agreement is alleged to have occurred or to be threatened that\nbest gives them effect.",
                "changed_text": "(e) The parties hope that the covenants in Section 1 will be generally upheld to a reasonable extent, as allowed by the applicable jurisdiction's laws, should a breach be alleged. To this end, the covenants should be interpreted flexibly in terms of time, area, and participation, within the bounds of what the jurisdiction might permit. The intention is to address competition by the Sellers and their subsidiaries in a manner that seems fair under the circumstances, with the governing law being that of jurisdictions where a breach is thought to have occurred, aiming for a practical outcome.",
                "explanation": "The original clause aims for maximum enforcement allowable by law. The modified version weakens this significantly by replacing 'shall be enforced to the greatest extent' with 'hope that the covenants...will be generally upheld to a reasonable extent' and 'should be interpreted flexibly'. The phrases 'as allowed by the applicable jurisdiction's laws, should a breach be alleged', 'within the bounds of what the jurisdiction might permit', 'in a manner that seems fair under the circumstances', and 'aiming for a practical outcome' introduce a level of subjectivity and uncertainty that can undermine the enforceability of the covenants. This ambiguity contradicts the intention of the original clause to maximize protection for the Buyer.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pennsylvania law favors clear and unambiguous contractual language. By introducing subjectivity and weakening the enforcement provisions, this modification creates a situation where a court might find the clause unenforceable due to its vagueness, contradicting the principle of upholding the parties' intended agreement.",

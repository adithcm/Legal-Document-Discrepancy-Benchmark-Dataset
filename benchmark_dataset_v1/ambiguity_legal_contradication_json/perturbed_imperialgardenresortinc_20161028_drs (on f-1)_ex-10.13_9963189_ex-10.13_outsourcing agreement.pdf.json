                "explanation": "The original text has a clear mandate; Party B 'shall follow all instructions' and 'ensure all plans and designs' meet regulations. The modified text introduces 'endeavor to', 'reasonable efforts', and 'perceived' which weakens the obligation and leaves it open to interpretation, creating ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Taiwan Building Act and related regulations require strict adherence to building codes and regulations. Ambiguity undermines the compliance aspect.",

                "explanation": "The original states that Party B 'shall take on a professional attitude' and 'maintain benefits'. The change introduces terms like 'should, where feasible,' 'what it considers a professional attitude', 'consider', and 'potentially adopt a reasonably economical option while generally prioritizing safety'. This significantly weakens the obligations and introduces subjective assessment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Professional negligence standards in Taiwan, where architects and engineers are expected to adhere to a certain standard of care and competence. The modified text creates loopholes that could allow for substandard work.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'obligatory to report the latest progress and completed content' with 'expected to periodically update on progress made', the modified text removes the mandatory nature of reporting and leaves the frequency and content of the updates vague.",

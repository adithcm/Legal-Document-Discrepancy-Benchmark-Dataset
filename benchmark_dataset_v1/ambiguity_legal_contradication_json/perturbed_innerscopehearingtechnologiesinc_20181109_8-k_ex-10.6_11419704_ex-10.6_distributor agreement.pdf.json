                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor shall at all times comply with all applicable laws and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall endeavor to comply with what they understand to be applicable laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing the mandatory 'shall comply' with the discretionary 'shall endeavor to comply with what they understand to be.' The added phrase 'what they understand to be' makes compliance subjective and based on the distributor's interpretation, rather than strict adherence to all laws. This contradicts the general legal principle of mandatory compliance with laws and regulations, and depending on the specific law, could result in legal violations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Legal Principle of Mandatory Compliance with Laws and Regulations; Specific regulations like FDA requirements if products are not handled correctly, or anti-kickback statutes if products are inappropriately marketed.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor shall maintain appropriate records concerning the sales of the Products. Such records shall include at a minimum the name, address and telephone number of each customer, the date of sale, a listing of the Products sold to each customer. Upon Erchoniaâ€™s request, Distributor shall provide Erchonia with regular periodic reports including the information described in this paragraph.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall keep records concerning the sales of the Products as they deem fit. Distributor shall provide Erchonia with reports occasionally.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the record-keeping obligation. Replacing 'maintain appropriate records' with 'keep records as they deem fit' introduces a subjective standard, and removing detail from the reports makes monitoring difficult. The ambiguity around the frequency of reporting, by replacing 'regular periodic reports' with 'reports occasionally', makes enforcement much harder and can be interpreted in multiple ways. This contradicts general principles that the Distributor must take the required safety measures to provide their clients with quality products.",
                "contradicted_law": "State or Federal Laws governing product distribution where distributors should track patients and their products in case of side effects.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor must adhere to and comply with any use recommendations or restrictions for the Products as indicated or recommended by Erchonia. Distributor shall not make any statements, representations, or recommendations inconsistent with any use restriction or limitation.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor should generally consider use recommendations or restrictions for the Products as indicated or recommended by Erchonia. Distributor may make statements, representations, or recommendations not entirely consistent with any use restriction or limitation.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'must adhere to and comply' to 'should generally consider' and 'shall not' to 'may', the obligation becomes discretionary, allowing the distributor to disregard recommendations. This weakens the adherence to the product guidelines. By changing 'shall not make any statements...inconsistent with any use restriction or limitation' with 'may make statements...not entirely consistent' means that the Distributor does not necessarily have to follow the use recommendations. This ambiguity conflicts with product liability laws requiring accurate representation of product usage and safety. This also affects the quality of products offered by the Distributor.",
                "contradicted_law": "Product Liability Laws; FDA regulations concerning off-label marketing and promotion of medical devices; false advertising laws.",

                "original_text": "The Company shall maintain complete and accurate records of the number of packages shipped by the MBE Centers using the Service and all payments due or accrued to the Company by MBE Centers hereunder. MBE shall, at any time during the term of this Agreement, be entitled to audit all such records upon ten (10) days written notice to the Company, in order to confirm the accuracy of such records and conformance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\nprovided, however, that no more than one (1) such audit may be conducted in any\nninety (90)-day period. Any such audit shall be performed at MBE's expense\nduring the Company's normal business hours; provided, however, that in the event\nthat such audit reveals any non-compliance with any term of this Agreement by\nthe Company, the Company shall bear the cost of such audit.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will endeavor to maintain records of packages shipped by the MBE Centers and payments, and MBE may request an audit of these records with reasonable notice, to generally assess accuracy and conformance. Audits may occur, ideally, no more than once per quarter. Audits are typically at MBE's expense during standard business hours. However, if a significant discrepancy is found, costs may be discussed.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity in several ways. 'Shall maintain complete and accurate records' becomes 'will endeavor to maintain records,' weakening the obligation. 'Entitled to audit' becomes 'may request an audit,' making the audit discretionary. Removing the '10 days written notice' removes a clear obligation. 'To confirm the accuracy of such records' becomes 'to generally assess accuracy,' reducing the standard of accuracy required. Replacing 'no more than one (1) such audit may be conducted in any ninety (90)-day period' with 'Audits may occur, ideally, no more than once per quarter' makes the audit frequency guideline, not a hard limit. By replacing 'the Company shall bear the cost of such audit' with 'costs may be discussed', it removes the clear financial responsibility of the company in case non-compliance is found.",
                "contradicted_law": "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require maintenance of accurate and verifiable financial records, and Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) requires specific internal controls regarding financial reporting. Making record-keeping and auditing discretionary and less accurate could violate these requirements, and principles in California where MBE is incorporated.",

                "changed_text": "MBE and MBE Centers should avoid providing Service Documentation or Confidential Information of the Company, where reasonably possible, to those outside their direct employ who don't obviously require it for agreement-related purposes.",
                "explanation": "The original clause is a clear prohibition on disclosing confidential information to unauthorized individuals. The modified clause introduces ambiguity with phrases like 'should avoid,' which is less forceful than 'agree not to'; 'where reasonably possible,' which allows for subjective interpretation of what is feasible; 'those outside their direct employ,' which is vague; and 'don't obviously require it,' which is subjective and difficult to enforce. This weakens the obligation to protect confidential information.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA) requires reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of trade secrets. This modification undermines the 'reasonable efforts' requirement by making the protection of confidential information discretionary and subjective, exposing the Company to legal risks associated with trade secret misappropriation.",

                "original_text": "The Company will defend, at its expense, any action brought\nagainst MBE and its directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates,\nsuccessors, assigns or franchisees (\"Indemnitees\") based upon a claim that the\nService used properly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the\ntSubscription Agreement infringes a U.S. patent or copyright or misappropriates a\ntrade secret under U.S. law (a \"Claim\"). The Company further agrees to pay all\ndamages and costs (including reasonable attorneys' fee and expert witness fees)\nincurred by any Indemnitee in connection with such Claim.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will consider defending any action brought against MBE and its Indemnitees concerning claims that the Service infringes a U.S. patent or copyright, or misappropriates a trade secret, to the extent the Service was utilized as contemplated. The Company may contribute to covering damages and costs incurred by the Indemnitee relating to the claim.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'will defend, at its expense' with 'will consider defending,' the obligation becomes discretionary. Replacing 'based upon a claim that the Service used properly' with 'to the extent the Service was utilized as contemplated' introduces vagueness about the standards for use. Replacing 'agrees to pay all damages and costs' with 'may contribute to covering damages and costs' makes the financial obligation uncertain. This introduces ambiguity, making it difficult to enforce the indemnification clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "Patent Act (35 U.S. Code § 281) and Copyright Act (17 U.S. Code § 501) provide remedies for patent and copyright infringement, including damages and injunctive relief. This modification weakens the indemnification obligation, potentially leaving MBE without adequate protection against infringement claims, and therefore is a breach of contract.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Parties shall at all times fully comply with all relevant regulations, such as but not limited to, the obligation for ELEPHANT TALK - as providers of public electronic communications services in the Netherlands- to notify OPTA according to article 2.1 of the Dutch Telecommunication Act.",
                "changed_text": "Parties shall endeavor to comply with relevant regulations, such as the notification obligation for ELEPHANT TALK - as providers of public electronic communications services in the Netherlands- to OPTA according to article 2.1 of the Dutch Telecommunication Act.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"shall at all times fully comply\" to \"shall endeavor to comply\" introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. 'Endeavor' suggests an effort rather than a guarantee of compliance, making it difficult to enforce. This contradicts the strict compliance required by the Dutch Telecommunications Act.",

                "explanation": "The modified text uses \"should aim for\" and \"generally align,\" which makes the obligation to comply with technical specifications vague. The original text ensures that there was an explicit compliance, the changed version does not.",

ELEPHANT TALK agrees to inform in writing, before the Ready for Service Date, the relevant Dutch authority (which is at the time of closing of this Agreement the public prosecutor) that T-Mobile will carry out the lawful intercept requests regarding ELEPHANT TALK Customers and that T-Mobile will and is entitled to collect the financial compensation of the concerning authority for these legal intercept activities on behalf of ELEPHANT TALK. ELEPHANT TALK shall provide T-Mobile with a copy of the aforementioned letter to the relevant Dutch authority before the Ready for Service Date.",

ELEPHANT TALK will consider informing the relevant Dutch authority that T-Mobile may handle lawful intercept requests concerning ELEPHANT TALK Customers and potentially collect compensation for these activities. ELEPHANT TALK might provide T-Mobile with a copy of any communication to the relevant Dutch authority.",
                "explanation": "Changes 'shall support' to 'will attempt to support', 'agrees to inform' to 'will consider informing', and 'shall provide' to 'might provide.' These changes significantly weaken the obligation to ensure lawful interception and provide necessary information, thus creating ambiguity regarding compliance with Dutch law regarding law enforcement requests.",
                "contradicted_law": "Dutch law regarding lawful interception (specific regulations would be detailed in Appendix 5, but the principle of mandated cooperation with law enforcement is undermined.)",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "VNUE hereby engages the Promoter as an Independent Contractor to secure contracts for VNUE with Thirty (30) music venues.",
                "changed_text": "VNUE may engage the Promoter as an Independent Contractor to attempt to secure contracts for VNUE with approximately Thirty (30) music venues.",
                "explanation": "The original text obligates VNUE to engage the promoter and sets a fixed target of 30 venues. The modified text makes the engagement discretionary ('may engage'), the target approximate ('approximately'), and the securing of contracts a matter of 'attempt', creating ambiguity about the Promoter's actual obligations and VNUE's expectations. This introduces uncertainty about whether the promoter is actually required to secure any contracts at all.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clarity and definiteness of terms. An obligation to 'attempt' without clear performance metrics is difficult to enforce.",

                "changed_text": "Promoter should try to avoid disseminating or sharing with third parties what Promoter reasonably believes to be material information about VNUE. Promoter acknowledges that third parties might try to act on material non-public information.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the restriction on disseminating information. Replacing 'will not disseminate' with 'should try to avoid' makes compliance less mandatory. The addition of 'what Promoter reasonably believes to be' introduces subjectivity and allows the Promoter to decide what constitutes material information. This ambiguity potentially conflicts with insider trading laws, which do not allow for subjective interpretations of materiality.",
                "contradicted_law": "SEC Rule 10b-5 regarding insider trading, which requires strict adherence to confidentiality of material non-public information.",

                "original_text": "The party in violation of any of the provision agrees to pay to the injured party all court fees, attorney fees, charges and expenses as are deemed fair by the court.",
                "changed_text": "The party potentially in violation of a provision might contribute to the injured party's expenses, including court fees and attorney fees, to the extent deemed potentially appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation to pay all fees. The modified text introduces several ambiguities: 'potentially in violation' makes it unclear when the obligation arises. 'Might contribute' makes the payment discretionary rather than mandatory. 'Expenses...to the extent deemed potentially appropriate' further weakens the obligation, allowing for subjective assessment and partial payment, making enforcement difficult. This contradicts the principle of full compensation for breach of contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding remedies for breach of contract, which generally aim to make the injured party whole.",

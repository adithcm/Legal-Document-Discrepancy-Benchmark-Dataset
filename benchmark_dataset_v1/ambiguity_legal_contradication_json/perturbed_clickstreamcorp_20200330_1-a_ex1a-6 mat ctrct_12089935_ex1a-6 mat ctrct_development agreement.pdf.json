            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Developer agrees, during the Term and thereafter, to hold in strictest confidence, and not to use, except for the benefit of the Client, or to disclose to any person, firm, or corporation without the prior written authorization of the Client, any Confidential Information of the Client.",
                "changed_text": "The Developer agrees to make reasonable efforts, during the Term and thereafter, to hold in confidence, and to limit the use of, Confidential Information of the Client.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'hold in strictest confidence' with 'make reasonable efforts to hold in confidence' weakens the obligation. Removing the explicit prohibition on disclosure without prior written authorization introduces ambiguity and provides a loophole. This contradicts Florida's trade secret laws, which require a higher standard of care to protect confidential information, and could violate non-disclosure agreements, making them difficult to enforce.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida Uniform Trade Secrets Act (FUTSA)",
                "location": "Section 6"

                "changed_text": "The Developer shall generally perform the Services, and to its knowledge, will attempt to comply with applicable laws, rules, or regulations, and the Developer will try to obtain necessary permits or permissions.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be performed in accordance with' to 'shall generally perform the Services' introduces ambiguity about the standard of performance required. Replacing the obligation to 'obtain all permits or permissions required' with 'will try to obtain necessary permits or permissions' makes compliance discretionary. This could contradict state and federal labor laws if the application development involves activities requiring mandatory permits, licenses, or specific compliance standards, thus creating a potential violation by creating uncertainty regarding compliance with the law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal and State Labor Laws Regarding Permits and Compliance",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Developer shall execute and deliver to the Client any instruments of transfer and take such other action that the Client may reasonably request, including, without limitation, executing and filing, at the Client’s expense, copyright applications, assignments, and other documents required for the protection of the Client’s rights to such materials.",
                "changed_text": "The Developer may, if it deems feasible, execute instruments of transfer and take action the Client suggests, potentially including executing copyright applications, assignments, and other documents for the protection of Client's rights, resources permitting.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall execute and deliver' with 'may, if it deems feasible, execute' makes the obligation discretionary rather than mandatory. Adding 'resources permitting' introduces further ambiguity, allowing the Developer to avoid obligations based on subjective resource constraints. This contradicts U.S. Copyright Law, which mandates clear assignment of copyright for 'works for hire' and weakens the Client's intellectual property rights by creating a loophole for non-compliance.",

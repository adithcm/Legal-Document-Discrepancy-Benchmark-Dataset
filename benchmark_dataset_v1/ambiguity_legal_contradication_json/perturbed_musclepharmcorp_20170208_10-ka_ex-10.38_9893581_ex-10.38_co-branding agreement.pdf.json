                "original_text": "The Licensed Products shall be of the highest quality and manufactured, produced, sold, distributed and promoted in strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and be of substantially the same or better quality as the samples previously submitted by MusclePharm. MusclePharm shall be responsible for ensuring that the products are properly designed and manufactured for safe use and shall promptly and fairly address and resolve all consumer complaints and warranty claims. MusclePharm hereby acknowledges that the AS Parties are not competent to determine whether the products are safe for sale and/or distribution to the public at large. Accordingly, the AS Parties’ approval rights relate to aspects of quality and not to a determination of the safety of the products and any approvals given by the AS Parties of the products shall in no way detract from the MusclePharm’s obligations hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "The Licensed Products shall endeavor to be of high quality and manufactured, produced, sold, distributed and promoted with consideration of all applicable laws and regulations, and aim to be of substantially the same or better quality as the samples previously submitted by MusclePharm. MusclePharm shall consider ensuring that the products are designed and manufactured for reasonably safe use and shall attempt to address and resolve consumer complaints and warranty claims in a fair manner. MusclePharm acknowledges that the AS Parties may not be fully competent to determine whether the products are safe for sale and/or distribution to the public at large. Accordingly, the AS Parties’ approval rights relate to general aspects of quality and not specifically to a determination of the safety of the products, and approvals given by the AS Parties of the products might not detract from MusclePharm’s obligations hereunder.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the obligation by replacing 'strict compliance' with 'consideration of all applicable laws,' making the legal duty less definitive. The change from 'shall be responsible for ensuring' to 'shall consider ensuring' makes product safety less of a firm obligation. The use of 'may not be fully competent' introduces uncertainty. 'Might not detract' weakens the assertion that AS Parties' approvals do not lessen MusclePharm's responsibilities. This violates **California Health and Safety Code**, which requires strict compliance with safety standards.",

MusclePharm and the manufacturers agree that, where local industry standards are higher than applicable legal requirements, MusclePharm and manufacturer will meet the higher local standards.",
                "changed_text": "MusclePharm and the manufacturers will strive to comply with applicable wage and hour laws, rules, regulations, and industry standards to a reasonable extent. MusclePharm and the manufacturers agree that, where local industry standards are perceived to be higher than applicable legal requirements, MusclePharm and manufacturer will consider meeting the higher local standards.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'strive to comply' instead of 'materially comply' weakens the legal obligation to meet wage and hour laws. Replacing 'will meet the higher local standards' with 'will consider meeting the higher local standards' makes adhering to higher standards discretionary. This contradicts **California Labor Code**, which mandates strict adherence to wage and hour laws and industry standards.",

                "original_text": "MusclePharm shall, throughout the Term of the Agreement and for a period of not less than four years thereafter, obtain and maintain at its own cost and expense from a qualified insurance company licensed to do business in California and New York, a commercial general liability insurance policy including coverage for contractual liability (applying to the terms and conditions of this agreement), product liability, personal injury liability, and advertiser's liability, in a form approved by the AS Parties, in the amount of at least Five Million Dollars (US$5,000,000) per occurrence naming the AS Parties (for the avoidance of doubt, specifically including each of Lender, Endorser, and Fitness) as additional named insureds.",
                "changed_text": "MusclePharm shall use reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain, throughout the Term of the Agreement and for approximately four years thereafter, from what it believes to be a qualified insurance company licensed to do business in California and New York, a commercial general liability insurance policy that may include coverage for contractual liability, product liability, personal injury liability, and advertiser's liability, in a form generally acceptable to the AS Parties, in an amount that it deems reasonably adequate per occurrence naming the AS Parties as additional insureds as reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall' with 'shall use reasonable efforts,' weakening the obligation to obtain insurance. Replacing 'not less than four years' with 'approximately four years' introduces uncertainty. The phrase 'that may include coverage' makes the inclusion of key liabilities discretionary, and 'what it believes to be a qualified insurance company' uses subjective criteria. 'Generally acceptable' provides flexibility, while 'reasonably adequate' introduces another subjective measure. 'As reasonably practical' weakens the obligation to name the AS Parties as additional insureds, violating **California law** regarding insurance requirements in business contracts.",

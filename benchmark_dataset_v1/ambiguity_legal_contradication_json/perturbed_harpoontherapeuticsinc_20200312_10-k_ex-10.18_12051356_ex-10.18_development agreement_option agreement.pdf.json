If at any time AbbVie has a reasonable basis to believe that Harpoon is in material breach of its obligation to perform any Initial Development Activities, then AbbVie may so notify Harpoon in writing, specifying the basis for its belief, and the Parties shall meet within [***] after such notice to discuss in good faith AbbVie’s concerns.",
                "changed_text": "Harpoon will attempt to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that clinical sites participating in the Phase I/IB Trial submit Clinical Data generated at such site into the clinical database. If at any time AbbVie believes that Harpoon has potentially not performed Initial Development Activities adequately, then AbbVie may notify Harpoon, generally indicating its concerns, and the Parties may, if convenient, meet to discuss AbbVie’s concerns.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates Harpoon to ensure timely submission of data, whereas the modified text only requires Harpoon to attempt to do so, weakening the obligation. Replacing 'material breach' with 'potentially not performed adequately' and 'specifying the basis' with 'generally indicating' creates vagueness and reduces the legal burden. The change from 'shall meet' to 'may, if convenient, meet' introduces discretion, conflicting with requirements for diligent efforts in contract performance.",

                "explanation": "This modification weakens the obligation by changing 'shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts' to 'should consider using Commercially Reasonable Efforts,' making the effort discretionary. Additionally, replacing 'Develop and obtain Regulatory Approval' with 'potentially Develop and seek Regulatory Approval' adds further ambiguity, reducing the commitment to concrete action. Removing the specifics '[***] Licensed Product for [***]' and changing it to 'Licensed Product for use in a Major Market' makes the target vague.",

                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on AbbVie to notify Harpoon promptly and within a specific timeframe, whereas the modified text replaces 'shall make every reasonable effort' with 'will try to notify Harpoon when practical,' weakening the duty to notify. Removing the specific deadline '[***]' introduces more ambiguity. Replacing 'the reasoning behind such determination, and any supporting facts' with 'some information related to this' reduces the required detail in the notification, which is important for compliance and safety monitoring.",

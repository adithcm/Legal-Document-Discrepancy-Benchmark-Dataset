                "changed_text": "IBM will endeavor to perform the Services with what it considers reasonable care and skill, and will generally adhere to the terms of this Agreement. IBM asserts it possesses corporate power and authority to undertake obligations under this Agreement, as it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines IBM's obligations with 'shall' and 'in accordance with this Agreement'. The modified text uses softer language like 'endeavor,' 'what it considers reasonable,' 'generally adhere,' and 'as it deems appropriate,' making the commitment vague and subjective. This introduces ambiguity and weakens the enforceability of IBM's obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text stated the Customer’s responsibility to select security options and IBM’s commitment to implement them. The modified text uses ambiguous language such as 'various security suggestions', 'Customer may consider', 'could potentially meet', and 'attempt to implement, resources permitting'. This makes the security obligations unclear and gives IBM considerable discretion, weakening their commitment and control over critical infrastructure.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines IBM's rights and actions in case of suspected violations, using 'reserves the right' and 'may'. The modified text introduces significant ambiguity and makes these actions discretionary by using phrases like 'may, but is not obligated to', 'subjectively believes', 'might, if feasible', 'possibly suggest', 'consider whether to terminate', and 'think about exercising rights and remedies, perhaps'. This significantly weakens IBM's ability to enforce the terms of the agreement.",

                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each of them is generally responsible for the filing of such filings and amendments, and is encouraged to ensure the accuracy of their information; however, responsibility for the completeness or accuracy of information concerning other persons making the filing will only be assumed if there is a strong reason to suspect inaccuracies.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines responsibility for filings and information accuracy. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'is responsible' with 'is generally responsible' and 'is encouraged to ensure,' weakening the legal obligation to file on time and with accurate information. The phrase 'strong reason to suspect inaccuracies' introduces a subjective standard, making it difficult to enforce the responsibility for the accuracy of information regarding other filers. This contradicts **Section 13 of the Exchange Act**, which requires each filer to be responsible for the information they provide, and holds them liable for misrepresentations.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement will likely remain in effect unless a party indicates an intention to revoke their participation through written notice; however, the specific consequences for the remaining parties will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the agreement remains in effect until revoked with signed writing. The modified version uses 'will likely remain' which is less definitive and introduces uncertainty. The phrase 'specific consequences for the remaining parties will be determined on a case-by-case basis' is vague, undermining the entire purpose of the agreement and potentially violating regulations regarding clear disclosure requirements under the **Securities Exchange Act of 1934**.",

                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the “Exchange Act”) the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of Clarus IV-A, L.P., Clarus IV-B, L.P., Clarus IV-C, L.P., Clarus IV-D, L.P., Clarus IV GP, L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.L.C., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings I/II GP L.L.C., The Blackstone Group Inc., Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. and Stephen A. Schwarzman, on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "The parties express their general intent to jointly file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically referencing Section 13 filings for Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with the understanding that specific filing responsibilities and the precise scope of the joint undertaking remain subject to further clarification and mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to joint filing by introducing ambiguity. Replacing 'hereby agree to the joint filing' with 'express their general intent to jointly file' makes the commitment less binding. Adding 'with the understanding that specific filing responsibilities and the precise scope of the joint undertaking remain subject to further clarification and mutual agreement' undermines the purpose of the agreement and leaves room for dispute, making it potentially non-compliant with SEC regulations regarding disclosures and reporting requirements under the **Securities Exchange Act of 1934** and rules thereunder.",

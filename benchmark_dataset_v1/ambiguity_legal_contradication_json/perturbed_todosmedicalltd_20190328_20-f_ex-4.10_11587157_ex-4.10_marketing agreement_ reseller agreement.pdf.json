                "explanation": "The change from 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply' and 'shall ensure' to 'make reasonable efforts to ensure' weakens the obligation. It introduces ambiguity and allows for discretion in compliance, potentially violating mandatory Israeli regulations for medical device quality assurance and certification.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply at all times' with 'shall attempt to comply' creates ambiguity regarding the level of commitment to legal and regulatory compliance. This introduces uncertainty, as strict compliance may be mandatory under Israeli law for medical devices and healthcare-related activities, potentially leading to non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall provide' to 'shall, to the extent feasible, provide' and 'at least one percent (1%)' to 'approximately one percent (1%)', the obligation to provide feedback becomes vague and discretionary. The term 'as available' makes providing screening results uncertain. This contradicts the implied obligation of data collection for quality control and post-market surveillance, potentially hindering compliance with regulatory requirements concerning product performance monitoring.",

                "original_text": "3.1 By this Agreement, Cisco makes, and Distributor accepts, the appointment of Distributor as an authorized, non-exclusive distributor of Products and Services to Resellers located in the Territory. Distributor agrees to use its best efforts to distribute Product solely to Resellers located in the Territory. Those Resellers may resell Product only to End Users who intend to use the Product in the Territory. All Resellers to which Distributor distributes Product must meet Cisco's then-current guidelines for Resellers, as amended from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 By this Agreement, Cisco makes, and Distributor accepts, the appointment of Distributor as an authorized, non-exclusive distributor of Products and Services to Resellers located in the Territory. Distributor will endeavor to distribute Product to Resellers located in the Territory. Those Resellers may make reasonable efforts to resell Product to End Users within the Territory. All Resellers to which Distributor distributes Product should generally align with Cisco's guidelines for Resellers, as amended from time to time.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'agrees to use its best efforts' with 'will endeavor,' making the obligation to distribute solely within the territory less stringent. Also, it replaces 'may resell' with 'may make reasonable efforts', and 'must meet' with 'should generally align', thus introducing ambiguity and discretion, thereby weakening the original obligations. These changes contradict the clarity required for enforceable contracts under contract law.",

                "original_text": "21.1 Distributor shall obtain all licenses, permits and approvals required by any government, including any recycling or take-back programs applicable to packaging or Products, and shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, policies and procedures and any requirements applicable to the importation, exportation, use, sale, loan, purchase, and distribution of Products under telecommunications, consumer rights related, environmental, labor, tax, and any other laws and regulations, of any government or other competent authority where the Products are to be sold, used or deployed (collectively \"Applicable Laws\").",
                "changed_text": "21.1 Distributor will, where feasible, attempt to obtain necessary licenses, permits, and approvals required by any government, including recycling or take-back programs, if practical, applicable to packaging or Products, and will strive to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, policies and procedures and requirements relating to Products under various laws and regulations of any government or other competent authority where Products are to be sold, used, or deployed (collectively \"Applicable Laws\").",
                "explanation": "The insertion of 'where feasible' and 'if practical' introduces significant ambiguity regarding the distributor's obligation to obtain necessary licenses, permits, and approvals. The phrase 'will strive to comply' weakens the original 'shall comply,' making the compliance discretionary. This contradicts legal requirements for strict adherence to environmental, labor, and tax laws, potentially violating various state and federal regulations.",

                "original_text": "17.1 With regard to both Distributor and Affiliates' activity, Distributor shall keep full, true, and accurate records and accounts, in accordance with generally-accepted accounting principles, of each Product or Service purchased and deployed, Resold, or distributed by serial number, including information regarding compliance with Cisco marketing and sales programs, Software usage, and export or transfer. Distributor shall make these records available for audit by Cisco upon [*****] prior written notice, during regular business hours, at Distributor's principal place of business or such other of Distributor's locations where Distributor may maintain relevant records. [*****].\nAll reporting and related obligations in this Section 17 apply to not only data regarding Distributor's activities, but also",
                "changed_text": "17.1 With regard to both Distributor and Affiliates' activity, Distributor should generally maintain records and accounts that reflect, to a reasonable extent, the Products or Services purchased and deployed. Distributor will endeavor to provide access to records for audit by Cisco, subject to reasonable notice and availability. All reporting and related obligations in this Section 17 apply to data regarding Distributor's activities, however,",
                "explanation": "The use of 'should generally maintain records and accounts that reflect, to a reasonable extent' instead of 'shall keep full, true, and accurate records and accounts' significantly weakens the obligation and introduces subjectivity. 'Will endeavor to provide access' instead of 'shall make these records available' further dilutes the distributor's responsibility. This contradicts the legal requirement for maintaining accurate and verifiable financial records under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and could violate Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements for publicly traded companies.",

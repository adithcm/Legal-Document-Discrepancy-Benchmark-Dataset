                "original_text": "Each of the Village Media Company and PFHOF, as applicable, agrees to be in material compliance with all federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations applicable to its respective operations and to obtain and maintain all licenses and permits required by law necessary for each of their respective operations.",
                "changed_text": "Each of the Village Media Company and PFHOF, as applicable, agrees to endeavor to be in compliance with all federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations applicable to its respective operations and to attempt to obtain and maintain all licenses and permits.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to be in material compliance' with 'agrees to endeavor to be in compliance' weakens the obligation. Also, changing 'obtain and maintain all licenses and permits required by law' to 'attempt to obtain and maintain all licenses and permits' further reduces the definiteness of the legal requirement. The change introduces ambiguity by using softer language that does not guarantee actual compliance or attainment of necessary permits, leading to potential disputes over whether the parties' efforts were sufficient. This change makes compliance with applicable regulations a matter of effort rather than a definite legal requirement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various federal, state, and local laws require strict compliance and necessary permits for business operations, such as environmental regulations (EPA) and business licensing requirements at the state and local levels. Under Ohio law, failing to maintain required licenses and permits can result in fines and business closure.",

                "original_text": "The Village Media Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective permitted sublicensees not to, whether during the Term or thereafter, challenge (a) the rights of PFHOF in and to any PFHOF Work, (b) the validity of any PFHOF Work, (c) PFHOF’s right to grant rights or licenses relating to the PFHOF Works or (d) the validity, legality, or enforceability of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Village Media Company shall use its best efforts to ensure that its Affiliates and their respective permitted sublicensees do not, whether during the Term or thereafter, challenge (a) the rights of PFHOF in and to any PFHOF Work, (b) the validity of any PFHOF Work, (c) PFHOF’s right to grant rights or licenses relating to the PFHOF Works or (d) the validity, legality, or enforceability of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall not' to 'shall use its best efforts to ensure that...do not' introduces ambiguity by making the obligation less definitive. 'Best efforts' is a vague standard that can be interpreted differently, making it difficult to enforce. This weakens the protection of PFHOF's intellectual property rights and the enforceability of the agreement by not mandating that the Village Media Company or its affiliates will not take any actions that would challenge those rights. This makes it more difficult for PFHOF to seek legal recourse if these entities do challenge their legal rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "Intellectual property law relies on clear and enforceable agreements to protect rights, such as copyright and trademark. This change could undermine the enforceability of intellectual property protection, which could violate the Lanham Act (federal trademark law) by creating uncertainty around trademark rights.",

                "changed_text": "The Advisory Board should meet from time to time as deemed necessary to facilitate the Village Media Company’s consideration of media-related opportunities contemplated hereunder and may review proposed projects, budgets, schedules, and creative concepts under consideration by the Village Media Company.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall meet regularly' with 'should meet from time to time as deemed necessary' weakens the obligation of the Advisory Board to meet. Additionally, replacing 'to review' with 'may review' reduces the requirement for the Advisory Board to review the proposed projects, budgets, schedules, and creative concepts. This creates ambiguity regarding the Advisory Board's role and involvement, potentially diminishing their oversight and input. This change implies a lack of commitment to regular and thorough reviews, possibly leading to less informed decisions and disputes over project approvals. Regular meetings would assure an oversight, and this is no longer assured in the text.",
                "contradicted_law": "While there is no specific statute directly violated, this change could indirectly lead to breaches of fiduciary duty if the Advisory Board's reduced oversight results in mismanagement or harm to the Village Media Company, potentially conflicting with corporate governance laws.",

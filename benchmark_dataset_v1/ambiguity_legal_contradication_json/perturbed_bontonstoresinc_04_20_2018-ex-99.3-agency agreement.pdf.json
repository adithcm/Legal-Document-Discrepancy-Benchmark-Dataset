                "original_text": "Agent is authorized to conduct, advertise, post signs, utilize sign-walkers, and otherwise promote the GOB Sale as a “going out of business”, “store closing”, “sale on everything”, “everything must go”, or similar themed sale, in accordance with the Sale Guidelines (as the same may be modified and approved by the Bankruptcy Court), subject to compliance with the Sale Guidelines, the Approval Order, and all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances, including, without limitation, all laws and regulations relating to advertising, privacy, consumer protection, occupational health and safety and the environment, together with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders of, and applicable restrictions imposed by, governmental authorities (collectively, the “Applicable General Laws”), other than all applicable laws, rules and regulations in respect of “going out of business”, “store closing” or similar-themed sales and permitting (collectively, the “Liquidation Sale Laws”);",
                "changed_text": "Agent is authorized to conduct, advertise, post signs, utilize sign-walkers, and otherwise promote the GOB Sale as a “going out of business”, “store closing”, “sale on everything”, “everything must go”, or similar themed sale, in general accordance with the Sale Guidelines (as the same may be modified and approved by the Bankruptcy Court), subject to reasonable compliance with the Sale Guidelines, the Approval Order, and applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances, including, without limitation, all laws and regulations relating to advertising, privacy, consumer protection, occupational health and safety and the environment (collectively, the “Applicable General Laws”), other than all applicable laws, rules and regulations in respect of “going out of business”, “store closing” or similar-themed sales and permitting (collectively, the “Liquidation Sale Laws”);",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by changing 'in accordance with' to 'in general accordance with,' suggesting the Sale Guidelines are not strictly binding. Replacing 'subject to compliance with' to 'subject to reasonable compliance with' weakens the obligation to adhere to laws and regulations. This introduces uncertainty and potential for legal disputes regarding the extent of compliance required. This change could be interpreted to allow the Agent to selectively comply with consumer protection laws, which are not discretionary.",

                "original_text": "All Sales Taxes shall be deposited into a segregated account designated by Merchant and Agent solely for the deposit of such Sales Taxes (the “Sales Taxes Account”). Merchant shall prepare and file all applicable reports and documents required by the applicable taxing authorities, and Merchant shall promptly pay all Sales Taxes from the Sales Taxes Account.",
                "changed_text": "All Sales Taxes may be deposited into an account designated by Merchant and Agent for the deposit of Sales Taxes (the “Sales Taxes Account”). Merchant will endeavor to prepare and file reports and documents for the taxing authorities, and Merchant will attempt to pay all Sales Taxes from the Sales Taxes Account.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the obligation to handle sales taxes correctly. Replacing 'shall be deposited' with 'may be deposited' makes segregating sales taxes optional. Changing 'shall prepare and file' to 'will endeavor to prepare and file' and 'shall promptly pay' to 'will attempt to pay' introduces ambiguity and discretion into the mandatory process of tax reporting and payment, contradicting the strict requirements of sales tax laws. This could lead to penalties and legal issues if not handled carefully.",

                "changed_text": "Subject to the Wind-Down Budget, Merchant shall, throughout the Sale Term, endeavor to maintain in reasonable working order such equipment as cash registers, heating systems and air conditioning systems at the Stores.",
                "explanation": "By modifying the language from 'maintain in good working order, condition, and repair all' to 'endeavor to maintain in reasonable working order such equipment as,' the obligation becomes significantly weaker and more subjective. The original clause implies a definite responsibility to keep all mentioned equipment fully functional, while the altered clause suggests only an effort to maintain a limited set of equipment in 'reasonable' condition. The deliberate vagueness of 'reasonable' is not defined, and the removal of elevators/escalators can cause ADA violations.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Client shall provide Developer assistance to complete the Services, and produce the Deliverables, as reasonably requested, including but not limited to providing the necessary information or documentation required from Developer for the development of the Subject Program. Client shall conduct all Acceptance Tests in good faith and shall not delay any acceptance of any Service or Deliverable without reasonable justification. The evaluation of any Service or Deliverable for any Acceptance Test will be based on material compliance with applicable Specifications and Client shall not arbitrarily withhold acceptance of any Milestone Deliverable or Subject Program.",
                "changed_text": "Client shall endeavor to provide Developer assistance to complete the Services and produce the Deliverables, to the extent feasible. Client will attempt to conduct Acceptance Tests and will aim not to unduly delay the acceptance of Services or Deliverables. The evaluation of any Service or Deliverable for any Acceptance Test will generally be based on compliance with Specifications and Client retains the right to withhold acceptance of any Milestone Deliverable or Subject Program if deemed necessary.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall provide' with 'shall endeavor to provide,' making the assistance optional rather than mandatory. Replacing 'shall conduct' with 'will attempt to conduct' weakens the commitment to acceptance testing. Adding 'if deemed necessary' gives Client broad discretion to withhold acceptance, which could undermine the entire delivery schedule.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Principles - Good Faith and Fair Dealing - introduces uncertainty about whether Pelican Delivers Inc. is contractually obligated to provide sufficient resources to enable Seattle Software Developers, Inc. to perform their obligations.",

                "original_text": "Receiving Party agrees to undertake reasonable measures to maintain and preserve the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in confidence, which measures shall be no less than the measures taken by the Receiving Party to protect its own confidential information and in no vent shall be less than reasonable care.",
                "changed_text": "Receiving Party agrees to take steps they consider appropriate to maintain the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, but such measures will not be required to exceed those already in place for the Receiving Party’s own confidential information.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'reasonable measures' with 'steps they consider appropriate,' the obligation to protect confidential information becomes subjective and less enforceable. Removing the 'no less than reasonable care' standard further weakens the protection. This could violate general principles of trade secret law if the 'steps' taken are insufficient to prevent unauthorized disclosure.",
                "contradicted_law": "Washington Uniform Trade Secrets Act (RCW 19.108) - Introduces ambiguity as to what constitutes reasonable steps to protect trade secrets, making it difficult to enforce confidentiality obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Client will pay some Fees for certain Services and Deliverables, if any, provided by Developer to Client up to the termination date, subject to ongoing negotiations; and Developer will make an effort to transfer most Works to Client as of the date of termination, subject to prior claims.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several ambiguities. 'Some Fees for certain Services' is vague, making it unclear what Client is obligated to pay. 'Subject to ongoing negotiations' introduces uncertainty about the final payment amount. 'Make an effort to transfer most Works' is also vague and does not guarantee the transfer of all intellectual property as originally intended. 'Subject to prior claims' introduces an undefined exception that could prevent the transfer of critical Works.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Principles - Creates uncertainty and potential grounds for dispute concerning the payment of fees and transfer of intellectual property upon termination of the agreement. Also, 17 U.S.C. § 204 (a) states that a transfer of copyright ownership is not valid unless there is an instrument of conveyance.",

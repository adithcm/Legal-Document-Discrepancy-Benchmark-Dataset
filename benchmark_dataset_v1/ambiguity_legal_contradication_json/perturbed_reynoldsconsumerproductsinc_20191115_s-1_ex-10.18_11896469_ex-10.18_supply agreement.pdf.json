                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "A Party is formed, registered, licensed and operating its business in compliance with the laws of the United States of America, its states\nand territories, and any districts, municipalities and other political subdivisions of the foregoing (“Applicable Laws”).",
                "changed_text": "A Party is generally operating its business in alignment with the spirit of the laws of the United States of America, its states\nand territories, and any districts, municipalities and other political subdivisions of the foregoing (“Applicable Laws”).",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity by replacing 'in compliance with the laws' to 'generally operating its business in alignment with the spirit of the laws', making it vague and subjective, thereby allowing for non-compliance with specific regulations. It contradicts regulatory requirements for strict adherence to laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies depending on specific regulatory requirements at the federal, state, and local levels within the United States.",

                "explanation": "The modification introduces uncertainty by replacing 'Seller will not be in breach' with 'Seller may be in breach based on Seller's sole discretion,' giving Seller the power to unilaterally determine the breach status, thereby weakening the warranty obligation. This could contradict consumer protection and product liability laws that require a clear assessment of breach based on objective criteria.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation to protect confidential information by changing 'will take all commercially reasonable actions required' to 'should consider taking actions it reasonably believes are helpful'. This is far less definitive and makes the safeguarding of confidential information optional rather than mandatory, introducing significant ambiguity. The original wording implied a legal duty of care consistent with trade secret law, while the modified version could be interpreted as merely an aspirational goal.",

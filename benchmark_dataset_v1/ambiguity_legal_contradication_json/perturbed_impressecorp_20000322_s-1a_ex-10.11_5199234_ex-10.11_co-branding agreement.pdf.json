                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Impresse shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to all support requests by VerticalNet relating to the Co-Branded Site within one Business Day (as defined below) of Impresse's receipt of such notification. Impresse shall use reasonable efforts to cure the reported problem as soon as reasonably possible.",
                "changed_text": "Impresse will attempt to respond to support requests by VerticalNet relating to the Co-Branded Site within a reasonable time frame of Impresse's receipt of notification. Impresse will try to address the reported problem when feasible.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' to 'will attempt to respond' and 'shall use reasonable efforts to cure' to 'will try to address when feasible' introduces ambiguity. 'Reasonable time frame' and 'when feasible' are subjective and weaken the obligation. This introduces uncertainty about the expected response time and resolution efforts.",

                "original_text": "Each party shall comply with all prevailing laws, rules and regulations and obtain all necessary approvals, consents and permits required by the applicable agencies of the government of the jurisdictions that apply to its activities or obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each party should endeavor to comply with relevant laws, rules, and regulations and attempt to obtain necessary approvals, consents, and permits where reasonably practical for its activities or obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modifications replace 'shall comply' with 'should endeavor to comply' and 'obtain all necessary' with 'attempt to obtain... where reasonably practical'. This weakens the legal obligation, making compliance and permit acquisition discretionary. 'Endeavor' and 'reasonably practical' are ambiguous, undermining mandatory legal requirements.",

Upon termination of the Agreement, VerticalNet and Impresse shall jointly own all User Data. Neither Party shall use the User Data other than in accordance with the VerticalNet privacy policy and all applicable laws during the Term and thereafter.",

Upon termination, each party can use the User Data within their own discretion, provided they consider the VerticalNet privacy policy and related laws.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the clear 'shall be maintained' with 'will generally be treated', making confidentiality less strict. It also replaces the restriction of User Data may be disclosed only as part of an aggregation or analysis of all User Data but not as independent data with each party may share aggregated User Data with partners which broadens the disclosure allowance. Also, it replaces 'Neither Party shall use the User Data other than in accordance with the VerticalNet privacy policy and all applicable laws during the Term and thereafter' to 'each party can use the User Data within their own discretion, provided they consider the VerticalNet privacy policy and related laws'. This weakens the restriction in User Data usage as long as they only 'consider' privacy policies and applicable laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) mandates specific, strict rules around data usage and sharing, not just considering related laws.",

                "explanation": "Replaced \"shall engage in any practice or activity that is not in compliance with\" with \"should endeavor to engage in practices and activities generally aligned with the principles of...as reasonably practical\", making compliance subjective and not mandatory. The addition of \"as reasonably practical\" introduces ambiguity and allows for potential non-compliance, contradicting the strict compliance required by these laws. This creates a loophole, as the \"endeavor\" is not a legally binding requirement.",

The demand shall set forth a statement for the nature of the dispute and the amount involved. If Equidata and Marketing Affiliate can not resolve the dispute on their own within 10 days after Equidata receive said dispute, the parties shall jointly select an arbitrator.",

                "explanation": "Replaced \"shall give\" with \"should attempt to give within a reasonable timeframe,\" which is vague and non-committal. \"Shall set forth a statement\" becomes \"should generally describe,\" reducing the requirement for specific details. \"Shall jointly select an arbitrator\" becomes \"may consider jointly selecting an arbitrator,\" making arbitration optional rather than mandatory.

Similarly, \"Equidata reserves the right to site inspect at any time\" is softened to \"Equidata might consider a site visit if deemed mutually beneficial,\" making the site inspection optional and dependent on mutual agreement, which is not guaranteed. This introduces ambiguity around Equidata's ability to verify compliance, which could violate the principles of due diligence and oversight required for financial transactions and data handling under federal regulations, specifically the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) if the services involve handling consumer financial information.",

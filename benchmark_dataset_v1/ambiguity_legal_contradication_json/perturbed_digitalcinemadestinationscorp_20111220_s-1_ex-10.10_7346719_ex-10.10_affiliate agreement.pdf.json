                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Network Affiliate shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all Equipment delivered to any Theatre or otherwise in the possession, custody or control of Network Affiliate is secure and not accessible by authorized third parties.",
                "changed_text": "Network Affiliate shall attempt to ensure that all Equipment delivered to any Theatre or otherwise in the possession, custody or control of Network Affiliate is secure and not accessible by authorized third parties.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'shall attempt' weakens the obligation, making it unclear what level of security effort is required. This potentially contradicts general data security principles, as attempting something doesn't guarantee reasonable security measures.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) principles regarding reasonable security measures for data protection (although not directly applicable, the principle is analogous).",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall cause its employees to attend such training and to follow the instructions' to 'will endeavor to have its employees consider attending such training and generally be aware of the instructions' makes the training attendance and adherence to instructions voluntary and vague. This weakens the obligation for employees to comply with the training, opening it to multiple interpretations. This could cause issues in ensuring employees properly implement safety and other standards instructed in the training.",
                "contradicted_law": "OSHA regulations, which require mandatory training and compliance for certain safety procedures.",

                "changed_text": "NCM will generally inform Network Affiliate of the length of time that Lobby Promotions and additional Lobby Promotions, if any, are intended to be displayed.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'generally' and changing 'are to be' to 'are intended to be' creates ambiguity about the commitment to providing accurate and firm timelines for lobby promotions. This affects Network Affiliate's planning for their own promotions and potentially opens NCM to disputes regarding unfulfilled timelines. The change can lead to the obligation being difficult to enforce.",

                "original_text": "Western Copper covenants and agrees with Glamis that, for a period of 2 years after the Effective Date, it will not, directly or indirectly, either individually or in partnership or jointly or in conjunction with any Person, which will include being a principal, agent, shareholder, or advisor of such Person or in any other manner whatsoever,\n(a) carry on or be engaged in Mining Activities, or\n(b) advise, lend money to, guarantee the debts or obligations of or permit its name to be used by any Person who carries on or is engaged in Mining Activities,\nin the Area of Non-Competition.",
                "changed_text": "Western Copper will endeavor to avoid competing with Glamis. For approximately 2 years after the Effective Date, it will consider refraining, either individually or perhaps jointly with another Person, from activities that significantly resemble Mining Activities. Whether it advises or lends to others engaged in such activities will depend on Western Copper's assessment of circumstances.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the non-compete clause by replacing 'covenants and agrees' with 'will endeavor to avoid,' making the obligation less stringent. 'Approximately 2 years' introduces ambiguity about the duration. The clause now suggests potential options for Western Copper rather than strict prohibitions, and assessing 'circumstances' makes what is disallowed vaguer than before.",

                "original_text": "Glamis covenants and agrees with Western Copper that if at any time it intends to dispose of a Designated Mineral Property for cash consideration or by abandonment, it will give Western Copper notice (the ‘ Disposition Notice”) of the intended disposition. For a period of 30 days from the time of delivery of the Disposition Notice Glamis will, if requested by Western Silver, entertain an offer from Western Copper to acquire the Designated Mineral Property. In the ease of a Designated Mineral Property that Glamis intends to dispose of for cash consideration, the parties will negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable agreement for the sale to Western Copper of the [Designated Mineral Property. If Glamis and Western Copper are unable to negotiate an acceptable agreement with respect to the Designated Mineral Property within the 30 day period, Glamis may thereafter dispose of the Designated Mineral Property as it sees til in its absolute discretion. If Glamis does not dispose of the Designated Mineral Property within a period of 3 months from the first to occur of the date that Glamis and Western Copper acknowledge failure to negotiate an acceptable agreement with respect to the Designated Mineral Property and the end of the 30 day period, the provisions of this section 2.2 will once again apply to any intended disposition of the Designated Mineral Property by Glamis. In the case of a Designated Mineral Property that Glamis intends to abandon, Glamis wall, if requested by Western Copper, transfer such Designated Mineral Property to Western Copper at no cost save and except for the reasonable costs of transfer incurred by Glamis.",
                "changed_text": "Glamis will consider notifying Western Copper if it contemplates disposing of a Designated Mineral Property. If so, and if Western Copper expresses interest, Glamis will consider offers. Negotiating in good faith for 30 days might occur. Glamis may dispose of the property at its discretion, potentially subject to further discussions if a deal isn't reached within approximately three months. Abandonment will be handled at Glamis's discretion considering Western Copper's interests.",
                "explanation": "This weakens Glamis's obligation to provide Western Copper with a right of first offer. 'Will consider notifying' makes the initial notice discretionary, contradicting the original mandatory language. 'Negotiating in good faith might occur' introduces further uncertainty. By adding 'approximately' to the 3-month period and stating 'considering Western Copper’s interests' when abandonment is handled the obligations are weakened.",

References to Glamis and Western Copper may include affiliates, but this is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the binding nature of the agreement on subsidiaries and affiliates. 'Generally intend' and 'the exact extent...will be determined on a case-by-case basis' introduces ambiguity, contradicting the original strict application. The 'may include' weakens the reference to affiliates.",

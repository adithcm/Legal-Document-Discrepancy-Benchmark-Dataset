                "original_text": "Company shall perform the work in connection with this Agreement in a timely, professional and workmanlike manner consistent with industry standards. Each party shall ensure that all persons performing work under this Agreement on its behalf shall have the requisite experience, training, skill and other qualifications needed to develop the Recipes, Deliverables and Specifications.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall endeavor to perform the work in connection with this Agreement in a reasonably timely manner, aiming for a professional and workmanlike outcome. Each party should consider ensuring that persons performing work under this Agreement on its behalf possess adequate experience, training, skill, and other qualifications believed to be needed to develop the Recipes, Deliverables and Specifications.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for timely, professional work and requires ensuring qualified personnel. The modified text introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall perform' to 'shall endeavor to perform,' making the timeline less strict. Changing 'consistent with industry standards' to 'aiming for a professional and workmanlike outcome' makes the quality of work subjective. Replacing 'shall ensure' with 'should consider ensuring' weakens the obligation to guarantee qualified personnel. This contradicts general contract law principles which requires obligations to be fulfilled to the best extent possible.",

Company will and hereby does, without further consideration, irrevocably assign to Reed’s any and all worldwide right, title or interest that Company may now or hereafter possess in or to the Deliverables in perpetuity (or the maximum period permitted by Applicable Laws and Regulations) and Reed’s accepts such assignment. Company will execute and deliver documents reasonably requested by Reed’s to register its Intellectual Property in the Deliverables.",

Company may assign to Reed’s any right, title, or interest that Company possesses in or to the Deliverables and Reed’s may accept such assignment. Company will attempt to execute and deliver documents requested by Reed’s to register its Intellectual Property in the Deliverables.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Company 'will' create and provide Deliverables and that Reed's 'will' exclusively own them, with Company irrevocably assigning rights. The modified text uses 'may' instead of 'will', making the creation, provision, and ownership of Deliverables optional. The phrase 'attempt to execute and deliver' instead of 'will execute and deliver' weakens the obligation to provide necessary documents for IP registration. This contradicts intellectual property law, which states the ownership of work will be given to the entity if requested. ",

Unless otherwise expressly permitted herein, Receiving Party should try to avoid disclosing such information to third persons without seeking the consent of the Disclosing Party.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a strict obligation to maintain confidentiality and prohibits unauthorized disclosure. The modified text weakens this obligation by replacing 'shall hold' with 'should attempt to hold' and 'shall not disclose' with 'should try to avoid disclosing,' making confidentiality and non-disclosure discretionary rather than mandatory. Changing 'prior written consent' to 'seeking the consent' also introduces ambiguity. This could conflict with trade secret protection laws, which need to adhere to a certain standard.",

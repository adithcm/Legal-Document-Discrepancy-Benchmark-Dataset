                "original_text": "The Parties expressly agree that any and all uses or disclosures of the Confidential Information by a Party will be done in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the provisions of all applicable federal and state laws and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties acknowledge an intent to comply with the terms of this Agreement and applicable federal and state laws and regulations regarding the use or disclosure of Confidential Information; however, the extent of such compliance will be determined at their sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with federal and state laws. The modified text replaces this strict requirement with an ambiguous 'intent to comply,' where the extent of compliance is left to the parties' sole discretion. This introduces uncertainty regarding whether the parties are legally bound to follow all applicable laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), which requires strict adherence to privacy and security rules regarding protected health information.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires 'appropriate safeguards'. The modified text replaces this with 'reasonable safeguards'. The term 'reasonable' is vague and subjective, and does not guarantee alignment with specific, mandated security standards required by data protection laws. This ambiguity allows for interpretation that may not be sufficient to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure.",
                "contradicted_law": "HIPAA Security Rule, which mandates specific administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect electronic protected health information (ePHI).",

                "explanation": "The original text states 'agrees to mitigate, to the extent practicable'. The modified text replaces this with 'attempt to mitigate, as they see fit'. The phrase 'attempt' and 'as they see fit' makes mitigation optional and dependent on the party's subjective assessment, undermining the obligation to take concrete steps to remedy breaches, potentially leading to non-compliance.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Company agrees to provide its services, as defined in Attachment A, in accordance with all applicable laws and in accordance with standards of decorum and taste so as not to adversely reflect upon the Association or its mission.",
                "changed_text": "Company will endeavor to provide its services, as generally described in Attachment A, while considering applicable laws and standards of decorum and taste, striving not to significantly reflect negatively upon the Association or its mission.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation to comply with 'all applicable laws.' The modified text weakens this obligation by using 'endeavor to,' 'generally described,' 'considering applicable laws' instead of strict accordance, and 'striving not to significantly reflect negatively,' thus creating ambiguity about the level of compliance required. This change can lead to potential non-compliance, as it introduces subjective interpretation.",

Company may, at its discretion, provide the Association with samples of items or materials that contain the Association Marks periodically.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a definite obligation to maintain quality and provide quarterly samples. The modified text weakens this by using 'should generally maintain a comparable quality,' and 'may, at its discretion, provide...periodically.' This introduces ambiguity and makes enforcement difficult, as the quality standard and frequency of sample provision are now subjective.",

The modified text weakens this by using 'should consider,' 'deems appropriate,' 'could potentially,' 'may consider,' 'may offer assistance,' 'reasonably feasible,' and 'endeavor to notify in a timely fashion.'

                "original_text": "The Sellers guarantee that the commodity hereof is complies in all respects with the quality and specification stipulated in this Contract.",
                "changed_text": "The Sellers will endeavor to ensure that the commodity generally meets the quality and specification outlined in this Contract.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a guarantee, which is a firm commitment. The modified text weakens this commitment to 'endeavor to ensure,' which is vague and doesn't guarantee compliance. The word 'generally' adds another layer of ambiguity, making it unclear what level of deviation is acceptable. This undermines the buyer's assurance of receiving goods that strictly adhere to the agreed-upon quality and specifications.",

                "changed_text": "Within a reasonable time after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not entirely satisfactory, the Buyers may, at their discretion, present a claim based on available documentation. Expenses may be discussed and potentially shared.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a clear 7-day deadline and specifies the China Commodity Inspection Bureau's certificate as the basis for claims. It also clearly states the seller bears all related expenses. The modified text replaces the 7-day deadline with 'a reasonable time,' which is subjective and open to interpretation. 'Not entirely satisfactory' is far less precise than 'not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract.' 'Available documentation' is vague compared to the specific Inspection Certificate. The term 'expenses may be discussed and potentially shared' weakens the seller's obligation to cover all expenses.",
                "contradicted_law": "China's Contract Law, which requires specific and reasonable timelines for claims related to non-conforming goods. Also the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) which mandates clear guidelines for examination of goods and notification of non-conformity.",

In case no settlement can be reached, the case may then be submitted for arbitration to the Foreign Economic and Trade Arbitration Committee of the China Beijing Council for the Promotion of International Trade in accordance with its Provisional Rules of Procedures by the said Arbitration Committee. The Arbitration shall take place in Beijing and the decision of the Arbitration Committee shall be final and binding upon both partiesÍ¾ neither party shall seek recourse to a law court nor other authorities to appeal for revision of the decision. Arbitration fee shall be borne by the losing party.",
                "changed_text": "All disputes related to this Contract should be discussed in good faith. If resolution proves challenging, the parties might consider non-binding mediation.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates arbitration in Beijing under specific rules. The modified text replaces this with a suggestion for 'good faith' discussions and potential 'non-binding mediation.' This eliminates the mandatory arbitration clause, making dispute resolution uncertain and unenforceable. By suggesting only non-binding mediation, the clause allows either party to disregard the outcome of the mediation process, rendering it less effective and failing to provide a clear and binding resolution mechanism.",
                "contradicted_law": "China's Arbitration Law, which requires a clear agreement to arbitrate for arbitration to be enforceable. The modified text lacks this clear agreement and contradicts the intent of the original clause.",

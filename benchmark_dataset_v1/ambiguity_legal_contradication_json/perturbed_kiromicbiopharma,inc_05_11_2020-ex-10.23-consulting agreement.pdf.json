                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Consultant agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant agrees to take precautions to prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information as they deem necessary.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'as they deem necessary' introduces subjectivity regarding the precautions taken to protect confidential information. This weakens the obligation and introduces ambiguity. This could violate regulations such as the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (TUTSA), which requires reasonable measures to protect trade secrets, a standard not necessarily met by the consultant's subjective judgment.",

                "original_text": "Consultant agrees, from time to time during the term of this Agreement, to keep Company advised as to Consultant’s progress in performing the Services and, as reasonably requested by Company, prepare written reports with respect thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant may, from time to time during the term of this Agreement, keep Company advised as to Consultant’s progress in performing the Services and prepare written reports with respect thereto, only if it is convenient.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'agrees' to 'may' and adding the phrase 'only if it is convenient,' the obligation to provide progress updates and reports becomes discretionary rather than mandatory. This creates ambiguity about the required level of communication and reporting. This could be a violation of general contract law principles, as well as principles around duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Subject to written waivers that may be provided by the Company upon request, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Consultant agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, Consultant will not directly or indirectly (i) participate in the formation of any business or commercial entity in the Field of Interest or otherwise competitive with the Company.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to written waivers that may be provided by the Company upon request, which might not be unreasonably withheld, Consultant agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, Consultant should avoid directly or indirectly (i) participating in the formation of any business or commercial entity in the Field of Interest or otherwise competitive with the Company.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not be unreasonably withheld' to 'might not be unreasonably withheld' and 'will not' to 'should avoid' weakens the non-compete clause significantly. It introduces uncertainty about the circumstances under which the waiver is given and whether the consultant must avoid competing. This could potentially violate Texas Business and Commerce Code, which regulates non-compete agreements. For non-competes to be enforceable, there must be reasonable limitations. This change creates ambiguity and potentially makes the agreement unreasonable.",

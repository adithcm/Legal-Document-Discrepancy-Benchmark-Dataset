                "changed_text": "mPhase will use its best efforts to generally follow the guidelines appearing on Schedule B of this Agreement relating to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo. mPhase acknowledges that these guidelines may be updated periodically and will attempt to accommodate such updates where feasible.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"agrees to abide by\" to \"will use its best efforts to generally follow\" and \"agrees to abide by those updates\" to \"will attempt to accommodate such updates where feasible\" introduces ambiguity and makes compliance with the guidelines discretionary rather than mandatory. This could be problematic as Schedule B contains specifications designed to protect Lucent's trademark, and weakening adherence could lead to trademark infringement issues.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"agrees to maintain the quality\" with \"agrees to endeavor to maintain the quality\" and adding \"as reasonably determined by mPhase\" introduces ambiguity. It shifts the responsibility for quality assessment to mPhase and weakens the obligation to maintain a comparable level of quality, potentially harming Lucent's brand if the quality diminishes. 'Not significantly inferior' is also very vague.",

The extent and frequency of such reviews will be subject to mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"agrees to allow Lucent to inspect\" to \"will generally permit Lucent...to review\", adding restrictions like \"reasonable security requirements\", \"not unduly disrupt mPhase's business operations\", and making \"extent and frequency\" subject to \"mutual agreement\", the right of Lucent to inspect is significantly weakened. This makes it harder for Lucent to enforce the brand standards and quality control.",

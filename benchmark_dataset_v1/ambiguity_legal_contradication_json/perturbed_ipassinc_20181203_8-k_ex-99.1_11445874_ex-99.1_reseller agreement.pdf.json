Prior to deployment of the Licensed Software in a production environment, Channel Partner agrees to implement processes that will allow the Licensed Software to successfully report as specified in the Documentation. If Channel Partner fails to implement such processes within a reasonable time following iPass’ request, iPass may elect to terminate the Agreement or Channel Partner’s use of the Licensed Software upon written notice to Channel Partner. In such an event, Channel Partner shall be responsible for payment of all undisputed amounts due and owing to iPass under the Agreement. In addition, Channel Partner agrees to ensure that prior to deployment of the Licensed Software in a Business Entity production environment, each Business Entity implements processes that will allow the Licensed Software to successfully report as specified in the Documentation. If Channel Partner’s Business Entity fails to implement such processes within a reasonable time following iPass’ or Channel Partner’s request, iPass may elect to terminate the order for such Business Entity upon written notice to Channel Partner.

                "explanation": "The perturbation replaces 'will use its reasonable endeavors' with 'should attempt to cooperate,' diluting the obligation to a mere suggestion. The modification of 'agrees to implement' to 'may consider implementing' introduces uncertainty about whether the Channel Partner is legally obligated to implement certain processes. Also, the change from 'shall be responsible' to 'could be responsible' weakens the obligation to make payments, making it ambiguous and potentially unenforceable.",

Channel Partner will not waive, amend, or agree to terms that would tend to negate or materially dilute the sample terms provided in Exhibit E. Channel Partner shall promptly notify iPass of any material breach of any End User Agreement and will cooperate with iPass and/or iPass suppliers in any legal action to mitigate iPass’ damages in the event of any such breach. iPass may, and may require Channel Partner to suspend or terminate Services to an End User who breaches the terms of an End User Agreement. Upon request, Channel Partner will provide iPass a copy of each End User Agreement entered into by Channel Partner and End Users. A breach by an End User is deemed a breach by Channel Partner.",
                "changed_text": "Channel Partner will try to enforce each End User Agreement with something like the same degree of diligence used in enforcing similar agreements. Channel Partner might waive, amend, or agree to terms that could tend to dilute the sample terms in Exhibit E, depending on their consideration. Channel Partner should make an effort to notify iPass of a breach of any End User Agreement and may cooperate with iPass and/or iPass suppliers in any legal action. iPass may consider requiring Channel Partner to suspend or terminate Services to an End User who breaches an End User Agreement. Upon request, Channel Partner will endeavor to provide iPass a copy of each End User Agreement. A breach by an End User may be seen as a breach by Channel Partner.",
                "explanation": "The term 'will enforce' is softened to 'will try to enforce,' introducing a subjective element into the enforcement of agreements. Replacing 'will not' with 'might' introduces uncertainty about adherence to the terms provided in Exhibit E. The changes from 'shall promptly notify' to 'should make an effort to notify,' and 'will cooperate' to 'may cooperate' reduce the mandatory nature of these actions. Also, modifying 'is deemed' to 'may be seen as' introduces ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "The clause 'will comply with all applicable laws and regulations' has been changed to 'will generally try to comply with most applicable laws and regulations, mainly those focusing on privacy and exportation.' The terms 'generally try' introduces a level of effort that does not ensure full compliance, and 'most applicable laws' suggests that the Channel Partner may pick and choose which laws to comply with. Adding 'mainly those focusing on privacy and exportation' minimizes the importance of other regulations, making the extent of the compliance obligation unclear. Furthermore, ‘concerning its activities loosely associated with this Agreement’ limits the activities that are subject to applicable laws and regulations. This contradicts general legal principles which require full and unambiguous compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.",

                "original_text": "Distributor will perform localization of any software components to make the program possible to use in the local Territory. This is to include language translations or interface design changes. Provider will act as liaison with local Territory wireless carriers. This will include content review to insure content meets local broadcast standards and meets any local regulatory requirements. Distributor also agrees to secure necessary governmental approvals or permits necessary to operate in the Territory and to secure permission to enable distribution of IMNTV’s share of Subscription Fees to IMNTV in the United States.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will endeavor to perform localization of any software components to make the program generally usable in the local Territory. This may include language translations or interface design changes. Provider may act as a point of contact with local Territory wireless carriers. Distributor will attempt to secure governmental approvals or permits to operate in the Territory and to enable distribution of IMNTV’s share of Subscription Fees to IMNTV in the United States.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains clear obligations on the distributor to perform localization, content review, and secure governmental approvals. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'will perform' with 'will endeavor to,' 'This is to include' with 'This may include', 'will act as' with 'may act as', and 'Distributor also agrees to secure' with 'Distributor will attempt to secure.' This weakens the legal obligations, making them subject to distributor's discretion and effort, thus harder to enforce.",
                "contradicted_law": "Article 17 of the 'Administrative Regulations on Telecommunications of the People's Republic of China' requires that telecommunications service providers must obtain relevant licenses and approvals before engaging in telecommunications services. This ambiguous wording does not guarantee compliance with these regulations.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires customer support to be provided in a 'workmanlike and professional manner.' This is a fairly objective standard. The modified text replaces this with 'in what it considers a satisfactory manner,' making the standard completely subjective and at the discretion of the Distributor. This makes it difficult to enforce any specific quality of customer support.",
                "contradicted_law": "Article 25 of the 'Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests' stipulates that operators providing goods or services shall guarantee that the goods or services meet the requirements for safeguarding personal safety and property safety. By being ambiguous, it is difficult to enforce that the quality of service protects the user.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens the Distributor's responsibility. Replacing 'is solely responsible for' with 'will endeavor to monitor' and 'will notify immediately' with 'will attempt to notify' makes the monitoring and notification discretionary rather than mandatory. This introduces ambiguity and makes it harder to hold the distributor accountable for maintaining service quality and keeping IMNTV informed.",
                "contradicted_law": "Article 9 of the 'Measures for the Administration of Internet Audio-Visual Program Services' requires internet audio-visual program service providers to improve their management systems and technical security measures to ensure service quality. The ambiguity makes compliance uncertain.",

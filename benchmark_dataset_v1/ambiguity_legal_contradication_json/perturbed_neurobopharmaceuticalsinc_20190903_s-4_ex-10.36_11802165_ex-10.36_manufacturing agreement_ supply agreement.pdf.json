                "explanation": "Changing 'in compliance with the KGMP' to 'adhering to the spirit of the KGMP' and 'while considering KGMP standards' introduces ambiguity. It's unclear if strict compliance is required, potentially allowing Dong-A to deviate from KGMP standards. This ambiguity introduces a loophole that contradicts the intention of ensuring product quality and regulatory compliance.",

                "changed_text": "2.1 Subject to the provisions hereof, Dong-A will endeavor to (i) supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo already manufactured by Dong-A as of the Effective Date, keeping in mind KGMP guidelines, and (ii) manufacture, with reasonable effort to comply with KGMP and to conform to the specifications separately agreed upon between the Parties and attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Product Specifications”) and supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, and NeuroBo shall purchase from Dong-A the entire requirement of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for research and development of the Licensed Products under the License Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall' with 'will endeavor to' and 'manufacture in compliance with' with 'manufacture, with reasonable effort to comply with' introduces ambiguity. Also, 'keeping in mind KGMP guidelines' weakens the obligation to meet KGMP standards. This creates uncertainty about the level of compliance required, potentially contradicting the KGMP which mandates strict adherence to manufacturing standards.",

This is for each batch of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo shipped hereunder, indicating that the batch is believed to broadly align with the Product Specifications.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Dong-A shall supply' to 'Dong-A will aim to supply' makes the supply itself less certain. Replacing 'together with a certificate of analysis' with 'potentially including a certificate of analysis' makes the certificate optional. Also, the shift from 'certifying that such batch meets the Product Specifications' to 'indicating that the batch is believed to broadly align with the Product Specifications' diminishes the assurance of compliance. This weakened guarantee creates a contradiction with the need for verifiable quality assurance documentation as mandated by GMP.",

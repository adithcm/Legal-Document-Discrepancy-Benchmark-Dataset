                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Distributor undertakes and agrees with the Supplier that at all times during the Term it will:\n(a)\nuse all reasonable endeavours to promote the distribution and sale of the Products;",
                "changed_text": "The Distributor should consider using reasonable endeavours to promote the distribution and sale of the Products.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'undertakes and agrees...it will' to 'should consider' weakens the obligation to promote the products. 'Reasonable endeavours' remains, but the directive is now merely a suggestion, undermining the original, more forceful commitment. This creates an ambiguous legal obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Creates uncertainty and unenforceability regarding the distributor's commitment to actively promote sales, potentially violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing if the distributor does little to no promotion.",

                "changed_text": "The Distributor should strive to generally adhere to laws and regulations relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption; and \nmay avoid engaging in activities that are clearly considered an offense.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'should strive to generally adhere' and 'not engage' with 'may avoid engaging in activities that are clearly considered an offense' makes the anti-bribery compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. The term 'generally adhere' and 'clearly considered' are vague and open to interpretation, therefore creating non-compliance with a specific law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) - The FCPA mandates strict compliance with anti-bribery laws, and this change allows for ambiguity and potential non-compliance.",

These records shall include\nrecords of deliveries to customers (including batch numbers, delivery date, name and address of customer,\ntelephone number, fax number and e-mail address).",
                "changed_text": "The Distributor will attempt to maintain records to enable the recall of Products. These records may include delivery information.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'undertakes to maintain appropriate, up-to-date and accurate records to enable the immediate recall' to 'will attempt to maintain records to enable the recall' weakens the obligation to maintain comprehensive records. Removing the terms 'appropriate, up-to-date, and accurate' along with 'immediate' introduces ambiguity regarding the nature of the records that should be kept. Also, changing 'shall include' to 'may include' regarding customer records makes the inclusion of this data discretionary.",
                "contradicted_law": "Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations - FDA regulations require detailed and accurate records for product recalls, and these changes weaken the distributor's obligation to maintain adequate records for effective recalls, potentially violating this requirement.",

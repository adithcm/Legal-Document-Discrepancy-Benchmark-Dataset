                "original_text": "Licensor shall be solely responsible for the Titles and any and all legal liability resulting from the Titles, excluding any legal liability caused by Licenseeâ€™s breach of this Agreement or gross negligence with regards to the Titles. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensor shall be solely responsible for any and all royalties and other fees payable to any applicable licensor(s) or any third party for distribution of the Titles by Licensee (including, without limitation, residuals and clearances or other payments to guilds or unions and rights for music clearances, such as performance rights, synchronization rights and mechanical rights), and all other fees, payments and obligations arising out of the activities contemplated by this Agreement, and Licensee shall have no responsibility or liability for any such royalties or fees.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor shall generally be responsible for the Titles and resulting legal liability, except in cases of Licensee's clear breach of this Agreement or demonstrable gross negligence directly linked to the Titles. Licensor will typically handle royalties and fees for third-party distribution, including residuals and clearances, and music rights. However, Licensee may assume some responsibility if mutually agreed upon in writing.",
                "explanation": "The phrase \"shall generally be responsible\" introduces ambiguity and reduces Licensor's previously defined sole responsibility. Similarly, \"will typically handle\" weakens the obligation for royalties and fees, and introducing the possibility of Licensee assuming responsibility makes the allocation of liability vague and open to interpretation. This creates a loophole where the responsibility can be shifted without clearly defined conditions.",

                "original_text": "Licensee agrees to display the Titles without material alteration to the content thereof. Licensee may make non-material modifications or edits the format of the Titles only for technical purposes with prior written approval by Licensor (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and subject to the applicable limitations (if any) in section 2(a)(i). Nothing in this Agreement prevents Licensee from providing Users with the ability to use the Titles as permitted by law or in a manner for which a license is not required.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee will aim to display the Titles with minimal alterations. Licensee may, at its discretion, make minor modifications or edits to the format of the Titles for technical purposes, with Licensor's approval possibly needed, considering Section 2(a)(i). Licensee is permitted to allow Users to engage with the Titles in ways not explicitly restricted by law or licensing.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to display' to 'will aim to display' weakens the commitment. The phrase 'at its discretion' introduces a degree of subjectivity to the modification process. Also, replacing 'prior written approval by Licensor' with 'with Licensor's approval possibly needed' makes the requirement for approval uncertain. The term 'ways not explicitly restricted' is overly broad, potentially conflicting with copyright law. These introduce vagueness and shift the control from the Licensor to Licensee.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'will consider notifying' makes the notification process optional, and the phrase 'may attempt to address' weakens the obligation to resolve technical issues. The addition of 'as resources allow' introduces a subjective limitation based on unspecified resources. This creates uncertainty regarding the parties' responsibility to address technical problems, contradicting typical expectations in content distribution agreements.",

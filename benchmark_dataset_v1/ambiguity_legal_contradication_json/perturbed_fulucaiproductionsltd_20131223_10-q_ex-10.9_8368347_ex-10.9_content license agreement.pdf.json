                "original_text": "Producer shall take all reasonable steps to protect all copyrights pertaining to each Program from infringement and will institute such actions and proceedings as may be reasonable to prevent any unauthorized use, reproduction, exhibition or exploitation by third parties of the Program or any part thereof, or the material on which the Program is based which may be in contravention of the rights and license granted to ConvergTV herein.",
                "changed_text": "Producer will consider taking steps to protect copyrights pertaining to each Program from infringement and may institute actions and proceedings if deemed appropriate to prevent unauthorized use, reproduction, exhibition or exploitation by third parties of the Program or any part thereof, or the material on which the Program is based which may be in contravention of the rights and license granted to ConvergTV herein.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall take all reasonable steps' to 'will consider taking steps' significantly weakens the obligation to protect copyrights. Replacing 'will institute such actions and proceedings as may be reasonable' with 'may institute actions and proceedings if deemed appropriate' introduces subjectivity and makes the protection of copyrights discretionary. This weakens the copyright protection promised to ConvergTV.",
                "contradicted_law": "Copyright Act, specifically the obligation to actively protect copyrighted material to maintain its value and prevent infringement. Vague obligation undermines enforceability of copyright protection, which is a violation of federal copyright law.",

                "changed_text": "For Programs licensed by and/or through ConvergTV, ConvergTV will endeavor to provide protections for its distribution platform to address potential unauthorized distribution, licensing issues, piracy, theft of content and monetization from the platform.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall provide reasonable protections' to 'will endeavor to provide protections' introduces ambiguity about the level of security to be provided by ConvergTV. Replacing the specific issues 'unauthorized distribution, unauthorized licensing, unauthorized sub-licensing, piracy, theft of content and/or unauthorized monetization' with 'potential unauthorized distribution, licensing issues, piracy, theft of content and monetization' further obscures the level of protection. This removes the explicit responsibility to protect the content.",
                "contradicted_law": "Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which requires specific measures to protect copyrighted content online. This vague obligation makes compliance difficult to ascertain.",

                "original_text": "All questions with respect to the construction of this Agreement, and the rights and liabilities of the Parties hereto, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida. The Parties also agree that the venue for this Agreement shall be in the County of Brevard, Florida. The Parties expressly waive any claim to jurisdiction in any federal or other state forum or venue in any other county or place. In the event of any controversy, claim or dispute between the Parties hereto, including, but not limited to, any action at law or in equity, including any action for declaratory or injunctive relief, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover from the losing Party all of his or her actual attorney's fees and costs in bringing, prosecuting, or defending said action.",
                "changed_text": "Questions with respect to the general understanding of this Agreement may be subject to the laws of the State of Florida. The Parties agree that the venue for disputes may be in Brevard County, Florida. The Parties consider waiving any claim to jurisdiction elsewhere. In the event of a controversy, the prevailing Party may be considered for reimbursement of attorney's fees and costs.",
                "explanation": "The use of \"may be subject to\" weakens the governing law clause, creating uncertainty about whether Florida law definitively applies. Similarly, \"may be\" for venue and \"consider waiving\" for jurisdiction, alongside \"may be considered for reimbursement\" regarding legal fees, erode the original intent of a clear and enforceable agreement on dispute resolution, allowing the dispute to possibly fall under a different jurisdiction and reduce the accountability of covering legal fees.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law Principles â€“ A governing law clause needs to be clear and unambiguous to be enforceable. This ambiguity opens the door for forum shopping and undermines the predictability of legal outcomes, violating general contract law principles.",

Licensee shall execute any and all documents which Licensor may reasonably request in support of such registrations, and, at Licensor’s request, Licensee shall provide use evidence, testimony, and documentation that may be required in any ex parte or inter partes administrative proceedings and prosecutions, maintenance and renewals involving registrations of the Licensed Mark, at Licensee’s sole expense.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee will endeavor to cooperate with Licensor in achieving registration of the Licensed Mark worldwide, and in maintaining and protecting existing registrations. Licensee should aim to execute documents which Licensor may request in support of registrations and provide use evidence, testimony, and documentation when reasonably possible in administrative proceedings and prosecutions for the Licensed Mark. Costs associated with such endeavors will be discussed and allocated between parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for Licensee to cooperate and provide necessary documentation at its sole expense. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using weaker terms such as 'endeavor,' 'should aim,' and 'when reasonably possible,' making the cooperation and provision of documents discretionary rather than mandatory. Also, the clear indication of 'Licensee's sole expense' is replaced with 'costs associated with such endeavors will be discussed and allocated between parties', introducing further ambiguity.",

                "original_text": "The Licensed Products shall be of a quality commensurate with previous production or the samples approved by Licensor. If the quality of a class of the Licensed Products falls below such standards, Licensee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to restore such quality. In the event that Licensee has not taken appropriate steps to restore such quality within one-hundred twenty (120) days after notification by Licensor, Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Licensed Products should generally align with the quality of previous production or the samples approved by Licensor. If the quality of a class of the Licensed Products seems to fall below standards, Licensee may consider efforts to restore such quality. If the issue persists for an extended period after notification by Licensor, both parties will discuss the appropriate course of action, potentially including termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a standard for product quality and mandates commercially reasonable efforts to restore quality within a defined timeframe, giving Licensor the right to terminate if unaddressed. The modified text weakens this obligation by using terms like 'should generally align' and 'may consider efforts,' making the quality standard less stringent and the restorative actions discretionary. Replacing the definite 'shall have the right to terminate' with a discussion of 'appropriate course of action, potentially including termination' makes the consequences of failing to maintain quality vague and subject to negotiation.",

                "original_text": "Licensee shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Licensor and its officers, directors, employees, agents, corporate subsidiaries, parents, and affiliates (“Licensor Indemnitees”) from and against any and all demands, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments, deficiencies, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys’ fees and expenses), incurred in conjunction with or arising out of or relating to any third-party claim concerning the Licensed Products and any acts or omissions of Licensee with respect to the Licensed Mark, including without limitation Licensee’s performance of its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee will consider defending, indemnifying, and holding harmless Licensor and its Indemnitees from demands, claims, and liabilities related to third-party claims concerning the Licensed Products and Licensee's actions related to the Licensed Mark. However, the extent of such support will depend on a mutual agreement between both parties and subject to available resources.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly establishes Licensee's obligation to defend and indemnify Licensor from third-party claims. The modified text weakens this obligation by introducing uncertainty with phrases like 'will consider,' 'the extent of such support will depend,' and 'subject to available resources.' This ambiguity makes it unclear under what circumstances the Licensee is actually required to provide defense and indemnity, making the provision difficult to enforce and creating a potential conflict. This is especially important since Licensee is dealing with Licensed Products, which may create possible liability. ",

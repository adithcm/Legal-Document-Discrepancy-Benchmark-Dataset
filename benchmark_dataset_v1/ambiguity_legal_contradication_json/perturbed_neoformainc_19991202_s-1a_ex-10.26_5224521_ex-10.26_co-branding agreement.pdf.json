                "original_text": "VerticalNet and Neoforma shall use commercially reasonable efforts to co-promote the VerticalNet Medical Online Communities, the Co-Branded Sites, the VerticalNet Buyer's Guide, Neoforma Plan, Neoforma Shop and Neoforma Auction in mutually agreeable advertising, collateral marketing material and sales force activities. All co-promotion advertising materials produced by or on behalf of either Party (the \"Originating Party\") shall be subject to the written approval of the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\"), which approval shall not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Receiving Party shall notify the Originating Party of its approval or disapproval of such advertising materials as soon as practicable, but in any event within five business days after Receiving Party's receipt thereof. Any failure of the Receiving Party to respond within such five business day period shall be deemed disapproval of the advertising materials in question.",
                "changed_text": "VerticalNet and Neoforma will consider co-promoting the VerticalNet Medical Online Communities, the Co-Branded Sites, the VerticalNet Buyer's Guide, Neoforma Plan, Neoforma Shop and Neoforma Auction in potentially agreeable advertising and marketing activities. Co-promotion advertising materials produced by either Party may be subject to the other Party's feedback. The Receiving Party should attempt to communicate their perspective on such advertising materials, but inaction will not necessarily imply any formal response.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines a clear obligation for both parties to 'use commercially reasonable efforts' for co-promotion and establishes a specific approval process for advertising materials. The modification replaces 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'will consider,' reducing the binding nature of the obligation. The term 'mutually agreeable' becomes 'potentially agreeable,' creating uncertainty. The approval process is weakened by changing 'shall be subject to the written approval' to 'may be subject to the other Party's feedback,' and the requirement for notification within five days is removed, making the process vague. This ambiguity makes it difficult to enforce the co-promotion obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce, requires that businesses must act honestly and fairly, and requires businesses to conduct their practices within clear obligations. The changes create uncertainty and weakens those requirements.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall comply with all prevailing laws, rules and regulations and obtain all necessary approvals, consents and permits required by the applicable agencies of the government of the jurisdictions that apply to its activities or obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall endeavor to be mindful of applicable laws, rules and regulations and to seek necessary approvals, consents and permits, if feasible and appropriate, from relevant governmental agencies pertaining to their activities or obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The modified version uses weaker language such as 'endeavor to be mindful,' which introduces ambiguity regarding the extent of compliance required. 'If feasible and appropriate' makes obtaining necessary approvals discretionary rather than mandatory, undermining the original obligation. This could lead to non-compliance and legal challenges.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change conflicts with regulatory compliance standards, such as those established by the FDA or state health agencies, which require strict adherence to regulations and mandatory acquisition of necessary permits and approvals before commencing certain business activities.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "In connection with this Agreement, each Party is an independent contractor. This Agreement does not, and shall not be construed to, create an employer-employee, agency, joint venture or partnership relationship between the Parties. Neither Party shall have any authority to act for or to bind the other Party in any way, to alter any of the terms or conditions of any of the other Party's standard forms of invoices, sales agreements, warranties or otherwise, or to warrant or to execute agreements on behalf of the other or to represent that it is in any way responsible for the acts, debts, liabilities or omissions of the other Party.",
                "changed_text": "For the purpose of this Agreement, each Party may be considered an independent entity. The Parties do not intend this Agreement to establish an employer-employee, agency, joint venture, or partnership dynamic; however, circumstances might arise where one Party could reasonably assume certain responsibilities or representation on behalf of the other, subject to informal consent.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly defines the relationship as independent contractors and explicitly denies any authority for one party to bind the other. The modification introduces ambiguity by stating that each party 'may be considered an independent entity,' weakening the definition. It further creates a potential conflict by suggesting that 'circumstances might arise' where one party could 'reasonably assume' responsibilities for the other 'subject to informal consent.' This vague exception could lead to disputes about liability and authority, undermining the independent contractor relationship.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change contradicts IRS guidelines for independent contractor status, which require a clear separation and lack of control by one party over the other. The possibility of 'reasonably assum[ing] certain responsibilities' blurs the line between contractor and employee, potentially leading to misclassification and violations of employment tax laws and employee protection laws.",

                "original_text": "You shall devote all of your time, attention and best efforts to the Franchised Business pursuant to this Agreement and all work and services performed and/or supervised by you under this Agreement shall be performed and/or supervised by you or by your authorized employees. You shall adhere to all current established policies, practices and procedures of the System, and as the same may be amended from time to time, and shall not deviate therefrom without our prior written consent.",
                "changed_text": "You should consider devoting a significant portion of your time and attention to the Franchised Business, and work and services may be performed and/or supervised by you or your employees. You are encouraged to generally follow the System’s policies, practices, and procedures, but deviations may occur.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to devote 'all' time and attention to the franchise, using 'should consider' which introduces ambiguity. Replacing 'shall be performed' with 'may be performed' makes supervision less mandatory. Replacing 'shall adhere' with 'are encouraged to generally follow' makes compliance with system policies discretionary. All these changes weaken the franchisees obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts the principle of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to a contract to act honestly and reasonably. By making the franchisee's effort and compliance discretionary, it creates a loophole that undermines the franchisor's ability to enforce brand standards.",

                "changed_text": "You should endeavor to maintain a place of business that is generally safe and clean and conduct the Franchised Business in a manner that might generate some goodwill and public approval.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the requirement to maintain a safe and clean business. Replacing 'shall maintain' with 'should endeavor to maintain' makes it a goal rather than a requirement. Replacing 'in compliance with all governmental and industry standards' with 'that is generally safe and clean' reduces the standard. Replacing 'generates goodwill and public approval' with 'might generate some goodwill and public approval' lowers expectations.",
                "contradicted_law": "This potentially violates health and safety regulations, which mandate specific, non-discretionary standards for business premises. This change introduces ambiguity, making it harder to enforce these standards.",

                "original_text": "You shall conduct advertising to solicit Applicants for the purchase of Unit Franchisees in the Master Territory (“Solicitation Advertising”).  You shall expend not less than $5,000 each month on such Solicitation Advertising. To protect the Proprietary Marks and our goodwill in the industry, you must submit samples of all proposed Solicitation Advertising materials to us at least fifteen (15) days before any use of the same. If we do not disapprove the proposed Solicitation Advertising materials within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the same, you may use the proposed Solicitation Advertising materials as submitted to us; provided, however, that if such Solicitation Advertising is required to be submitted to a government agency, you shall so submit such materials to the applicable government agency and shall not use such materials until the materials are approved or disapproved or if the use of the materials otherwise become permissible under law, such as if notice of disapproval is not received from a governmental agency within a stated period of time prescribed by law. We may, at any time after you begin to use the Solicitation Advertising materials, prohibit further use of the same, effective upon your receipt of written notice from us to do so.",
                "changed_text": "You are encouraged to conduct advertising to solicit Applicants for the purchase of Unit Franchises in the Master Territory (“Solicitation Advertising”).  You may consider spending around $5,000 each month on such Solicitation Advertising. To protect the Proprietary Marks and our goodwill in the industry, submitting samples of proposed Solicitation Advertising materials to us at least fifteen (15) days before any use of the same would be appreciated. If we do not communicate disapproval of the proposed Solicitation Advertising materials in a reasonable amount of time after receiving them, you might be able to use the proposed Solicitation Advertising materials as submitted to us; provided, however, that if such Solicitation Advertising is required to be submitted to a government agency, you should probably submit such materials to the applicable government agency and maybe not use such materials until they’re somehow approved or permissible under law. We retain some right to possibly disallow further use of advertising materials, likely after providing written notice.",
                "explanation": "This transformation significantly weakens the franchise's advertising obligations, introducing substantial ambiguity. The mandatory 'shall' becomes 'are encouraged,' making advertising discretionary. Replacing the definite spending commitment 'shall expend not less than $5,000' with 'may consider spending around $5,000' introduces vagueness, and the formal review process is softened to 'submitting samples ... would be appreciated' with a vague timeline for approval.",
                "contradicted_law": "These modifications conflict with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, particularly regarding the franchisee's obligation to promote the franchise, and undermine advertising standards that franchise systems must uphold to protect its reputation.",

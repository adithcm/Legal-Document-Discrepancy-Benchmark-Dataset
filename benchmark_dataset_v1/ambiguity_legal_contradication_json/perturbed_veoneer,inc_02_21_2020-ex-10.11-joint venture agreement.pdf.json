                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the Nissin Parties agree to cause each of VNBJ and VNBZ to comply with Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of the JV Agreement with respect to the indemnification or reimbursement, as applicable, of all Directors and Officers (except those individuals resigning pursuant to Section 6.2.6 of the VNBJ SPA and Section 6.2.6 of the VNBZ SPA) with respect to any Liabilities arising prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the Nissin Parties will encourage each of VNBJ and VNBZ to consider Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of the JV Agreement with respect to the indemnification or reimbursement, as applicable, of Directors and Officers with respect to Liabilities arising prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'agree to cause to comply' is replaced with 'will encourage to consider,' weakening the obligation for indemnification. The removal of the exclusion of individuals resigning pursuant to specific sections also creates ambiguity, potentially leading to disputes over which directors and officers are entitled to indemnification. This introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation difficult to enforce, as 'encourage to consider' does not guarantee actual compliance with the indemnification provisions, contradicting standard corporate governance practices in Japan.",

                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall generally be interpreted according to principles informed by the laws of Japan.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan' to 'generally be interpreted according to principles informed by the laws of Japan' introduces ambiguity. It is no longer explicitly stating that Japanese law will govern the agreement but rather implies that Japanese legal principles will only loosely guide its interpretation. This creates uncertainty regarding which specific laws apply and how they should be enforced. This could contradict principles of Contract Law in Japan.",

                "changed_text": "This Amendment may become effective upon the VNBJ Closing with respect to Article 1.1 and the VNBZ Closing with respect to Article 1.2, and may terminate if the VNBJ SPA and the VNBZ SPA are terminated.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall only become effective' to 'may become effective' and 'shall terminate' to 'may terminate' introduces uncertainty about the amendment's enforceability. By using 'may' instead of 'shall,' the effectiveness and termination become discretionary rather than definitive. This ambiguity could contradict fundamental aspects of Japanese Contract Law, which relies on legally binding agreements that are not subject to arbitrary changes in effectiveness.",

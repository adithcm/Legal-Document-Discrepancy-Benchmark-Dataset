                "original_text": "Each Party shall promptly disclose to the other Party all Inventions made by it during the Term; provided that GSK will be allowed a reasonable time to file patent applications covering GSK Inventions prior to disclosing the GSK Invention to Theravance, and Theravance will be allowed a reasonable time to file patent applications covering Theravance Inventions prior to disclosing the Theravance Invention to GSK.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall endeavor to disclose to the other Party all Inventions made by it during the Term; provided that GSK may be allowed a suitable time to file patent applications covering GSK Inventions before possibly disclosing the GSK Invention to Theravance, and Theravance may be allowed a suitable time to file patent applications covering Theravance Inventions before possibly disclosing the Theravance Invention to GSK.",
                "explanation": "The modifications replace 'shall promptly disclose' with 'shall endeavor to disclose,' weakening the mandatory nature of the disclosure. Additionally, replacing 'will be allowed a reasonable time' with 'may be allowed a suitable time' introduces ambiguity regarding the time frame for filing patent applications before disclosure. The use of 'possibly disclosing' further adds uncertainty. This contradicts the legal expectation of prompt and transparent disclosure of inventions, which is standard in collaborative agreements to protect intellectual property rights, creating ambiguity and enforceability issues.",
                "contradicted_law": "Relevant intellectual property laws emphasize the importance of timely disclosure for patent priority and protection.",

                "original_text": "GSK shall have the overall responsibility for, and use Diligent Efforts in, the performance of all such Development activities which shall include, where applicable, relevant regulatory filings (as contemplated under Article 8) for any such Collaboration Product moved forward in Development. Further, GSK shall use Diligent Efforts to advance such Collaboration Product through Development in accordance with the Go/No-Go checkpoints identified in the then current Development Plan for such Collaboration Product.",
                "changed_text": "GSK shall have the general responsibility for, and attempt to use Diligent Efforts in, the performance of most Development activities, which may include, where seen fit, some regulatory filings (as loosely contemplated under Article 8) for any such Collaboration Product potentially moved forward in Development. Further, GSK may try to use Diligent Efforts to consider advancing such Collaboration Product through Development, possibly in line with the vaguely defined Go/No-Go checkpoints somewhat outlined in the current Development Plan for such Collaboration Product.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation significantly weakens GSK's obligations. 'Shall have the overall responsibility' is changed to 'shall have the general responsibility,' reducing the scope of responsibility. 'Use Diligent Efforts' is softened to 'attempt to use Diligent Efforts.' 'Which shall include, where applicable, relevant regulatory filings' becomes 'which may include, where seen fit, some regulatory filings,' making the filings discretionary. 'As contemplated under Article 8' is weakened to 'as loosely contemplated under Article 8.' 'Moved forward in Development' is changed to 'potentially moved forward in Development,' reducing certainty. 'In accordance with' becomes 'possibly in line with,' and 'identified in the then current Development Plan' is replaced with 'somewhat outlined in the current Development Plan,' introducing vagueness. This contradicts regulatory requirements mandating specific and diligent actions.",
                "contradicted_law": "FDA regulations (21 CFR Part 312) require specific, diligent actions in drug development, including regulatory filings and adherence to development plans.",

                "original_text": "Each Party acknowledges the goodwill and reputation that has been associated with the other Party’s Housemarks over the years, and shall use such Housemarks in a manner that maintains and promotes such goodwill and reputation and is consistent with trademark guidelines. Each Party shall take all reasonable precautions and actions to protect the goodwill and reputation that has inured to the other Party’s Housemarks, shall refrain from doing any act that is reasonably likely to impair the reputation of such Housemarks, and shall cooperate fully to protect such Housemarks.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party vaguely recognizes the potential goodwill and reputation that might be associated with the other Party’s Housemarks, and should consider using such Housemarks in a way that might not harm such goodwill and reputation as generally understood. Each Party should think about taking some precautions and actions to, when possible, protect the potential goodwill and reputation, maybe refrain from some actions, and possibly cooperate when available to protect the Housemarks.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces several ambiguities that weaken the original obligation. 'Acknowledges the goodwill and reputation' is softened to 'vaguely recognizes the potential goodwill and reputation.' The mandatory 'shall use' is replaced with the suggestive 'should consider using.' The obligation to 'maintain and promote' becomes the vague 'might not harm.' 'Shall take all reasonable precautions and actions' is reduced to 'should think about taking some precautions and actions' with the added condition 'when possible.' Similarly, 'shall refrain from doing any act that is reasonably likely to impair' becomes 'maybe refrain from some actions,' and 'shall cooperate fully' becomes 'possibly cooperate when available.'",

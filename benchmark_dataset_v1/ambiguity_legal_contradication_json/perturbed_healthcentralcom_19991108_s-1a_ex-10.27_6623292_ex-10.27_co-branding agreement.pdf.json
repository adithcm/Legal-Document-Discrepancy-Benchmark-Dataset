                "original_text": "ensure that in the event that user traffic to the Co-Branded Site falls\n     below the levels outlined in Schedule 2, that MediaLinx will use all\n     commercially reasonable efforts to increase promotion to the Co-Branded\n     Site until usage to the site increases to levels above the levels outlined\n     in Schedule 2余 and",

                "explanation": "The change from 'ensure' to 'potentially falls' and from 'will use' to 'may use' introduces ambiguity regarding MediaLinx's obligation to increase promotion. The addition of 'near the levels' creates a vague target and conflicts with the original contract terms. This undermines the enforceability of the clause.",

                "changed_text": "HCI shall endeavor to maintain a level of Canadian content on the Co-Branded Site\n     that is generally similar to the content found on the HealthyWay section of the\n     Sympatico web site on the Launch Date, and ensure that the level of\n     Canadian content is reasonably followed in accordance with the attached Schedule\n     \"3\"余",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'ensure' with 'endeavor to maintain' and 'such levels' with 'generally similar' significantly weakens the obligation to maintain a specific level of Canadian content. Adding 'reasonably followed' turns a set-in-stone rule to something closer to a suggestion. This is ambiguous and could lead to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces multiple ambiguities. Replacing 'shall ensure' with 'make an effort to ensure,' 'wholly responsible' with 'reasonably responsible,' 'all products and transactions' with 'some products and certain transactions,' 'shall comply with all applicable...laws' with 'attempt to comply with most applicable...laws,' and 'including privacy laws' with 'with some concern for privacy laws' significantly weakens the legal obligation for third-party compliance.

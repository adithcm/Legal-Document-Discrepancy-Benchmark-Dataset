                "original_text": "Sellers agrees to support the creation of purchasing specifications for Products by Buyer and agrees to supply Products in accordance to those purchasing specifications. Seller has the right to review each purchasing specification and needs to accept in writing before such purchasing specifications become effective. Seller has the right to take exceptions to terms and provisions in these purchasing specifications if in contradiction with Seller’s Sales specifications, General Terms and Condition of Sales or other Seller’s procedures and policies.",
                "changed_text": "Sellers will consider supporting the creation of purchasing specifications for Products by Buyer and will endeavor to supply Products in a manner consistent with those purchasing specifications. Seller will have the opportunity to review each purchasing specification, and acceptance in writing may be required for such purchasing specifications to become effective. Seller retains the option to note exceptions to terms and provisions in these purchasing specifications if they are perceived to potentially conflict with Seller’s Sales specifications, General Terms and Condition of Sales or other Seller’s procedures and policies.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces ambiguity by weakening the seller's obligation. Replacing 'agrees to support' with 'will consider supporting' and 'agrees to supply' with 'will endeavor to supply' makes the commitment non-binding. Similarly, 'needs to accept in writing' is replaced by 'acceptance in writing may be required', making the acceptance discretionary. Finally replacing 'in contradiction with' with 'potentially conflict with' makes the reason for taking exceptions vague. This may conflict with the FDA regulations regarding pharmaceutical packaging which requires manufacturers to adhere to strict quality standards and specifications agreed upon by both parties, making the specifications vague can be considered a violation.",

West/A will share its needs with EMCC/A and how they relate to West/A activities to help guide ExxonMobil Chemical Affiliates technical efforts.",
                "changed_text": "EMCC/A may offer technical assistance in the use of Products and may utilize its technical centers to facilitate communications with West Pharmaceutical Services Affiliates technical centers. West/A intends to share its needs with EMCC/A and how they relate to West/A activities to generally inform ExxonMobil Chemical Affiliates technical efforts.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the commitment to provide technical expertise. 'Will provide' is changed to 'may offer,' and 'will use' becomes 'may utilize,' introducing uncertainty about the level of support. The wording 'to help guide' becomes 'to generally inform', which lowers the expectation on what ExxonMobil will consider when helping West Pharmaceuticals. This creates an ambiguous obligation that undermines the clarity and enforceability of technical assistance, and is a potential violation of quality assurance standard if there is a clear need of providing assistance.",

                "changed_text": "Seller may consider entering into discussions with Buyer, and will endeavor to explore potential enhancements to risk mitigation and business continuity strategies.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'agrees to enter into discussions and negotiations' to 'may consider entering into discussions,' the obligation to actively engage in these activities becomes discretionary. Also 'take reasonable efforts' is changed to 'endeavor to explore potential enhancements' makes the extent of commitment unclear. This creates an ambiguous legal obligation, as what constitutes 'exploring potential enhancements' can be subjective and open to interpretation. A failure to specify the level of business continuity required might clash with regulations if that business continuity is needed.",

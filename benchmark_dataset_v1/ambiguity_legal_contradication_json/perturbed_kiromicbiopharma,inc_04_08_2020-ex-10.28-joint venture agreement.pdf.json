                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Molipharma allows Kiromic’s staff in charge of the above research programs to have access to its own structures, identified from time to time, as well as the possible use of its own equipment, in compliance with the law provisions and the regulations therein applied, in compliance and observance of the protection, safety and health standards therein applied.",
                "changed_text": "Molipharma may allow Kiromic’s staff to access its structures and equipment, subject to Molipharma’s discretion and consideration of applicable regulations. The extent of compliance with safety and health standards will be determined by Molipharma.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'allows' with 'may allow,' making access discretionary rather than mandatory. The phrase 'subject to Molipharma’s discretion' further weakens the obligation. Replacing 'in compliance and observance' with 'extent of compliance will be determined by Molipharma' introduces further ambiguity regarding the adherence to safety and health standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) regulations, which mandate strict adherence to specific safety and health standards in the workplace, not subject to the employer's discretion.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties should endeavor to notify each other about the achievement of the Scope, as mentioned in point 2 (“the Results”), that may be subject to Industrial and Intellectual Property Rights, within a reasonable time from the achievement of such Results and to consider cooperating in the evaluation of the existence of the necessary requirements for the patenting/registration of such Results.",
                "explanation": "The modified text uses 'should endeavor' instead of 'undertake,' making the notification process optional rather than obligatory. The phrase 'a reasonable time' replaces the specific '30 days,' introducing vagueness. 'Consider cooperating' diminishes the commitment to cooperate, creating further ambiguity regarding the patenting process.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States Patent Law, specifically the requirements for timely disclosure and diligent pursuit of patent rights. Delaying notification and cooperation can jeopardize patent eligibility and enforcement.",

The Party to whom the communication is addressed will therefore be released from any responsibility and/or claim of third parties, related to the possible communication of common and/or sensitive data made in breach of the provisions of this clause and the Privacy Code and EU Reg. 679/2016.",

The Party to whom the communication is addressed may be released from some responsibility and/or some claims of third parties, related to the communication of common and/or sensitive data made in possible breach of the provisions of this clause and EU Reg. 679/2016.",
                "explanation": "The original text holds each party individually responsible, while the modification replaces 'shall be' with 'may be held,' making responsibility uncertain. The removal of the obligation to have prior consent when sharing common and/or sensitive data introduces further ambiguity. The phrase 'possible breach' and 'some responsibility' weakens the protection of personal data.",
                "contradicted_law": "GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), which mandates strict accountability and data protection measures for the processing of personal data. The changes allow ambiguity in accountability and weakens the necessity of adhering to required procedures.",

                "original_text": "RGHI and such Affiliates will perform the agreed key controls and evidence such performance in the agreed format. Company shall have the right, in a manner to avoid unreasonable interruption to RGHI’s or its Affiliates’ business, to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of the key controls; and (2) upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice to RGHI, perform (through its external auditor) audit procedures over RGHI’s internal controls and procedures for the Services provided under this Agreement; provided that such right to audit shall exist solely to the extent reasonably required by Company’s external auditors to ensure Company’s compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.",
                "changed_text": "RGHI and such Affiliates will endeavor to perform the agreed key controls and may evidence such performance in a suitable format. Company may have the opportunity, as resources allow and without undue disruption to RGHI’s or its Affiliates’ business, to (1) assess the general nature of key controls; and (2) with reasonable notice, consider conducting audit procedures over RGHI’s internal controls and procedures, if deemed necessary. The ability to audit will be subject to RGHI's approval and may be limited based on RGHI's assessment of the audit's impact on their operations.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation by changing 'will perform' to 'will endeavor to perform,' making the performance of key controls discretionary. Changing 'agreed format' to 'suitable format' makes the evidentiary standard vague. Replacing 'shall have the right' with 'may have the opportunity' reduces the company's right to audit to a mere possibility, contingent on available resources and subject to RGHI's approval. This contradicts the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires a clear and enforceable right for companies to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.",

                "original_text": "Provider shall perform the Services (i) at a level of quality substantially similar in all material respects to that at which such Services were performed or enjoyed during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof and (ii) in accordance with applicable Law (collectively, (i) and (ii), the “Service Standard”). Subject to Section 3.1(c), internal controls of Provider and its Affiliates with respect to the Service Standard shall remain materially the same in effect throughout the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Provider will aim to perform the Services (i) at a generally comparable level of quality to that previously observed and (ii) with consideration for applicable Law (collectively, (i) and (ii), the “Service Standard”). Internal controls of Provider and its Affiliates may be adjusted from time to time, provided they do not significantly deviate from past practices.",
                "explanation": "The original text set a clear 'Service Standard' that the Provider had to meet. The modified text weakens this standard by replacing 'shall perform' with 'will aim to perform', making the performance less mandatory. Changing 'substantially similar in all material respects' to 'generally comparable level' introduces ambiguity, making it difficult to objectively assess the quality of services. Replacing 'in accordance with applicable Law' with 'with consideration for applicable Law' weakens the legal obligation. Stating that internal controls 'may be adjusted from time to time' introduces ambiguity, as the term \"significantly deviate\" is vague and hard to measure. This may conflict with laws that require consistent internal controls.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall, and shall cause any of its Affiliates or third parties providing or receiving Services (as the case may be) to, follow the reasonable policies, procedures and practices of the other Party and its Affiliates applicable to the Services that are known or made known to such Party. A failure of a Recipient to act in accordance with this Section 3.2 that prevents a Provider from providing a Service hereunder shall, upon reasonable advance written notice to the Recipient (where practicable), relieves Provider of its obligations under the Service until such time as the failure has been cured.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party should endeavor to ensure its Affiliates and third parties giving or getting Services, take note of the other Party’s policies, procedures, and practices related to the Services, insofar as practical. If a Recipient’s action somehow complicates a Provider's ability to provide a Service, the Provider might, if feasible, inform the Recipient beforehand and may be relieved of certain obligations.",
                "explanation": "This change makes compliance with policies discretionary rather than mandatory. Replacing 'shall' with 'should endeavor' weakens the obligation for each Party to ensure compliance. The change from 'follow the reasonable policies' to 'take note of... insofar as practical' introduces significant ambiguity, as the extent of 'practical' is not defined. Replacing 'prevents a Provider from providing a Service' with 'somehow complicates a Provider's ability' weakens the causal link required for relief of obligations, and the phrase \"might, if feasible\" makes Provider's actions even less certain. There are many laws that states companies need to adhere to rules, this statement contradicts that.",

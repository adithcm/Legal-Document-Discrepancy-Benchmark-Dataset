                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Company agrees that it shall:\n(i) comply with the laws and regulations that govern its business;",
                "changed_text": "The Company agrees that it shall:\n(i) endeavor to comply with the laws and regulations that govern its business, to the best of its understanding;",
                "explanation": "Changing 'comply' to 'endeavor to comply' introduces ambiguity. The phrase 'to the best of its understanding' makes the obligation subjective and potentially unenforceable. It allows the company to claim compliance even if they are not fully meeting legal requirements due to a claimed lack of understanding.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts the strict compliance standards expected by various state and federal laws, including those enforced by the FDA regarding pharmaceutical dispensing and HIPAA regarding patient data privacy, applicable in both Florida and Texas.",

Distributor agrees to include Company's trademarks, and the phrase \"Authorized Company Distributor,\" on all literature, marketing collateral, stationery and business correspondence in which the Products or related services are mentioned.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor agrees to make efforts to market Company's Products in the Territory. Distributor will try to include Company's trademarks, and the phrase \"Authorized Company Distributor,\" on relevant literature, marketing collateral, stationery and business correspondence.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'commercially reasonable efforts' with 'make efforts,' the standard of marketing performance becomes vague and subjective. Similarly, substituting 'agrees to include' with 'will try to include' weakens the obligation to use Company's trademarks in marketing materials. The addition of 'relevant' also introduces a subjective criterion, that allows the Distributor to decide whether include or not the Company's trademarks.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts standard contract law principles requiring clear obligations, making enforcement difficult, especially regarding trademark usage. It also potentially violates marketing regulations in Texas and Florida that require accurate representation of products and affiliations.",

                "original_text": "Each party shall keep true, accurate and consistent records containing regular entries relating to the disposition of\nthe Products, distributed reproduced or maintained in inventory by each respective Party. These records shall be available for examination during\nnormal business hours by accountants representing the other Party, who shall be entitled to perform an audit and to make copies and extracts, and\nreceive any explanations that may reasonably be requested. Each Party is responsible for payment of the accountant's fee, except that the other\nParty shall be responsible for such fees in the event the examination disclose a discrepancy in a Party's favor of more than five percent (5%) of the\npayments due under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each party should try to keep records relating to the Products, distributed reproduced or maintained in inventory. These records may be available for examination during business hours, if practical, by accountants. Each Party might be responsible for payment of the accountant's fee.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall keep true, accurate and consistent records' to 'should try to keep records' weakens the record-keeping requirement. Further, making the availability of records for examination conditional ('if practical') creates uncertainty. Finally, changing 'Each Party is responsible' to 'Each Party might be responsible' makes the responsibility for accountant fees conditional and vague.",
                "contradicted_law": "This undermines the requirement for maintaining auditable financial records as mandated by the IRS and accounting standards, making it difficult to verify financial transactions and comply with tax laws. It also contradicts general principles of contract law requiring parties to act in good faith and be responsible for their obligations.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Consultant shall at all times and in all respects do its utmost to enhance and develop the business interests and welfare of the Company.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant shall endeavor to enhance and develop the business interests and welfare of the Company.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall at all times and in all respects do its utmost' with 'shall endeavor' weakens the obligation. 'Endeavor' implies an attempt, not a guarantee, making the consultant's responsibility less stringent and open to interpretation. This contradicts the fiduciary duty that consultants owe to companies to work in their best interest. Under Canadian law, this standard typically requires more than just an effort.",

                "changed_text": "The Services undertaken by the Consultant under this Agreement should generally align with applicable laws and reflect reasonable business ethics.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be in full compliance' to 'should generally align' and 'high degree of business ethics' to 'reasonable business ethics' introduces ambiguity and reduces the legal standard. 'Generally align' suggests that deviations are possible, and 'reasonable business ethics' is subjective. This undermines the clear legal and ethical requirement for full compliance. This contradicts the legal requirement for full compliance with Canadian laws.",

                "changed_text": "The Consultant will aim to keep records of Works made, and such records may be made available to the Company as reasonably practicable.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will keep and maintain adequate and current written records' with 'will aim to keep records' introduces uncertainty about the quality and consistency of record-keeping. Similarly, changing 'will be available at all times to the Company' to 'may be made available to the Company as reasonably practicable' creates ambiguity regarding accessibility. This change weakens the obligation to maintain records. This change contradicts intellectual property law which stipulates that clear record keeping is a must.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"have or shall obtain and each shall use their best efforts to maintain\" to \"will attempt to obtain and maintain\" and adding the condition of \"if it is practical\", the obligation becomes vague and unenforceable. It is not clear what constitutes an \"attempt\" or what makes obtaining or maintaining a license \"impractical.\" This weakens S2K's responsibility to be properly licensed.",

S2K shall perform these services in a professional and competent manner and shall provide such office space and equipment, telephone facilities and personnel as it determines may be reasonably necessary or beneficial in order to provide such services at no cost to the Distributor.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"sufficient staff and expenditures...consistent with industry standards\" with \"staff and resources as it deems fit\" introduces subjectivity and removes a benchmark for performance. Similarly, \"strive to perform competently\" is weaker than \"shall perform in a professional and competent manner,\" and \"potentially helpful\" makes the provision of resources discretionary. This affects S2K's required level of commitment.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"agrees to comply\" with Reg S-P to \"will attempt to adhere to Reg S-P to the extent feasible,\" the obligation becomes discretionary.

                "original_text": "All books and records relative to COMPANY’S obligations to a particular Licensor hereunder shall be maintained and made accessible to that Licensor for inspection at a location in Los Angeles, California for at least twelve (12) months after termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "All books and records relative to COMPANY’S obligations to a particular Licensor hereunder shall be maintained and made accessible to that Licensor for inspection at a location reasonably convenient to Company in Los Angeles, California for approximately twelve (12) months after termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'reasonably convenient' introduces ambiguity as it does not specify the standards for convenience and allows the Company to decide the location. The phrase 'approximately twelve months' creates ambiguity because the exact period for maintaining records is not definitively specified. This contradicts California law, which requires specific and accessible record-keeping for business transactions, especially concerning audits and legal compliance. California Corporations Code Section 1502 requires businesses to maintain records for a specified duration to ensure transparency and accountability.",

                "changed_text": "Each report rendered by COMPANY to a Licensor hereunder shall become generally considered final approximately twelve (12) months following the date COMPANY might render same to that Licensor unless the Licensor provides COMPANY with a written expression of concern thereto.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"final and incontestable\" to \"generally considered final,\" the obligation of finality is weakened, creating uncertainty about when the reports are actually closed for dispute. Changing \"detailed written objection\" to \"written expression of concern\" makes the objection process vague because the level of detail needed for an effective objection is undefined. This change undermines regulatory compliance with California's accounting standards, which requires clear and incontestable financial records for audits and regulatory reporting.",

                "changed_text": "Each of COMPANY and CONTENT PROVIDER agrees to endeavor to execute and deliver such other documents or agreements and consider taking such other action as may be helpful for the general implementation of this Agreement and the potential consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to execute and deliver' to 'agrees to endeavor to execute and deliver' weakens the commitment to complete necessary documentation. Replacing 'reasonably necessary or desirable' with 'may be helpful for the general implementation' introduces a subjective standard based on what might be 'helpful' and makes the implementation 'general,' reducing specificity. The change from 'consummation' to 'potential consummation' creates uncertainty about whether the transactions will actually be completed. This undermines the enforceability of the agreement, contradicting California contract law which requires clear and definite terms for a contract to be binding. The changes introduce doubt and weaken the obligations to take actions needed for fulfilling the contract's purpose.",

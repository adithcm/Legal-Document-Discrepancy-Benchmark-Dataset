                "original_text": "Each Party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to conduct the Development activities for which it is responsible, as described in the Phase I Clinical Development Plan and Phase II Clinical Development Plan, in compliance with: (a) the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (b) the Phase I Clinical Development Plan and Phase II Clinical Development Plan, as updated from time to time; (c) all applicable GLP, GCP and applicable cGMP requirements, including, without limitation those specified by the ICH; and (d) all Applicable Laws and Regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will attempt to conduct Development activities for which it is responsible, as described in the Phase I Clinical Development Plan and Phase II Clinical Development Plan, and will generally consider compliance with: (a) the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (b) the Phase I Clinical Development Plan and Phase II Clinical Development Plan, as updated from time to time; (c) GLP, GCP and applicable cGMP requirements, including, without limitation those specified by the ICH; and (d) Applicable Laws and Regulations, only to the extent feasible.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates the use of Commercially Reasonable Efforts in complying with all listed requirements. The modified text weakens this by stating the party will 'attempt' to conduct activities and 'generally consider' compliance 'only to the extent feasible.' This introduces ambiguity and discretion, potentially conflicting with regulatory requirements that demand strict adherence.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates the South Korean Pharmaceutical Affairs Act, which requires strict adherence to GLP, GCP, and cGMP standards in drug development.",

As between Green Cross and MacroGenics, ***. Green Cross shall bear all of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with all such Commercialization activities in the Territory.",
                "changed_text": "Green Cross may periodically inform MacroGenics of its Commercialization activities at JSC meetings. As between Green Cross and MacroGenics, ***. Green Cross will cover the majority of costs and expenses associated with Commercialization activities in the Territory, as it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates regular updates at JSC meetings and that Green Cross shall bear *all* costs. The modified text changes 'shall update' to 'may periodically inform', making the updates discretionary. It also replaces 'shall bear all' costs with 'will cover the majority,' making the financial obligation ambiguous. It further gives the cost covering an 'as it deems appropriate' which makes the decision of how to allocate the budget, to Green Cross, violating the intent of the original.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates South Korean Fair Trade Act by potentially allowing Green Cross to disproportionately shift financial burden or reduce accountability, affecting proper commercialization and market competition.",

                "changed_text": "Green Cross should endeavor to notify MacroGenics regarding the potential occurrence of a possible First Commercial Sale in the Territory.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a direct, clear obligation to notify MacroGenics. The revised text weakens this obligation by replacing 'shall timely notify' with 'should endeavor to notify,' making the notification optional. Additionally, it changes 'occurrence' to 'potential occurrence of a possible,' which makes the event itself uncertain, further reducing the strength of the obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates the basic principles of contract law in South Korea, which requires clear communication and fulfilment of obligations to ensure proper enforcement of contractual agreements.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Transporter will receive Customer Gas at the prevailing pressure at which such Customer Gas is delivered to the applicable Point of Receipt by the operator of the applicable Plant.",
                "changed_text": "Transporter will aim to receive Customer Gas at a pressure close to the prevailing pressure at which such Customer Gas is delivered to the applicable Point of Receipt by the operator of the applicable Plant.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the transporter will receive gas at the prevailing pressure. The modified text uses 'aim to receive Customer Gas at a pressure close to the prevailing pressure' which makes the obligation ambiguous. What is considered 'close' is undefined, giving the Transporter leeway to deviate from the actual prevailing pressure. This could lead to disputes and potential under-performance in violation of the implicit duty to maintain consistent and adequate transportation services.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Texas contract law, which requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in the performance of their contractual obligations.",

                "original_text": "Within fifteen (15) calendar Days following receipt of each of Transporter’s invoices and statements, Customer shall make payment to Transporter of all undisputed amounts by wire transfer, in accordance with the account information provided to Customer, unless another form of payment is agreed to in writing by the Parties. Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid. If Customer fails to pay Transporter undisputed amounts due hereunder and such failure is not cured within ten (10) calendar Days’ of written notice from Transporter to Customer, Transporter may suspend receipt and delivery of Customer Gas without prejudice to any other available remedies at law or in equity.",
                "changed_text": "Within a reasonable timeframe following receipt of Transporter’s invoices and statements, Customer shall endeavor to make payment to Transporter of all undisputed amounts by a method agreeable to both parties. If Customer encounters difficulties in adhering to this payment schedule, both parties will engage in discussions to find a mutually satisfactory resolution. Transporter retains the option to suspend receipt and delivery of Customer Gas, provided that such action is preceded by good-faith efforts to resolve any payment discrepancies.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a strict 15-day payment term. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'reasonable timeframe' and 'endeavor to make payment,' making the payment deadline vague. It also replaces the clear interest accrual with a discretionary 'discussion' approach and the suspension for failure to pay is now subjected to 'good-faith efforts to resolve any payment discrepancies'. This weakened language makes enforcement difficult and contradicts the certainty required for payment obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Business and Commerce Code regarding prompt payment laws, which generally require clear payment terms and timelines in commercial contracts.",

Exclusive venue for any suit, action or proceeding brought by either Party in connection with this Agreement or arising out of the terms or conditions hereof shall be in the state or federal courts situated in Harris County, Texas.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement is generally understood to be subject to applicable laws, potentially including those of the State of Texas. The Parties anticipate that any disputes will ideally be resolved through amicable discussions, although judicial proceedings may occur in a venue deemed appropriate at the time, taking into account the convenience of both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly specifies Texas law and Harris County courts as the governing law and venue. The modified version uses vague language like 'generally understood,' 'potentially including,' 'amicable discussions,' and 'venue deemed appropriate at the time'. This introduces uncertainty about the applicable law and jurisdiction, making it difficult to predict where and how disputes will be resolved. This could conflict with the principle of certainty in contract law.",

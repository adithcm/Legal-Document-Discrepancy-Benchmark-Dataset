                "original_text": "Each party agrees to hold such Confidential Information in strictest confidence, to use all efforts reasonable under the circumstances to maintain the secrecy thereof, and not to make use thereof other than in accordance with this Agreement, and not to release or disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the other’s prior written consent, subject to a court order, or subject to a sublicense consistent with this Agreement and requiring the sublicensee to maintain the Confidential Information in strictest confidence, to use all efforts reasonable under the circumstances to maintain the secrecy thereof, not to make use thereof other than in accordance with the sublicense Agreement, and not to release or disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the other’s prior written consent.",
                "changed_text": "Each party will endeavor to hold such Confidential Information with reasonable care, making commercially reasonable efforts, as they deem appropriate, to maintain the secrecy thereof, and may use it in a manner they consider acceptable, unless explicitly forbidden herein, and may release or disclose Confidential Information to a third party if they believe it is in their best interest, or as required by a court order, or subject to a sublicense that requires the sublicensee to use reasonable efforts to maintain confidentiality. Each party will make an effort to avoid use other than in accordance with the sublicense Agreement and will try not to release or disclose Confidential Information to any third party without considering the other’s prior written consent.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the confidentiality obligations by replacing 'strictest confidence' with 'reasonable care' and 'commercially reasonable efforts as they deem appropriate,' making the standard of care subjective and discretionary. Replacing the restriction on use with 'may use it in a manner they consider acceptable, unless explicitly forbidden herein' provides a loophole that contradicts the intent of protecting confidential information. The clause 'may release or disclose Confidential Information to a third party if they believe it is in their best interest' introduces ambiguity and contradicts the explicit requirement of prior written consent.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York law regarding trade secrets and confidential information requires a defined and reasonable standard of care. This change introduces excessive ambiguity, making it difficult to prove a breach of confidentiality.",

T&B and Tarek El Moussa shall be named as an additional insured on such insurance and proof of such inclusion shall be provided to T&B.",

LEA will attempt to obtain and maintain what they deem to be appropriate insurance, potentially including Commercial General Liability Insurance, including product liability insurance, trademark infringement, copyright infringement, defamation, contractual liability and personal and advertising injury liability insurance, with the amount of coverage to be decided at their discretion. T&B and Tarek El Moussa may be named as an additional insured on such insurance if LEA finds it reasonable and practical and proof of such inclusion may be provided if possible.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity into LEA's indemnification obligations. Replacing 'shall defend, hold harmless and indemnify' with 'shall endeavor to defend, hold harmless and indemnify' weakens the obligation. The use of 'potentially including' and 'arguably arising out of' makes the scope of indemnification unclear. The specification that LEA will only 'attempt to obtain and maintain what they deem to be appropriate insurance' and that coverage amounts are at 'their discretion' contradicts the previous clear insurance requirements, making it difficult to enforce. Changing 'shall be named' to 'may be named if LEA finds it reasonable and practical' makes the requirement discretionary.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under New York law, indemnification clauses must be clear and unequivocal. This change introduces excessive ambiguity, making it difficult to enforce the indemnification obligation and ensure adequate financial protection for T&B against potential liabilities.",

                "original_text": "In consideration of T&B Personality providing commercially reasonable, regular and periodic marketing support to LEA substantially in accordance with Schedule 2 attached to this Agreement and incorporated herein by reference, which LEA agrees to request and accept from T&B consistently during the Term, LEA will pay T&M a royalty in addition to the Base Royalty (“Marketing Royalty”) which shall be comprised of and calculated at [●%] of LEA’s Cash Sales made from the sale of Products at live events and [●%] of LEA’s Cash Sales made from the sale of Products at on-line webinars. For the avoidance of doubt, the Base Royalty and Marketing Royalty shall be cumulative and calculated independently, without overlap. Further, nothing herein shall be construed to enable LEA to refuse to accept reasonable, regular and periodic marketing support from T&B as a means to avoid paying T&B a Marketing Royalty. In the event, T&B offers, but LEA refuses to request or accept reasonable, regular and periodic marketing support from T&B during the Term, LEA shall continue to be obligated to pay T&B a Marketing Royalty as if such marketing support had been requested and accepted by LEA.",
                "changed_text": "If T&B Personality provides marketing support to LEA in a manner they feel is adequate, possibly in accordance with Schedule 2 attached to this Agreement, and LEA chooses to request and accept it during the Term, LEA may pay T&M a royalty in addition to the Base Royalty (“Marketing Royalty”) which could be a percentage of LEA’s Cash Sales made from the sale of Products at live events and on-line webinars. For clarification, the Base Royalty and Marketing Royalty may be cumulative and may be calculated independently. It is understood that LEA might not want to accept marketing support from T&B. If T&B offers, but LEA does not request or accept marketing support from T&B during the Term, LEA may not be obligated to pay T&B a Marketing Royalty.",
                "explanation": "This section originally clearly outlines the conditions for LEA to pay T&B a Marketing Royalty for marketing support. The modified version injects ambiguity by replacing 'commercially reasonable, regular and periodic marketing support to LEA substantially in accordance with Schedule 2' with 'marketing support to LEA in a manner they feel is adequate, possibly in accordance with Schedule 2.' This gives LEA discretion over what constitutes adequate marketing support and undermines the specific guidelines in Schedule 2. By stating that LEA 'may' pay the Marketing Royalty and that the royalties 'may' be cumulative, the obligation is weakened. Furthermore, the statement that LEA 'may not be obligated' to pay the royalty if they refuse marketing support contradicts the original clause, which mandated payment regardless of LEA's refusal.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under New York law, contracts must clearly define the obligations of each party. This change introduces vague and discretionary language, making the obligation to pay the Marketing Royalty unenforceable due to the uncertainty surrounding the marketing support requirements and LEA's payment obligations.",

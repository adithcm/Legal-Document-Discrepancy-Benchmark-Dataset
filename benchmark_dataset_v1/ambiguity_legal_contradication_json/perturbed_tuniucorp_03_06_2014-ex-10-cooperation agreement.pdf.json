                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Party A irrevocably undertakes that it will make best efforts to assist and endeavor to achieve the exclusive operation of the cooperative business to the extent permitted by laws.",
                "changed_text": "Party A will consider assisting and attempting to achieve the exclusive operation of the cooperative business as it deems reasonably appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text says Party A will make 'best efforts' to assist to achieve the exclusive operation of the cooperative business to the extent permitted by laws, which implies a strong commitment. Changing 'best efforts' to 'consider assisting and attempting' significantly weakens this obligation, making it discretionary and subject to Party A's interpretation of 'reasonably appropriate'. This could allow Party A to avoid taking necessary steps to ensure exclusive operation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Article 12 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China mandates that parties perform their obligations in good faith and in accordance with the terms of the contract. The ambiguous wording undermines this principle by allowing Party A to potentially shirk its responsibility for ensuring the exclusive operation of the cooperative business.",

                "original_text": "Party B shall have the right to adjust the amount of Service Fee at its own discretion, without the prior consent of Party A or its subsidiaries.",
                "changed_text": "Party B may consider adjustments to the Service Fee as it sees fit, and should endeavor to inform Party A or its subsidiaries of any changes.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Party B has the 'right' to adjust the amount of Service Fee at its discretion without needing consent. The modified text weakens this by stating Party B 'may consider adjustments' and 'should endeavor to inform,' which introduces ambiguity and removes the mandatory nature of the original provision. It becomes unclear when and how Party A may be informed.",
                "contradicted_law": "Article 464 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China requires fairness and reasonableness in contractual agreements. The ambiguous language could allow Party B to make arbitrary adjustments to the service fee without accountability, potentially violating these principles of fairness and reasonableness.",

                "original_text": "The Parties shall be obligated to take measures (including without limitation preparing the confidentiality rules, entering into the confidentiality agreement, establishing the archive management system and etc.) to ensure their respective employees will observe the confidentiality obligations specified hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties should explore potential measures to encourage their respective employees to generally respect confidentiality.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the parties 'shall be obligated to take measures' to ensure employee confidentiality, outlining specific examples such as confidentiality rules, agreements, and archive management. Replacing this with 'should explore potential measures to encourage...generally respect confidentiality' weakens the obligation significantly. The obligation is now discretionary, and the level of confidentiality required is vague, which makes enforcement difficult.",
                "contradicted_law": "Article 9 of the Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the People's Republic of China mandates the safeguarding of trade secrets. The weaker confidentiality measures implied by the modified text may not adequately protect sensitive information, thereby potentially violating Article 9 of the Anti-Unfair Competition Law.",

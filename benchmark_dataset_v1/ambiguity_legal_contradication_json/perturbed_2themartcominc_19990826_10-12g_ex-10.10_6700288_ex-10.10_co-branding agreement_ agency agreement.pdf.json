The Information Transfer Mechanism\nshall not go live until its operation has\nbeen approved (\"Approval Date\") by both\nparties, such approval not to be\nunreasonably withheld.",
                "changed_text": "Each party should consider cooperating with the other party in effectuating their respective duties under the SOW. The Information Transfer Mechanism shall not go live until its operation has been approved (\"Approval Date\") by both parties, with approval potentially withheld based on subjective interpretations of operational readiness.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall reasonably cooperate' to 'should consider cooperating' introduces ambiguity. The original text implies a mandatory obligation to cooperate reasonably. The modified text weakens this obligation, making the level of cooperation discretionary. Furthermore, adding 'with approval potentially withheld based on subjective interpretations of operational readiness' introduces ambiguity by allowing approval to be withheld based on subjective criteria rather than objective standards. This creates potential disputes and non-compliance.",

                "changed_text": "2TheMart may, at its discretion, promote the Services:\n(a) To some sellers and high bidders through a variety of potential means. It should be somewhat convenient for buyers or sellers to initiate a Transaction Inquiry with i-Escrow, potentially requiring them to re-enter some of their personal or transaction related information.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity by changing 'will widely promote' to 'may, at its discretion, promote,' making the promotion optional. It also replaces 'every seller and high bidder' with 'some sellers and high bidders,' making the scope of promotion unclear. The original text clearly states the intention for ease of use. This is weakened by using 'somewhat convenient' and adding 'potentially requiring them to re-enter some of their personal or transaction related information' which directly contradicts the original intent. This vagueness undermines the obligation to effectively promote the Services.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall keep for one (1) year proper records' to 'should keep records and books of account as it deems reasonably necessary' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. 'Should keep' is less mandatory than 'shall keep.' Deeming 'reasonably necessary' makes the record-keeping subjective and potentially less comprehensive than 'proper records.' The original text requires these documents to be kept for one year, where the modified text introduces ambiguity about how long they should be kept.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - The vague obligation of keeping the book and records creates a problem that cannot be enforced. California contract law requires definite terms.",

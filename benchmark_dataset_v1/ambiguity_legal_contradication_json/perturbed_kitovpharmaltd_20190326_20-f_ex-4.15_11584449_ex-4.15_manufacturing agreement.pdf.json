                "original_text": "The Parties shall store and transport the Product in compliance with applicable laws and regulations for pharmaceutical products, the Quality Agreement and the relevant Marketing Authorization. Dexcel will be responsible for packaging the Product in a manner appropriate for shipment and for including data loggers with each such shipment in accordance with the provisions of the Quality Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties shall endeavor to store and transport the Product, considering applicable laws and regulations for pharmaceutical products, the Quality Agreement, and the relevant Marketing Authorization. Dexcel will make reasonable efforts to package the Product in a suitable manner for shipment and may include data loggers with each shipment as it sees fit.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing the mandatory 'shall' with the discretionary 'shall endeavor' and 'make reasonable efforts,' weakening the obligation to comply with laws and regulations. The phrase 'may include data loggers as it sees fit' makes the inclusion of data loggers discretionary rather than mandatory, which contradicts cGMP guidelines that mandate strict adherence to storage and transportation requirements, particularly temperature monitoring, to ensure product integrity and patient safety.",

                "explanation": "This change makes the delivery commitment vague by replacing 'shall use reasonable commercial efforts' with 'will aim to deliver,' reducing the obligation to a mere intention. Furthermore, replacing 'shall be accompanied by certificates of analysis' with 'may be accompanied by certificates of analysis and other documents that Dexcel finds appropriate' makes the provision of essential documentation discretionary, conflicting with regulatory requirements for pharmaceutical product traceability and quality control.",

                "original_text": "Kitov shall provide Dexcel with written notification of any shortfalls in shipment quantity, and (a) any out-of-specification temperature excursions based on the downloaded data logger information following compliance with the provisions of the Quality Agreement, and/or (b) any failure of the Product to meet the Specifications which are apparent upon visual inspection and/or identification testing of the Product delivered to it by Dexcel (each of (a) and (b) being an “Apparent Defect”), such notification to be provided within thirty (30) Working Days of receipt of the Product at Kitov’s warehouse, accompanied by samples of any such allegedly defective Product and any such Product shall not be removed from quarantine until their status is resolved.",
                "changed_text": "Kitov should, if possible, provide Dexcel with notification of any shortfalls in shipment quantity, and potentially any temperature excursions or failures of the Product to meet Specifications. Such notification, if provided, would ideally occur within a reasonable timeframe. The handling of defective products will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation weakens Kitov's obligation to report defects and discrepancies. Replacing 'shall provide' with 'should, if possible, provide' and adding qualifiers like 'potentially' and 'ideally' makes the reporting process discretionary and vague. Removing the fixed timeframe of 'thirty (30) Working Days' and replacing it with 'a reasonable timeframe' introduces further ambiguity. The statement 'The handling of defective products will be determined on a case-by-case basis' eliminates the requirement for quarantine and a defined resolution process, contravening cGMP requirements for handling and investigating product defects.",

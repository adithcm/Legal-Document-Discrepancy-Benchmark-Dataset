                "explanation": "By adding 'generally' and 'to the extent feasible', the obligation to comply fully with broker-dealer requirements becomes ambiguous and discretionary. The language weakens the guarantee of full compliance with regulations.",

                "explanation": "The language \"endeavor to believe\" and \"hope to believe\" introduces a level of uncertainty regarding the verification of accredited investor status.

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Unless otherwise provided in this Amendment, any Confidential Information released by either of the Parties (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other Party (the “Receiving Party”) shall not be released in whole or in part to any third party.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise provided in this Amendment, any Confidential Information released by either of the Parties (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other Party (the “Receiving Party”) should generally not be released to any third party, unless deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear prohibition against releasing confidential information. The modified text weakens this by replacing 'shall not be released' with 'should generally not be released' and adding 'unless deemed appropriate,' introducing ambiguity and discretion where none existed. This makes the obligation less enforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York law, which requires clear and unambiguous contractual terms, especially regarding confidentiality agreements. Vague terms are often construed against the drafter, making enforcement unpredictable.",

                "changed_text": "- endeavor to notify the Disclosing Party if a disclosure of Confidential Information is requested by a Government Entity or by Law, and use effort to assist the Disclosing Party in limiting such disclosure as reasonably practical;",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'prompt' notification and 'all reasonable effort.' The modified text weakens this to 'endeavor to notify' and 'use effort as reasonably practical'. 'Endeavor' is less binding than 'promptly notify,' and 'as reasonably practical' introduces subjective interpretation regarding the effort required. This is ambiguous and open to interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York law requires good faith and reasonable efforts in fulfilling contractual obligations. The modified language could be interpreted as falling short of this standard, potentially leading to a breach of contract claim.",

Such committee shall be created by the Parties within [*****] from the date of receipt of the Notice of Dispute.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties may consider attempting to settle the Dispute amicably. A committee could be formed at their discretion, composed of representatives. The timeline for this process is subject to mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text obligates the parties to 'make their reasonable endeavors' and establishes a firm timeline. The revised text uses permissive language ('may consider attempting,' 'could be formed at their discretion') and eliminates the strict timeline, replacing it with a vague 'subject to mutual agreement.' This significantly reduces the legal force of the obligation to attempt amicable settlement.",
                "contradicted_law": "While New York encourages alternative dispute resolution, weakening the obligation to engage in good-faith negotiations prior to arbitration may contradict the principle of promoting efficient and timely resolution of disputes. The modification allows a party to easily avoid meaningful settlement efforts.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Customizations shall fulfill or exceed all of the functional, performance and other specifications described in the Program Materials and the documents prepared either by Bank of America or Supplier pursuant to this Agreement. as indicated below.",
                "changed_text": "The Customizations should endeavor to fulfill the functional, performance and other specifications described in the Program Materials and the documents prepared either by Bank of America or Supplier pursuant to this Agreement, as practically possible.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall fulfill or exceed' with 'should endeavor to fulfill' weakens the obligation, making it non-mandatory. Adding 'as practically possible' introduces further ambiguity, allowing subjective interpretation of the required specifications. This contradicts contract law principles that require clear and defined obligations.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall deliver' to 'will aim to deliver' and 'when reasonably convenient' makes the delivery timeline non-binding. Also, changing 'shall be incorporated' to 'may be considered for incorporation' makes the incorporation of detailed specifications discretionary for Bank of America, undermining the supplier's obligations and potentially leading to unfulfilled requirements. This introduces ambiguity and weakens the enforceability of the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "If the proposed price Is Increased by Supplier upon delivery to Bank of America of detailed specifications or at any other time hereafter, Bank of America may consider terminating this Schedule, and a partial refund, if any, will be subject to negotiation.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Bank of America may terminate this Schedule and shall receive a refund of all amounts previously paid hereunder' with 'Bank of America may consider terminating this Schedule, and a partial refund, if any, will be subject to negotiation' significantly weakens Bank of America's rights. The change makes termination discretionary rather than guaranteed and replaces a full refund with a potentially smaller, negotiated refund. This creates significant ambiguity and uncertainty about the financial consequences of a price increase. Therefore, it increases the risk of disputes and makes the agreement less enforceable.",

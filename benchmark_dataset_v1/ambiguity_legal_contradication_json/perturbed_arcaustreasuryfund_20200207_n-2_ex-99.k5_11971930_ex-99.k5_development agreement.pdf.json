                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Blockchain Administrator shall perform (or oversee, or arrange for, the performance of) development and administrative services necessary for the issuance of the Fund’s shares as ERC-1404 compatible digital securities (“Shares”) and the on-going maintenance and administration of the smart contracts underlying such Shares. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Blockchain Administrator shall provide the Fund with facilities, equipment, technology, coding and such other services as the Blockchain Administrator, subject to review by the Board, shall from time to time determine to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Blockchain Administrator shall endeavor to perform development and administrative services related to the issuance of the Fund’s shares as ERC-1404 compatible digital securities (“Shares”) and the maintenance of the smart contracts underlying such Shares. The Blockchain Administrator shall provide the Fund with facilities, equipment, technology, coding and such other services as it finds appropriate to attempt to perform its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall perform' with 'shall endeavor to perform', and 'on-going maintenance and administration' with simply 'maintenance', weakening the obligation to ensure continued, active management. It also changes the criteria for service provision from 'necessary or useful' to 'finds appropriate', giving the Blockchain Administrator much broader discretion. This introduces ambiguity regarding the level of service required and the Administrator's commitment to continuous operation of the digital securities.",

                "original_text": "The Blockchain Administrator shall ensure that any such service provider shall operate in conformity with the requirements of the Investment Company Act and other applicable federal and state law and shall maintain books and records of the Fund (if any) in a manner substantially similar to Section 2 of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Blockchain Administrator should encourage any such service provider to generally operate with consideration to the requirements of the Investment Company Act and other applicable federal and state law. Service providers should also keep records that are somewhat similar to those outlined in Section 2 of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall ensure' with 'should encourage', making compliance by service providers discretionary rather than mandatory. Additionally, replacing 'maintain books and records ... in a manner substantially similar' with 'keep records that are somewhat similar' introduces ambiguity regarding the required standards for record-keeping, making it difficult to enforce consistent compliance.",

                "original_text": "In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the Investment Company Act, the Blockchain Administrator agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund shall at all times remain the property of the Fund, shall be readily accessible during normal business hours, and shall be promptly surrendered upon the termination of the Agreement or otherwise on written request. The Blockchain Administrator further agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the Investment Company Act will be preserved for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the Investment Company Act unless any such records are earlier surrendered as provided above.",
                "changed_text": "The Blockchain Administrator acknowledges Rule 31a-3 under the Investment Company Act, and will endeavor to ensure that all records which it maintains for the Fund remain the property of the Fund, are accessible during business hours when feasible, and will be surrendered at some point after the termination of the Agreement or on request. The Blockchain Administrator will attempt to preserve records pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the Investment Company Act as per Rule 31a-2 under the Investment Company Act, unless surrendered.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees that...shall' with 'will endeavor to ensure' and 'are readily accessible during normal business hours' with 'are accessible during business hours when feasible' weakens the obligation of accessibility. The change from 'shall be promptly surrendered' to 'will be surrendered at some point after' creates significant ambiguity regarding the timing of record surrender, potentially delaying access to crucial information. The phrase 'will attempt to preserve' also weakens the commitment to preserving records as required.",
                "contradicted_law": "Investment Company Act of 1940, Rules 31a-1, 31a-2, and 31a-3, which mandate specific and non-discretionary requirements for record-keeping, accessibility, and surrender timelines to ensure regulatory oversight and investor protection.",

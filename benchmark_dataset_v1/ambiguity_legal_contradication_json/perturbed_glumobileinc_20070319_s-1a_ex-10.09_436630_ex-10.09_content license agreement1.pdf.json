                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'will endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation, and adding 'to the extent feasible' introduces further ambiguity. This makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory, which is problematic as some laws require strict adherence.",

                "explanation": "This modification replaces the 'shall provide all' with 'shall, from time to time, provide', making the provision of customer support intermittent. The wording that customer support is provided 'in a manner it deems appropriate' introduces ambiguity as it relates to quality of support. The wireless industry standards are traded out for a practice that is 'potentially consistent' with general industry practices which removes concrete standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Consumer protection laws, which often require reasonable and consistent product support. If the Wireless Products collect personal data, failure to provide support will violate CCPA and GDPR. The vague language around industry standards is non-compliant with data laws that require a basic level of security.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause' with 'shall consider making commercially reasonable efforts to encourage' reduces the level of obligation required from the licensee. By changing, the product release from '[...] no later than ***** prior to the initial theatrical release' to 'around the time of the initial theatrical release' introduces uncertainty. ",

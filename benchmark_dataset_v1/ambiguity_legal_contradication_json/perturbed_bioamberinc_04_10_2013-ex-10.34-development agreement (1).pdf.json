                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Cargill will perform the Work Plan in a workmanlike manner with reasonable skill and care ordinarily exercised by members of the profession practicing under similar conditions and in accordance with accepted industry practices and professional guidelines;",
                "changed_text": "Cargill will endeavor to perform the Work Plan in a manner they consider appropriate, taking into account what they perceive to be reasonable skill and care.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a standard of 'workmanlike manner' and adherence to 'accepted industry practices,' creating a clear obligation. The modified text replaces this with a subjective standard based on Cargill's own perception, making the obligation ambiguous. This introduces uncertainty about the required level of skill and care, potentially leading to disputes over whether Cargill adequately fulfilled its obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Subject to Section 13.1, Cargill believes it has in effect and will attempt to maintain what it considers the appropriate permits, licenses and other authorizations related to performing the Work Plan;",
                "explanation": "The original text states a clear obligation for Cargill to maintain all necessary permits and licenses. The modified text weakens this obligation by introducing subjective language such as 'believes it has' and 'what it considers the appropriate permits'. This creates ambiguity about whether Cargill is actually required to hold all legally mandated permits, and whether they are actually attempting to maintain permits, therefore conflicting with state regulations around permits and licenses.",

Cargill will own any Improvement in all fields other than the field of succinic acid and salts thereof, subject to the rights provided in Section 5.2.1 below, and such Improvement shall be designated “Cargill Improvements”. In the event it is not clear as to ownership of any Improvement as described in this Section 5.2, in other words, if it is not clear whether an invention or discovery is either a Bioamber Improvement or a Cargill Improvement, such Improvement shall be [***] and such Improvement shall be designated “Joint Improvements”.",

Cargill also may have ownership of any perceived Improvement in what they vaguely consider to be all fields other than the field of succinic acid and salts thereof, subject to the rights provided in Section 5.2.1 below, designating such Improvement as “Cargill Improvements”.

                "explanation": "By adding the terms like 'perceived Improvement' and 'vaguely consider' makes the process of assigning ownership to new technologies much less clear. Patents are a very big business and therefore this would affect what company owns it and who benefits. As well, intellectual property laws surrounding ownership are very strict and this clause would not be in line with those practices.",

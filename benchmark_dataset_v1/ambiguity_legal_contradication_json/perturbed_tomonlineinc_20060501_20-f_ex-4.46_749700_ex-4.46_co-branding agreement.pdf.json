Subject to Section 2.3.2, all decisions relating to the specific promotional activities of the Company and the Online Group hereunder, including, without limitation, any advertising, licensing, distribution or other exploitation of the Company-Skype Branded Application, Company-Skype Toolbar, Company-Skype Branded Content or Company-Skype Branded Web Site, shall be mutually agreed upon, provided, however, that the Online Group shall at a minimum (i) promote the availability of the Company-Skype Branded Application to all visitors of the Online BVI Web Site, (ii) promote the availability of the Company-Skype Branded Application to all its existing customers and/or users, provided that this obligation shall not require the Online Group to communicate with those customers and/or users by SMS or e-mail where prohibited by contract, applicable laws, regulations and/or policies of telecommunications operators, and (iii) place each of the following in a reasonably conspicuous position within a prominent home or next level Web Page, the “preferred partners” area, and any other area or other Web Pages within the Online BVI Web Site as the Parties may mutually agree to from time to time: (x) links to the Company-Skype Branded Application and a mutually-agreeable short profile of Skype; and (y) promotional material for the Company-Skype Branded Application and links to the Company-Skype Branded Web Site.",
                "changed_text": "The Company may, and Online BVI may consider causing the Company to, use its reasonable efforts to promote the Company-Skype Branded Application and the Company-Skype Branded Web Site. Subject to Section 2.3.2, decisions relating to promotional activities may be discussed. The Online Group may consider promoting the availability of the Company-Skype Branded Application to visitors of the Online BVI Web Site. The Online Group may consider promoting the availability of the Company-Skype Branded Application to its existing customers and/or users and may consider placing links to the Company-Skype Branded Application and a profile of Skype within the Online BVI Web Site.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several ambiguities. 'May' and 'consider' weaken the obligations to promote the application. Replacing 'shall be mutually agreed upon' with 'may be discussed' makes promotional activities optional rather than mandatory. The phrase 'reasonable efforts' is vague and difficult to enforce. This contradicts advertising laws in the PRC that require clear and affirmative actions for promotional activities, making them unenforceable.",

In this connection, Skype shall provide assistance and give a reply to the Company on each back-end and network connection service request in no less than twelve (12) hours after the receipt of such request from the Company. Skype shall also maintain and provide access to the customer support forum on the Skype Site, in the English language only.",
                "changed_text": "The Company may be responsible for providing first-level support to Company-Skype Branded Customers. Online BVI will consider asking the company to provide its standard customer support. Skype will try to provide the Online Group with back-end support and network connection support, depending on resources and as needed. Skype may maintain a customer support forum.",
                "explanation": "The legal obligation is weakened by changing 'shall be responsible' to 'may be responsible,' making support discretionary. Replacing 'shall cause' with 'will consider asking' and 'shall provide' with 'will try to provide' further diminishes the mandatory nature of the requirements. Removing the 24/7 support requirement introduces ambiguity around service availability, contradicting regulations in the PRC that require consistent and reliable customer service for internet-based services.",

                "explanation": "This significantly weakens the obligation to comply with PRC laws. Changing 'shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure' to 'should consider whether ... should comply' transforms a mandatory requirement into a suggestion. Removing the need to identify laws in writing and deliver them to Skype makes compliance entirely discretionary. This directly conflicts with PRC laws requiring strict adherence to local regulations for content and websites operating within the country, making the change unenforceable.",

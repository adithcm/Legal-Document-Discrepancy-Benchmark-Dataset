                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Parties will mutually agree on the regulatory pathway(s) to be used through the Joint Steering Committee.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties will attempt to agree on the regulatory pathway(s) through discussions in the Joint Steering Committee.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will mutually agree' to 'will attempt to agree' introduces ambiguity regarding whether a concrete agreement on the regulatory pathway is actually required. This creates uncertainty about which regulatory standards must be adhered to, potentially conflicting with regulatory requirements in Brazil, Mexico, or Argentina where strict guidelines must be followed to get approval for the licensed product. This implies the pathway choice might be discretionary which contradicts regulatory laws of those countries. Since this agreement applies to Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina).",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by country, but generally violates pharmaceutical regulatory laws mandating clear and binding regulatory pathways (e.g., ANVISA in Brazil, COFEPRIS in Mexico, ANMAT in Argentina).",

                "original_text": "In advance of their use and/or submission, Eurofarma shall furnish NLS with copies of all material correspondence to be sent to the competent regulatory authorities in the Territory, and all MA applications which are prepared for the Licensed Product. NLS shall have the right to comment and Eurofarma must comply with the requested changes by the NLS, provided that any such comments and/or changes are in compliance with the rules of the local and competent regulatory agencies.",
                "changed_text": "Eurofarma will share with NLS relevant correspondence intended to be sent to regulatory authorities. Eurofarma should consider NLS’s comments on this correspondence where feasible, but Eurofarma retains the right to determine the final content.",
                "explanation": "The original clause imposes an obligation on Eurofarma to comply with changes requested by NLS, as long as they align with the local regulations. Changing 'shall furnish' to 'will share', 'must comply' to 'should consider' removes the binding nature of this obligation. This introduces ambiguity and discretion, making it unclear whether Eurofarma is actually required to implement NLS's changes. Since Eurofarma has the sole right to determine the final content, it allows Eurofarma to bypass implementing important regulatory changes or actions, if these are determined to be unfeasible. This ambiguity undermines the Licensor’s control and potentially contradicts regulatory expectations, undermining adherence to pharmaceutical regulation laws in the Latin American countries where the product would be marketed.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pharmaceutical regulatory laws mandate adherence to scientifically justified updates and safety standards and require specific interactions with health authorities (e.g., ANVISA in Brazil, COFEPRIS in Mexico, ANMAT in Argentina).",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Licensor shall take all reasonable actions and render all reasonable assistance to help Licensee obtain and maintain the MA which are reasonably requested by the Licensee or required by the competent authorities in line with local requirements and/or necessary to avoid the imposition of any restriction or condition under the MA by the competent authorities.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor shall endeavor to provide reasonable assistance to help Licensee obtain and maintain the MA where practical.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall take all reasonable actions' to 'shall endeavor to provide reasonable assistance' and removing the detailed requirements of the original clause drastically weakens the obligation on the Licensor. The inclusion of 'where practical' further introduces ambiguity, allowing the Licensor to avoid taking certain actions if they deem it impractical. This change directly contradicts the intent of pharmaceutical regulatory laws which require ongoing support for maintaining Marketing Authorizations. The removal of “required by the competent authorities in line with local requirements and/or necessary to avoid the imposition of any restriction or condition under the MA by the competent authorities” removes important obligations that might occur under those regulatory constraints. In Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, keeping the MA active requires continuous compliance and reporting which depends on the licensor sharing the information. Failure to do so could be a violation of the regulation in those countries.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pharmaceutical regulatory laws mandate ongoing support and data provision for maintaining Marketing Authorizations (e.g., ANVISA in Brazil, COFEPRIS in Mexico, ANMAT in Argentina).",

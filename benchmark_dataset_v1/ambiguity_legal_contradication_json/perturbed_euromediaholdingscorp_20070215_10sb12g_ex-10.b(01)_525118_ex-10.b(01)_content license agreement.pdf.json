During the Term, Licensor shall use best efforts to add\nnewly available Licensed Programs to such list, and may periodically delete Licensed Programs from such list; provided, however,\nthat: (i) Licensor shall provide to Rogers at least ninety (90) days prior notice of the availability date of any Licensed Program\nadded to such list during the Term; (ii) Licensor shall provide to Rogers at least sixty (60) days prior notice of the deletion of any\nLicensed Program from such list; and (iii) Licensor shall be responsible for any and all reasonable costs and/or losses incurred by\nRogers as a result of any deletions from such list during the Term.",

During the Term, Licensor may try to add\nnewly available Licensed Programs to such list, and retains the right to delete Licensed Programs from such list at any time; provided, however,\nthat: (i) Licensor will attempt to provide Rogers with as much notice as possible, ideally around ninety (90) days, regarding the availability date of any Licensed Program\nadded to such list during the Term; (ii) Licensor will try to give Rogers some notice, if feasible around sixty (60) days, before deleting any\nLicensed Program from such list; and (iii) Licensor may be responsible for some costs and/or losses incurred by Rogers\nas a result of any deletions from such list during the Term, as determined by Licensor's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguities by replacing definitive obligations with vague terms like 'will endeavor,' 'approximate length,' 'estimated license period,' 'general availability timeframe,' 'may try,' 'retains the right to,' 'attempt to provide,' 'as much notice as possible,' 'ideally around,' 'try to give,' 'some notice,' 'if feasible,' and 'may be responsible...as determined by Licensor's sole discretion.'

Such mediums shall include, but not be limited to: (i) television; (ii) radio; (iii) print;\n(iv) Internet; and (v) event-based marketing.

The modified text replaces this with discretionary terms like 'may consider,' 'if and when it is convenient,' 'could include,' 'might provide,' 'some examples,' 'when practical,' and 'perhaps a few days in advance.' This makes promotion optional and the timing of providing samples unclear, creating significant ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for reimbursement. The modified text introduces uncertainty using terms such as 'will consider,' 'a portion of,' 'Rogers claims to have paid,' 'potentially calculated,' 'some period,' 'possibly payable,' and 'depending on Licensor's financial situation.' This transforms a fixed obligation into a discretionary one, subject to Licensor's subjective determination.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "In the performance of its obligations hereunder, such Party shall comply and shall cause its and its Affiliates’ employees and contractors to comply with all Applicable Laws.",
                "changed_text": "In the performance of its obligations hereunder, such Party should endeavor to comply and should encourage its and its Affiliates’ employees and contractors to comply with Applicable Laws.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'should endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation. Compliance becomes discretionary, potentially conflicting with regulations that require strict adherence. The change from 'shall cause' to 'should encourage' further reduces the binding nature of ensuring compliance by employees and contractors.",

                "original_text": "Zogenix will have the right, upon reasonable prior written notice and during Distributor’s regular business hours, to audit Distributor’s and its Affiliates’ books and records by an independent certified public accounting firm of recognized international standing, and Distributor shall ensure that Zogenix has the right to audit its Sub-distributors’ and subcontractors’ books and records, to investigation potential violations of any of the representations, warranties or covenants in this Section 10.2, the FCPA or other Applicable Laws or Distributor’s compliance policies.",
                "changed_text": "Zogenix may, with what it considers reasonable prior written notice and during Distributor’s business hours, conduct audits of Distributor’s books and records, if it deems necessary. Distributor will use reasonable efforts to allow Zogenix to audit its Sub-distributors’ and subcontractors’ books and records, subject to legal restrictions, regarding potential violations of the representations, warranties or covenants in this Section 10.2, the FCPA or other Applicable Laws or Distributor’s compliance policies.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the audit rights. Replacing 'will have the right' with 'may...if it deems necessary' makes the audit discretionary. The original text enforces the audit with \"shall ensure\", which shifts to a weaker version in the form of \"reasonable efforts to allow\", thus creating uncertainty. The addition of 'subject to legal restrictions' introduces a loophole that could impede thorough audits, conflicting with requirements to ensure financial transparency and compliance with anti-corruption laws.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor will certify to Zogenix annually in writing or otherwise upon Zogenix’s written request, under the form set forth in Exhibit 10.2(b) attached hereto, Distributor’s compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants in this Section 10.2, the FCPA and other Applicable Laws and Distributor’s compliance policies",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will endeavor to certify to Zogenix periodically when reasonably requested by Zogenix, under a form similar to that set forth in Exhibit 10.2(b), Distributor’s general awareness of compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants in this Section 10.2, the FCPA and other Applicable Laws and Distributor’s compliance policies.",
                "explanation": "The modified text significantly weakens the compliance obligation. Changing 'will certify' to 'will endeavor to certify' makes the certification optional. Replacing 'annually' with 'periodically when reasonably requested' reduces the frequency and introduces ambiguity around what constitutes a 'reasonable' request. Altering 'Distributor's compliance' to 'Distributor's general awareness of compliance' lowers the standard to a mere acknowledgement of awareness rather than a confirmation of actual compliance, conflicting with requirements to ensure strict regulatory adherence.",

At a minimum, usage\n          reports will include:\n          i)    Transactional Data on all Excite@Home Members who transact\n                through the Co-Branded Application (where available and as\n                limited by Section 6.a.iii);\n          ii)   Individual Program Member data, including such information as\n                user preferences, usage, and response rates;\n          iii)  Daily page views by category; and\n          iv)   Aggregate information on response rates.",
                "changed_text": "Application Provider will attempt to provide usage reports to Excite@Home on a periodic basis in a somewhat agreed-upon format. At a minimum, usage reports may include:\n          i)    Transactional Data on all Excite@Home Members who transact\n                through the Co-Branded Application (where available and as\n                limited by Section 6.a.iii);\n          ii)   Individual Program Member data, potentially including such information as\n                user preferences, usage, and response rates, if feasible;\n          iii)  Occasional page views by category; and\n          iv)   General information on response rates.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces ambiguity by weakening the obligation to provide usage reports. The original text mandates weekly reports in a mutually agreed-upon format, while the revised text introduces uncertainty with terms like 'attempt to provide,' 'periodic basis,' 'somewhat agreed-upon format,' 'may include,' 'potentially including,' 'if feasible', and 'occasional'. This makes the obligation less enforceable and open to interpretation.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation weakens the requirement for data handling to comply with security and privacy guidelines. The original text mandates strict compliance ('shall comply'), whereas the revised text uses the phrase 'will generally align with,' which suggests that deviations are possible. This introduces ambiguity about what level of alignment is acceptable, making compliance discretionary and potentially undermining data protection standards.",

                "explanation": "By using 'seems to retain' and 'approximately retain most', there's an introduction of ambiguity concerning the ownership of trademarks. The original text is clear about each party retaining all rights subject to licenses. The modified text creates uncertainty, potentially leading to disputes over trademark usage and enforcement. This contradicts trademark law, which requires clear identification and protection of trademark rights.",

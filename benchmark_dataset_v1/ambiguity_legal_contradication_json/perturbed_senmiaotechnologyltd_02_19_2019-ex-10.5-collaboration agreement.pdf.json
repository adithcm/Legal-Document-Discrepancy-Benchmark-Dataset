                "original_text": "3.2.3 Party B guarantees that the vehicles released and leased on the Platform shall meet the following conditions simultaneously:\n3.2.3.1 Obey the requirements of this agreement, Platform Rules, Laws; can drive on the road, and can be used to engage in online Ride-hailing operation in the place where the leased vehicle is used;\n3.2.3.2 The vehicles are passenger cars that meet the Safety Specifications for Power-driven Vehicles Operating on Roads (GB 7258-2012) and have less than 7 seats, including the driver's seat;\n3.2.3.3 No decorations, devices or equipment (except those required by law) have been installed, and there are no other modifications or additions that may affect the safe operation of the vehicle or endanger the personal and property safety of the vehicle drivers and passengers;\n3.2.3.4 The engine has not been replaced or adjusted in a way different from that of the factory, or the performance has been substantially modified or installed (except those permitted by local laws and passed the safety inspection of the traffic administrative department of the public security organ).\n3.2.3.5 There is no any right defect or ownership dispute. Party B is entitled to lease the vehicle to others in the form of financial leasing for the operation of online Ride-hailing or other purposes.",
                "changed_text": "3.2.3 Party B will try to ensure that the vehicles released and leased on the Platform generally meet the following conditions:\n3.2.3.1 Endeavor to meet the requirements of this agreement, Platform Rules, Laws; should be able to drive on the road, and should be usable for online Ride-hailing operation where the leased vehicle is used;\n3.2.3.2 The vehicles might be passenger cars similar to those meeting the Safety Specifications for Power-driven Vehicles Operating on Roads (GB 7258-2012) and generally have less than 7 seats, including the driver's seat;\n3.2.3.3 Decorations, devices or equipment may be installed, and there might be modifications or additions that could potentially affect the safe operation of the vehicle or possibly endanger the personal and property safety of the vehicle drivers and passengers;\n3.2.3.4 The engine may have been replaced or adjusted in a way different from that of the factory, or the performance might be substantially modified or installed (except those arguably permitted by local laws and possibly passed a cursory safety inspection of an unspecified administrative department).\n3.2.3.5 There may be some right defects or ownership disputes. Party B may attempt to lease the vehicle to others in the form of financial leasing for the operation of online Ride-hailing or other purposes.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the guarantees and mandatory requirements for vehicle safety and legality. Replacing \"guarantees\" with \"will try to ensure\" and using terms like \"endeavor to meet,\" \"might be,\" \"potentially affect,\" \"possibly passed a cursory safety inspection,\" and \"may attempt\" makes the obligations vague and discretionary. This introduces significant ambiguity about the standards to which Party B must adhere.",
                "contradicted_law": "Regulations concerning vehicle safety standards and operational requirements for ride-hailing services in China, which require strict adherence to safety and licensing rules. The ambiguity undermines the legal responsibility to maintain road-safe vehicles for ride-hailing, potentially violating administrative regulations.",

                "original_text": "3.2.4 Party B shall be obliged to verify the actual use of the leased vehicles, assist and ensure that the Driver User purchases corresponding insurance according to the actual use of the leased vehicles; if the leased vehicle is used for online Ride-hailing operation, in case that the provisions of the local Laws on online Ride-hailing insurance are changed within the term of cooperation or the provisions of the local Laws on online Ride-hailing are officially implemented within the term of cooperation, Party B shall inform the Driver User within 3 working days after the change of local Laws and regulations on Ride-hailing or the effective implementation thereof, assist the Driver User and ensure that the insurance of the leased vehicle shall be changed in accordance with the provisions of local Laws on ride-hailing to make the insurance of the leased vehicle comply with the provisions of relevant Laws and regulations on Ride-hailing at that time.",
                "changed_text": "3.2.4 Party B will take steps to check on how the leased vehicles are being used and should offer assistance to the Driver User in obtaining insurance that is somewhat appropriate for the vehicle's use. If the vehicle is used for online Ride-hailing, and the local laws about Ride-hailing insurance happen to change, or if such laws come into effect, Party B will try to let the Driver User know about these changes within a reasonable timeframe and will offer support to help them adjust their insurance to be generally compliant with local Ride-hailing laws as they understand them.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces 'shall be obliged' and 'ensure' with weaker, less definite terms like 'will take steps', 'should offer assistance,' 'somewhat appropriate,' 'try to let,' and 'generally compliant.' This reduces the legally binding nature of the obligation to verify vehicle use and ensure proper insurance coverage, creating ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "The ambiguity here conflicts with local laws and regulations on ride-hailing insurance in China, which mandate specific insurance requirements to protect passengers and drivers. This change introduces a lack of legal certainty about the obligation to maintain legally compliant insurance coverage.",

In the event of any losses incurred to the observing party, in addition to the corresponding liability for breach under the Agreement, the breaching party shall also be liable for the compensation for such losses (including, but not limited to, the losses incurred to the counterParty By such breach, the legal costs, notarial fees, appraisal fees, the attorney’s fee, the travel expenses, etc., arising from the investigation and affixation of the liabilities of the breaching Party By the counterparty) . Unless any party is in violation of the confidentiality clause, in any case, neither party shall be liable for any indirect, punitive claims, or claims for losses of commercial profits, or damages for business losses of the company or any third Party Arising from this Agreement, or for any loss or inaccuracy of data of any form, whether based on Agreement, tort or any other legal principle, even though the party has been informed of the possibility of such damage.",
                "changed_text": "10.6 If either party possibly breaches this Agreement, they might attempt to fix it if the other party mentions it. If the other party feels they've lost something, the breaching party could potentially be responsible for those losses as described in this Agreement. However, neither party is definitely responsible for indirect, punitive claims, or claims for lost profits, or any data issues, even if they knew it might happen.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and softens the language regarding liability for breach. By using words like 'possibly breaches,' 'might attempt to fix it,' 'feels they've lost something,' 'could potentially be responsible,' and 'definitely responsible,' the obligation to remedy breaches and compensate for losses becomes unclear and discretionary. The original language creates uncertainty around enforcement and liability.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, which mandates specific performance and compensation for breach of contract. The ambiguity created in this section undermines the enforceability of these provisions and contradicts the legal obligation to provide remedies for breaches.",

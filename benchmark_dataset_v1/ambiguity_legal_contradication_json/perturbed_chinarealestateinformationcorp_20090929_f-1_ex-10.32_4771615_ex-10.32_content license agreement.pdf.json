                "original_text": "Licensee shall monitor and censor all Content on the websites associated with the Licensed Domain Names, including without limitation Content posted by end users. Licensor shall also have the right to monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority. Licensee’s failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing obligations, Licensee acknowledges that Licensor shall have the right to remove such offending Content from the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee will endeavor to monitor and censor Content on the websites associated with the Licensed Domain Names, including without limitation Content posted by end users. Licensor may also monitor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee will attempt to remove potentially offending Content, including materials that might be considered illegal, potentially pornographic, or materials of a possibly violent nature, or materials that could be viewed as politically sensitive, from such websites when practical after becoming aware of such Content. Licensee’s failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) might be considered a breach of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee acknowledges that Licensor may remove such Content from the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the obligation to monitor and censor content by changing 'shall' to 'will endeavor to,' 'shall remove' to 'will attempt to remove,' and using vague language like 'potentially offending' and 'might be considered.' Replacing 'shall be deemed a material breach' with 'might be considered a breach' makes the consequences uncertain.",

                "explanation": "This modification replaces 'shall ensure' with 'will strive to ensure,' indicating an effort rather than a guarantee of compliance. Using 'generally aligns with' introduces ambiguity about the degree of compliance required.",

                "changed_text": "If Licensor perceives that a violation by Licensee could potentially harm Licensor’s business, reputation, or goodwill, Licensee will consider, following notification from Licensor, ceasing such non-conforming uses.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the obligation by changing 'reasonably determines' to 'perceives,' making the determination subjective. It replaces 'shall promptly cease and desist' with 'will consider ceasing,' making the cessation discretionary rather than mandatory. This creates uncertainty about the Licensee's responsibility.",
                "contradicted_law": "Tort Law of the People's Republic of China (Article 8) which specifies that actions infringing upon another's rights, including reputational harm, should be ceased immediately, making 'considering' an insufficient response.",

                "changed_text": "CEIS shall endeavor to make the Content available to XFN on a reasonably continuous basis.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall use its best endeavours' with 'shall endeavor' and 'continuous, uninterrupted real-time basis' with 'reasonably continuous basis' introduces ambiguity. 'Endeavor' is weaker than 'best endeavours', and 'reasonably continuous' lacks specific performance criteria, making it difficult to enforce continuous real-time availability. This contradicts the implied obligation to provide timely and accurate financial news, essential for the licensee's business.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides a firm warranty of compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The modified clause weakens this by stating that CEIS only 'believes' it 'generally complies.' This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty. It is unclear what 'generally' means, and the belief is subjective. This contradicts the original firm commitment and introduces potential non-compliance with laws and regulations governing the content, such as those relating to financial accuracy or defamation.",

In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, the Parties agree to amend this Agreement as may be necessary to comply with applicable laws, including without limitation the laws of the People's Republic of China.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will consider taking further action and executing further documents if deemed appropriate to give effect to the general intent of this Agreement. The Parties may discuss amending this Agreement to consider compliance with applicable laws.",
                "explanation": "The original clause created a clear obligation for each party to take action and amend the agreement to comply with laws. The modified clause replaces this with a weaker obligation: 'will consider', 'if deemed appropriate', and 'may discuss'. This introduces ambiguity and makes compliance with applicable laws discretionary rather than mandatory. This could lead to violations of laws that require mandatory compliance. In the context of a contract involving the People's Republic of China, this is particularly problematic due to its complex and evolving regulatory landscape.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles that obligate parties to comply with laws affecting the contract, and potentially any specific laws that the agreement would need to comply with, such as those relating to data privacy, export controls, or intellectual property within the People's Republic of China.",

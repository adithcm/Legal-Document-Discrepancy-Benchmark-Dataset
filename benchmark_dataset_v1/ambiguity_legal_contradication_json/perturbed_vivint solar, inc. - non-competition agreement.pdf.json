                "original_text": "WHEREAS, the Parties had entered into a Non-Competition Agreement dated September 30, 2014, by and between the\r\nParties (collectively, the “Non-Competition Agreement”) to set out certain restrictive covenants of each Party.\r\nWHEREAS, the Parties wish to amend the existing obligations under the Non-Competition Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, the Parties had entered into a Non-Competition Agreement dated September 30, 2014, by and between the\nParties (collectively, the “Non-Competition Agreement”) to generally outline potential restrictive considerations for each Party.\nWHEREAS, the Parties may consider amending certain obligations under the Non-Competition Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the agreement sets out restrictive covenants and that the parties wish to amend obligations. The modified text uses ambiguous language, like 'generally outline potential restrictive considerations' and 'may consider amending certain obligations,' which weakens the enforceability of the non-competition agreement. This creates ambiguity regarding the extent and nature of the restrictive covenants, making it difficult to determine the actual obligations of each party.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware law requires contracts, including non-compete agreements, to be clear and unambiguous regarding the scope and nature of the restrictions. This change introduces vagueness which can make the non-compete agreement unenforceable under Delaware law.",

Except as otherwise set forth in this Amendment, the Non-Competition\r\nAgreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment will generally apply to the provisions of the Non-\nCompetition Agreement referenced herein. Except as otherwise considered in this Amendment, the Non-Competition\nAgreement will potentially continue in effect.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states how the amendment impacts the original agreement. The modified text introduces ambiguity with terms like 'generally apply' and 'potentially continue in effect'. This makes it unclear which specific provisions of the original agreement remain in effect and to what extent they are modified. The removal of 'specifically' before 'referred to herein' further adds to the ambiguity, leaving room for interpretation as to which provisions are actually affected.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under Delaware contract law, modifications must be clear and specific to avoid uncertainty. The ambiguous language used here contradicts this principle, potentially rendering the modification unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Master Framework Agreement. This Amendment may be generally guided by the Master Framework Agreement, potentially including Sections 4 (Confidentiality) and 6 (Miscellaneous) of the Master Framework Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly establishes that the amendment is governed by the Master Framework Agreement. The modified text weakens this connection by using phrases like 'may be generally guided' and 'potentially including'. This introduces uncertainty as to whether the Master Framework Agreement is actually binding on the amendment, especially regarding the confidentiality and miscellaneous provisions, making enforcement unpredictable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware law requires contracts to clearly define governing documents and terms. By using vague language, this change undermines the clarity and enforceability of the agreement, making it susceptible to legal challenges.",

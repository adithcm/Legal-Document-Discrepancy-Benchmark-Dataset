                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Consultant to perform the Services in accordance with all Applicable Law",
                "changed_text": "Consultant shall endeavor to perform the Services in general accordance with Applicable Law.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"in accordance with\" to \"in general accordance with\" and \"Consultant to perform\" with \"Consultant shall endeavor to perform\" introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation to comply with all applicable laws. The term \"endeavor\" does not guarantee full compliance, and \"general accordance\" lacks specificity. This weakens the consultant's legal obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law (California) - creates uncertainty about the standard of care expected, making enforcement of full compliance difficult. Also puts Aduro at legal risk regarding required safety standards and regulations.",

                "changed_text": "Consultant shall, when reasonably practical, disclose to Aduro information relating to Work Product as deemed relevant as part of the Services and upon formal request of Aduro.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces subjectivity and discretion to the disclosure of work product information. Adding \"when reasonably practical\" and \"as deemed relevant\" creates ambiguity around the timing and scope of the disclosure, potentially allowing the consultant to withhold crucial information. This can impede Aduro's intellectual property rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA) - hinders Aduro's ability to protect its trade secrets by giving the consultant leeway to determine what information is disclosed and when. The vagueness makes it difficult to prove that a failure to disclose information constitutes a violation.",

Such injunctive remedy shall be nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any and all other remedies which may be available to it at law or in equity, including without limitation, the recovery of direct, indirect, incidental, consequential and/or punitive damages.",
                "changed_text": "Aduro may pursue injunctive relief. Such remedy may be considered in addition to other remedies available, potentially including direct damages.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"shall be entitled to\" to \"may pursue\" weakens Aduro's right to injunctive relief, making it discretionary rather than guaranteed. Furthermore, limiting the damages to \"potentially including direct damages\" removes the possibility of recovering indirect, incidental, consequential, and punitive damages, undermining Aduro's potential recourse.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law (California) - This modification limits the remedies available to Aduro in case of a breach, which is a violation of standard contract law principles that ensure full compensation for damages resulting from a breach of contract. Limiting the damages could mean Aduro is not made whole.",

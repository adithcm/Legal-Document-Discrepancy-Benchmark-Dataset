                "original_text": "This Agreement shall incorporate and in all respects be subject to the \"General Terms and Conditions\" and the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) set forth in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, as may be revised from time to time. Transporter may file and seek Commission approval under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) at any time and from time to time to change any rates, charges or provisions set forth in the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) and the \"General Terms and Conditions\" in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, and Transporter shall have the right to place such changes in effect in accordance with the NGA, and this Agreement shall be deemed to include such changes and any such changes",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement should generally consider the \"General Terms and Conditions\" and the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) set forth in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, as may be revised from time to time. Transporter may, at its discretion, file and seek Commission approval under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) at any time to change any rates, charges or provisions set forth in the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) and the \"General Terms and Conditions\" in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, and Transporter may consider placing such changes in effect, and this Agreement will consider such changes and any such changes",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall incorporate' with 'should generally consider,' the obligatory nature of adhering to the General Terms and Conditions is weakened. Similarly, changing 'shall have the right to place such changes in effect' to 'may consider placing such changes in effect' introduces uncertainty. This creates ambiguity regarding the firm's commitment to regulatory requirements, which are critical for compliance and risk management.",

                "changed_text": "Any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not definitively resolved by the parties may be subject to interpretation under principles influenced by the laws of the State of Michigan.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that Michigan law governs disputes. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating controversies 'may be subject to interpretation under principles influenced by' Michigan law, making it unclear if Michigan law strictly applies or if other legal principles can be considered. The inclusion of 'not definitively resolved' also adds a layer of ambiguity as to when this clause is even applicable.",

                "changed_text": "All notices and communications with respect to this Agreement should preferably be in writing by mail, e-mail, or fax, or potentially other means as generally discussed by the parties, and sent to the addresses reasonably believed to be correct.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be' to 'should preferably be' makes written communication non-mandatory. Replacing 'as agreed to by the parties' with 'as generally discussed by the parties' makes the method of communication less formal and binding. The wording 'reasonably believed to be correct' introduces ambiguity in the delivery of notices, undermining the purpose of formal notification requirements.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall perform' with 'will endeavor to perform' and 'shall be responsible' with 'will assist with' introduces ambiguity and reduces the consultant's obligation. Adding 'potentially including' makes the scope of fundraising and stock promotion uncertain. This contradicts the general requirement of clear contractual obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Consultant agrees to consider indemnifying the Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers and employees from potential losses, damages and liabilities to the extent Consultant deems reasonable, arising from potential connection with (i) gross negligence or intentionally wrongful acts of Consultant , (ii) performance of the Services, (iii) alleged failure of Consultant to perform the Services in accordance with material applicable laws. However, the determination of indemnification will be subject to good faith negotiations.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the indemnification clause significantly by making the consultant's obligation discretionary ('agrees to consider indemnifying'), limiting it to 'gross negligence', removing specific instances and introducing a 'reasonableness' standard. The phrase 'alleged failure' and 'material applicable laws' creates ambiguity regarding the scope of indemnification. The added requirement of 'good faith negotiations' can cause future disputes.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'will be entitled' to 'may be considered for', and adding the caveat 'should the circumstances warrant', the mandatory awarding of attorney's fees to the prevailing party is made discretionary. This creates uncertainty and could discourage parties from pursuing legitimate claims.",

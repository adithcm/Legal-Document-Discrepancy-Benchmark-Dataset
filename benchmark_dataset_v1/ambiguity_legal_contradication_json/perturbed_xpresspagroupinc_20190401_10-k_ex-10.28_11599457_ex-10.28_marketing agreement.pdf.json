                "original_text": "XSPA shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to display, market, promote, offer for sale and sell the Products set forth on Exhibit A in all Stores throughout the Territory. The Products shall only be sold by XSPA at the retail price of the applicable Product as set forth on Exhibit A (the “Retail Price”). For the avoidance of doubt, the Retail Price for the Products at the Stores in the Territory (i) may only be modified by mutual agreement of the Parties, and (ii) does not include any discounts, promotions or applicable sales taxes.",
                "changed_text": "XSPA should consider displaying, marketing, promoting, offering for sale and selling the Products set forth on Exhibit A in Stores throughout the Territory. The Products can be sold by XSPA at a price generally aligned with the Retail Price of the applicable Product as set forth on Exhibit A (the “Retail Price”). For the avoidance of doubt, the Retail Price (i) may be modified at XSPA's discretion after initial consultation with Calm, and (ii) may include certain discounts and promotions, while applicable sales taxes will be handled separately.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity in several ways. Replacing 'shall use its commercially reasonable efforts' with 'should consider' weakens the obligation to actively promote and sell the products. Allowing for price modification 'at XSPA's discretion after initial consultation with Calm' undermines the previously fixed Retail Price. Furthermore, the inclusion of 'certain discounts and promotions' without clear guidelines creates uncertainty about pricing and revenue sharing, which could violate consumer protection laws regarding clear pricing and transparency.",

                "changed_text": "With respect to each Store in the Territory, XSPA might consider using some efforts to: (a) eventually after the Effective Date, (i) prepare some notices and consents and possibly take a few actions thought to be needed to perhaps obtain or maintain approval, if needed, for bulkhead signage from airport regulatory authorities, and install such bulkhead signage when convenient, and (ii) once installed, try to maintain such bulkhead signage when practical;",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by replacing definitive terms with vague alternatives. Replacing 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'might consider using some efforts' significantly weakens the obligation. The phrases 'eventually after', 'possibly take a few actions thought to be needed', 'perhaps obtain or maintain approval, if needed', 'when convenient', and 'try to maintain such bulkhead signage when practical' all create uncertainty about XSPA's responsibilities, making enforcement difficult. The original text required prompt and necessary actions, whereas the modified text leaves these actions optional and subject to XSPA's discretion. This could violate advertising regulations at airports, which often require specific signage and maintenance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Airport advertising regulations (specific regulations vary by airport and jurisdiction, but generally require adherence to approved signage plans).",

At XSPA’s request, Calm shall provide training to XSPA area managers and select store managers at times and locations mutually agreed upon by the Parties regarding the display, marketing, promotion, offer for sale and sale of Products.",

Calm may, if feasible, offer assistance to select XSPA personnel, subject to availability and convenience, regarding the display, marketing, promotion, offer for sale and sale of Products.",
                "explanation": "The obligation to provide training is significantly weakened. 'Shall provide training to any and all employees' becomes 'may attempt to provide basic guidance to some employees', making training discretionary and limited. The phrase 'if any, provided by Calm' creates doubt about the existence of training materials. Similarly, Calm's obligation is reduced to 'may, if feasible, offer assistance to select XSPA personnel, subject to availability and convenience', making their support contingent and uncertain. This could violate consumer protection laws by not ensuring adequate product knowledge among sales staff.",

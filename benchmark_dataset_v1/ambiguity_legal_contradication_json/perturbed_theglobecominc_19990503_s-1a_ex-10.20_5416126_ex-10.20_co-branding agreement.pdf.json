                "changed_text": "At its own expense, Boxlot shall endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding providing and operating the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, Boxlot shall (a) make reasonable efforts to obtain governmental approval, permits and licenses, and to make governmental filings and registrations, necessary for the marketing and performance of the Service in every United States jurisdiction, (b) endeavor to ensure that theglobe is not required to obtain governmental approval, permits or licenses as a result of this Agreement, theglobe's performance hereunder or any payments made to theglobe hereunder, and (c) address any assertions that the Service is illegal or violating a protected third party interest as it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation by replacing 'shall comply' with 'shall endeavor to comply,' making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. Changing 'obtain all governmental approval, permits and licenses' to 'make reasonable efforts to obtain...' makes securing necessary legal permissions uncertain. The phrase 'address any assertions... as it deems appropriate' is also ambiguous, granting Boxlot broad discretion on how to handle claims of illegality, which may conflict with legal requirements for immediate and proper resolution.",

In addition, Boxlot shall immediately notify theglobe of any known security breaches or holes in the Service or Co-Branded Pages.",

In addition, Boxlot will attempt to notify theglobe of significant security breaches or holes in the Service or Co-Branded Pages.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall prevent' with 'take steps it considers appropriate' introduces subjectivity, potentially falling short of reasonable security standards. Similarly, altering 'shall immediately notify' to 'will attempt to notify' weakens the notification requirement and allows for delayed or omitted notifications, which can have critical legal repercussions in case of a data breach.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various U.S. State Data Breach Notification Laws - Weakens the requirement for immediate notification of security breaches, potentially violating laws that mandate specific timelines and procedures for breach disclosure (e.g., California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and other similar state laws).",

                "original_text": "The Mark owner may terminate the foregoing trademark license if, in its reasonable discretion, the licensee's use of the Marks tarnishes, blurs or dilutes the quality associated with the Marks or the associated goodwill and such problem is not cured within 10 days of notice of breachÍ¾ alternatively, instead of terminating the license in total, the owner may specify that certain licensee uses may not contain the Marks.",
                "changed_text": "The Mark owner may consider terminating the foregoing trademark license if, in its subjective opinion, the licensee's use of the Marks potentially tarnishes, blurs or dilutes the quality associated with the Marks or the associated goodwill, and the owner makes a good faith effort to allow the licensee to address the issue. Alternatively, the owner might suggest that the licensee modify its use of the Marks.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'in its reasonable discretion' to 'in its subjective opinion,' the clause becomes less objective and more prone to arbitrary enforcement. Replacing 'such problem is not cured within 10 days of notice of breach' with 'owner makes a good faith effort to allow the licensee to address the issue' removes a clear deadline for remediation, creating uncertainty about compliance. Finally, 'the owner might suggest that the licensee modify its use of the Marks' is non-committal, replacing the original right to specify restrictions with a mere suggestion.",

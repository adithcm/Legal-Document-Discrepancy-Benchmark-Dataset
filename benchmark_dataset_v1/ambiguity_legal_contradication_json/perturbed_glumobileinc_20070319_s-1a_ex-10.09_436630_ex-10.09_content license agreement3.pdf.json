Fox also grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive right and license to distribute the following Wireless Products in connection with the Property “ICE AGE 2” outside of the United States, with consideration given to: (A) Multiple Scrat voicetones; (B) One or more John Leguizamo voicetone; and (C) A handful of premium videos.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity by replacing precise numbers with vague terms like 'some,' 'a few,' 'several,' 'multiple', 'one or more' and 'handful'. This creates uncertainty about the exact quantity of each type of wireless product the Licensee is entitled to distribute. This could be interpreted as breach of contract.",

                "original_text": "In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox, or\nsuch other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n(a) From the first unit sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee’s Gross Receipts\n(as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee’s sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee will generally pay to Fox, or\nsuch other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n(a) From the initial units sold, Fox will likely earn a royalty at approximately ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee’s Gross Receipts\n(as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee’s sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall pay' with 'will generally pay', 'shall earn' with 'will likely earn', 'first unit' with 'initial units' and 'at the rate of' with 'at approximately'. This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the obligation to pay royalties and the exact royalty rate. The licensee could argue that they aren't obligated to pay a fixed rate from the first unit sold, giving them wiggle room to dispute the royalty payments. The percentage is confidential in the document, but those can't be changed in this case.",

                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall not' with 'will not automatically' and 'shall have no claim' with 'may not have a definitive claim'. This introduces ambiguity. It suggests that under certain unspecified circumstances, the licensee might be entitled to a share of revenues or might have a claim. This creates a potential conflict and legal uncertainty where none previously existed.",

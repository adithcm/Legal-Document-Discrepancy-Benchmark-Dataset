                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor shall comply with all applicable laws, statutes, regulations and treaties relating to the marketing, distribution and sale of the Products and the performance of its duties and obligations hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall endeavor to comply with all applicable laws, statutes, regulations and treaties relating to the marketing, distribution and sale of the Products and the performance of its duties and obligations hereunder.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply,' the obligation becomes ambiguous and less stringent. 'Endeavor' implies an attempt rather than a guarantee of compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts various state and federal laws, such as the **Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)**, which requires strict compliance with regulations regarding the marketing and sale of medical devices.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor shall use efforts to advertise, promote and penetrate the market for the Products in the Territory",
                "explanation": "By removing 'actively' and 'best,' the intensity of the obligation is reduced. 'Efforts' is a vague term, making it difficult to assess whether the Distributor is fulfilling its obligations sufficiently. 'Best efforts' sets a higher legal standard.",
                "contradicted_law": "This may lead to non-compliance with the implicit obligation to diligently market and promote the products, undermining the intention of the agreement and potentially conflicting with **contract law principles requiring good faith efforts**.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor shall document and inform STAAR of Complaints or other matters addressed in this Section 10.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'fully' creates ambiguity as to the level of detail and completeness required in documenting complaints, while failing to report something is easier to defend.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts the obligations of post-market surveillance of medical device as required by **21 CFR Part 803 Medical Device Reporting**, potentially affecting reporting accuracy and timeliness, which can lead to regulatory penalties.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "A.  Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement on the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof.",
                "changed_text": "A.  Guarantors shall endeavor to pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement, as reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall pay' to 'shall endeavor to pay' and adding 'as reasonably practical', the obligation to pay on specific dates and times is weakened. 'Endeavor' suggests an attempt rather than a guarantee, and 'as reasonably practical' introduces a subjective assessment, conflicting with the explicit payment terms that would otherwise be strictly enforced. This creates an ambiguity that allows the guarantor to potentially delay or avoid payments based on their interpretation of 'reasonably practical'.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms; potential violation of state-specific laws regarding guarantee agreements requiring specific performance.",

                "changed_text": "B. Guarantors should generally guarantee performance and discharge by Master Franchisee of the obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text places an unconditional guarantee on the Guarantors. The revised language uses 'should generally guarantee,' replacing a strict obligation with a weaker, more suggestive one. This introduces ambiguity regarding the extent and circumstances under which the guarantee applies, contradicting the requirement for clear and enforceable guarantee terms under contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law regarding the enforceability of guarantees, which typically require clear and unambiguous terms. State laws governing guarantees may also require specific language to ensure enforceability.",
                "location": "Paragraph B"

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "C. Guarantors shall indemnify and save harmless Franchisor and its affiliates against and from all losses, damages, costs, and expenses which Franchisor and its affiliates may sustain, incur, or become liable for by reason of: (1) the failure for any reason whatsoever of Master Franchisee to pay the monies payable pursuant to the Master Franchise Agreement or to do and perform any other act, matter or thing pursuant to the provisions of the Master Franchise AgreementÍ¾ or (2) any act, action, or proceeding of or by Franchisor for or in connection with the recovery of monies or the obtaining of performance by Master Franchisee of any other act, matter or thing pursuant to the provisions of the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "C. Guarantors shall consider indemnifying Franchisor and its affiliates against losses, damages, costs, and expenses which Franchisor and its affiliates may sustain, incur, or become liable for due to the failure of Master Franchisee to potentially fulfill the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall indemnify and save harmless' with 'shall consider indemnifying' drastically weakens the obligation to indemnify. The addition of 'potentially fulfill' makes the trigger for indemnification vague. This change creates significant ambiguity about the Guarantors' responsibility for the Master Franchisee's failures, undermining the purpose of the indemnity clause and contradicting contract law's requirements for clear and enforceable indemnity agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and unambiguous indemnification agreements. State-specific laws may require specific language to ensure an indemnity agreement is enforceable.",

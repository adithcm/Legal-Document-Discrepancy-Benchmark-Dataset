                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each of the parties shall execute and perform this Agreement in compliance with all applicable laws or regulations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party shall not be obligated to take any action that violates, infringes or conflicts with or prohibited from taking any action required to be in compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Each of the parties should endeavor to execute and perform this Agreement in general alignment with applicable laws or regulations. A party may choose not to take any action if it perceives that it potentially violates, infringes, or conflicts with any applicable laws or regulations.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'should endeavor to execute and perform... in general alignment' weakens the obligation to comply with all laws, making it suggestive rather than mandatory. Also, the phrase 'may choose not to take any action if it perceives that it potentially violates' introduces a subjective standard based on perception, undermining the requirement for objective compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "The original text ensures compliance with laws and regulations, but this change introduces ambiguity, creating a loophole where the company might not meet regulatory obligations, making it difficult to enforce and potentially violating various securities laws.",

                "changed_text": "Moelis Holdings and SMBC/Nikko might consider cooperating with each other and using their reasonable efforts to avoid any of the events in the preceding sentence by possibly taking actions deemed suitable, potentially including, in connection with any restructuring to facilitate the IPO, which may involve issuing a new class or series of Partnership Interests or alternative economic interests to SMBC, or its affiliates, if feasible.",
                "explanation": "Changes like 'might consider cooperating,' 'possibly taking actions deemed suitable,' and 'may involve issuing... if feasible' significantly weaken the obligation to cooperate and take necessary actions. The original text implies a strong commitment to avoid certain events, while the modified text makes the actions optional and subject to feasibility, making the requirements on the entities to take actions questionable.",
                "contradicted_law": "The original text aims to prevent actions that could trigger regulatory requirements under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act. By weakening the obligation to cooperate and take necessary actions, the modified text increases the risk of violating these requirements, as it reduces the assurance that proactive steps will be taken to avoid regulatory triggers.",

                "original_text": "The Alliance Review Committee will meet annually and will have the authority to recommend changes to the Strategic Alliance or this Agreement if deemed appropriate. For the avoidance of doubt, the recommendations of the Alliance Review Committee will not be binding upon any party unless and until this Agreement is amended or modified pursuant to Section 15.3.",
                "changed_text": "The Alliance Review Committee may meet periodically and may suggest potential changes to the Strategic Alliance or this Agreement if they find it convenient. For the avoidance of doubt, the suggestions of the Alliance Review Committee might be considered by any party, but are not required to be implemented unless all parties independently agree.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will meet annually' to 'may meet periodically' introduces uncertainty about the frequency of meetings, weakening the review process. Replacing 'will have the authority to recommend changes' with 'may suggest potential changes' diminishes the committee's influence. Stating that suggestions 'might be considered' rather than 'will not be binding' makes it more ambiguous whether recommendations will lead to any action.",
                "contradicted_law": "These alterations affect the enforceability of the strategic alliance's review process, potentially conflicting with regulatory requirements for proper oversight and governance that is especially relevant in financial institutions.",

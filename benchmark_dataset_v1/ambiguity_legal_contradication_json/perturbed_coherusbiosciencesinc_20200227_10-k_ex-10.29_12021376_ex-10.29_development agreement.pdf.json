                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Bioeq shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain Regulatory Approval for the Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory in accordance with and as set forth in the Development & Manufacturing Plan.",
                "changed_text": "Bioeq shall use good faith efforts to seek Regulatory Approval for the Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory, with consideration for the Development & Manufacturing Plan.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' with 'good faith efforts' weakens the obligation. The addition of 'with consideration for' makes adherence to the Development & Manufacturing Plan discretionary, not mandatory. This could conflict with FDA requirements for biosimilar approval, which necessitate demonstrating a high degree of similarity and adherence to pre-approved manufacturing processes. Good faith can be open to interpretation.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts' to 'shall endeavor to maintain' makes the obligation to maintain Regulatory Approvals less stringent and highly interpretable. Replacing 'in each case, in consultation with Bioeq' to 'ideally in consultation with Bioeq' suggests that consulting with Bioeq is preferred but not legally required. This could lead to failure to meet post-approval requirements set by the FDA.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Licensee shall ensure' to 'Licensee shall make an effort to ensure' weakens the guarantee of accuracy. Replacing 'to Licensee’s knowledge, true and accurate in all material aspects and will be generated in compliance with Applicable Law' with 'to the best of Licensee’s understanding, reasonably accurate and generally compliant with relevant laws' introduces further subjectivity and reduces the standard of compliance.

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Company shall be truthful with Consultant in regard to any relevant material regarding the Company, verbally or otherwise, or this entire Agreement will terminate and all consideration paid shall be forfeited without further notice.",
                "changed_text": "The Company should endeavor to be truthful with Consultant in regard to any relevant material regarding the Company, verbally or otherwise, but the impact on the agreement if the Company isn't truthful will be up to interpretation.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be truthful' to 'should endeavor to be truthful' introduces ambiguity regarding the Company's obligation to provide truthful information. The added phrase weakens the consequence of untruthfulness, making enforcement difficult.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law - Good Faith and Fair Dealing. Although not always explicitly stated, most jurisdictions, including Florida, imply a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts. This modification undermines that covenant.",

                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Consultant may perform the services described below (the “Consulting Services”) for the Company.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will perform' to 'may perform,' the Consultant's obligation to provide the described services becomes discretionary rather than mandatory, thus creating ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law - Specific Performance. A court is less likely to order specific performance if the obligation is not clearly defined or mandatory.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees that it will make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all actions, direct or indirect, taken by it and its respective agents, employees, and affiliates in connection with this Agreement and any financing or underwriting hereunder generally align with Federal and State securities laws.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall conform' with 'will make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure...generally align' significantly weakens the obligation to comply with securities laws. 'Commercially reasonable efforts' and 'generally align' are vague and subjective, making it difficult to prove a violation of securities laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal and State Securities Laws (e.g., Securities Act of 1933, Securities Exchange Act of 1934). These laws require strict compliance, not just 'general alignment'.",

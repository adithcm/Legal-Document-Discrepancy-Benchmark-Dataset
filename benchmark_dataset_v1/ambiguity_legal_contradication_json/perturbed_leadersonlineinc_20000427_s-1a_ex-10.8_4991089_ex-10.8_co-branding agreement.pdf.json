                "changed_text": "LeadersOnline should endeavor to limit contact with a Candidate to either one phone contact or one e-mail contact per calendar quarter, unless mutually agreeable. LeadersOnline will attempt to cease all contact upon the reasonable request of the Candidate.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies clear limitations on contacting candidates. The modified text introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall' to 'should endeavor,' 'unless expressly agreed to by the Candidate' to 'unless mutually agreeable' and 'shall immediately cease' to 'will attempt to cease' and 'the request of the Candidate' to 'reasonable request of the candidate,' weakening the obligation and making it subjective.",

                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear and comprehensive obligation to comply with all laws and regulations. The modified text weakens this by changing 'shall comply with all prevailing laws' to 'will aim to comply with general laws', adding ambiguity to the level of compliance required. The addition of 'generally accepted approvals' and 'relevant agencies' makes the requirements more subjective and less enforceable, conflicting with the objective standards required by many regulations.",

                "explanation": "The original text lays out a defined requirement for LeadersOnline to track and maintain user data from VerticalNet promotions. The changed text transforms this definitive obligation into a discretionary action ('may include a suggestion'), introduces subjectivity ('if feasible,' 'suitable for occasional review'), and undermines the auditability aspect by replacing 'examined by VerticalNet' with 'as needed for potential auditing purposes,' creating uncertainty and potential non-compliance.",

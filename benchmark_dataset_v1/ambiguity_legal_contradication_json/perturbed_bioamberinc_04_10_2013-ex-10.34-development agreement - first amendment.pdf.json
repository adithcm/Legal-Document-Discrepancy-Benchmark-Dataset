                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days of the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrating such production levels of succinic acid, Bioamber will cease any further funding and/or other support for the BRI Project. Further Bioamber will require that any unexpended funds received from Bioamber be utilized for a project other than the BRI Project.",
                "changed_text": "Within a reasonable timeframe of the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrating such production levels of succinic acid, Bioamber should consider ceasing further funding and/or support for the BRI Project. Further, Bioamber will suggest that any unexpended funds received from Bioamber be utilized for a project other than the BRI Project.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'thirty (30) days' to 'reasonable timeframe' introduces ambiguity, as 'reasonable' is subjective. Replacing 'will cease' with 'should consider ceasing' weakens the obligation, making it discretionary. Furthermore, 'will require' is changed to 'will suggest' further making compliance uncertain and not mandatory.",

                "changed_text": "In order to potentially enable such conversion, Bioamber will attempt to put in place agreements with the owners/operators of the Sarnia Plant that may allow Bioamber to request such conversion of the Sarnia Plant to generally use CB1 for the manufacture of succinic acid as described above.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'enable' and 'will' are substituted to introduce ambiguity. Replacing 'enable' with 'potentially enable' makes the outcome uncertain. Changing 'will put in place' to 'will attempt to put in place' introduces a weaker obligation, and 'require' is softened to 'request.' 'Solely' is changed to 'generally' creating uncertainty of the degree of which CB1 should be used.",

Additionally, Bioamber shall use best efforts to scale up the CB1 Strain and fermentation protocols utilizing the CB1 Strain.",

Additionally, Bioamber may explore scaling up the CB1 Strain and fermentation protocols utilizing the CB1 Strain.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use best efforts' to 'will endeavor to explore' significantly weakens the obligation. Replacing 'shall use best efforts' with 'may explore' makes the scale-up discretionary and introducing uncertainty.",

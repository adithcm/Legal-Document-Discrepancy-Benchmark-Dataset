Developer also shall carry such worker's compensation insurance as may be required by applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, Developer should endeavor to obtain and maintain some insurance coverage for public liability, including products liability, with limits they feel are adequate. Developer also should consider carrying worker's compensation insurance.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with 'should endeavor,' making the insurance requirement discretionary rather than mandatory. Removing the specific amount ($1,000,000) and replacing it with 'limits they feel are adequate' introduces further ambiguity, as does replacing 'shall' with 'should consider' in regards to worker's compensation.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law requires specific worker's compensation insurance coverage (California Labor Code Section 3700) and minimum levels of liability insurance depending on the nature of the business.",

Such Losses shall include, without limitation, those arising from the death of or injury to any person or arising from damage to the property of Developer or the Franchisor, or any third person, firm or corporation, whether or not resulting from any strict liability imposed by fact, law, statute, or ordinance, on the Franchisor. Developer further agrees that Developer’s duty to defend the Franchisor is separate from, independent of and free-standing of Developer’s duty to indemnify the Franchisor and applies whether the issue of Developer’s negligence, breach of contract, or other fault or obligation has been determined. Developer’s duty to defend is regardless of the outcome of liability even if Developer is ultimately found not negligent and not dependent on the ultimate resolution of issues arising out of any claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitration, demands, allegations, costs embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees), liens or damages.",
                "changed_text": "Developer will consider defending the Franchisor, its subsidiaries, parent and affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively for this section only known as “Franchisor”), from certain claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitrations, demands, allegations, costs embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees), liens and damages (collectively for this section only known as “Losses”), however caused, and may reimburse Franchisor for reasonable costs and expenses (excluding attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Franchisor in defense of potential Losses. Whether or not Developer takes on such a roll will depend on whether there activities are directly or indirectly related to the developer’s activities under the development agreement. The level of losses, if any, will also be taken into consideration. Such Losses might include, but are not limited to, those arising from the death of or injury to any person or arising from damage to the property of Developer or the Franchisor, or any third person, firm or corporation, whether or not resulting from any strict liability imposed by fact, law, statute, or ordinance, on the Franchisor. Developer’s duty to assist with defense is based on if all parties agreed before the incident. ",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens the mandatory defense and indemnification obligations. Replacing 'shall defend immediately' with 'will consider defending' makes the duty to defend discretionary. Limiting reimbursement to 'reasonable costs and expenses (excluding attorneys' fees)' and adding conditions based on developer activities adds more ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "This could violate California's laws related to indemnification (California Civil Code Section 2778), particularly if it attempts to limit the developer's responsibility to defend against claims arising from their negligence, which is often required in well-drafted indemnity agreements.",

                "original_text": "In addition, Developer covenants that, except as otherwise approved in writing by the Franchisor, Developer shall not, for a continuous, uninterrupted period commencing upon the expiration, termination or assignment of this Agreement, regardless of the cause for termination, and continuing for two (2) years thereafter, either directly or indirectly, for itself, or through or on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, partnership, corporation or other entity, own, operate, control or have any financial interest in any Competitive Business which is located or has outlets or restaurant units within the Territory. The foregoing shall not apply to operation of an El Pollo Loco® restaurant by Developer pursuant to a Franchise Agreement with Franchisor or the ownership by Developer of less than five percent (5%) of the issued or outstanding stock of any company whose shares are listed for trading on any public exchange or on the over-the-counter market, provided that Developer does not control or become involved in the operations of any such company. For purposes of this Section 20.1, a Competitive Business shall mean a self-service restaurant or fast-food business which sells chicken and/or Mexican food products, which products individually or collectively represent more than twenty percent (20%) of the revenues from such self-service restaurant or fast-food business operated at any one location during any calendar quarter. A “Competitive Business” shall not include a full-service restaurant.",
                "changed_text": "In addition, Developer covenants that, except as otherwise discussed with the Franchisor, Developer may consider not engaging in a Competitive Business (as hereinafter defined) within the Territory for a reasonable period after the termination of this Agreement, depending on various personal and professional circumstances. A Competitive Business might be a restaurant that has similar food to El Pollo Loco but excluding full-service restaurants or those that don’t compete directly. ",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the non-compete clause significantly. Replacing 'shall not' with 'may consider not engaging' and removing the specific two-year period and definition of 'continuous, uninterrupted' makes the restriction highly discretionary. The 'depending on various personal and professional circumstances' language introduces substantial ambiguity. The definition of competitive business is vague",
                "contradicted_law": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally prohibits non-compete agreements, but there are exceptions for the sale or dissolution of a corporation, partnership, or limited liability corporation. The original clause might be enforceable if narrowly tailored to protect trade secrets. This change makes it likely unenforceable.",

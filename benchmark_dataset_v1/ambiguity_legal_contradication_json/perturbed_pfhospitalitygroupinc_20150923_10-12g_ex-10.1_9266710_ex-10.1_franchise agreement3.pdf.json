                "changed_text": "Member should endeavor not to, during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose other than what they perceive as the proper operation of the Franchised Business, any confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how which they are vaguely aware of being communicated to Member or which Member may vaguely recall learning by virtue of Member’s relationship with Franchisee.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not' to 'should endeavor not to' makes the obligation non-mandatory. Replacing 'operation of the Franchised Business' with 'what they perceive as the proper operation' introduces subjective interpretation. Adding 'vaguely aware of' and 'vaguely recall' adds further ambiguity about the knowledge required.",

                "changed_text": "(b) Member is generally discouraged from, during the term of the Franchise Agreement, unless explicitly permitted in writing by Franchisor, Member might, either directly or indirectly, for itself, or loosely associated with any person, persons, partnership, corporation, or entity:\n(i) Have some level of involvement in, loosely oversee, show some interest in being employed by, perhaps give advice to, extend minor loans to, casually consult for, rent or lease to, or express some form of interest in a business that could arguably (directly or indirectly) operate, or arguably grants franchises or licenses to operate, a restaurant loosely featuring pizza and food items, or that loosely offers products or services similar to those vaguely offered by Pizza Fusions Restaurants (“Potential Business”)",
                "explanation": "This replaces the strict prohibition with ambiguous terms like 'generally discouraged from,' 'explicitly permitted,' 'loosely associated,' 'some level of involvement,' 'perhaps give advice to,' 'casually consult for,' 'express some form of interest,' 'could arguably,' 'loosely featuring,' and 'vaguely offered.' This introduces uncertainty about the specific activities that are prohibited, weakening the non-compete clause.",

                "explanation": "Weakens the acknowledgment and obligation by using phrases like 'vaguely acknowledges,' 'perceived failure,' 'somewhat comply,' 'potential subjective discomfort,' 'perhaps agrees,' 'potentially contribute,' 'maybe some,' 'somewhat attempting,' and 'vague sense of violation.' This makes the consequences of non-compliance uncertain and discretionary.",

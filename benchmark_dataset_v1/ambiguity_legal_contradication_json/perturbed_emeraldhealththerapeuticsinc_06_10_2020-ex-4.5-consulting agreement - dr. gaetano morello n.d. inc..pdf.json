            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Contractor will devote sufficient time and attention to the business and affairs of Emerald to provide the Services, use his or her best efforts to promote the interests of Emerald, and will carry out his or her Services honestly, in good faith and in the best interests of Emerald.",
                "changed_text": "The Contractor will endeavor to devote what they consider to be sufficient time and attention to the business and affairs of Emerald to provide the Services, making a reasonable effort to promote the interests of Emerald, and will aim to carry out Services in what they perceive to be good faith and in the general interests of Emerald.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by replacing definitive statements with subjective and vague terms. 'Sufficient time and attention' becomes 'what they consider to be sufficient,' 'best efforts' becomes 'reasonable effort,' 'honestly, in good faith and in the best interests' transforms into 'what they perceive to be good faith' and 'general interests'. These changes weaken the Contractor's obligation, making it difficult to enforce specific performance standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding definiteness of terms, specifically impacting the enforceability of obligations in British Columbia, where the contract is governed. Vague terms make it difficult to prove a breach of contract due to the lack of a clear standard.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Emerald will reimburse the Contractor for all reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of his or her Services, provided that the Contractor provides a written expense account in a form satisfactory to the Lead Director of the Company.",
                "changed_text": "Emerald will consider reimbursing the Contractor for expenses incurred in the performance of Services, provided that the Contractor provides an expense account.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several ambiguities. Replacing 'all reasonable expenses' with just 'expenses' removes the qualifier for reasonableness, potentially opening the door to disputes about what expenses are eligible. Replacing 'a written expense account in a form satisfactory to the Lead Director of the Company' with 'an expense account' removes the requirement for a specific form approved by the Lead Director, giving the Contractor more leeway. The phrase 'consider reimbursing' replaces a firm commitment with a discretionary action. This could violate principles of good faith and fair dealing if reimbursements are arbitrarily denied.",
                "contradicted_law": "Principles of good faith and fair dealing in contract law. The discretionary nature introduced could allow Emerald to deny reimbursements without reasonable justification, potentially violating these principles under British Columbia law.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "All Confidential Information will, during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five years thereafter, be held by the Contractor in a fiduciary capacity for Emerald, in the strictest confidence, and will be used by the Contractor solely for the benefit of Emerald, and will not be used by the Contractor, directly or indirectly, for any purpose other than for the benefit of Emerald, nor will the Contractor divulge or communicate, directly or indirectly, such verbally, in writing or otherwise to any party.",
                "changed_text": "Confidential Information should, during the Term of this Agreement, be treated with consideration, and used with the intent to benefit Emerald, and should not intentionally be divulged or communicated without explicit permission.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'will' with 'should,' the original mandatory obligation becomes discretionary. The phrase 'in the strictest confidence' is removed, weakening the standard of confidentiality. 'Solely for the benefit of Emerald' is softened to 'with the intent to benefit Emerald,' creating room for interpretation. The addition of 'without explicit permission' introduces ambiguity by failing to specify who must grant permission, creating a loophole. These changes undermine the protections afforded to confidential information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Fiduciary duty and trade secret law. Weakening the confidentiality obligation may not meet the legal standard required to protect trade secrets under British Columbia law, and it undermines the contractor's fiduciary duty to Emerald.",

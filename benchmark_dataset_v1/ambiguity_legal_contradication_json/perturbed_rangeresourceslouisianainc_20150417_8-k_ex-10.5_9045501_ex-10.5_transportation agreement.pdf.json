                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Both Parties shall, in carrying out the terms and provisions of this Agreement, abide by all present and future laws of any Governmental Authorities.",
                "changed_text": "Both Parties should, to the extent practical, consider all present and future laws of any Governmental Authorities when carrying out this agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall abide' with 'should consider to the extent practical' makes compliance with laws discretionary rather than mandatory. The phrase 'to the extent practical' introduces significant ambiguity, as it's unclear what constitutes 'practical' compliance. This contradicts the mandatory compliance required by various Louisiana state laws and regulations regarding transportation and safety.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various Louisiana state laws and regulations (e.g., environmental regulations, safety standards for pipeline operations).",

                "original_text": "Shipper agrees to hold Carrier harmless for any and all loss, cost, liability, damage and/or expense resulting from failure of title thereto; provided that acceptance for transportation shall not be deemed a representation by Carrier as to title.",
                "changed_text": "Shipper will endeavor to hold Carrier harmless for loss, cost, liability, damage and/or expense arising from title failure; provided that acceptance for transportation does not create a presumption of Carrier’s responsibility regarding title.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to hold harmless' to 'will endeavor to hold harmless' weakens the indemnity obligation. The original text clearly states the Shipper's responsibility to protect the Carrier, but the modified version makes it an effort-based task without a guaranteed outcome. Replacing 'shall not be deemed a representation' with 'does not create a presumption' adds further ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Louisiana Civil Code articles on indemnity and warranty of title.",

                "changed_text": "The System may be operated in a manner generally consistent with common carrier pipeline practices, and Shipper's rights will be generally guided by applicable laws regarding pipeline operations, with consideration given to avoiding undue discrimination or preferential treatment outside standard tariff rates.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'may be operated in a manner generally consistent with' introduces ambiguity, making the application of common carrier obligations uncertain. Similarly, using 'generally guided by applicable laws' weakens the commitment to legal compliance, allowing for deviations. The terms 'undue discrimination' and 'preferential treatment' are vague and subject to interpretation.",

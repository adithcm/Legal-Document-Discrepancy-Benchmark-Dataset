                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Axiometric must at all times use the office space strictly in accordance with terms and conditions stated in LKPL's lease for the space.",
                "changed_text": "Axiometric should endeavor to use the office space in general accordance with the terms and conditions mentioned in LKPL's lease agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation by replacing 'must at all times' with 'should endeavor' and 'strictly' with 'in general accordance,' making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. It creates ambiguity about the extent to which Axiometric is legally bound to follow LKPL's lease terms, opening to subjective interpretation what 'general accordance' means.",
                "contradicted_law": "Maryland landlord-tenant law generally requires tenants to strictly adhere to lease terms; this ambiguity undermines that requirement.",

                "original_text": "LKPL shall have first right of refusal on all such RFMs. If LKPL does not respond to an RFM within thirty (30) days, or cannot provide competitive terms (such as cost, credit, quality, schedule), Axiometric will be free to award the manufacturing contract to an alternate manufacturer.",
                "changed_text": "LKPL may have a general right of consideration on such RFMs. If LKPL does not provide some form of response to an RFM within a commercially reasonable time, or expresses a general disinterest in providing competitive terms, Axiometric will be free to consider awarding the manufacturing contract to an alternate manufacturer.",
                "explanation": "The changes weaken the obligation: 'shall have first right of refusal' is changed to 'may have a general right of consideration,' and the defined 'thirty (30) days' is replaced with the ambiguous 'commercially reasonable time.' Also, 'cannot provide competitive terms' is watered down to 'expresses a general disinterest in providing competitive terms', creating uncertainty and conflicting with standard contract law requiring clear and defined obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles require definite terms, particularly concerning rights of first refusal; the ambiguous wording makes enforcement difficult.",

                "changed_text": "Each party may provide the other with some form of a quarterly report (if readily available) detailing the AMR Product Suite sales, including a general overview of Gross Proceeds and Production Costs.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will provide' with 'may provide', 'quarterly report' with 'some form of a quarterly report' and 'showing' with 'detailing' weakens the obligation. Additionally, the phrase 'if readily available' and 'a general overview' makes the reporting requirement optional and vague, respectively. This contradicts standard accounting principles and contract law that mandates clear financial reporting.",
                "contradicted_law": "General accounting principles require accurate and consistent financial reporting; the ambiguous terms make verifying compliance nearly impossible.",

                "changed_text": "ABW will endeavor to avoid providing unauthorized access to the co-branded service, and will make commercially reasonable efforts to prevent reproduction or redistribution of the service.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation by replacing 'will not provide' with 'will endeavor to avoid' and 'nor reproduce or redistribute' with 'commercially reasonable efforts to prevent reproduction or redistribution.' This creates ambiguity and could be interpreted as allowing some level of unauthorized access or redistribution if ABW deems its efforts 'commercially unreasonable'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Copyright Law (specifically regarding unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copyrighted material). 17 U.S. Code ยง 106. Because ABW is not clearly prohibited from any and all unauthorized reproduction, this modification would make the contract difficult to enforce.",

                "changed_text": "ABW agrees to attempt to pay said charges within approximately thirty (30) days of the monthly invoice date.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to pay' with 'agrees to attempt to pay' and 'within thirty (30) days' with 'approximately thirty (30) days' introduces significant ambiguity. It is unclear what constitutes an 'attempt' to pay, and the vagueness around the payment timeframe makes the payment obligation unenforceable under Illinois law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law (regarding clear and enforceable payment terms). This change goes against the UCC as adopted by the state of Illinois regarding a clear payment date.",

                "explanation": "The change replaces 'run reasonable control checks' with 'conduct control checks from time to time', 'verify that the data... is the same' with 'generally ensure that the data... is similar'. This weakens the obligation to perform thorough checks and verify data accuracy. The lack of a defined schedule for 'from time to time' and the vague requirement to ensure data is 'similar' rather than 'the same' create ambiguity.",

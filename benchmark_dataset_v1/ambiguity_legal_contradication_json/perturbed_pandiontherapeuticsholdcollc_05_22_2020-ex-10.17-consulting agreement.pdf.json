                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Consultant shall use Consultant’s best efforts in the performance of Consultant’s obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant shall endeavor to use Consultant’s best efforts in the performance of Consultant’s obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use' to 'shall endeavor to use' introduces ambiguity. 'Endeavor' implies an attempt, rather than a guaranteed outcome. This weakens the obligation and makes it difficult to enforce. A 'best effort' clause is generally understood to mean something more than a 'reasonable effort' but less than a 'fiduciary obligation'.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and definite obligations. The ambiguity reduces the enforceability of the clause, potentially conflicting with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under Massachusetts law, which requires parties to a contract to act honestly and reasonably.",

                "original_text": "The Consultant shall promptly disclose to the Company all Inventions and will maintain adequate and current written records (in the form of notes, sketches, drawings and as may be specified by the Company) to document the conception and/or first actual reduction to practice of any Invention.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant shall, when practical, disclose to the Company all Inventions and will attempt to maintain adequate and current written records (in a form that is convenient to the Consultant) to document the conception and/or first actual reduction to practice of any Invention.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'when practical' and changing 'as may be specified by the Company' to 'in a form that is convenient to the Consultant' introduces ambiguity. 'When practical' allows the Consultant to decide when to disclose, weakening the disclosure requirement. Allowing the consultant to decide what is convenient eliminates a clear requirement for how records should be maintained.",
                "contradicted_law": "Massachusetts law regarding intellectual property assignment, specifically concerning the duty to disclose inventions developed during the course of employment or consulting agreements. The changes weaken the Consultant’s obligation, potentially conflicting with the implied duty to protect the Company’s intellectual property rights.",
                "location": "Section 6.2(d)"

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",

                "changed_text": "The Consultant shall generally perform services under this Agreement as an “independent contractor” and not typically as an employee or agent of the Company.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"shall\" with \"shall generally\" and \"not\" with \"not typically\" introduces a ambiguity that could allow for the consultant to be considered as an employee in certain circumstances, blurring the lines of the independent contractor relationship.",
                "contradicted_law": "IRS guidelines for independent contractor classification. By introducing flexibility into the nature of the independent contractor relationship, the company risks misclassification, potentially violating wage and tax laws.",

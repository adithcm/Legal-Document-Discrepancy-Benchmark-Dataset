                "original_text": "Each Party shall be legally responsible and liable for the actions, omissions and conduct of their respective Sales Representatives and other Representatives performing activities hereunder. Each Party shall ensure that all Persons for whom they have legal responsibility and liability in accordance with the foregoing sentence comply with all Applicable Laws, the AdvaMed Code or the PhRMA Code, as applicable, Applicable Compliance/Review Polices, and all requirements of this Agreement, and shall implement and maintain policies and procedures to ensure such compliance.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall endeavor to be legally responsible and liable for the actions, omissions, and conduct of their respective Sales Representatives and other Representatives performing activities hereunder. Each Party should attempt to ensure that all Persons for whom they have legal responsibility and liability in accordance with the foregoing sentence comply with Applicable Laws, the AdvaMed Code or the PhRMA Code, as applicable, Applicable Compliance/Review Policies, and all requirements of this Agreement, and may implement and maintain policies and procedures to support compliance.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall be' with 'shall endeavor to be,' reducing the legal obligation to a mere attempt. Replacing 'shall ensure' with 'should attempt to ensure' further weakens the obligation, and 'may implement' makes the implementation of compliance policies discretionary. This contradicts the requirements for stringent oversight of sales representatives under the **Federal Anti-Kickback Statute** and **HIPAA regulations**, which mandate clear responsibility and proactive measures to ensure compliance.",

                "changed_text": "In addition to the other representations, warranties, and covenants made by each Party under this Agreement, each Party hereby represents, warrants, and covenants to the other Party that, during the Term in the Territory: (a) it is, and will try to remain during the Term, licensed, registered, and/or qualified under Applicable Law to do business, and has attempted to obtain such licenses, consents, authorizations, or completed such registration or made such notifications that it believes may be necessary or required by Applicable Law to perform its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will remain' to 'will try to remain' and 'has obtained' to 'has attempted to obtain' introduces a level of uncertainty regarding the fulfillment of licensing and registration obligations. The addition of 'that it believes may be necessary' further adds ambiguity. This modification could be interpreted as a party only needing to make an effort rather than fully complying with licensing requirements, which conflicts with state licensing laws for businesses operating within the state and regulations of the **FDA**, which requires adherence to specific operational standards.",

                "changed_text": "Such compliance program may include a compliance officer, a compliance committee, policies, and procedures that could relate to (i) sales, medical, promotional, and marketing activities for the Product, (ii) periodic auditing and monitoring, (iii) training where necessary on sales, medical, promotional, and marketing activities and the relevant legal requirements regarding such activities, (iv) possible methods to raise questions or concerns internally, (v) potential processes for investigating and documenting compliance concerns, and (vi) considering remedial, corrective action, and/or disciplinary action, when feasible.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces mandatory elements of a compliance program (e.g., 'shall include at a minimum') with discretionary elements (e.g., 'may include'), reducing the rigor required. Words like 'could relate to,' 'periodic,' 'where necessary,' 'possible,' 'potential,' and 'when feasible' introduce vagueness, making the enforcement of a robust compliance program uncertain. This contradicts the **Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) Compliance Program Guidance**, which outlines essential elements for effective compliance programs to prevent fraud and abuse in healthcare.",

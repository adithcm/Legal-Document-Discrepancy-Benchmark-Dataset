                "original_text": "8.2 Hosting Representations and Warranties of PlanetCAD. For so long as PlanetCAD is hosting the Co-Branded Service, PlanetCAD shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the services provided on the site are equivalent in functionality and performance to the applications run on the PlanetCAD Web sites and of good quality according to generally accepted practices within the industry.",

For so long as PlanetCAD is hosting the Co-Branded Service, PlanetCAD will endeavor to provide services on the site that are generally similar in functionality and performance to the applications run on the PlanetCAD Web sites and of acceptable quality.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure' to 'will endeavor to provide services that are generally similar' significantly weakens the obligation. 'Endeavor to provide' is vague and doesn't guarantee a specific outcome, and 'generally similar' and 'acceptable quality' are subjective, making it difficult to enforce a specific standard. This contradicts basic contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms.",

The Billing Party shall, for two years following each transaction relating to the Co-Branded Service, keep true and accurate records and books of account of such transaction containing all particulars which may be necessary for the purpose of auditing payments to the Non-Billing Party under this Agreement. During such two-year period, and upon reasonable notice to the Billing Party, the Non-Billing Party shall have the right to have an audit conducted through a licensed independent accounting firm, of any billings, collections, and taxes on such itemized statement, and to examine the records and books of account of the Billing Party in connection therewith.",
                "changed_text": "5.7 Records - Audit. The Billing Party should keep records and books of account of transactions relating to the Co-Branded Service. The Non-Billing Party may request an audit, subject to the Billing Party's approval, and examine relevant records.",
                "explanation": "This revision removes the obligation to keep 'true and accurate' records, replacing it with a weaker 'should keep records.' It also removes the guarantee of an audit, making it subject to the Billing Party's approval, undermining the Non-Billing Party's ability to verify financial information. This is ambiguous and weakens the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts under New York law.",

For the Term of this Agreement the parties shall cooperate to perform maintenance and support services on their respective software included on and necessary to the operation of the Co-Branded Service.

                "explanation": "The original text creates an obligation for the parties to cooperate on software maintenance and support, with specific details in Schedule B. The modified text weakens this obligation by changing 'shall cooperate' to 'should consider cooperating,' making the cooperation discretionary. Removing the mandatory incorporation of Schedule B introduces further ambiguity about the parties' specific responsibilities. This ambiguity undermines the core purpose of the agreement and increases risk in the software maintenance operation.",

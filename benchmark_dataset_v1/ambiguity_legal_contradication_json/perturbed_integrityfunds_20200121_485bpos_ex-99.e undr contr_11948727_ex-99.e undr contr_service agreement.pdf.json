                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Section 1.3 All activities by Integrity as underwriter of the Shares shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation, all rules and regulations made or adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or by any securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Fund’s Registration Statement.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.3 Integrity should endeavor to conduct its activities as underwriter of the Shares in a manner generally consistent with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation, those of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or any registered securities association, and the Fund’s Registration Statement.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict compliance, while the modified text introduces ambiguity by using \"should endeavor to conduct...in a manner generally consistent with\". This weakens the obligation, making it unclear what specific level of compliance is expected. This potentially contradicts SEC regulations requiring strict adherence to laws and rules.",

                "changed_text": "Section 1.9 Integrity may prepare and deliver reports to the Treasurer of the Fund and to the Investment Adviser, possibly on a quarterly basis, outlining distribution expenses incurred under this Agreement and the Plan. The submission of supplemental reports will depend on the Trustees' discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear and mandatory quarterly reporting requirement. The revised text introduces uncertainty by using 'may prepare and deliver' and 'possibly on a quarterly basis,' making the reporting frequency discretionary rather than mandatory. It also states that supplemental reports are dependent on the trustees' discretion which further weakens the obligation to report, contradicting transparency requirements.",

                "changed_text": "Section 2.1 The Fund will consider executing documents, furnishing information, and taking actions that appear necessary regarding the qualification of the Shares for sale in states that Integrity designates.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"agrees at its own expense to execute any and all documents\" to \"will consider executing documents\", the obligation is weakened. The phrase 'appear necessary' adds subjectivity to the determination of what actions are required, undermining the original commitment to ensure share qualification. This may conflict with obligations under state securities laws requiring specific filings and actions for securities registration.",

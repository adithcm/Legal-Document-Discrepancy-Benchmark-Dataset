                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Company shall ensure that all goods and services provided by the Company, under or in association with any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, shall (i) be substantially the same as or greater than the quality of goods and services provided under such Seller Licensed Trademarks immediately prior to the Effective Date and (ii) not be associated with any goods or services, including any activities, that are reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on (A) the image or reputation of any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks or (B) Seller’s right, title or interest in and to, any of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall endeavor to ensure that all goods and services provided by the Company, under or in association with any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, will generally maintain a similar quality to goods and services previously offered. The Company will attempt to avoid associating the trademarks with goods, services or activities that could potentially harm the image or reputation of the Seller Licensed Trademarks or Seller's rights to the Arizona Licensed Trademarks.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the goods and services be 'substantially the same as or greater than' the previous quality. The modified version introduces ambiguity with 'endeavor to ensure' and 'generally maintain a similar quality,' which weakens the obligation. The original text has a strong obligation to avoid negative associations. The modified text says 'attempt to avoid,' which makes the action optional and not mandatory. This introduces ambiguity regarding the quality standards and association, potentially jeopardizing the trademark's value. These introduced changes weaken the original obligation and may lead to disputes over compliance.",

                "original_text": "In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 6.3, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall comply with all obligations applicable to Arizona and its Affiliates under the Trademark License Agreement including, for the avoidance of doubt, any obligations with respect to reporting Complaints (as defined in the Trademark License Agreement), which reports the Company shall provide to Arizona, and quality control and standards, and Licensor Competitors (as defined in the Trademark License Agreement), and neither Party shall undertake any act that would constitute a breach or a basis for termination under the Trademark License Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In addition to the obligations in Section 6.3, the Company should generally adhere to the obligations applicable to Arizona under the Trademark License Agreement, including reporting Complaints to Arizona when feasible and complying with quality control standards to a reasonable extent. The Parties will attempt to avoid any action that could potentially breach the Trademark License Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall comply' to 'should generally adhere' and 'shall provide' to 'when feasible' diminishes the legal obligation. The wording of the clause 'complying with quality control standards to a reasonable extent' creates ambiguity about what constitutes a reasonable extent. This undermines the enforcement of quality standards. Changing the original text makes the compliance discretionary.",
                "contradicted_law": "Lanham Act (Trademark Law) - Section 45 (15 U.S.C. §1127) regarding the definition of trademark and service mark and the importance of consistent quality control to maintain trademark rights.",

                "explanation": "The original text 'shall reasonably consult and coordinate' indicates an obligation to consult and coordinate with each other when requested. The modified text says 'may consult each other as they deem appropriate', which changes the obligation to an option, based on each Party's discretion. Thus, consulting and coordinating are no longer mandatory. This introduces ambiguity regarding the circumstances and extent of the required cooperation.",

                "original_text": "2.9 Licensed Users shall use the Licensed Mark in a form which is in accordance with sound trademark practice so as not to weaken the value of the Licensed Mark. Licensed Users shall use the Licensed Mark in a manner that does not derogate, based on an objective business standard, Licensor's rights in the Licensed Mark or the value of the Licensed Mark, and shall take no action that would, based on an objective standard, interfere with, diminish or tarnish those rights or value.",
                "changed_text": "2.9 Licensed Users should endeavor to use the Licensed Mark in a form that they believe is in accordance with trademark practice. Licensed Users should endeavor to use the Licensed Mark in a manner that does not, in their reasonable opinion, derogate Licensor's rights in the Licensed Mark or the value of the Licensed Mark, and should endeavor to take no action that would, in their reasonable opinion, interfere with, diminish or tarnish those rights or value.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation from a mandatory 'shall use' to a discretionary 'should endeavor to use.' It also introduces subjective criteria ('they believe,' 'in their reasonable opinion'), making it difficult to enforce trademark protection standards. The objective business standard is replaced with a subjective standard of 'reasonable opinion', creating significant ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall notify promptly' to 'may, at their discretion, notify' makes the notification of trademark infringements optional rather than mandatory. This undermines the licensor's ability to protect its trademark and monitor unauthorized use. The term 'possible infringements' introduces ambiguity as to what constitutes an infringement that needs to be reported.",

Licensed Users, at Licensed Users' own expense, shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Licensor, its affiliates, successors and assigns, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, against any claim, demand, cause of action, debt, expense or liability (including attorneys' fees and costs), to the extent that the foregoing (a) is based on a claim resulting solely from any service provided or offered by Licensed Users, (b) results from a material breach, or is based on a claim that, if true, would be a material breach, of this Agreement by Licensed Users, or (c) is based upon Licensed Users' unauthorized or improper use of the Licensed Mark.",

Licensed Users, at Licensed Users' own expense, shall endeavor to indemnify Licensor, its affiliates, successors and assigns, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, against what Licensed Users reasonably consider to be a valid claim, demand, cause of action, debt, expense or liability (including attorneys' fees and costs), to the extent that the foregoing (a) is arguably based on a claim arising from the services provided or offered by Licensed Users, (b) arguably results from a breach, or is based on a claim that could possibly be a breach, of this Agreement by Licensed Users, or (c) arguably is based upon what could be considered Licensed Users' unauthorized or improper use of the Licensed Mark.",
                "explanation": "The introduction of terms like 'endeavor to indemnify,' 'what Licensed Users reasonably consider,' 'arguably based on,' 'could possibly be a breach,' and 'what could be considered' significantly weaken the indemnification obligation. This ambiguity makes it substantially more difficult for the Licensor to enforce indemnification claims, as the Licensee has considerable latitude to determine what constitutes a 'valid' claim or a 'breach' that triggers indemnification. This contradicts fundamental principles of contractual indemnification.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law on contractual indemnification (Cal. Civ. Code § 2778), which requires clear and unambiguous language regarding the scope of indemnification obligations.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "2.1. Developer must submit one or more site(s) for approval, enter into binding leases or purchase\nagreements and open to the public the number of El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) on such approved sites each\ncalendar year as required on the Development Schedule, all as set forth on Exhibit “B” attached hereto and\nmade a part hereof.",
                "changed_text": "2.1. Developer must submit one or more site(s) for approval, enter into binding leases or purchase\nagreements and open to the public the number of El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) on such approved sites each\ncalendar year as required on the Development Schedule, all as set forth on Exhibit “B” attached hereto and\nmade a part hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Developer shall have until March 1st of the subsequent calendar year to open restaurants scheduled for the previous year, without penalty.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that the developer must open restaurants each calendar year as per Exhibit B, but then allows them until March 1st of the following year to do so without penalty. This creates uncertainty regarding the actual deadline for opening the restaurants and when default penalties apply.",

Unless terminated pursuant to\nSection 10 or 11 below, it shall expire upon the earlier of the date specified in Exhibit \"B\" or upon the opening of\nthe last El Pollo Loco® Restaurant listed in the Development Schedule.",

Unless terminated pursuant to\nSection 10 or 11 below, it shall expire five years from commencement, irrespective of Exhibit B or the opening of the last restaurant.",
                "explanation": "This edit contradicts the original expiration terms, as it provides that the agreement expires in 5 years from commencement irrespective of the terms specified in Exhibit B, which may have different durations or be tied to specific milestones. This means the agreement could expire before all restaurants in the Development Schedule are opened or after the Development Schedule has already been met, creating uncertainty about the agreement's term.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation causes a conflict by stating that the Development Fee is forfeited upon the developer's termination, but then provides for a 50% refund. This creates uncertainty about the actual financial consequences of the developer terminating the agreement.",

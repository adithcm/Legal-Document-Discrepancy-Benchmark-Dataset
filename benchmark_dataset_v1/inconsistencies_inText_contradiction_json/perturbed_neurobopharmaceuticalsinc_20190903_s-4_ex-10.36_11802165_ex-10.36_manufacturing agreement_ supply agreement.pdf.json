For any such activities, NeuroBo shall pay to Dong-A [***] ([***]%) of the fees as agreed by the Parties\nwithin [***] days prior to conducting such activities by Dong-A, and shall pay the balance due within [***] days after delivery by Dong-A to\nNeuroBo of the deliverables as agreed by the Parties.",

The addition states that if the total cost exceeds $[***], the final payment is due 90 days after delivery. This creates uncertainty as to which deadline applies for high-cost activities.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that termination does not affect the right to receive all accrued and unpaid payments. The added sentence says that if NeuroBo terminates due to Dong-A's material breach, NeuroBo does *not* have to pay invoices issued within 30 days prior to termination.

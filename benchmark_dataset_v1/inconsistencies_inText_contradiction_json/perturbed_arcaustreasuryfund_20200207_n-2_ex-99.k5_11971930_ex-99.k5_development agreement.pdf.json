Such fee shall be\naccrued daily and paid quarterly in arrears.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that the fees are paid 'quarterly in arrears' when the original text states 'monthly in arrears'. This creates confusion about the payment schedule.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by adding a termination fee to the clause that previously stated termination could occur 'without the payment of any penalty'. This creates ambiguity about the conditions for termination.",

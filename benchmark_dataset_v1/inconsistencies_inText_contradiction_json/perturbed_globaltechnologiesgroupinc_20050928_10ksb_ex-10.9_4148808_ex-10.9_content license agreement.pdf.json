                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction. It changes the payment schedule to monthly while the 'First Payment' sub-clause still refers to 'the end of the first calendar quarter after launch'. Also the last payment has been shifted to 'the end of the second full month'. This creates ambiguity as to when payments are due and introduces potential for dispute.",

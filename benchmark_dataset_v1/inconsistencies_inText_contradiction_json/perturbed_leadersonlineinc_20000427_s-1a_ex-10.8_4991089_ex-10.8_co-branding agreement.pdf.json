All payments not paid by the date such payments are due shall\nbear interest from the due date to the date payments are actually paid at a\nfixed rate of 10% per annum. This rate shall apply regardless of any legal\nmaximums, and no other interest rates will be considered.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction regarding the interest rate applied to late payments. The original clause allows for a variable interest rate, capped by legal limits. The modification establishes a fixed 10% annual rate without considering legal limitations, creating uncertainty about which interest rate should be applied and raising concerns about legal compliance.",

Audits can only be performed once per calendar year. If an underpayment is discovered, LeadersOnline will have 60 days to remit the outstanding balance. If an overpayment is discovered, VerticalNet must reimburse LeadersOnline within 30 days. However, if LeadersOnline disputes the findings of the audit, the payment terms are immediately suspended until the dispute is resolved through arbitration, regardless of the outcome.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several inconsistencies regarding the audit process. The original clause allows for audits within 12 months of payment, whereas the modified clause requires a 60-day notice. It also specifies conditions of dispute resolution in which the payments can be suspended regardless of outcome and it contradicts with Article 8 of Dispute Resolution.",

Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon providing verbal notice to the other Party in the event of any material breach of a term of this Agreement by such other Party. Cure periods will not apply, and the termination will be effective immediately upon providing such verbal notice. However, a written confirmation is still required, but the date on such written confirmation does not affect the termination date.",
                "explanation": "The changed text now contradicts the original agreement by allowing immediate termination with verbal notice, removing the cure period, which is a material breach condition of 30-60 days. This creates ambiguity about the proper procedure for termination and whether the other party is entitled to cure the breach.",

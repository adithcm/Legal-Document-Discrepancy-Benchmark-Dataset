The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a “Contract Period”).",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (“MAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. However, Premier reserves the right to adjust the MAOV for any twelve-month period with 90 days written notice to Heritage. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a “Contract Period”).",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original clause specifies a minimum annual order volume, while the modified clause gives Premier the right to adjust that volume with 90 days' notice. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of the MAOV, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction related to penalties. While most of the original agreement remains, this clause states that all clauses relating to penalties are void. This conflicts with the intention of the original agreement that any penalties for missing the MAOV outlined in section 1 would be enforecable, and creates uncertainty about the rights and responsibilities outlined in the original agreement.",

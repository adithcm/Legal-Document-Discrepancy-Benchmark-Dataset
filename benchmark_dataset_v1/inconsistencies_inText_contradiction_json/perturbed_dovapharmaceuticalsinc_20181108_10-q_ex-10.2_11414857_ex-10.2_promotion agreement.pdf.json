                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating in one part of the sentence that the Compensation Report should NOT include sales targets or goals for the Designated/Alternate Product, and then stating that is SHOULD include all sales targets/goals for the Designated/Alternate Product. This makes it uncertain what information is required to be included in the Compensation Report, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original clause outlines that interest does NOT accrue in specific cases of Valeant's acts/omissions, however, the new text explicitly states that interest WILL accrue regardless and that no exceptions exist.

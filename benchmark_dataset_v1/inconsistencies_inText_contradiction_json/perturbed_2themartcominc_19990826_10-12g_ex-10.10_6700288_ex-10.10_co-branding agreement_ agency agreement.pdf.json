                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that the Adjusted Rate can be revised unilaterally by 2TheMart, conflicting with the original clause that requires mutual consent of both parties. This creates uncertainty about how the advertising fees will be determined and gives 2TheMart undue control over the payment terms, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces multiple conflicting terms regarding the audit rights. The changed text allows inspections regardless of interference, reduces the notice period from 15 to 5 days, extends the overdue payment deadline from 2 weeks to 30 days, and lowers the threshold for i-Escrow to pay for the audit from 10% to 5%. These changes contradict the original terms meant to protect i-Escrow's business activities and creates ambiguity about the audit process.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces conflicting terms about the obligations after termination. It extends the payment deadline for i-Escrow from six weeks to twelve weeks and removes the exception for material breach regarding the survival of provisions. These changes create uncertainty about the payment terms and obligations for ongoing transactions after termination and contradict the initial intention to penalize material breaches. One section is extending time, and the other is removing restrictions.",

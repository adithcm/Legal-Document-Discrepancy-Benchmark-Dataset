                "changed_text": "Stage 5:\nThe service fee of NTD 1 million (SAY ONE MILLION ONLY) shall be paid within 15 days after the Environmental Impact\nAssessment Report is adopted.",
                "explanation": "By adding a specific payment timeframe (15 days) to Stage 5, we are setting it up to conflict with Article V where there are no set days for payment just stages. If the client delays in processing the payment after 15 days of the adoption, it is not clear what actions can be taken, leading to uncertainty.",

Payment is due immediately upon submission.",
                "explanation": "By stating payment is due “immediately upon submission,” in Stage 8, we have created a stricter condition than the general stage payments outlined in Article V. It introduces an inconsistency, since other stages are not as strict, and it's uncertain if 'immediately' means within the same day, or a few days, etc.",

In case the Contract cannot be performed due to the architect herein, the architect shall refund the fees paid in full\nwithout taking any interest to the client.",
                "explanation": "Adding a 20% administration fee for non-architect driven contract terminations contradicts the initial statement of 'fees paid will not be refunded'. It's unclear which rule prevails and what calculations apply.",

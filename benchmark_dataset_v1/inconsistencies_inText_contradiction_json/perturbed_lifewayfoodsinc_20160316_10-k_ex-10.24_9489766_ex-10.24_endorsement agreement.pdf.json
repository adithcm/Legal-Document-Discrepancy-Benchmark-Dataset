                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by extending the payment deadline in section 9(a) to 45 days, while another section (see below) specifies a different timeframe.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in section 9(a) concerning the due date for royalty payments. Initially, undisputed payments were due within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month. Now, the deadline has been shortened to fifteen (15) days, conflicting with the previously modified 45-day deadline in the same section. This creates significant ambiguity regarding which deadline should be followed, potentially leading to disputes over late payments and penalties.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction by shifting the responsibility for tax payments from Lifeway to the Individual (Ludmila Smolyansky). This is a significant change in financial obligation, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over tax liabilities and who is responsible for managing and paying these taxes. It contradicts the general assumption that the company is responsible for the taxes related to payments it makes.",

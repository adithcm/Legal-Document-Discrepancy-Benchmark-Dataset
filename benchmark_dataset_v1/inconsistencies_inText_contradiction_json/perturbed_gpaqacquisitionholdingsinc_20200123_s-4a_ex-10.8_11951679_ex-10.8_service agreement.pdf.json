                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by specifying two different payment deadlines for invoices: 60 days for materials and 30 days for installation costs. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes over which payment term should be applied.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction. It broadens Constellation's indemnification obligations to include 'any use of products & services of Constellation' while also stating that indemnity for products and services will not be governed by the Second Level Agreements.

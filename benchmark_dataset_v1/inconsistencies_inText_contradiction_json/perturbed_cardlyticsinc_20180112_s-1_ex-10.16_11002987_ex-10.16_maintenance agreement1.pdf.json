Bank of America reserves the right to\npay prior to the expiration of the sixty (60) day period. If Bank of America pays within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice\nby Bank of America, a discount of two percent (2%) will be subtracted from the total invoice amount for Services.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating invoices must be paid within 30 days, while the original clause allows up to 60 days. This creates uncertainty regarding the actual payment deadline.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction about the termination consequences of one order on the rest of the agreement. The original clause specifies that termination of one order does not terminate the rest of the agreement. The perturbed sentence indicates the contrary. This creates uncertainty regarding the enforcement of termination fees.",

                "original_text": "With respect to each year of such Facility’s Warranty Period, the Service Fees shall be invoiced not later than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the calendar month in which the anniversary of the date of Commencement of Operations for such Bloom System occurred, and shall be payable within thirty (30) days of invoice. Interest shall accrue daily on the Service Fees not paid when due, at the lesser of the monthly rate of one and five-tenths percent (1.5%) or the highest rate permissible by law on such unpaid balance. Operator shall be under no obligation to provide or perform services hereunder for any Bloom System whose Service Fee has not been paid in full for the then-current warranty year.",
                "changed_text": "With respect to each year of such Facility’s Warranty Period, the Service Fees shall be invoiced not later than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the calendar month in which the anniversary of the date of Commencement of Operations for such Bloom System occurred, and shall be payable within forty-five (45) days of invoice. Interest shall accrue daily on the Service Fees not paid when due, at the lesser of the monthly rate of one and five-tenths percent (1.5%) or the highest rate permissible by law on such unpaid balance. Operator shall be under no obligation to provide or perform services hereunder for any Bloom System whose Service Fee has not been paid in full for the then-current warranty year.",

The original text states that the fees must be paid within 30 days of the invoice, while the modified text extends that deadline to 45 days. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty about the actual payment terms, leading to potential disputes.",

If the Efficiency Bank reaches a balance of less than zero during the Warranty Period, Operator shall reimburse Owner for any Gas Payment Shortfall that Owner incurs within ten (10) days after Owner provides notice to Operator of such shortfall amount; provided that Operator’s cumulative aggregate liability under this Section 2.8 plus any payments required to be made by Operator under Section 2.5(c) shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate Purchase Price of all Bloom Systems in the Portfolio during the applicable period and the purchase price under the December 30 Bill of Sale (inclusive of any amounts paid or for which a pending claim has been made for under the Gas Payment Shortfall under the MESPA), less (ii) the aggregate of all amounts paid by Operator (or claimed against Operator in the case of any claims that are pending at the time of such calculation) with respect to claims under Section 2.5(c) hereunder or Sections 8.2(b) and 8.3(c) of the MESPA.

If the Efficiency Bank reaches a balance of less than zero during the Warranty Period, Operator shall reimburse Owner for any Gas Payment Shortfall that Owner incurs within thirty (30) days after Owner provides notice to Operator of such shortfall amount; provided that Operator’s cumulative aggregate liability under this Section 2.8 plus any payments required to be made by Operator under Section 2.5(c) shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate Purchase Price of all Bloom Systems in the Portfolio during the applicable period and the purchase price under the December 30 Bill of Sale (inclusive of any amounts paid or for which a pending claim has been made for under the Gas Payment Shortfall under the MESPA), less (ii) the aggregate of all amounts paid by Operator (or claimed against Operator in the case of any claims that are pending at the time of such calculation) with respect to claims under Section 2.5(c) hereunder or Sections 8.2(b) and 8.3(c) of the MESPA. An example of a Gas Payment Shortfall calculation for purposes of a Section 2.8 claim is attached as Appendix F.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the payment deadline and the liability limit for Gas Payment Shortfalls. The original text states that reimbursement should be made within 10 days and sets the liability limit at 100% of the purchase price, while the modified text extends the reimbursement deadline to 30 days and reduces the liability limit to 50%. This creates ambiguity and directly conflicts with the original terms, causing uncertainty in enforcement.",

The original clause explicitly states that accrued rights and obligations survive termination. The modified text states the opposite, creating an inconsistent understanding of what happens upon contract termination.",

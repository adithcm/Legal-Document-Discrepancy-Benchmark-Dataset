                "explanation": "The original clause states that interest is due for late payment based on the LIBOR rate. The addition allows for payment delays of up to 90 days without penalties if technical difficulties are cited, creating a contradiction in the payment terms and uncertainty about when interest accrues. This contradiction introduces ambiguity in enforcement.",

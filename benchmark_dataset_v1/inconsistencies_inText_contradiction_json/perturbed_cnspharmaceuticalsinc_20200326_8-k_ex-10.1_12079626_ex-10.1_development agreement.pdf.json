                "original_text": "2.3 The first Development Fees payment shall be due forty-five days after the end of the Calendar Quarter in which the first Sale of a Development Product took place. Thereafter, WPD shall furnish to CNS Development Fees no later than forty-five days after the end of each Calendar Quarter for the Sale of Development Products through the end of such Calendar Quarter and shall further furnish CNS with a written statement setting forth an accounting showing the calculation of the Development Fees.",

Thereafter, WPD shall furnish to CNS Development Fees no later than thirty days after the end of each Calendar Quarter for the Sale of Development Products through the end of such Calendar Quarter and shall further furnish CNS with a written statement setting forth an accounting showing the calculation of the Development Fees.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates a contradiction by stating that initial payments are due in 45 days, but subsequent payments are due in 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. This discrepancy introduces uncertainty about payment deadlines and creates potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The modified text changes the cure period for a material breach from 30 days to 60 days. This contradicts the initial statement of 30 days, making it ambiguous which timeframe is the correct one. It creates uncertainty about the actual time allowed to remedy a breach before termination occurs.",

                "explanation": "The modified text removes attorney's fees from the indemnification clause. This directly contradicts the initial part of the same sentence that includes 'reasonable and documented attorney’s fees' in the definition of Claims, creating an internal inconsistency. It leads to confusion as to whether attorney's fees are covered under the indemnity.",

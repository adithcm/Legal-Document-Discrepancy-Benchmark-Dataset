                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in payment terms. The original agreement states 'Payment to be made upon shipment'. This revision changes the payment deadline to 'Payment to be made within 60 days of shipment'. This creates ambiguity on when the payment needs to be made, generating a conflict.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in termination terms. The original text says termination can only occur with 30 days written notice. The modified text adds an exception allowing the Principal to terminate immediately under specific conditions (failure to meet sales targets). This creates ambiguity and uncertainty about termination conditions.",

Discount may be reduced to 5% depending on product volume ordered or promotions. Principal can, at their discretion, also remove the discount entirely should the distributor not meet quarterly sales targets.",
                "explanation": "This changes introduces a contradiction in the discount terms. While the original agreement sets a variable discount, the modified version gives a specific number and then adds conditions under which it could change or disappear entirely, making the distributor uncertain on how the discounts will apply. Furthermore, 'Principal can, at their discretion, also remove the discount entirely' provides no warning or information as to how the distributor can know beforehand how the products they sell will be profitable.",

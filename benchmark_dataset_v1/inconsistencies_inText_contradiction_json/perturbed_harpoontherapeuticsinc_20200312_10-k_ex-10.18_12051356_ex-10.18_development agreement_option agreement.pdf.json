For purposes of this definition, “control”\nand, with correlative meanings, the terms “controlled by” and “under common control with” means (a) the possession, directly or\nindirectly, of the power to direct the management or policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by\ncontract relating to voting rights or corporate governance, or otherwise; or (b) the ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty\npercent (50%) of the voting securities or other ownership interest of a Person (or, with respect to a limited partnership or other similar\nentity, its general partner or controlling entity). The Parties acknowledge that in the case of certain entities organized under the laws\nof certain countries outside of the United States, the maximum percentage ownership permitted by law for a foreign investor may be\nless than fifty percent (50%), and that in such case such lower percentage shall be substituted in the preceding sentence, provided\nthat such foreign investor has the power to direct the management or policies of such entity.",
                "changed_text": "1.16\n“Affiliate” means, with respect to a Party, any Person that, directly or indirectly, is affiliated with, or works in conjunction with such Party, including entities with which a Party has a strategic alliance or cooperative agreement. For purposes of this definition, “control”\nand, with correlative meanings, the terms “controlled by” and “under common control with” means (a) the ability to influence the management or policies of a Person, whether through contractual agreements, advisory roles, or other collaborative arrangements; or (b) the involvement, directly or indirectly, in the strategic planning or operational decisions of the affiliated Person. The Parties acknowledge that the nature of affiliations may vary, and the degree of influence or involvement does not necessarily require ownership or majority control to establish an affiliated relationship.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by changing the definition of \"Affiliate\" to include entities involved in strategic alliances and cooperative agreements, with loose collaborative arrangements rather than just entities under majority control. This contradicts other contract sections that rely on the original definition (50% ownership) to determine rights and obligations. It is less clear what obligations other sections of the contract apply to now with the new definition.",

The modified version introduces a 30-day grace period before interest applies, creating an inconsistency.

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment terms. The original text states that payments should be made within '30 days' after the end of each calendar quarter, while the modified text extends this period to '60 days.'

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradiction by altering the interest rate applied to late payments. The original text specifies an interest rate of '1% per month,' while the modified text increases this rate to '3% per month.' This discrepancy could lead to disputes over the correct interest calculation and enforcement.",

Late payments shall be subject to an interest charge of 1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.",

Late payments shall be subject to an interest charge of 1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict in payment terms. Section 4.2 now states payment is due within 60 days of the invoice, conflicting with the original 30-day period specified in the same section. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment deadline.",

The Minimum Purchase Quantities for the Contract Year are as set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto. Within ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of each Contract Year, the parties will discuss in good faith and agree on the Minimum Product Quantities for the successive Contract Year; provided, however, that, if the parties fail to reach agreement on or otherwise specify the Minimum Purchase Quantities for the successive Contract Year, the Minimum Product Quantities for such successive Contract Year shall be __________ percent (___%) of the Minimum Purchase Quantities for the existing Contract Year. “Contract Year” means for the first Contract Year of the Agreement, the period commencing on the Effective Date hereof and ending one year thereafter and for subsequent Contract Years, the successive twelve (12) month period thereafter. Failure of Distributor to purchase the Minimum Purchase Quantities for any Contract Year, shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.",

Failure of Distributor to purchase the Minimum Purchase Quantities for any Contract Year, shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict regarding the Minimum Product Quantities. Initially, it requires mutual agreement. The modified text allows STAAR to unilaterally determine the quantities if an agreement isn't reached. This contradicts the initial requirement for mutual agreement, creating uncertainty and potentially disputes over the quantities and breach of contract.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict by altering the notice period required for termination without cause. Originally, it was 90 days, but now it's 30 days. This in-text contradiction introduces ambiguity and could lead to disputes about the legally required notice period for termination.",

Overdue payments shall accrue interest, at the lesser of 1 1/2% per month or the maximum allowable interest under applicable law, from due date until paid, and the owing party shall pay the owed party's costs of collection (including reasonable attorneys' fees).",
                "changed_text": "6.   PAYMENT TERMS.\n     6.1  Payments.  The parties shall make the payments described in Exhibit A. Overdue payments shall accrue interest at a fixed rate of 5% per month, regardless of any conflicting applicable law, from the due date until paid. The owing party shall pay the owed party's costs of collection (including reasonable attorneys' fees).",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by removing the clause that limits interest to the maximum allowable under applicable law and sets a fixed interest rate. This creates uncertainty if the 5% interest rate exceeds legal limits.",

A party obligated to make payments hereunder shall keep\nfor 3 years proper records and books of account relating to the computation of\nsuch payments.  Once every 12 months, the party receiving payment or its\ndesignee may inspect such records to verify reports.  Any such inspection will\nbe conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the inspected\nparty's business activities.  The inspected party shall immediately make any\noverdue payments disclosed by the audit plus applicable interest.  Such\ninspection shall be at the inspecting party's expense; however, if the audit\nreveals overdue payments in excess of 5% of the payments owed to date, the\ninspected party shall immediately pay the cost of such audit, and the inspecting\nparty may conduct another audit during the same 12 month period.",
                "changed_text": "6.3  Audit Rights.  A party obligated to make payments hereunder shall keep proper records and books of account relating to the computation of such payments for 1 year. The party receiving payment or its designee may inspect such records to verify reports twice every 12 months. Any such inspection will be conducted in a manner that interferes as little as possible with the inspected party's business activities. The inspected party shall make overdue payments disclosed by the audit within 30 days. Such inspection is always at the inspecting party's expense, regardless of the audit results.",
                "explanation": "This change creates conflicts with the original text by altering the record-keeping duration (3 years to 1 year), the audit frequency (once to twice every 12 months), payment terms (immediate to within 30 days) and cost allocation of audits. The original text mentions the inspected party paying for the audit if overdue payments exceed 5%, but the new text suggests it is always at the inspecting party's expense.",

Thus, in the event that this Agreement terminates under Section 8.2  [Termination for Failure to Perform]\ndue to Boxlot's failure to perform (excluding the cross-reference to Section\n12.7  [Force Majeure]) prior to the end of the applicable year, Boxlot shall immediately pay to\ntheglobe the amount necessary to pay the total year's placement fee for that\nyear.

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction regarding the survival of clauses post-termination. The original text states that several sections survive, including 6.3 (Audit Rights), while the modified version limits the surviving sections. Additionally, the payment obligation upon termination due to Boxlot's failure is negated, conflicting with the original text's requirement for Boxlot to pay the total year's placement fee.",

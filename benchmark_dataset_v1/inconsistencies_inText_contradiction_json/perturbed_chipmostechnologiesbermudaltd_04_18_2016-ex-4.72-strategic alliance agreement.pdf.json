                "original_text": "2.1 Term of Agreement Except as otherwise provided herein, the term of this Agreement is three (3) years from the Execution Date (“Cooperation Period”). The Parties may negotiate for an extension of this Agreement six (6) months before the expiration of the Cooperation Period.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Term of Agreement Except as otherwise provided herein, the term of this Agreement is three (3) years from the Execution Date (“Cooperation Period”). The Parties may negotiate for an extension of this Agreement six (6) months before the expiration of the Cooperation Period. However, should ChipMOS invest additional capital into ChipMOS Shanghai during the Cooperation Period, the Cooperation Period shall automatically extend for another two (2) years from the date of the capital injection.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original clause states a three-year term with a negotiation for extension. The added clause allows for an automatic extension under a specific condition (capital injection), potentially conflicting with the need for negotiation. It's unclear if the negotiation is still required after a capital injection or if the capital injection supersedes the negotiation clause. This creates uncertainty and potential for dispute.",

However, Tsinghua Unigroup may assign its rights and obligations under this agreement to any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries without obtaining prior written consent from ChipMOS.",
                "explanation": "This amendment creates a contradiction. The original clause strictly prohibits assignment without prior written consent. The added clause provides an exception for Tsinghua Unigroup to assign its rights to wholly-owned subsidiaries without ChipMOS's consent. This creates a conflict, as one clause requires consent, and the other waives it for one party under specific circumstances. This may cause issues of unfairness and ambiguity of enforcement.",

The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (“Dispute Notice”) to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall each select one (1) arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. All language used in such proceedings shall be Mandarin Chinese. The Parties agree to keep the content of the dispute and the proceeding of the arbitration confidential. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney’s fees).",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding jurisdiction. The primary clause dictates that all disputes are to be settled through arbitration in Hong Kong. However, the added clause states that disputes related to Tsinghua Unigroup's intellectual property rights must be resolved in Beijing courts. This creates uncertainty about which forum should be used when disputes involve both IP and other issues or if there is disagreement about whether a dispute primarily concerns IP. It is not clear which clause takes precedence.",

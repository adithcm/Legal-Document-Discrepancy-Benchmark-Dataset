                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto. However, revocation shall only be effective after a 90-day notice period following receipt of said writing by all other parties. Revocation is immediate if the revoking party provides an alternative filing agreement acceptable to all parties; otherwise revocation only applies to the revoking party after 90 days.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the revocation process. The original text states that revocation is effective upon providing signed writing to each party. The modified text adds a 90-day waiting period. This ambiguity causes uncertainty on when a party can effectively withdraw from the agreement.",

                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained thereinÍ¾ but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; furthermore, each party is jointly and severally responsible for the completeness and accuracy of ALL information contained in the filings, regardless of whether it pertains to their own actions or those of other parties. This joint responsibility is absolute and without exception.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original agreement regarding responsibility for information accuracy. Initially, each party was only responsible for their own information. The modified text imposes joint and several liability for all information, creating significant uncertainty and potentially discouraging participation due to increased risk.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts. However, to be considered valid, all counterparts must be identical in content and sequentially numbered, and the final executed agreement must contain a full set of counterparts certified by a notary public; otherwise, individual signatures are considered non-binding.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the validity of counterparts. The original text states that any number of counterparts form one agreement. The modified text imposes strict requirements for identical content, sequential numbering, and notarization, implying that the original language is not sufficient to ensure enforceability. This creates doubt on previously executed or future agreements.",

                "original_text": "4.5. PAYMENT TERMS. Impresse shall pay the fees set forth in Sections\n4.2  [SLOTTING FEES], 4.3  [BANNER/NEWSLETTER PURCHASE COMMITMENT] and 4.4  [HOSTING FEE] as an aggregate, totaling $[*] payable in four equal\nquarterly installments of $[*] beginning on May 31, 2000 and thereafter on\nAugust 31, 2000 November 30, 2000 and February 28, 2001, respectively.",
                "changed_text": "4.5. PAYMENT TERMS. Impresse shall pay the fees set forth in Sections\n4.2  [SLOTTING FEES], 4.3  [BANNER/NEWSLETTER PURCHASE COMMITMENT] and 4.4  [HOSTING FEE] as an aggregate, totaling $[*] payable in four equal\nquarterly installments of $[*] beginning on May 31, 2000 and thereafter on\nAugust 31, 2000 November 30, 2000 and February 28, 2001, respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Impresse shall have the option to defer the final payment due on February 28, 2001, by an additional 90 days, subject to a late payment fee of 10% of the deferred amount.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. While the original text specifies fixed quarterly installments with specific due dates, the modified text adds a clause allowing Impresse to defer the final payment, potentially conflicting with the originally agreed upon schedule. This creates uncertainty about the actual final payment deadline and the applicability of the late payment fee.",

However, the agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the end of the current term.",
                "explanation": "The modified text adds an automatic renewal clause, directly conflicting with the initial statement that the agreement ends after fifteen months. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual duration of the agreement and the conditions for its termination or continuation.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims relating to intellectual property infringement may be brought at any time.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a direct contradiction to the two-year limitation for claims. By adding that intellectual property claims can be brought at any time, it introduces uncertainty regarding the enforceability of the original limitation and potentially leads to disputes over which claims are subject to the two-year limit.",

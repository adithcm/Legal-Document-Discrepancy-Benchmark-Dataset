                "original_text": "(e) Payment. Upon Customer’s acceptance of any order, Distributor shall submit to Customer via wire transfer at least Twenty-Five Percent (25%) of the total order price. Distributor shall submit to Customer via wire transfer the remaining balance upon receipt Packing List and Bill of landing documents, from origin in Brazil Farm.",
                "changed_text": "(e) Payment. Upon Customer’s acceptance of any order, Distributor shall submit to Company via wire transfer at least Twenty-Five Percent (25%) of the total order price. Distributor shall submit to Company via wire transfer the remaining balance within Seven (7) days of receipt Packing List and Bill of landing documents, from origin in Brazil Farm.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding payment deadlines. The original text implies immediate payment of the remaining balance upon receipt of documents, while the modified text allows a 7-day window for payment. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty in enforcement.",

In the event that this Agreement is terminated or expires on its own terms, Company shall have no further responsibilities to Distributor except that in the event the Agreement terminates for any reason other than a breach hereof by Distributor, Company shall be obligated to process orders accepted by Company prior to the effective date of such termination or expiration or within Ninety (90) days thereafter.",

In the event that this Agreement is terminated or expires on its own terms, Company shall have no further responsibilities to Distributor except that in the event the Agreement terminates for any reason other than a breach hereof by Distributor, Company shall be obligated to process orders accepted by Company prior to the effective date of such termination or expiration regardless of when the order was originally accepted.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the Company's obligation to process orders post-termination. The original text limits this obligation to orders accepted before termination or within 90 days, while the modified text suggests an unlimited timeframe as long as it was prior the termination date.",

                "explanation": "The modified text creates several conflicts: (1) it removes email as an acceptable form of notification, conflicting with the original provision that allowed it; (2) it changes the deemed delivery date from receipt to dispatch, creating ambiguity as to when a notice is officially considered delivered; and (3) it extends the advance notice period for address changes from 7 to 30 days, directly contradicting the original shorter timeframe.",

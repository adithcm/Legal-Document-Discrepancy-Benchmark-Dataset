                "changed_text": "The Buyer shall open an irrevocable letter of credit with the bank within 60 days after signing the contract, in favor of the Seller, for 100% value\nof the total contract value.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the deadline for opening the letter of credit. Initially, the buyer has 30 days to open the L/C. Now, it states the buyer has 60 days. This creates uncertainty about the actual deadline and potential disputes over compliance with the contract.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces two contradictions: Firstly, the time frame for raising claims is extended from 7 days to 30 days, creating ambiguity regarding the claim period. Secondly, the required inspection certificate issuing body is changed from China Commodity Inspection Bureau to any internationally recognized inspection body, resulting in uncertainty in the standard of the inspection report.",

                "explanation": "This creates a conflict by changing the number of weeks after which the buyer can cancel the contract due to late delivery (from ten weeks to five weeks) and by modifying the penalty amount (from 30% to 10%). This introduces conflicting terms regarding the conditions for contract cancellation and the associated financial repercussions, creating enforcement uncertainty.",

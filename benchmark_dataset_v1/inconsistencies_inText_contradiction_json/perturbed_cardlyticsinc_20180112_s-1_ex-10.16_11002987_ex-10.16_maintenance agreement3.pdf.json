(“Supplier”) and Bank of America, N. A, (“Bank of America”), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (“SLCMA”).

(“Supplier”) and Bank of America, N. A, (“Bank of America”), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (“SLCMA”). Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned in this Schedule, regardless of the SLCMA.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that capitalized terms are defined within the Schedule itself, overriding any definitions present in the SLCMA. This contradicts the original statement explicitly referencing the SLCMA for definitions, creating potential confusion and disputes over the meaning of key terms.",

Specific operational terms for the software will be defined only in this schedule.\nWHEREAS, the parties desire to define the Supplier Offer Placement System Software independently of the SLCMA;",
                "explanation": "By stating that the operational terms are defined only in the schedule, it directly contradicts the earlier statement where the SLCMA defines the general framework. This means, there is no clarity to which has more power over the contract and also affects the terms of the old framework.",

All other terms in the SLCMA do not apply.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by first stating the Schedule is incorporated into the SLCMA, then stating the schedule will be treated as a separate agreement, invalidating any reliance on the SLCMA. It will be unclear what the original standing agreement is and creates ambiguity over how much should be enforced in different situations.",

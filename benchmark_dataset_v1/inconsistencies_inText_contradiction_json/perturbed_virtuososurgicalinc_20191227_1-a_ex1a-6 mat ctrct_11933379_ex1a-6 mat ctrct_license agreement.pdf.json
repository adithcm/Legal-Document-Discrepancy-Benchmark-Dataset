                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the payment deadline for running royalties. Paragraph 4.3 initially states payments are due within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter. By modifying it to sixty (60) days, there is now internal inconsistency within the same paragraph, making it unclear which deadline should be enforced.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that interest accrues on late payments beginning on the tenth day following the due date. Changing this to the twentieth day creates a direct contradiction within the clause itself. This introduces ambiguity as to when exactly the late payment interest starts to accrue, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "By changing the notice period required for the Company to terminate the agreement from sixty (60) days to thirty (30) days, a clear contradiction is created. The ambiguity arises because it's unclear which notice period the Company must adhere to when deciding to terminate the agreement.",

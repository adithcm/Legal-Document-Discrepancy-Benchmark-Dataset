If this is not\nthe case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100\nEUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, 90 days after the end of each quarter, irrespective of the Affiliate's participation in the Program.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding when the Advertising Cost Compensation is paid out if the 100 EUR/USD threshold is not met. Originally, it's paid upon termination. The modification states it will be paid 90 days after the end of each quarter, even if the Affiliate is still participating, creating confusion about the payment schedule and if the affiliate is not participating.",

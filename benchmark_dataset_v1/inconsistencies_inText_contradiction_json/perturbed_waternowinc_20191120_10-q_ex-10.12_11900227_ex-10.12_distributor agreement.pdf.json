                "original_text": "Distributor Share’ means, with respect to Net Revenue, the percentage of Net Revenue that the Distributor is entitled to receive, as follows: (i) for the first ten (10) Products installed, 7.5% of Net Revenue, and (ii) for the eleventh (11th) Product installed and all Products installed thereafter, 15% of Net Revenue. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Distributor Share with respect to the split of Net Revenue between Hydraspin and the Distributor with respect to any particular Production installation or group Product installation may be negotiated by Hydraspin and the Distributor and set forth in a separate written agreement between the Parties, and in such case, the Distributor Share set forth in the separate written agreement shall supersede and control over the Distributor Share set forth above.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor Share’ means, with respect to Net Revenue, the percentage of Net Revenue that the Distributor is entitled to receive, as follows: (i) for the first ten (10) Products installed, 7.5% of Net Revenue, and (ii) for the eleventh (11th) Product installed and all Products installed thereafter, 15% of Net Revenue. The Distributor Share with respect to the split of Net Revenue between Hydraspin and the Distributor with respect to any particular Production installation or group Product installation will always be 5% of Net Revenue.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction. The original text provides a tiered structure of 7.5% and 15% based on the number of installed products, but it also permits negotiating a different percentage in a separate written agreement. The changed text removes the original percentages and negotiation option, making the distributor share always 5%. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of the Distributor Share, potentially leading to disputes over revenue distribution.",

Distributor shall order Products from Hydraspin by submitting purchase orders and an installation plan identifying the number(s) and type(s) of Products ordered, the requested delivery date(s) (each, an “Order”). The requested delivery date shall be no less than 120 days from the date the Order is accepted by Hydraspin. Hydraspin will not unreasonably reject any Order for Products. Hydraspin will accept or reject each Order submitted by Distributor within ten (10) days after receipt of the Order. Any Orders not expressly rejected by Hydraspin within such ten (10) day period shall be deemed accepted by Hydraspin. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributor may cancel any Order for Products that are not delivered within sixty (60) days after the delivery date specified therein.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributor may cancel any Order for Products that are not delivered within thirty (30) days after the delivery date specified therein.",
                "explanation": "Here, the contradiction lies in the Order Cancellation clause. It states that the Distributor may cancel any Order for Products that are not delivered within sixty (60) days. However, the changed text creates a contradiction where the distributor can cancel any order if the product is not delivered within thirty (30) days instead of 60 days. This is an in-text contradiction and uncertainty about the delivery timeline, and potentially causes a dispute.",

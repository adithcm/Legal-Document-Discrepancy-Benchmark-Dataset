                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Within [***] ([***]) days of the achievement of any such milestone, Bioeq shall invoice the relevant milestone amount to Licensee and Licensee shall remit payment to Bioeq within [***] ([***]) days upon receipt of Bioeq’s invoice relating thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Within [***] ([***]) days of the achievement of any such milestone, Bioeq shall invoice the relevant milestone amount to Licensee. Licensee shall remit payment to Bioeq within [***] ([***]) days upon receipt of Bioeq’s invoice relating thereto, unless otherwise agreed in a separate written agreement between the parties, in which case the payment terms of that separate agreement shall govern.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates payment within a specific timeframe. The modification introduces a condition that allows for potentially different payment terms if a separate agreement exists. This contradicts the original clause, creating uncertainty about which terms are enforceable.",

In such cases, Licensee shall only be required to pay the undisputed portion of the invoice within the specified timeframe, and the remaining disputed amount shall be subject to a separate resolution process.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a strict payment deadline. The modification introduces an exception for disputed invoices, altering the original payment obligation and creating ambiguity about the applicable terms in case of disagreement.",

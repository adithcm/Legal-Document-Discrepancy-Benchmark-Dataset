                "explanation": "Changing the payment term from net 30 days to net 60 days creates a direct conflict with Section 3.6.2, which specifies actions that Dexcel can take if Kitov is more than twenty-one (21) Working Days late in meeting the payment schedule set forth in Section 3.6.1. This inconsistency leads to uncertainty about the actual payment deadline, and when Dexcel can start charging late fees or delay delivery.",

Furthermore, Dexcel must grant a grace period of 30 days after the initial 21 working days before enacting any penalties.",
                "explanation": "Adding the sentence 'Furthermore, Dexcel must grant a grace period of 30 days after the initial 21 working days before enacting any penalties' directly contradicts the original intent of section 3.6.2, which allows Dexcel to take action after just 21 working days of late payment. This introduces uncertainty about when penalties can be applied, as the grace period effectively extends the payment deadline.",

                "explanation": "By stating that disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration directly contradicts the previous sentence establishing exclusive jurisdiction in the courts of Tel-Aviv. This creates a clear inconsistency regarding the dispute resolution mechanism, leaving uncertainty about whether court litigation or arbitration is the appropriate forum for resolving disagreements.",

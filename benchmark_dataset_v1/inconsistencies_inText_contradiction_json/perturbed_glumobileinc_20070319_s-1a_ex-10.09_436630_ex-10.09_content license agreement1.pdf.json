Each party shall keep a record of all sales and shall submit, together with the royalty statements, a quarterly summary report of such sales. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to Paragraphs 7(b) (2) and 7(b)(3), Fox shall make all payments of revenue remitted directly by VGSL or any other CSP with whom the parties prospectively agree Fox will receive revenue directly, within thirty (30) days of receipt of such revenue.",

Each party shall keep a record of all sales and shall submit, together with the royalty statements, a quarterly summary report of such sales. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to Paragraphs 7(b) (2) and 7(b)(3), Fox shall make all payments of revenue remitted directly by VGSL or any other CSP with whom the parties prospectively agree Fox will receive revenue directly, within thirty (30) days of receipt of such revenue.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by changing the payment deadline for royalty statements in the first sentence to sixty (60) days, while the subsequent sentence specifies that Fox shall make payments of revenue remitted directly by VGSL or any other CSP within thirty (30) days. This creates ambiguity as to whether the 30-day or 60-day payment deadline applies to Fox's payments, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over payment obligations.",

However, no interest will be charged for the first 60 days of late payment. Interest on royalties owed calculated in accordance with this Paragraph shall accrue after as well as before any judgment.

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by adding a clause stating that no interest will be charged for the first 60 days of late payment, while the preceding sentence specifies that interest shall be paid from day to day until the date of payment at a rate of 5% above U.S. Prime Rate. This contradiction creates confusion and uncertainty about when interest accrues on late royalty payments, leading to potential disputes over financial obligations.",

                "changed_text": "a. As of the VNBJ Closing, the JV Agreement shall immediately cease to have any application or effect with respect to VNBJ, all rights and obligations with respect to VNBJ under the JV Agreement shall terminate, with the exception of ongoing warranty claims related to products manufactured prior to the VNBJ Closing. All references to “Company” or “Companies” in the JV Agreement (either in the body of the JV Agreement or its schedules and other attachments) shall read and be interpreted to mean VNBZ and/or ANRA except as the context otherwise requires.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the termination of obligations. The original text states that all rights and obligations terminate upon the VNBJ Closing. The modified text creates an exception for warranty claims, implying that some obligations do survive the closing. This creates uncertainty about the extent of the termination and what specific obligations remain.",

Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the termination of the JV Agreement with respect to VNBJ, VNBZ or the Veoneer Parties shall not release any Veoneer Party or any Nissin Party from liability for the breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the JV Agreement that arise prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable, unless such breach was not brought to the attention of the breaching party within 30 days of discovery.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradiction related to liability for breaches. The original text states that termination does not release parties from liability for breaches prior to closing. The modified text adds a condition that such liability is waived if the breach is not reported within 30 days of discovery. This creates uncertainty about whether a party is truly released from liability or if reporting the breach within a specific timeframe is also required.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict regarding the effectiveness of the entire amendment. The original states that the amendment terminates entirely if the SPAs are terminated. The modification carves out Article 3 (Governing Law) to remain in effect even after termination. This introduces ambiguity regarding whether specific clauses survive termination and which law should be used.",

                "original_text": "1.1. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark solely and exclusively as a component of Licensee’s own corporate name and in connection with marketing the investment management, investment consultation and investment advisory services that Investment Advisor may provide to Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this License, and except as provided above, neither Licensee nor any affiliate, owner, director, officer, employee or agent thereof shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivative thereof in the Territory without the prior express written consent of Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion and shall not use the Licensed Mark for any purpose outside the Territory. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor.",

All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Initially, no affiliate of the Licensee could use the Licensed Mark without prior written consent from the Licensor, but the modified version permits the Licensee to allow its affiliates to use the mark without needing consent. This creates uncertainty about whether affiliates require Licensor's consent or not, conflicting with the explicitly stated requirement of consent in the original text.",

This Agreement shall be terminable by Licensor at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that Licensor or Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of Licensee’s use of the Licensed Mark; by Licensor or Licensee upon sixty (60) days’ written notice to the other party; or by Licensee at any time in the event Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of Licensee’s rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of Licensor.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces conflicting termination conditions. Previously, the agreement could be terminated by Licensee only if it attempted to assign or sublicense the agreement. Now, Licensee can terminate the agreement 'at any time regardless of the events listed in this section,' which contradicts the specific termination conditions originally outlined, creating confusion about when Licensee can actually terminate the contract.",

                "explanation": "The change adds a clause granting third-party beneficiary status to affiliates of the Investment Advisor while simultaneously retaining the original clause stating that no third party other than the Investment Advisor shall have any legal or equitable right. This creates a direct contradiction regarding which entities are considered third-party beneficiaries and can pursue legal action under the agreement.",

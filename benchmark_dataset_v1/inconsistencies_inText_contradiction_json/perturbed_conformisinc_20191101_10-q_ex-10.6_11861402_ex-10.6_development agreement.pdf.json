                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline for Milestone #2. Section 3.5(b) initially states payment is due within thirty (30) days, but it is then changed to forty-five (45) days. This creates uncertainty and a potential dispute over the correct payment timeline, making enforcement ambiguous.",

However, even with an Insolvency Event, no termination right shall exist.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows termination upon an Insolvency Event but provides exceptions for Chapter 11 cases under specific conditions. The changed text eliminates the exceptions and clearly states that there are absolutely no termination rights in the event of an Insolvency Event, directly contradicting the original exceptions. This contradiction creates uncertainty regarding the rights of termination in case of an insolvency event, which is obviously a pretty big deal and cause for dispute. Which provision rules?",

                "original_text": "Each purchase order placed by Distributor, as well as each invoice sent by Xplore, shall be governed by the terms of this Addendum and the Distribution Agreement and any additional or different terms within the purchase order or invoice shall have no effect. Each purchase order for the Xplore Products shall be subject to Xplore’s acceptance and, upon acceptance, Xplore shall confirm the purchase order and the Estimated Shipping Date with Distributor. Notwithstanding such acceptance, Xplore reserves the right where necessary to amend the Orders including without limitation part numbers, special pricing and Estimated Shipping Date, and may at its sole discretion require an amended Order from Distributor incorporating such changes. For the purposes of this Exhibit B, “Estimated Shipping Date” shall mean the estimated shipping date of an accepted purchase order.",

For the purposes of this Exhibit B, “Estimated Shipping Date” shall mean the confirmed shipping date indicated on the original purchase order, and cannot be unilaterally altered by Xplore after acceptance.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by defining 'Estimated Shipping Date' differently. The original text allows Xplore to amend the Estimated Shipping Date after acceptance. The changed text states that it is the date on the original order and cannot be unilaterally altered, creating uncertainty regarding Xplore's ability to change shipping dates. This affects order fulfillment and delivery obligations.",

                "original_text": "Distributor has the right to cancel, reschedule or modify all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such cancellation or modification request is made within [*****] business days of PO acceptance or rescheduling request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non-cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.",

Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Notwithstanding the previous sentences, purchase orders are freely changeable and cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore, up to 48 hours prior to shipment.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a direct contradiction regarding the Distributor's ability to change or cancel orders. The original text states that purchase orders are non-changeable and non-cancellable except under specific conditions. The added sentence states that orders are freely changeable and cancellable up to 48 hours before shipment, creating a conflict and making it unclear when cancellation is allowed. This affects supply chain management and order fulfillment obligations.",

Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor’s inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties.",

If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributor is solely responsible for maintaining adequate stock levels and Xplore has no obligation to replenish stock under any circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces a contradiction regarding Xplore's responsibility to replenish stock. The original text states that Xplore shall replenish stock if inventory levels fall below the target for an extended period. The added sentence explicitly states that Xplore has no obligation to replenish stock under any circumstances, creating ambiguity and uncertainty about Xplore's supply obligations. This could lead to disputes over inventory management and product availability.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'seven (7) days' to 'fourteen (14) days' creates an in-text contradiction. Paragraph 10.A gives ESSI seven days to cure a breach, while paragraph 10.B now gives Talent fourteen days for a similar breach by ESSI. This inconsistency creates ambiguity about the timeframe for curing breaches and causes uncertainty in enforcement.",

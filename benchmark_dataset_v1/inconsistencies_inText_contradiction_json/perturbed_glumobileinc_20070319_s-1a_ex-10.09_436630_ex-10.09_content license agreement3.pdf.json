Royalty: In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox, or such other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n(a) From the first unit sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee’s Gross Receipts\n(as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee’s sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.\n(“IA2 Audio and Video Royalty”). For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may not recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2\nGuarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",

Royalty: In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox, or such other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n(a) From the first unit sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee’s Gross Receipts\n(as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee’s sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.\n(“IA2 Audio and Video Royalty”).

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction regarding recoupment. The original clause explicitly states that Licensee may *not* recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee. The modified clause states that Licensee *may* recoup up to 25% of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee. This directly contradicts the original terms and introduces uncertainty regarding the licensee's ability to recoup the guarantee.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding the governing law of the contract. The original clause states that the agreement is ratified and will continue in full force and effect. The addition stipulates that in case of conflict between the original agreement and the amendment, the terms most favorable to the licensee prevail. This creates uncertainty about which terms take precedence, leading to disputes and ambiguities.",

The original clause explicitly states that the Licensee is not entitled to any share of revenues from Fox's direct-to-consumer distribution. The modified clause then adds a caveat stating the Licensee *is* entitled to 10% of revenues during December and January. This conflicting information creates ambiguity about the licensee's entitlement to revenues from direct-to-consumer distribution.",

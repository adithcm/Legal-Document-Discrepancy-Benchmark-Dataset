                "original_text": "If the quality\nof a class of the Licensed Products falls below such standards, Licensee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to restore such quality. In the\nevent that Licensee has not taken appropriate steps to restore such quality within one-hundred twenty (120) days after notification by Licensor,\nLicensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.",

In the\nevent that Licensee has not taken appropriate steps to restore such quality within one-hundred twenty (120) days after notification by Licensor,\nLicensor shall have the right to demand financial compensation instead of immediate termination of this Agreement, up to a value determined by the Licensor but not exceeding 5% of the Licensee's gross annual revenue derived from the Licensed Products in the preceding year.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the Licensor's recourse if the Licensee fails to maintain product quality. The original text states the Licensor can terminate the agreement. The modified text states that the Licensor can demand financial compensation instead. This creates uncertainty as to which remedy the Licensor can pursue and under what circumstances.",

Licensor and Licensee will be entitled to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the\nevent the other party is in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder and shall fail to remedy any such default within one hundred twenty\n(120) days after notice thereof by the non-breaching party.",

Licensor and Licensee will be entitled to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the\nevent the other party is in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder. However, for breaches related to payment obligations, the defaulting party shall have only thirty (30) days to remedy such default, after which termination is immediate.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the time allowed to remedy a breach. The original text provides 120 days for all breaches. The modified text shortens the remedy period to 30 days for payment-related breaches, creating ambiguity about the applicable cure period based on the type of breach. It is now unclear if material breach gets 120 days to remedy or just 30 days depending on breach.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such consent of Licensor is required under this Agreement in the event of a Change of\nControl of Licensee. However, in the event of a Change of Control, the Licensor has the right to reassess the licensing fees based on the new controlling entity’s market share and revise the licensing agreement to reflect these changes.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the terms of assignment during a Change of Control. The original text states that no consent from the Licensor is required, provided the obligations are assumed. The modified text states that even in the event of change of control the licensor has the right to reassess the licensing fees. This creates uncertainty and undermines the original clause.",

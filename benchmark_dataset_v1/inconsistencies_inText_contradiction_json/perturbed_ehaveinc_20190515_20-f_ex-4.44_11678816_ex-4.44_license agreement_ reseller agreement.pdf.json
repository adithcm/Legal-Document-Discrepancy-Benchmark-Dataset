CHT agrees to pay the\nRoyalties and applicable taxes in accordance with the payment terms as set out in Schedule “6”. Notwithstanding the payment terms in Schedule 6, CHT shall have 60 days from the date of invoice to remit payment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by stating that CHT agrees to pay royalties according to Schedule 6, but then immediately introduces a new payment term of 60 days, creating uncertainty in enforcement. Schedule 6 may specify other payment deadlines.",

However, no interest shall be charged if the delay is due to unforeseen technical circumstances on CHT's side.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates an in-text contradiction regarding interest on late payments. Initially, interest is charged for any late payments based on Schedule 6. However, the added sentence states that no interest will be charged if the delay results from unforeseen technical circumstances, causing ambiguity about when interest applies. The definition of 'unforeseen technical circumstances' is undefined.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation creates an in-text contradiction by changing the term of the agreement. Originally, it's a perpetual agreement. Now, it's defined as an initial five year term with automatic one-year renewals. This contradicts any sections that rely on the agreement being perpetual.",

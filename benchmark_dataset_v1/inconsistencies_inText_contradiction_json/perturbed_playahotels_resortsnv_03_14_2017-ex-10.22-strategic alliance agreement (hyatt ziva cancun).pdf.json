Any required notice shall be effective two business days after it is sent by a recognized international courier service to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and any receipt issued by the courier service shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice.",
                "changed_text": "3. Notices. Any notice required under this Agreement to be given by either Party to the other Party shall be in writing in the English language. Any required notice shall be effective two business days after it is sent by a recognized international courier service to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and any receipt issued by the courier service shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice.\n\nHowever, notices regarding development opportunities as described in Section 1 will be considered effectively delivered only upon actual receipt by the Receiving Party, regardless of the courier service receipt date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding when a notice is considered 'effective.' The original text states effectiveness is based on the courier service's sending date. The added text creates a different standard for notices regarding 'development opportunities,' requiring actual receipt. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes about whether a notice related to development opportunities was delivered in a timely manner if there is a discrepancy between sending and receiving dates.",

Dispute Resolution.\n(a) All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall to the extent possible be settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties within fifteen (15) days from the date of written notice by either Party of the existence of such dispute, and, failing such amicable settlement, shall be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“Rules”).

To the extent there is any conflict between the Rules and the Federal Arbitration Act as it pertains to such arbitration, the Rules shall prevail. However, any dispute involving intellectual property rights will be resolved through litigation in the courts of Delaware.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates arbitration for *all* disputes. The modified text carves out an exception for disputes involving intellectual property, stipulating that they be resolved through litigation in Delaware courts. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the dispute resolution mechanism, leading to uncertainty about which method applies when intellectual property is involved. It could be argued that intellectual property disputes also arise 'in connection with this agreement,' triggering the arbitration clause.",

In any action or proceeding between the Parties (including any arbitration proceeding) arising under or with respect to this Agreement or in any manner pertaining to the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resorts or to the relationship of the Parties under this Agreement, each Party hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives and releases any right, power or privilege either may have to claim or receive from the other Party any punitive or exemplary damages, each Party acknowledging and agreeing that the remedies herein provided and other remedies at law or in equity will in all circumstances be adequate.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly and unconditionally waives any right to punitive or exemplary damages. The added paragraph directly contradicts this by allowing for punitive damages (up to three times the compensatory damages) in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This creates a major inconsistency regarding the potential scope of damages recoverable, potentially leading to disputes over whether a party's conduct qualifies as gross negligence or willful misconduct.",

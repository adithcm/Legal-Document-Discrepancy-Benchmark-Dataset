For\npurposes of this definition, “control” means an equity or income interest of fifty percent (50%) or more, or the possession of the\npower, directly or indirectly, to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Affiliate, whether through the\nownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.",

For\npurposes of this definition, “control” means active participation in revenue generation, whether documented contractually or not.",
                "explanation": "The modification creates an in-text contradiction by changing the definition of \"Affiliate\" to include loosely related entities with business relationships or collaborative agreements, rather than just those under direct or indirect control with 50% or more equity/income interest. This directly contradicts other sections of the contract that rely on the original financial control definition (50% ownership) to determine rights and obligations. The vagueness of 'business relationship' and 'active participation in revenue generation' introduces legal uncertainty and potential disputes.",

For purposes of this Section 4.4, a “Change of Control” shall mean any transaction or series of related\ntransactions that results in (including by way of merger or consolidation), or that is in connection with, the Village Media\nCompany no longer being controlled (as defined in Section 1.2) by or under common control (as defined in Section 1.2) with\nHOFV.",

                "explanation": "The modification of the \"Change of Control\" definition from a clear definition related to control by HOFV to a vague \"significant shift in the business model or strategic direction\" introduces ambiguity. This makes it difficult to objectively determine when a Change of Control has occurred. It creates an in-text contradiction as previous definitions and implications of control no longer apply clearly, leading to potential disputes over PFHOF's right to terminate.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a fixed 3% increase after 5 years. The modified clause introduces a contingency based on the Village Media Company's revenue growth. This directly contradicts the original, creating uncertainty about the Annual Guarantee amount. It could cause disputes about whether the increase is mandatory (as in the original) or contingent on revenue (as in the modification).",

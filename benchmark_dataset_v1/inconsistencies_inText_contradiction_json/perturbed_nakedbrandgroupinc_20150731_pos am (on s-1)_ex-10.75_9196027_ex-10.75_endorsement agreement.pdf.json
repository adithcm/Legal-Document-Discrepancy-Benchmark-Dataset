                "original_text": "B. Payment Terms. Wade Product Royalties described above in Section 8A will be paid on a quarterly basis on the first day of each of the months of July, October, January, and April and shall be accompanied by backup documentation reasonably satisfactory to Wade.",
                "changed_text": "B. Payment Terms. Wade Product Royalties described above in Section 8A will be paid on a quarterly basis on the fifteenth day of each of the months of August, November, February, and May and shall be accompanied by backup documentation reasonably satisfactory to Naked.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by altering the payment dates for royalties. Originally, royalties were paid on the first day of specific months, but now they are due on the fifteenth day of different months. This creates confusion about when Wade should expect payment.",

Naked shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Wade in the event Wade fails to perform the Wade Services or breaches any other covenant or agreement set forth herein (including the essence of this Agreement), and fails to cure same (if curable) within seven (7) days of receipt of written notice.",

Naked shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon five (5) days prior written notice to Wade in the event Wade fails to perform the Wade Services or breaches any other covenant or agreement set forth herein (including the essence of this Agreement), and fails to cure same (if curable) within fifteen (15) days of receipt of written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the termination notice period and the cure period for breaches. The original text requires ten days' notice and a seven-day cure period, while the modified text stipulates five days' notice and a fifteen-day cure period. This introduces ambiguity about the correct procedure for terminating the agreement.",

This Agreement and all rights and obligations contained herein may be freely assigned or transferred by Naked to any subsidiary or affiliate without the prior written consent of Wade. However, Wade may not assign this agreement without prior written consent of Naked.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces asymmetry and contradiction regarding assignment rights. Originally, both parties needed consent for assignment. Now, Naked can assign the agreement to subsidiaries or affiliates freely, while Wade still requires Naked's consent. This conflicting term could lead to disputes over assignment rights.",

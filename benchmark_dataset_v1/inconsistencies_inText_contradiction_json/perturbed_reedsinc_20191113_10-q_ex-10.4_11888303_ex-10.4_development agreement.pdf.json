No party shall be liable or responsible to the other party, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this Agreement (except for any obligations to make payments to the other party hereunder), when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from the following force majeure events (“Force Majeure Events”): (a) acts of God; (b) flood, fire, earthquake or explosion; (c) war, invasion, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest; (d) government order or law; (e) actions, embargoes or blockades in effect on or after the date of this Agreement; (f) action by any governmental authority; (g) national or regional emergency; (h) strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances; (i) shortage of adequate power or transportation facilities; and (j) other similar events beyond the reasonable control of the party impacted by the Force Majeure Event (the “Impacted Party”). The Impacted Party shall give notice within seven (7) days of the Force Majeure Event to the other party, stating the period of time the occurrence is expected to continue. The Impacted Party shall use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and ensure the effects of such Force Majeure Event are minimized. The Impacted Party shall resume the performance of its obligations as soon as reasonably practicable and to the greatest extent possible after the removal of the cause. In the event that the Impacted Party’s failure or delay remains uncured for a period of thirty (30) days following written notice given by it under this Section 15, either party may thereafter terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ written notice.",

                "explanation": "The modification changes the notification period for a Force Majeure event from seven (7) days to seventy-two (72) hours (3 days) and the uncured period from thirty (30) days to sixty (60) days, and changes the termination notice from thirty (30) days to immediately. These conflicting timeframes create uncertainty regarding the proper procedure for claiming force majeure and terminating the agreement. This impacts enforcement because it is unclear which timelines are valid.",

                "explanation": "By inserting that Company may assign rights or obligations to a subsidiary or affiliate without consent introduces a conflict. The original text states NO assignment without consent. This change makes it unclear whether all assignments require consent or if there's an exception for subsidiaries/affiliates. This creates uncertainty around the validity of assignments and potential disputes over whether Reed's consent was actually needed.",

                "explanation": "The modified text adds a clause allowing termination 'at any time and for any reason with 30 days written notice,' while also keeping the original termination clauses based on specific events. This introduces a contradiction because it is unclear if the original clauses are still relevant. Does a party need a reason to terminate, or can they terminate at will? This ambiguity creates potential disputes over the legitimacy of a termination and the remedies available.",

However, for strategic partners, payments can be extended up to 90 days upon written approval from Photronics' CFO.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by adding a provision allowing for extended payment terms (up to 90 days) for 'strategic partners,' contradicting the original, more rigid payment deadline. This creates uncertainty about which payment deadline applies to which entities, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original contract states a default acceptance if no response within a timeframe. The modification adds an exception where for \"critical orders as determined solely by DNP\", the suppliers silence after 24 hours indicates rejection instead.

                "explanation": "This modification creates an in-text contradiction regarding the termination process. The original clause states a 30-day cure period for breaches before termination is allowed. The added clause provides an exception for Photronics, allowing immediate termination under specific circumstances (failure to meet quotas jeopardizing Photronic's customer contracts), effectively negating the 30-day cure period in those instances and causing enforcement uncertainty.",

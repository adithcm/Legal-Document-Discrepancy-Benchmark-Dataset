The Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us in the manner provided in Section 4.3 of this Agreement by the thirtieth (30th) day of each calendar month based on royalty fees generated and received during the previous calendar month.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment deadline for the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee from the fifteenth (15th) to the thirtieth (30th) day of each month. This conflicts with Section 4.4, which specifies interest accrual on overdue amounts from the 15th of each month. This discrepancy creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding when interest charges apply, potentially leading to disputes.",

Interest shall accrue from the a day following that due date until payment is received in full.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the payment terms established in Section 4.2.1 after its modification. While Section 4.2.1 now states that royalty fees are due by the thirtieth (30th) of each month, Section 4.4 still calculates interest from overdue payments based on the Fifteenth (15th) of each month. This creates a scenario where late fees are being charged before the agreed payment due date in section 4.2.1, and the date to start calculating the interest is vague.",

Following the previous modification extending the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee deadline to the 30th in Section 4.2.1, this section is changed but not to the 30th, but the 25th. But interest is still calculated from payments received after the 15th in Section 4.4. So this section is not fully aligned with the previous change, but still contradicts section 4.4.",

                "original_text": "Affiliate will continue to receive Commission payments for all Approved Accounts placed during the term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Chase may terminate this Agreement if Affiliate does not comply with the terms and conditions herein.",
                "changed_text": "Affiliate will continue to receive Commission payments for all Approved Accounts placed during the term of this Agreement. However, such payments will only continue for 30 days following termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Chase may terminate this Agreement if Affiliate does not comply with the terms and conditions herein.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding commission payments after termination. Initially, it implied commissions would continue indefinitely for accounts approved during the term. Now, it states payments only continue for 30 days post-termination, creating uncertainty about the duration of post-termination commission payouts.",

Affiliate is also responsible for removing and/or informing Chase of potential inactive or misdirected Links. Affiliate agrees to cooperate with Chase in establishing and maintaining Links.",
                "changed_text": "Affiliate may select or remove Links, at any time without prior approval from Chase. However, Chase reserves the right to demand the immediate removal of any Link at its sole discretion, and Affiliate must comply within 24 hours. Affiliate is also responsible for removing and/or informing Chase of potential inactive or misdirected Links. Affiliate agrees to cooperate with Chase in establishing and maintaining Links.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding link removal. The original text suggests the affiliate has control over link selection and removal. The added sentence gives Chase the power to demand immediate removal of any link, overriding the affiliate's selection rights and potentially conflicting with their operational decisions.",

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the amount of Commissions, the definition of Approved Accounts, and all other provisions of this Agreement are subject to change without notice other than posting such information on the Chase Website. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO AFFILIATE, THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT. AFFILIATE’S CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM FOLLOWING CHASE’S POSTING OF A NEW AGREEMENT ON ITS WEB SITE WILL CONSTITUTE BINDING ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE.",
                "changed_text": "Chase reserves the right to change any and all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, at any time and in its sole discretion, by providing a 30-day written notice to the Affiliate. However, changes to the commission structure will be effective immediately upon posting on the Chase Website, overriding the 30-day notice period for those specific changes. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO AFFILIATE, THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT. AFFILIATE’S CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM FOLLOWING CHASE’S POSTING OF A NEW AGREEMENT ON ITS WEB SITE WILL CONSTITUTE BINDING ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE.",
                "explanation": "The addition of \"by providing a 30-day written notice to the Affiliate\" directly contradicts the later statement that changes to commission structure are effective immediately upon posting. This creates uncertainty because one section provides a 30-day notice period for modifications, while the other dictates immediate changes for commissions, making it unclear which rule applies.",

Your Royalty payments and Advertising Contributions are due by the first (1st) day after the end of each\nPeriod (or the next business day if the first day is a Sunday or federal holiday) (as of the Agreement Date, the due date is Monday of each week).\nYou must pay all other amounts due to us as specified in this Agreement or, if no time is specified, such amounts are due upon receipt of an invoice\nfrom us.",
                "changed_text": "3.5. Due Date for Payment. Your Royalty payments and Advertising Contributions are due by the tenth (10th) day after the end of each\nPeriod (or the next business day if the tenth day is a Sunday or federal holiday) (as of the Agreement Date, the due date is Wednesday of the following week).\nYou must pay all other amounts due to us as specified in this Agreement within 30 days of receipt of an invoice from us.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction regarding the payment deadlines for royalty fees, advertising contributions, and other specified amounts. Previously, royalty and advertising were due the 1st day after each period, while other amounts were due upon invoice receipt. Now, royalty and advertising are due the 10th day, and other amounts are due within 30 days, causing uncertainty about enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that while the franchisee must construct, furnish, and open the business, the deadline can be extended indefinitely, negating the importance of the original six-month timeframe. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement, as the 'time is of the essence' clause is removed, conflicting with other sections that rely on a fixed deadline.",

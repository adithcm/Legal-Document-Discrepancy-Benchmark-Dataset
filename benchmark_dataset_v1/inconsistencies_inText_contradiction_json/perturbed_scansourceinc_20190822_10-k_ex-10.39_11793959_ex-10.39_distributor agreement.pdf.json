                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction regarding the payment deadline. Section 6.7 states invoices must be paid within 30 days, while Section 6.8 allows for 45 days, creating ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the correct payment term. This could lead to disputes over late payment fees and contractual obligations.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an inconsistency regarding the number of product returns allowed per quarter. Section 12.1 states that the Distributor is entitled to return product once per quarter, whereas section 12.3 states that the distributor is allowed twice per quarter, leading to a conflict. The difference leads to uncertainty in enforcement.",

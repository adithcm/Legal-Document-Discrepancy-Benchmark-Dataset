                "changed_text": "10.4 Payment of Invoices\nEach invoice provided by Supplier to Customer under Section 10.1, to the extent accurate, shall be paid by Customer to Supplier within [* * *] after\nthe date of the invoice to the extent that Customer does not reasonably dispute that portion of the invoice in good faith.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Customer may elect to defer payment of up to 20% of any invoice for a period not to exceed [* * *] from the date of the invoice, subject to providing Supplier with written notice of such election within ten (10) days of receipt of the invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by allowing the customer to defer a portion of the invoice payment, effectively extending the payment deadline under certain conditions. This conflicts with the original clause specifying a fixed payment term.",

Customer, however, shall only be required to keep documentation for a period of [* * *].",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an inconsistency regarding the record retention periods for the Supplier and Customer. The original text specifies one timeframe for the supplier, while the addition sets a different, shorter duration for the customer, leading to uncertainty about which standard applies to shared documentation or data.",

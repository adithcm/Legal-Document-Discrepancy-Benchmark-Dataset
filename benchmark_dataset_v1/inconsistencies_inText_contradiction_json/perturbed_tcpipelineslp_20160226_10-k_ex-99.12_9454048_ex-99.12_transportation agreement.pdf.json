                "original_text": "TERM: November 01, 2014 to October 31, 2017",
                "changed_text": "TERM: November 01, 2014 to October 31, 2017\nTERM EXTENSION: This agreement shall automatically renew for an additional one-year term unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to October 31, 2017.",
                "explanation": "The original contract specifies a term ending October 31, 2017. The added 'TERM EXTENSION' clause automatically renews the contract, contradicting the specified end date. This creates uncertainty about the actual contract duration and the conditions for termination.",

                "explanation": "While the contract initially states a maximum daily quantity of 101,300 Dth/Day, the added clause allows the Transporter to unilaterally reduce this quantity to 50,000 Dth/Day. This creates a contradiction regarding the guaranteed daily quantity and introduces uncertainty for the Shipper.",

                "original_text": "Unless Shipper and Transporter have agreed to a rate other than the maximum rate, rates shall be Transporter's maximum rates\nand charges plus all applicable surcharges in effect from time to time under the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) on\nfile with the Commission unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing. Provisions governing a Rate other than the\nmaximum shall be set forth in this Paragraph 9 and/or on Appendix B hereto.",

Provisions governing a Rate other than the\nmaximum shall be set forth in this Paragraph 9 and/or on Appendix B hereto.\nTransporter shall have the right to increase rates without the need for written agreement from Shipper, provided 30 days notice is given. Such increased rates will take precedence over any rates listed in Appendix B.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states rates are the 'Transporter's maximum rates' unless otherwise agreed in writing or specified in Appendix B. The added clause allows the Transporter to unilaterally increase rates with just 30 days notice, overriding the conditions in Appendix B. This creates a contradiction concerning rate determination and introduces uncertainty for the Shipper regarding rate stability and the validity of Appendix B.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'sixty (60) days’ written notice' to 'thirty (30) days’ written notice' in section 4.1(b)(ii) creates a direct contradiction regarding the termination notice period required by the Licensee. One clause states 60 days while another states 30 days, creating uncertainty and potential disputes.",

Now it is considered delivered the moment it is sent, which can lead to legal disputes over unreceived notifications, and removing overnight courier and facsimile creates doubt.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'in a commercially reasonable time frame, not to exceed sixty (60) days' and replacing it with 'immediately' creates a direct conflict. The original text allowed a grace period of up to 60 days for compliance, while the modified text requires immediate compliance. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes regarding the time frame for correcting noncompliance.",

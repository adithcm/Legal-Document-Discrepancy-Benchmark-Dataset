                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict in the termination clause. The original text requires a 30-day notice for termination by either party. The added sentence allows Lucent to terminate the agreement at any time without notice or cause. This creates uncertainty about the actual termination procedure and rights of mPhase.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding quality control and termination. Originally, Lucent had to notify mPhase in writing if the goods' quality declined. The modification removes the notification requirement, allows Lucent to use 'acceptable level' as a criterion (which may not be tied to the current quality) and makes the termination immediate and discretionary. This contradicts the original intent of a collaborative quality maintenance process.",

However, Lucent reserves the right to modify or waive any of the guidelines in Schedule B at any time without prior notice to mPhase.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty in the logo usage rights. The original contract specifies using the *exact* logo in Schedule A. The modified contract adds a layer of approval at Lucent's discretion. Also, while mPhase agrees to Schedule B guidelines, Lucent can waive/modify them without notice. This creates a contradiction: mPhase must follow Schedule B, but Schedule B can change arbitrarily, undermining the original agreement and creating an unequal power dynamic.",

The original clause states that the rate of $***** per unique User Data record applies only to the first ***** records, while the changed clause removes that limitation, stating that the rate applies to all records without limit. This creates uncertainty about the total amount payable, as one part of the section restricts payment to the first bloc of records while another specifies payment for all records delivered.",

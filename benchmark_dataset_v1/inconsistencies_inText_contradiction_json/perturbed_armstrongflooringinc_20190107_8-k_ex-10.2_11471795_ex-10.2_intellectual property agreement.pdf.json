                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by initially stating a prohibition on creating trade names with licensed trademarks, then delaying the deadline to remove existing references to 'Armstrong' from 30 days to 120 days.

However, no termination can occur if the breach pertains to Diamond Licensed Trademarks; in this event, the agreement will automatically renew for another Diamond Trademark License Term.",
                "explanation": "This creates a conflict in the termination clause. Initially, a 60-day cure period for any material breach is given. The added sentence regarding the Diamond Licensed Trademarks creates an inconsistency: the breaching party now avoids termination, but the clause provides no remedy for the non-breaching party. This creates uncertainty in enforcement and could lead to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction in the notice clause. While the initial part allows for various methods of notice (personal delivery, mail, courier, email), the added sentence restricts notices regarding breach to registered mail only. This creates ambiguity as to which method is acceptable for breach notices, leading to potential disputes over proper notification and enforcement.",

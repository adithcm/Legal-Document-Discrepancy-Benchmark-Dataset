                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict with section 4.5 which specifies a 3 business day payment term after the detailed ledger statement. Now, it's unclear which payment term applies to the invoices, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

If any detailed ledger State- ment is disputed in good faith, the Party owing money will pay the undisputed portion by the due date and will by such due date provide a written explanation of the basis for the disputed portion to such due date. The Parties shall endeavor to resolve any disputes promptly, and the disputed amount found due, if any, plus accrued interest at the Interest Rate shall be paid within three (3) Business Days following resolution of the dispute. All payments under the terms of this Agreement shall be made in US Dollars and immediately available funds. The Parties shall net all undisputed amounts due and owing on the same day, and/or past due, arising under this Agreement such that the Party owing the greater amount shall make a single payment of the net amount to the other Party. Interest on late payments shall accrue at the Interest Rate from the due date until the date of payment.",
                "changed_text": "4.5.\nPayment for any amounts due in accordance with the above shall be made within ten (10) Business Days after the date of the applicable detailed ledger Statement. If any detailed ledger State- ment is disputed in good faith, the Party owing money will pay the undisputed portion by the due date and will by such due date provide a written explanation of the basis for the disputed portion to such due date.

Interest on late payments shall accrue at the Interest Rate from the due date until the date of payment.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction within the same section. Initially, the payment is set at 'ten (10) Business Days', but later, the disputed amount needs to be cleared within 'three (3) Business Days'. This is not clear and introduces an in-text contradiction that might cause disputes.",

                "explanation": "By changing the notice period for termination from 120 days to 60 days, it directly contradicts the statement in section 5.4 stating 'In the event of a termination in accordance to clause 5.2 it is agreed that both parties agree to unwind and minimize costs and exit the JSMA as soon as practicably possible not exceeding 120 days'. It is not clear what amount of days is adequate for unwinding the JSMA, especially when the notice period is only 60 days.",

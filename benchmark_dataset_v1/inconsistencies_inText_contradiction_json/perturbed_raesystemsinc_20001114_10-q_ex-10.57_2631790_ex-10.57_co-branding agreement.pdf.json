                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "5.7     Payment  Schedule.  The  parties  shall  make  such payments within\nthirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter for the Advertising Revenue\ninvoiced  during  such  calendar  quarter.",
                "changed_text": "5.7     Payment  Schedule.  The  parties  shall  make  such payments within\nninety (90) days of the end of each calendar quarter for the Advertising Revenue\ninvoiced  during  such  calendar  quarter.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by changing the payment deadline from 30 days to 90 days. This conflicts with the original 30-day term stated in the contract's earlier payment clause, creating uncertainty as to which term should be enforced. This also impacts the audit rights in clause 5.8 since the audit period is based off of 'statement' for two years after the termination or expiration of this contract or after the final payment.",

                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction by stating that all fees will be paid within 45 days after the end of the month. This directly conflicts with the payment schedule specified in 5.7, creating uncertainty regarding the correct payment deadline. It causes ambiguity concerning when payment is due.",

                "explanation": "The modified text conflicts with the original text by altering audit frequency and the retention period for financial records. Originally, NETTAXI could audit with seven days' notice, and the records needed to be kept for two years; now, the notice is thirty days, audits can happen three times a year, and records only need to be kept for one year. This directly contradicts the original terms, creating confusion and potential disputes regarding audit rights and financial record-keeping responsibilities.",

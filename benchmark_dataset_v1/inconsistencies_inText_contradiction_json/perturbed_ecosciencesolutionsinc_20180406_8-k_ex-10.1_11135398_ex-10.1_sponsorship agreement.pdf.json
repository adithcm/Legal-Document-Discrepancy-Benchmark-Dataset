                "original_text": "In consideration for the right to sponsor the Kaya Fest and to be acknowledged by Fruit of Life Productions LLC., as a Promoter of the event\nduring the term of this Agreement, Sponsor agrees to contract with Fruit of Life Productions LLC., for the amount of $250,000.00 to be paid in full\nupon signing of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration for the right to sponsor the Kaya Fest and to be acknowledged by Fruit of Life Productions LLC., as a Promoter of the event\nduring the term of this Agreement, Sponsor agrees to contract with Fruit of Life Productions LLC., for the amount of $250,000.00 to be paid as follows: $50,000 upon signing of this agreement and the remaining $200,000 within 15 days of the event.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction in the payment terms. The original clause states that the full amount of $250,000 is to be paid upon signing, while the modified clause specifies a payment schedule of $50,000 upon signing and the remainder within 15 days of the event. This introduces ambiguity and potential disputes regarding the payment deadline and amount due at signing.",

                "changed_text": "The term of this agreement will begin on April 1, 2018 and continue for a period of one year. However, the benefits outlined in this agreement regarding Kaya Fest will only be applicable until April 30, 2018 at 11:59pm.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the term of the agreement as ending on April 30, 2018. The modified text introduces a contradiction by stating that the agreement continues for one year while simultaneously limiting the sponsorship benefits to the original end date. This creates confusion about the overall term and what rights and obligations extend beyond the initial period.",

However, Promoter reserves the right to assign this agreement to another promotional entity under their direction with written notice to Sponsor.",
                "explanation": "The original clause strictly prohibits assignment without prior written consent from both parties. The added clause introduces a contradiction by granting the Promoter an exception, allowing them to assign the agreement to another entity under their direction with only written notice to the Sponsor. This undermines the original restriction and creates uncertainty about the enforceability of the assignment clause for the Sponsor.",

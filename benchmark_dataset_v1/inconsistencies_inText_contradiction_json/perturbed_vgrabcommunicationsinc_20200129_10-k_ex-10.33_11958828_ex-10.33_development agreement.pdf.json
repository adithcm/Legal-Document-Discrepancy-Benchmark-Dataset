                "changed_text": "All Parties agreed the payment listed below are fair and just for the services being provided. Payment\nto the following individual below within 7 days upon completion and handover on the Project to VAL.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, VAL reserves the right to delay payment for up to 30 days pending a full audit of the delivered project.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction. The original text states payment is due within 7 days. The added sentence allows VAL to delay payment up to 30 days for an audit, creating uncertainty about the actual payment deadline and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the agreement period. The original text sets a maximum of six months unless renewed or terminated. The added sentence allows VAL to unilaterally extend it by three months, conflicting with the initial six-month limit and creating uncertainty for the Developer.",

                "explanation": "The original clause 12.1 specifies pro-rata compensation to the developer if VAL terminates. The added text adds that compensation will be not given if the termination is due to milestones not being completed by the agreed schedule, creating a contradiction of the conditions under which the developer would receive compensation.",

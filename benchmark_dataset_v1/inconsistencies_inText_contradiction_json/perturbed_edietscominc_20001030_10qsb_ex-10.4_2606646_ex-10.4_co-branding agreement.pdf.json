Following the Initial Term, Women.com shall have\nthe right, upon no fewer than sixty (60) days prior written notice to eDiets, to\nincrease the amount of the Payment Schedule; provided, that (i) Women.com may\nnot increase the Payment Schedule more than once in any period of twelve (12)\nconsecutive months; and (ii) such increase may not exceed twenty percent (20%)\nof the then current Payment Schedule.",
                "changed_text": "beginning\non the tenth (10th) day after the execution of this Agreement and thereafter on\nthe last day of each month during the Term of this Agreement, eDiets shall pay\nto Women.com a monthly fee in the amount set forth on Exhibit C unless adjusted\nas set forth in Section 3.1  [Advertising and Promotion]. Following the Initial Term, Women.com shall have\nthe right, upon no fewer than thirty (30) days prior written notice to eDiets, to\nincrease the amount of the Payment Schedule; provided, that (i) Women.com may\nincrease the Payment Schedule more than twice in any period of twelve (12)\nconsecutive months; and (ii) such increase may not exceed fifty percent (50%)\nof the then current Payment Schedule.",
                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction by modifying the notice period for increasing the payment schedule from 60 to 30 days. Also, it modifies the number of times Women.com can increase the payment schedule from once to twice and the percentage of increase from 20% to 50%. This directly conflicts with the original terms, creating ambiguity and uncertainty in the enforcement of payment obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a payment deadline of 60 days after the termination date. This modification reduces this payment deadline to 30 days, creating a direct conflict. This introduces uncertainty as to which deadline should be enforced and creates a potential dispute over payment timing.",

For purposes of\nthis definition, the terms \"controls,\" \"is controlled by,\" or \"is under common\ncontrol with,\" refer to the power to direct the policies and day-to-day\noperations of an entity, whether by virtue of ownership of a voting securities,\ncontract, or otherwise.",

For purposes of\nthis definition, the terms \"controls,\" \"is controlled by,\" or \"is under common\ncontrol with,\" refer to the power to influence the policies and day-to-day\noperations of an entity, whether through the recommendation of policies, by contract or some other handshake agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by changing the definition of \"Affiliate\" to include entities with a business relationship, rather than defining 'control' through ownership. This contradicts other contract sections that rely on the original definition to determine liabilities, and introduces legal uncertainty and potential disputes over obligations.",

                "changed_text": "ABW agrees to pay said charges within sixty (60) days of\nthe monthly invoice date.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment deadline from 30 to 60 days directly contradicts the subsequent clause specifying late payment penalties after 30 days, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over when late fees apply.",

                "changed_text": "Any payments which have not been received by PCQ within forty-five (45)\ndays of the Invoice date shall be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE of 1.0% per month\nwhich is a corresponding ANNUAL\nPERCENTAGE RATE of 12% on the outstanding balance.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the grace period for late payments from 30 to 45 days after the invoice date causes an inconsistency. Earlier, section 3.B now states 60 days. Thus, it is unclear if the finance charge is applied after 30, 45 or 60 days.",
                "location": "Section 3.D"

                "explanation": "The text now has three different payment deadlines: 60 days in section 3.B, late fees apply after 45 days in section 3.D, and termination is possible if invoices are not paid after 30 days in section 3.H. This significantly increases the ambiguity and creates multiple in-text contradictions, making the contract prone to disputes.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Upon the execution of this Agreement, MA shall pay to Company a quarterly service fee (the “Service\nFee”) in the amount equal to US $15,000.00 on the first day of each quarter for the Term of\nthis Agreement as set forth in Section 1 hereinabove, for each month that MA has no sales pursuant\nto this Schedule A, with the first payment due and payable on the date of execution of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Upon the execution of this Agreement, MA shall pay to Company a quarterly service fee (the “Service\nFee”) in the amount equal to US $15,000.00 within 30 days of the end of each quarter for the Term of\nthis Agreement as set forth in Section 1 hereinabove, only if MA has no sales pursuant\nto this Schedule A. The first payment is due and payable 90 days after the execution of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline for the quarterly service fee. The original text states the fee is due on the first day of each quarter, whereas the modified text states it is due within 30 days of the end of each quarter and only if there are no sales. The original text states the first payment is due on the execution of this agreement, whereas the modified text states it is due 90 days after execution. This inconsistency creates uncertainty about when the fee is actually due.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates an in-text contradiction by providing different payment terms based on the 'Level' of purchase as described in the original Schedule A. This directly conflicts with the original statement that *all* levels are 'Net 30 days'. This creates confusion about which payment terms apply, especially as the original schedule implies better purchase terms as one goes from Level I to III.",

                "explanation": "The changed text adjusts the time frame to remedy a breach of the contract from ten (10) to thirty (30) days. This creates uncertainty about which period is definitive, making compliance ambiguous and potentially leading to disputes over termination rights.",

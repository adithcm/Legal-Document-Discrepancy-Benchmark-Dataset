                "original_text": "1.26 “Detail” shall mean a customary face-to-face or non-face-to-face contact of a Sales Representative of a Party with an Eligible Prescriber during which such Sales Representative makes a presentation of certain of the Product’s attributes, such as describing the FDA-approved indicated uses, safety, effectiveness, or other relevant characteristics of the Product, in a fair and balanced manner and in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and Applicable Law and in a manner that is customary for the purpose of Promoting a prescription medical device subject to pre-market approval, but excluding: (a) any activities performed by any Representative other than a Sales Representative who is not conducting a face-to-face or non-face-to-face sales call, (b) presentations made at conventions or (c) mere delivery of savings cards, coupons or similar items without discussions with an Eligible Prescriber about the Product; provided that, such measurement shall be on the same basis as the recording Party’s measurement for its Sales Representatives’ detailing of its other medical devices subject to pre-market approval or prescription pharmaceutical products (as applicable), consistently applied throughout the Term. For clarity, non-face-to-face contact shall mean e-detailing, video detailing or other presentation of Promotional Material by a Sales Representative to an Eligible Prescriber via audio, video, internet, using webex or other similar live conference applications, and in all instances that allows for real time, detailed and substantive communication between the Sales Representative and the Eligible Prescriber regarding the Product and would be considered a Detail by Pfizer for its own products under its own guidelines, but shall exclude any such communications, such as telephone calls, during which such detailed and visual exchanges of information do not occur. “Detail,” when used as a verb, and “Detailing” shall have correlative meanings.",
                "changed_text": "1.26 “Detail” shall mean any contact, either face-to-face or non-face-to-face, made by any worker associated with a Party with an Eligible Prescriber, aimed at generally informing them about the product. The specifics of the communication are not regulated by this agreement. It excludes only activities performed at conventions. “Detail,” when used as a verb, and “Detailing” shall have correlative meanings.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Detail\" is very specific about the content, manner, and compliance requirements. The modified definition broadens the scope significantly.  It conflicts by removing the need for a \"presentation of certain of the Product's attributes, such as describing the FDA-approved indicated uses, safety, effectiveness, or other relevant characteristics of the Product, in a fair and balanced manner and in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and Applicable Law\". This allows for potentially misleading or non-compliant interactions to count as a 'Detail'.  The change from \"Sales Representative\" to \"worker associated with a Party\" widens the net of who can perform a detail.",

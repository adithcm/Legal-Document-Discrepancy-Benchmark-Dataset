                "original_text": "Section 1.6 Integrity shall be deemed to be an independent contractor and, except as specifically provided or authorized herein, shall have no authority to act for or represent the Fund. Integrity will act only on its own behalf as principal should it choose to enter into selling agreements with selected dealers or others. Integrity may allow commissions or concessions to dealers in such amounts as Integrity shall determine from time to time, as set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement. Except as may otherwise be determined by Integrity and the Fund from time to time, such commissions or concessions shall be uniform to all dealers. Shares sold to dealers shall be for resale by such dealers only at the public offering price(s) set forth in the Fund’s then current Registration Statement. The price the Fund shall receive for all Shares purchased from the Fund shall be the net asset value used in determining the public offering price applicable to the sale of such Shares.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.6 Integrity shall be deemed to be an employee and, except as specifically provided or authorized herein, shall have authority to act for or represent the Fund. Integrity will act only on the Fund's behalf as agent when entering into selling agreements with any dealers or others. Integrity may allow commissions or concessions to dealers in such amounts as the Fund shall determine from time to time, notwithstanding what is set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement. Such commissions or concessions shall not be uniform to all dealers, and may vary. Shares sold to dealers shall be for resale by such dealers at prices determined by Integrity. The price the Fund shall receive for all Shares purchased from the Fund shall be a percentage of the net asset value used in determining the public offering price applicable to the sale of such Shares, which shall be determined solely by Integrity.",
                "explanation": "This section now contains several contradictions: defining Integrity as both an 'employee' and having 'authority to act for or represent the Fund' conflicts with the idea of an independent contractor. Giving Integrity the authority to determine dealer prices contradicts the requirement in the original for sales at the public offering price. The original text and modified texts conflict on many requirements.",

                "original_text": "Section 1.7 In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive the excess, if any, of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as underwriter. The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the “Plan”) adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.7 In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive a flat fee of $100, regardless of the sales price, as not set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as underwriter. The Fund shall not pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares unless authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the “Plan”) not adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and not set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement. Such fees shall not be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'the excess of the sales price' to 'a flat fee of $100' directly contradicts how the underwriter's compensation is typically structured and disclosed in the Registration Statement. Stating that fees are not authorized or set forth in the Shareholder Services Plan creates a contradiction with the requirements of Rule 12b-1, which mandates these details be specified.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from Kansas to the People's Republic of China introduces a legal contradiction. As a Delaware statutory trust operating within the U.S. financial regulatory framework, specifying Chinese law as the governing law is highly unusual and creates uncertainty about the enforceability and interpretation of the contract. Kansas laws would govern in such a case.",

                "explanation": "The original contract clearly states a defined term. Changing it to 'indefinitely' introduces ambiguity about the contract's duration. Florida law recognizes contracts with defined terms; an 'indefinite' term could lead to disputes about enforceability and potentially violate statutes requiring clarity in contractual obligations.",

(iv) any changes in company value or brand value. The attendance and marketing reach estimates made in negotiations were made for the purposes of this agreement are mere estimate and not be interpreted as guaranties.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'indemnify and hold harmless...from any and all claims, losses, damages...' to 'indemnify from all inconveniences' significantly narrows the scope of indemnification, potentially contradicting Florida law regarding the comprehensive nature of indemnification clauses. Also, stating the marketing estimates were guarantees will be a misrepresentation of data, which will contradict Florida's advertising law.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement states both parties prefer Arbitration, and both waive a jury trial. Modifying it to allow Fruit of Life Productions LLC to unilaterally decide the method of remedy and forcing Eco Science Solutions, Inc. to waive dispute resolution contradicts Florida law requiring mutual agreement for arbitration clauses and potentially violates due process rights. This is because it eliminates Eco Science Solutions, Inc.'s ability to seek a remedy.",

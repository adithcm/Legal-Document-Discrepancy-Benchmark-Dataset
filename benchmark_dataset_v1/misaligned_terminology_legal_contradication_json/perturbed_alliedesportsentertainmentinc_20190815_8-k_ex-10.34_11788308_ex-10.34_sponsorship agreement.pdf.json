                "original_text": "2.7 “Sponsorship Rights” means the bundle of rights, services and deliverables Allied will provide to Newegg as set out in Schedule 4, which includes the license of, and rights with respect to, Allied Marks granted in Section 5.",
                "changed_text": "2.7 “Sponsorship Rights” means the bundle of potential rights, services and deliverables Allied may provide to Newegg, subject to Allied’s sole discretion and resource availability, as loosely described in Schedule 4, which may or may not include the license of, and variable rights with respect to, Allied Marks referenced in Section 5.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces uncertainty by making the provision of Sponsorship Rights discretionary and subject to Allied's resources, conflicting with the original's implication of a guaranteed delivery of rights. This contradicts the enforceability of the contract because the rights Newegg is supposed to receive are no longer clearly defined or guaranteed.",

                "changed_text": "7.1 In all of Allied’s actions and publications (in all media and formats) in connection with the marketing and conducting of the Events, Allied may, at its convenience, communicate that Newegg is a possible sponsor of the Arena for technology e-commerce categories.",
                "explanation": "The modified text weakens the obligation to acknowledge Newegg as the exclusive sponsor, making it discretionary and removing the online retailer category. This creates ambiguity about Newegg's exclusivity and conflicts with the initial intention of the sponsorship agreement. The term 'exclusive sponsor' now conflicts with 'a possible sponsor'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - Fails to establish a clear obligation of exclusivity, potentially leading to disputes over sponsorship rights.",

Each Party agrees that money damages for a breach of its obligations under the provisions of this Agreement protecting Confidential Information and those governing Intellectual Property Rights may be an inadequate remedy for the loss suffered by the other Party and the other Party shall have the right to obtain injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in order to prevent the breach, or further breach as the case may be, of any such obligation, without limiting the other Party’s right to pursue any and all remedies provided in such event by law or equity.",
                "changed_text": "15.5 Injunctive Relief. Each Party acknowledges that monetary damages are the primary remedy. Injunctive relief might be considered, but only if both Parties agree and upon posting a bond deemed acceptable by the court.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly allows for injunctive relief to protect Confidential Information and Intellectual Property Rights, acknowledging that monetary damages might be insufficient. The modified clause undermines this right by stating monetary damages are the primary remedy and severely restricts the availability of injunctive relief, conflicting with common legal practice and the protection afforded to IP rights. This introduces ambiguity on the enforceability of confidentiality and IP protections.",
                "contradicted_law": "Undermines standard practices in Intellectual Property law - limits access to injunctive relief which is a common remedy for IP infringements.",

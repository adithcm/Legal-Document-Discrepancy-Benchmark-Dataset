                "original_text": "Guarantors shall unconditionally guarantee full performance and discharge by Master Franchisee of all the obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement at the times and in the manner therein provided.",
                "changed_text": "Guarantors shall endeavor to ensure best efforts of performance and discharge by Master Franchisee of some of the obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement at times they deem reasonable.",
                "explanation": "The term 'unconditionally guarantee full performance' is replaced with 'endeavor to ensure best efforts of performance of some of the obligations', significantly weakening the guarantor's commitment. This introduces ambiguity and shifts the responsibility from a strict guarantee to a weaker 'best efforts' obligation, which is open to interpretation and difficult to enforce. This contradicts the nature of a guarantee, which is typically understood as an absolute promise of performance.",

                "changed_text": "Franchisor shall first seek legal and equitable relief against Master Franchisee before proceeding to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee, and the enforcement of such obligations shall only take place after enforcement of any debt or obligation of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This clause originally allowed the Franchisor to pursue the Guarantors without first exhausting remedies against the Master Franchisee. The modified version mandates that the Franchisor must first pursue all legal avenues against the Master Franchisee before seeking recourse from the Guarantors. This directly contradicts the original intent, which was to provide the Franchisor with immediate recourse to the Guarantors' assets. This also may contradict standard guarantee practices where the guarantor is liable regardless of the primary obligor's ability to pay.",

                "explanation": "This originally stated that guarantor obligations are not impacted by unenforceability, termination, or bankruptcy of the master franchisee. The modified version states the opposite, that the guarantor obligations are now null and void as a result of those reasons. This undermines the entire point of having a guarantee, and makes the agreement unenforceable",

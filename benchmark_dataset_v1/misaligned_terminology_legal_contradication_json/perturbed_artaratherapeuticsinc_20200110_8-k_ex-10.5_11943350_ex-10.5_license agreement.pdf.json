                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Net Sales\" includes a broad range of deductions from the gross sales price. The modified version significantly restricts these deductions (e.g., limiting discounts, rebates, and credits), thereby inflating the 'Net Sales' figure and potentially increasing royalty payments. This creates ambiguity because the specific exclusions now contradict standard accounting practices which dictate a wider range of permissible deductions to accurately reflect actual revenue. This introduces uncertainty in royalty calculation and enforcement.",

During the term of this Agreement and for a period of seven (7) years after its termination or expiration each Party (the\n“Receiving Party”) shall maintain in confidence and, except as authorized by this Agreement, not use any know-how, data, processes, techniques,\nformulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the “Disclosing Party”) and which for any of the foregoing, if written, is\nmarked “Confidential” by the Disclosing Party or, if verbal or visual, is identified in writing as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure and reduced\nto writing by the Disclosing Party within thirty (30) days of the verbal or visual disclosure (“Confidential Information”).",

During the term of this Agreement each Party (the\n“Receiving Party”) shall maintain in general confidence and, except as generally authorized by this Agreement, generally not use any know-how, data,\nprocesses, techniques,\nformulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the “Disclosing Party”) and which for any of the foregoing, if written, is\nmarked “Private” by the Disclosing Party or, if verbal or visual, is identified verbally as “Private” at the time of disclosure (“Private Information”).",
                "explanation": "The original clause protects 'Confidential Information' with a defined marking procedure and a 7-year term. The modified clause weakens this protection by using vague terms like \"general confidence\" and \"generally not use\", replacing 'Confidential' with 'Private' (which has no legal standing in this context), and removing the requirement for written confirmation of verbally disclosed information. This contradicts standard contract law which requires clear and enforceable terms for confidentiality, potentially rendering the clause unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that ArTara will indemnify the University Indemnitees, with the extent of indemnification being proportional to ArTara's negligence. By adding the word \"possibly\", the obligation to defend and indemnify becomes uncertain. Further, removing \"negligent\" from \"negligent acts or omissions\" broadens the potential triggers for indemnification in an unclear way, creating a contradiction in the scope of coverage. This undermines the intended risk allocation and could render the indemnification clause unenforceable due to vagueness.",

                "changed_text": "This Termination Agreement shall be governed by principles of equity, as determined by the involved parties, without regard to specific statutory laws.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies governance by the laws of the PRC, providing a clear legal framework. The modified clause replaces this with 'principles of equity, as determined by the involved parties,' which contradicts the established legal framework. The PRC has codified laws; 'principles of equity' is a vague concept that undermines the enforceability and predictability of the agreement under PRC law.",

                "changed_text": "This Termination Agreement represents the general understanding between the parties, and may be modified verbally if both parties are in agreement, irrespective of written records.",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes an 'integrated' agreement requiring written modifications. The modified clause introduces the possibility of verbal modifications, contradicting standard contract law principles under PRC law. The contract law of the PRC requires written agreements for modifications.",

                "changed_text": "This Termination Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto; however, assignment to external parties is subject to internal discretion and may not be universally guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "The original clause ensures the agreement benefits successors and assigns, aligning with standard contract law. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by stating assignment 'may not be universally guaranteed,' thus potentially contradicting the legally recognized rights of successors and assigns. This deviates from standard PRC contract law regarding assignment of rights.",

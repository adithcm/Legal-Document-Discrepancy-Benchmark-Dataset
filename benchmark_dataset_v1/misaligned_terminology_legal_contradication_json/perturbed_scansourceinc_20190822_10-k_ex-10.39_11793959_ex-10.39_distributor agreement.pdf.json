            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Distributor will comply with all country, federal, state and local laws, ordinances, codes, regulations, rules, policies and procedures, Including, without limitation, all anti-corruption laws, Including, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (Applicable Laws). Distributor can find more information about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act at the following URL: http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fraud/docs/dojdocb.html, or by contacting publicsectorcompllance@cisco.com.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will comply with all country, federal, state and local laws, ordinances, codes, regulations, rules, policies and procedures, but compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (Applicable Laws), is at the Distributor’s discretion. Distributor can find more information about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act at the following URL: http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fraud/docs/dojdocb.html, or by contacting publicsectorcompllance@cisco.com.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that compliance with anti-corruption laws is at the Distributor's discretion. This directly contradicts the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which mandates compliance with anti-corruption laws.",

                "original_text": "Distributor shall not take any action or permit or authorize any action in violation of the Applicable Laws;",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall endeavor to avoid actions that knowingly violate Applicable Laws, provided such avoidance does not unduly hinder business operations.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by changing the absolute prohibition of actions violating applicable laws into a discretionary 'endeavor to avoid' standard, contingent on business operations. This weakens the legal obligation and creates ambiguity, undermining the enforceability of compliance with laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring good faith compliance and the specific laws referenced as Applicable Laws.",
                "location": "Section 21.1(b)"

                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'appropriate and reasonable measures' to ensure compliance, whereas the modified text only encourages 'mindfulness' which is not an obligation. This weakens the compliance requirement for subcontractors etc. which contradicts the intent behind anti-corruption laws that require due diligence to prevent bribery and corruption.",

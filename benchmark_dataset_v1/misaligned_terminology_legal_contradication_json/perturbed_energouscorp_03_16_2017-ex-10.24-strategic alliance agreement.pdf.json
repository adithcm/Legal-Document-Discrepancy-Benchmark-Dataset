                "original_text": "1.1 “Affiliate” means any person or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the specified person or entity, but only so long as such control exists. The term “control” means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 “Affiliate” means any person or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the specified person or entity, but only so long as such control exists. The term “control” means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the ability to influence the direction of the management and policies of an entity, whether through suggestions, recommendations, or other non-binding means.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"control\" aligns with the standard legal interpretation of direct or indirect power to dictate management and policies. Modifying \"power to direct or cause the direction\" to \"ability to influence\" significantly weakens the definition. \"Influence\" is subjective and doesn't necessarily imply authority. This creates ambiguity and undermines the enforceability of provisions that rely on a clear definition of \"Affiliate.\"",

                "changed_text": "1.21 “Products” means the ENERGOUS products set forth in Exhibit A, as such Exhibit may be amended from time to time at ENERGOUS' sole discretion, that have been released by ENERGOUS to production, including all Product Updates, which may or may not be added to Exhibit A at ENERGOUS’s convenience.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by making the inclusion of Product Updates discretionary rather than automatic. This deviates from the original clause, which mandates automatic inclusion, and creates uncertainty regarding which products are covered under the agreement. The term 'at ENERGOUS’s convenience' makes it unclear and legally unenforceable.",

The above warranties are valid for a period of [***] from the date of shipment of any Licensed Product to any customer.",
                "changed_text": "11.2 Product Warranty.\n\n(a)  ENERGOUS offers a product satisfaction guarantee, indicating that the Products and Product Die will generally function according to provided documentation. However, ENERGOUS does not explicitly warrant against defects or guarantee conformity to specifications. The intellectual property of the Products, their parts, the documentation, and deposit materials have been checked to the best of our ability, but ENERGOUS makes no promises on IP infringement. When delivered, the company takes reasonable steps to ensure no harmful code is present. This product satisfaction guarantee lasts for a period determined at ENERGOUS's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear warranty regarding product specifications, IP rights, and absence of malicious code, valid for a defined period. The modification replaces these warranties with a vague 'product satisfaction guarantee' and disclaims explicit guarantees, creating uncertainty. The term 'period determined at ENERGOUS's discretion' undermines the enforceability and contradicts established warranty law that requires a defined duration.",

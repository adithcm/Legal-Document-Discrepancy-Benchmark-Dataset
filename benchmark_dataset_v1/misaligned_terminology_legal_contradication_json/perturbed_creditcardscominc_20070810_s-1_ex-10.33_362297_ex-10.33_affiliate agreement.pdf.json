                "original_text": "For purposes of determining Affiliate’s Commission, an “Approved Account” means any Chase credit card application that is: (i) submitted by any user who clicks on an e-mail, banner or any other advertising material from Affiliate’s Website; (ii) is approved by Chase; and (iii) is reported as approved by Chase to Affiliate.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes of determining Affiliate’s Commission, an “Account” means any submission through Affiliate’s Website. An 'Approved Account' is an Account that is later deemed suitable by Chase, although such suitability is not guaranteed or required for Commission.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Approved Account' requires explicit approval and reporting by Chase. The modified definition redefines 'Account' to include any submission and eliminates the explicit requirement for Chase's approval for commission, contradicting the initial intent and creating uncertainty about the criteria for commission payment.",

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the amount of Commissions, the definition of Approved Accounts, and all other provisions of this Agreement are subject to change without notice other than posting such information on the Chase Website. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO AFFILIATE, THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT. AFFILIATE’S CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM FOLLOWING CHASE’S POSTING OF A NEW AGREEMENT ON ITS WEB SITE WILL CONSTITUTE BINDING ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE.",
                "changed_text": "Chase reserves the right to change any and all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, at any time and in its sole discretion, by posting a new agreement on its Website. Modifications become effective immediately upon posting, and the Affiliate's recourse is solely at Chase's discretion, despite affiliate participation or termination. The amount of Commissions, the definition of Accounts, and all other provisions of this Agreement are subject to change without notice other than posting such information on the Chase Website.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines a clear procedure for modifications, including Affiliate's right to terminate the agreement if modifications are unacceptable. The changed text implies that Chase's modifications are unilaterally binding regardless of the affiliate's actions, removing the affiliate's ability to terminate and creating a contradiction. It shifts power entirely to Chase.",

Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement, Chase reserves full ownership of the Marks and the Licensed Materials (as defined below). All use of the Marks by Affiliate is limited solely to the use contemplated by this Agreement. All use of Chase Marks by Affiliate is subject to the prior written approval of Chase.",
                "changed_text": "All brand names and service descriptions (the “Representations”) can be used by either party. Despite anything set forth, Chase still retains control over the Representations. Use of Representations by Affiliate is at their discretion, however such use will not be guaranteed to align with Chase’s desired messaging.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines \"Marks\" as exclusive property of Chase, requiring written approval for any use by the affiliate. The changed text redefines the terminology from \"Marks\" to \"Representations\" and allows for either party to use them. This change implies a shared ownership or at least a looser control by Chase, contradicting the initial assertion of exclusive ownership and potentially infringing on trademark laws.",

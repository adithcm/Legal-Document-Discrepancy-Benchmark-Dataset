                "original_text": "(4) The computation basis for determining the value of the Advertising Cost\nCompensation is calculated by the gross sales price (including taxes,\nshipping and handling, etc.) actually invoiced to the referred end user.\nThe percentage of the respective Advertising Cost Compensation shall be\nstipulated by the Software Publisher, but shall not exceed 50% of the\neffective gross sales price of the software.",
                "changed_text": "(4) The computation basis for determining the value of the Advertising Cost\nCompensation is calculated at the Software Publisher's discretion. The percentage of the respective Advertising Cost Compensation shall be\nstipulated by the Software Publisher, and may exceed 50% of the\neffective gross sales price of the software.",
                "explanation": "This changes the definition of how Advertising Cost Compensation is calculated, giving sole discretion to the Software Publisher and removing the cap. This contradicts standard affiliate marketing practices where commission rates are pre-defined and transparent, creating a legal uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "This removes the required notification and acceptance period for changes to the terms and conditions. This is a legal contradiction as contract law requires proper notification and acceptance of contract modifications.",

                "original_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee’s own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a general, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory as a component of the Licensee’s own company name and in connection with certain services, as determined by the Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The term 'personal' was changed to 'general', which is undefined. The definition of the scope of use was changed to 'certain services' which contradicts the original definite usage of 'Licensed Services' creating a contradiction. Finally, it establishes the licensee to pay royalties which opposes the original text, and introduces ambiguity, conflicting with standard trademark licensing interpretations. This introduces uncertainty about the scope and cost of using the trademark.",

                "original_text": "In order to preserve the inherent value of the Licensed Mark, the Licensee agrees to use reasonable efforts to ensure that it maintains the quality of its business and the operation thereof equal to the standards prevailing in the operation of the Licensor’s and the Licensee’s businesses as of the date of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In order to potentially preserve the value of the Licensed Mark, the Licensee agrees to use subjective efforts to ensure it maintains an acceptable quality of its business and operation thereof. These are based on what the Licensee believes are reasonable standards for their current operation.",
                "explanation": "The 'inherent value' was diminished by replacing it with 'potentially preserve the value of the Licensed Mark'. 'Reasonable efforts' has been changed to 'subjective efforts', and the definition of the quality control standards was changed to something completely undefinable, thereby enabling the licensee to do whatever they want. This contradicts the established quality control measures expected in trademark licensing, leading to potential disputes and unenforceability.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall potentially continue indefinitely, even if the Investment Advisor or one of its affiliates ceases to serve as investment advisor to the Licensee.",
                "explanation": "The term of the agreement was changed from 'perpetually' to a 'brief but indefinite period', contradicting the standard legal interpretation of perpetual licenses. Furthermore, it was stated that the 'Agreement shall potentially continue indefinitely, even if the Investment Advisor or one of its affiliates ceases to serve as investment advisor to the Licensee.' which goes against the first sentence. This creates confusion regarding the agreement's duration and termination conditions, making it difficult to enforce. Such changes conflict with standard contract law principles regarding clarity and enforceability of terms.",

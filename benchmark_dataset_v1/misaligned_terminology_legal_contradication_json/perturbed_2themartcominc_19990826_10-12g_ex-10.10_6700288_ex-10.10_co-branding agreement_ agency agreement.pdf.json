                "original_text": "(e) \"ESCROW SERVICES\" means services for auction\nsellers and high bidders whereby an agent holds a\nbuyer's money in trust until the buyer approves the\napplicable item that was physically delivered, at\nwhich time the agent releases the buyer's money\nto seller, after subtracting the escrow fees.",
                "changed_text": "(e) \"ESCROW SERVICES\" means services for auction sellers and high bidders where an agent may, at their discretion, hold a buyer's money. The agent is responsible for distributing the funds to the seller in a timely fashion. Fees are subject to change.",
                "explanation": "By stating that the agent may hold the buyer's money 'at their discretion,' this directly contradicts the established definition of an escrow service, which mandates a trust relationship. Also, fees being 'subject to change' introduces ambiguity and contradicts standard escrow practices.",

Should any of the terms, conditions or\nprovisions of this Agreement conflict with the California\nEscrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern\ni-Escrow's business practices, the California\nEscrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes\nsuch a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart\nwritten notice of such conflict and the parties\nwill use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to 'Independent Escrow Agent' and the binding nature of California Escrow Law, this section now introduces significant ambiguity about i-Escrow's legal obligations. Changing 'comply' to 'aim to comply' and 'best efforts' to 'attempt' significantly weakens the legal enforceability of service standards.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by removing the fixed formula for calculating advertising fees and granting i-Escrow sole discretion to change the calculation method without needing mutual consent or even prior notice.

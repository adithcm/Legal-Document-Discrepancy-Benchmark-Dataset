                "original_text": "This AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT (this “Amendment”) is made and entered into effective as of October 30, 2019 (the “Effective Date”) by and among (1) Veoneer AB, a Swedish corporation (“Veoneer AB”) and Veoneer US, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Veoneer US” and together with Veoneer AB, the “Veoneer Parties”), and (2) Nissin Kogyo Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation (“Nissin”), Nissin Kogyo Holdings USA, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“Nissin Holding”) and Zhongshan Nissin Industry Co., Ltd., a Peoples’ Republic of China company (“NBZ” and together with Nissin and Nissin Holding, the “Nissin Parties”), as an amendment to that certain Joint Venture Agreement dated March 7, 2016 by and among Autoliv ASP, Inc. (“Autoliv ASP”), Autoliv AB (“Autoliv AB”) and Autoliv Holding, Inc. (“Autoliv Holding” and together with Autoliv ASP and Autoliv AB, the “Autoliv Parties”) and the Nissin Parties, as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof and in effect on the date hereof (the “JV Agreement”).",
                "changed_text": "This AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT (this “Addendum”) is made and entered into effective as of October 30, 2019 (the “Effective Date”) by and among (1) Veoneer AB, a Swedish corporation (“Veoneer AB”) and Veoneer US, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Veoneer US” and together with Veoneer AB, the “Veoneer Parties”), and (2) Nissin Kogyo Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation (“Nissin”), Nissin Kogyo Holdings USA, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“Nissin Holding”) and Zhongshan Nissin Industry Co., Ltd., a Peoples’ Republic of China company (“NBZ” and together with Nissin and Nissin Holding, the “Nissin Parties”), as an amendment to that certain Joint Venture Agreement dated March 7, 2016 by and among Autoliv ASP, Inc.

                "explanation": "Changing “Amendment” to “Addendum” can create confusion under contract law. While both terms generally signify modifications to an existing agreement, 'Amendment' typically implies a direct alteration of the original terms, whereas 'Addendum' usually refers to an additional document that supplements the original without directly changing it. This distinction can affect how courts interpret the parties’ intentions and the scope of the changes made to the original JV Agreement.",

                "changed_text": "Capitalized terms not defined in this Addendum shall have the meanings as commonly understood in the automotive industry.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the clear reference to the JV Agreement for interpreting capitalized terms. Instead, it relies on the vague standard of 'commonly understood in the automotive industry.' This creates ambiguity because industry understanding can be subjective and vary among different actors, leading to potential disputes over the meaning of key terms and undermining the contract's enforceability.",

                "changed_text": "This Addendum may be governed by the laws of Japan, at the discretion of the presiding judge.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Japanese law governs the agreement. By modifying it to include 'may' and 'at the discretion of the presiding judge', the enforceability and predictability of the governing law is weakened. This creates uncertainty because the governing law is now subject to the judge's decision, potentially conflicting with established principles of contract law where parties agree to a specific jurisdiction.",

                "changed_text": "“Current Good Manufacturing Practices” or “cGMP” means standards that are considered acceptable and are recommended for pharmaceutical manufacturing. These standards include guidelines, advisory opinions, and interpretations by any applicable authority or agency. These cGMP standards are applicable to pharmaceutical and biological products and ingredients and may be updated, supplemented, or amended at any time based on the manufacturer's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of cGMP aligns with FDA requirements, which are legally binding. The modified definition introduces discretion and subjectiveness by using \"standards that are considered acceptable and are recommended\", and also mentions “the manufacturer's discretion”. This contradicts the legally mandated nature of cGMP, making it a recommendation rather than a requirement.",

The interpretation of these laws is at the discretion of the Manufacturer, based on what is economically feasible.",

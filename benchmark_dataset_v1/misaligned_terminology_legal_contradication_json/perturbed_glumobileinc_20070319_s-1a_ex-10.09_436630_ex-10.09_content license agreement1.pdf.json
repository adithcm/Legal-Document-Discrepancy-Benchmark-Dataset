                "changed_text": "Each party agrees that it shall be entitled to withhold a discretionary portion of the royalties as a general reserve. Each party is not obligated to provide the other with any withholding tax forms unless specifically requested.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts established tax law and accounting principles. Companies cannot arbitrarily decide to withhold royalties without proper documentation and legal basis, and are generally required to provide withholding tax forms, especially across state or international lines. This modification introduces ambiguity and potential non-compliance.",

                "changed_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Intellectual Property Rights” may mean know-how, inventions, patents, patent rights, and registrations and applications, renewals, continuations and extensions thereof, select works of authorship and art, certain copyrightable materials and copyrights (including, but not limited to, titles, designs, themes, objects, characters, character names, stories, dialog, catch phrases, concepts, artwork, animation, sounds, musical compositions, graphics and visual elements, audio-visual effects and methods of operation, and any related documentation), copyright registrations and applications, renewals and extensions thereof, mask works, industrial rights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, trademark registrations and applications, renewals and extensions thereof, trade secrets, rights in trade dress and packaging, and all other forms of intellectual property and proprietary rights recognized by the U.S. laws, and other applicable foreign and international laws, treaties and conventions.",
                "explanation": "By including the word 'may' and removing 'publicity, personality and privacy rights, rights of attribution, paternity, integrity and other similarly afforded “moral” rights' it creates uncertainty about which specific rights are covered, directly conflicting with the comprehensive nature of standard intellectual property definitions and potentially rendering the clause unenforceable.

                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens the requirement for Licensee to secure full written assignments of rights from third-party contributors. Replacing 'shall' with 'may' and adding 'Licensee is encouraged' turns a mandatory obligation into a suggestion, which conflicts with copyright law regarding ownership of intellectual property and can affect the enforceability of the copyright.",

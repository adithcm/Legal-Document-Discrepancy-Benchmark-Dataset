                "original_text": "\"Invention\" means any idea, invention, discovery, know-how, data, work of authorship, information, improvement, technology, process, concept or material, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or protectable as a trade secret, and whether or not reduced to practice or memorialized in writing.",
                "changed_text": "\"Invention\" means any idea, invention, discovery, know-how, data, work of authorship, information, improvement, technology, process, concept or material that is patentable, copyrightable or protectable as a trade secret, and reduced to practice or memorialized in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original definition includes any idea, whether or not patentable. The modified definition limits it to ideas that are patentable or protectable as a trade secret and reduces practice, contradicting the broader scope typically afforded to \"invention\" in intellectual property law.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'improvement' with 'significant advancement' elevates the standard for what qualifies as Improved Conformis Background IP.

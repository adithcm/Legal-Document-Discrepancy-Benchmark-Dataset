                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, the Funds’ shares may be sold by broker-dealers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) but registration with\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) is optional; and\nWHEREAS, the Distributor wishes to retain S2K, through registered representatives of S2K (“Authorized S2K Representatives”), to\nintroduce the Funds to unregistered representatives of broker-dealers and registered investment advisers located at the financial institutions (each, an\n“Intermediary” and collectively, “Intermediaries”) that may have customers interested in investing in a Fund.",
                "explanation": "The original text states shares may be sold by broker-dealers registered with the SEC and FINRA, but the modified text creates a contradiction stating that FINRA registration is optional. This is a misaligned terminology contradiction because FINRA registration is not optional for broker-dealers under US securities laws. The second change replaces 'registered representatives' with 'unregistered representatives' which contradicts the regulatory requirements for selling securities.",

                "explanation": "The modified text contradicts the legal requirement for broker-dealers to be registered with both the SEC and FINRA. By stating that registration may or may not be necessary and making FINRA registration discretionary, the contract deviates from established securities regulations.",

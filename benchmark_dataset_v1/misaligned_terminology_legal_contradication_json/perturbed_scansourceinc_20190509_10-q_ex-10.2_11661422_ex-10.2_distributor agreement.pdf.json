Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor’s inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties.",

Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor’s inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore may, at its sole discretion, replenish the stock to an amount it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies a mutual agreement on the replenishment amount, while the modified text gives Xplore sole discretion. This contradicts the principle of mutual agreement in contract law, creating uncertainty about the terms of replenishment and potentially violating good faith dealing requirements.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Distribution Agreement, and unless notified by Xplore otherwise, shipping terms for Xplore Products will be Delivery Duty Paid (DDP) INCOTERMS® 2010, whereby Distributor’s price, includes all costs of delivery, insurance, import and / or export duties and tariffs. Such prices are exclusive of all federal, state, municipal or other government excise, sales, use, occupational or like taxes in force, and any such taxes shall be assumed and paid for by Distributor in addition to its payment for the Xplore Products.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Distribution Agreement, and unless notified by Xplore otherwise, shipping terms for Xplore Products may be determined at Xplore's convenience. Such prices are exclusive of all federal, state, municipal or other government excise, sales, use, occupational or like taxes in force, and any such taxes shall be assumed and paid for by Distributor in addition to its payment for the Xplore Products.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'Delivery Duty Paid (DDP) INCOTERMS® 2010,' a clearly defined term, while the modified text replaces it with 'may be determined at Xplore's convenience,' making the shipping terms vague and uncertain. This contradicts the principle of clear and definite terms in contract law. The modification makes shipping costs unpredictable.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that title and risk of loss pass to the Distributor upon delivery. The modified text gives Xplore the power to determine who receives title and risk of loss. This creates a contradiction by making the transfer of ownership ambiguous and dependent on Xplore's decision, which could violate standard commercial practices.",

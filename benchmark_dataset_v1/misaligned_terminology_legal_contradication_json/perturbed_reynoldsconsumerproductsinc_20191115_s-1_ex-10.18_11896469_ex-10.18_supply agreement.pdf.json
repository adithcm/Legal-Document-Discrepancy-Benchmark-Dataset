This Agreement will apply to all products sold by Seller to Buyer, and all products purchased by Buyer from Seller, during the Term unless the Parties expressly agree that this Agreement will not apply to a particular type of transaction in a separate written document signed by an officer of each Party. This Agreement will not require Seller to sell any type or quantity of a product to Buyer, nor will this Agreement required Buyer to purchase any type or quantity of a product from Seller, except as expressly provided by the Parties in a Purchase Schedule. The phrase “Purchase Schedule” will mean a written supplement to this Agreement signed by an officer of each Party which references this Agreement and which identities, among other terms and conditions, the specific types and quantities of products that will be purchased and sold by the Parties on terms and conditions in the schedule, the specifications for the identified products, the duration of the commitment period during which the Parties will be obligated to purchase and sell the identified products on the terms and conditions in the schedule, the prices of the identified products, any mechanisms for adjusting the prices of the identified products over the commitment period, and the facilities at which the identified products will be manufactured, stored and delivered by Seller.",

                "explanation": "The original clause disclaims all representations and warranties, which is common in commercial agreements to limit liability. The modification changes the disclaimers into acceptances. It states that each party 'accepts all representations and warranties', 'relies on' the other party's representations, and 'agrees' that their claims may be based on these representations. This fundamentally changes the nature of the agreement and makes it unclear what the actual liabilities and responsibilities are.",

In contrast to the original version, the last sentence in the changed version specifies that 'A Party will be considered an agent of the other Party.'

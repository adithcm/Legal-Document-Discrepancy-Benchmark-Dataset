                "original_text": "(a) Exclusive Appointment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Distributor Agreement, Company hereby appoints and grants Distributor the exclusive right to sell and distribute the Products to customers that Distributor introduce and confirmed by Company, (in all territory of United State of America (USA) and to render other services as a distributor for Company as set forth herein. Distributor shall limit its activities with respect to the Products to Customers located within the Territory and refrain from selling or otherwise transferring, directly or indirectly, the Products to any person outside the Territory, without the express written consent of Company. Company shall not sell or otherwise supply, directly or indirectly, the Products to any Distributor’s Customer’s, except by sale through the Distributor. The Company shall not contact any of Distributor’s Customer’s for any reason, without the prior written approval of Distributor.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Non-Exclusive Appointment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Distributor Agreement, Company hereby appoints and grants Distributor the non-exclusive right to sell and distribute the Products to customers that Distributor introduce, whether or not confirmed by Company, in all territory of United State of America (USA) and to render other services as a distributor for Company as set forth herein. Distributor shall not limit its activities with respect to the Products to Customers located within the Territory and may sell or otherwise transfer, directly or indirectly, the Products to any person outside the Territory, without any consent of Company. Company may sell or otherwise supply, directly or indirectly, the Products to any Distributor’s Customer’s, without sale through the Distributor. The Company may contact any of Distributor’s Customer’s for any reason, without any approval of Distributor.",
                "explanation": "The contract initially grants an 'exclusive right' to the distributor, which typically means the company cannot sell to customers introduced by the distributor. Changing this to 'non-exclusive' and removing the confirmation clause contradicts the initial intention and introduces ambiguity. Additionally, removing the need for the Company to receive Distributor's permission to contact the Distributor's Customers also flies in the face of an exclusive deal for the Distributor. This significantly alters the nature of the agreement and could lead to disputes over sales territories and customer ownership.",

Distributor is an independent contractor and is not and shall not be deemed to be an employee, legal representative, dealer, general agent, joint venture or partner of Company for any purpose. Distributor acknowledges that Company has not granted it any authority to make changes to Company’s terms and conditions of sale, grant any warranties in excess of those extended by Company or limit its liabilities or remedies less than Company limits its liabilities and remedies, sign quotations, incur obligations (expressed or implied), or in general enter into contracts on behalf of Company or bind Company in any transaction with customers, governmental agencies or third parties.",

                "explanation": "The contract initially states that the 'Distributor is an independent contractor.' Changing this to 'Distributor is an employee' creates a direct contradiction, and also grants the Distributor permissions that are antithetical to that of an independent contractor. This misclassification has significant legal implications for tax, liability, and employment law compliance. The additional powers and permissions granted to the now-employee Distributor in the revised language further exacerbate the legal problems.",

This Agreement is a contract under the laws of the State of California and for all purposes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Delaware, with full regard to its principles of conflicts of laws provisions.",
                "explanation": "The original contract specifies that Florida law governs the agreement. Changing this to Delaware law, while specifying that California law determines that it is Delaware's law, creates ambiguity and conflict. Selecting Delaware Law when the contract states it is in accordance with California's principles of conflicts of laws, generates uncertainty, and depending on the specific issue, could lead to different legal outcomes. This shift introduces significant legal uncertainty.",

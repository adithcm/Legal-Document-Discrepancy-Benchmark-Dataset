The terms “License Term”, “Licensed Rights”, and “Licensed Territory” shall have the meaning specified in the Deal Terms above, which such Deal Terms are part of this Agreement and are hereby incorporated herein by reference. As used in this Agreement and this license, the term “Distribute” includes, but is not limited to, any and all License Rights specified in the Deal Terms, all rights of distribution, the right to copy and reproduce the Program, the right to create derivative works of the Program for the purpose of creating branding elements and short form promotional materials (“Promotional Works”), the right to sell copies, the right to import and export the Program and the Promotional Works, the right to display the Program and Promotional Works publicity, the right to transmit the Program and Promotional Works through any transmission or delivery method that exists today, or that is created in the future, to any number of devices or users, including transmission through simultaneous delivery or streaming, and the right to sublicense and/or assign some or all of these rights to others.",

The terms “License Term”, “Licensed Rights”, and “Licensed Territory” shall have the meaning specified in the Deal Terms above, which such Deal Terms are part of this Agreement and are hereby incorporated herein by reference. As used in this Agreement and this license, the term “Distribute” includes, but is not limited to, only some License Rights specified in the Deal Terms, including the right to display the Program and Promotional Works publicity, the right to transmit the Program and Promotional Works through any transmission or delivery method that exists today. It does NOT include the right to copy and reproduce the Program, the right to create derivative works of the Program for the purpose of creating branding elements and short form promotional materials (“Promotional Works”), the right to sell copies, the right to import and export the Program and the Promotional Works, the right to transmit the Program and Promotional Works through any transmission or delivery method that exists today, or that is created in the future, to any number of devices or users, including transmission through simultaneous delivery or streaming, and the right to sublicense and/or assign some or all of these rights to others.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the term 'Distribute' to 'Showcase' but retains the original definition of 'Distribute' in one section while restricting it in another, creating conflicting interpretations. The definition of 'Distribute' is narrowed, contradicting the broader rights initially granted, such as reproduction and sublicensing. This creates legal uncertainty as to the scope of ConvergTV's rights.",

                "explanation": "The term 'indemnify, defend and hold harmless' is replaced with 'reimburse'. Reimbursement typically only covers direct costs, while indemnification covers a much broader range of potential losses. The phrase 'all costs, expenses and damages' is changed to 'some costs, some expenses and damages' introduces ambiguity as to which costs and expenses are covered, and the phrase \"alleged breach\" is replaced with \"confirmed breach\". This misaligns the contractual obligation with standard legal definitions of indemnification. 'Confirmed breach' will take longer to be verified and is more restrictive, and who \"confirms\" it.",

                "original_text": "All questions with respect to the construction of this Agreement, and the rights and liabilities of the Parties hereto, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida. The Parties also agree that the venue for this Agreement shall be in the County of Brevard, Florida. The Parties expressly waive any claim to jurisdiction in any federal or other state forum or venue in any other county or place. In the event of any controversy, claim or dispute between the Parties hereto, including, but not limited to, any action at law or in equity, including any action for declaratory or injunctive relief, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover from the losing Party all of his or her actual attorney's fees and costs in bringing, prosecuting, or defending said action.",
                "changed_text": "All questions with respect to the interpretation of this Agreement, and the rights and liabilities of the Parties hereto, shall be subjected to negotiation. The Parties agree that the venue for this Agreement shall be anywhere convenient to ConvergTV. In the event of any controversy, claim or dispute between the Parties hereto, including, but not limited to, any action at law or in equity, including any action for declaratory or injunctive relief, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, the prevailing Party may be able to recover from the losing Party some of his or her possible attorney's fees and costs in bringing, prosecuting, or defending said action.",
                "explanation": "This modifies the governing law and dispute resolution clause, replacing 'construction of this Agreement, and the rights and liabilities of the Parties hereto, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida' with 'interpretation of this Agreement, and the rights and liabilities of the Parties hereto, shall be subjected to negotiation'. This negates the principle that contractual disputes are decided in courtrooms. Further, it turns into a negotiation (as opposed to a ruling by an arbitrator or judge). The term 'prevailing party shall be entitled to recover' with 'prevailing Party may be able to recover' makes the recovery of attorney's fees discretionary rather than a right, contradicting standard legal practice where fee-shifting is often mandated for certain types of claims.",

                "original_text": "1.24 “Commercialization” means any and all pre-launch, launch and post-launch activities related to the marketing, promoting, distributing (to Third Parties), offering for sale and selling a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory. For clarity, Commercialization does not include Development and/or Manufacturing of a Licensed Product. When used as a verb, “Commercialize” means to engage in Commercialization.",
                "changed_text": "1.24 “Commercialization” means selected activities for a limited time, such as marketing and promotion, but excludes the full scope of distribution and continuous sales efforts of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory. For clarity, Commercialization does not include Development and/or Manufacturing of a Licensed Product. When used as a verb, “Commercialize” means to engage in Commercialization.",
                "explanation": "By narrowing the scope of 'Commercialization', it now contradicts standard business practices and potentially relevant regulations concerning pharmaceutical product launches and lifecycle management. This definition implies only certain activities are covered instead of a full product lifecycle approach.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates standard interpretations in pharmaceutical law and business practices concerning product commercialization.",

                "original_text": "1.26 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means: (a) with respect to the efforts to be expended, or considerations to be undertaken, by a Party or its Affiliate with respect to any objective, activity or decision to be undertaken hereunder, reasonable, good faith efforts to accomplish such objective, activity or decision as such Party would normally use to accomplish a similar objective, activity or decision under similar circumstances; and (b) with respect to Development and Commercialization of any Licensed Product for any indication by a Party, efforts and resources consistent with those efforts and resources commonly used by a similarly situated biotechnology company with respect to a product owned by it or to which it has similar rights, which product is at a similar stage in its development or product life and is of similar market potential taking into account (i) the patent and other proprietary position of the Licensed Product and (ii) the anticipated profitability of the Licensed Product.",
                "changed_text": "1.26 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means: (a) with respect to the efforts to be expended, or considerations to be undertaken, by a Party or its Affiliate with respect to any objective, activity or decision to be undertaken hereunder, minimal efforts to simply meet the basic legal requirements. (b) with respect to Development and Commercialization of any Licensed Product for any indication by a Party, efforts and resources deemed adequate by the party, without regard to industry standards, product life cycle, or market potential. The only factors to consider are (i) the ease of obtaining patent and other proprietary position of the Licensed Product and (ii) the initial investment of the Licensed Product.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' significantly lowers the standard required of the parties. It focuses on minimal legal compliance and disregards industry standards and market potential, which contradicts standard interpretations of this term in contract law. By removing the 'good faith' clause and the reference to similarly situated companies, it creates ambiguity about the true extent of the obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contradicts generally accepted principles of contract law regarding the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "1.53 “Force Majeure” means any minor inconvenience that the affected Party deems significant enough to affect its performance of its obligations, even if preventable, except payment obligations, under this Agreement, including but not limited to traffic delays, minor equipment malfunctions, or personnel shortages.",
                "explanation": "This modification broadens the definition of 'Force Majeure' to include minor, easily preventable events, conflicting with the legal standard that requires the event to be unforeseeable and beyond the party's control. It introduces uncertainty as a party could potentially claim a 'Force Majeure' event for trivial reasons, making contract enforcement unpredictable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Conflicts with the established legal definition of Force Majeure, which requires an event to be extraordinary and unforeseeable.",

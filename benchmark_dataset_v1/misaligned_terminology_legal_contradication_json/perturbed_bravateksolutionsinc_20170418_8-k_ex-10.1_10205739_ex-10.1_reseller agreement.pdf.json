                "changed_text": "9. Relationship of Parties. The parties hereto expressly understand and agree that each party is a worker in the performance of each and every part of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractor' to 'worker' creates ambiguity. While the contract intends to establish an independent contractor relationship (avoiding employer responsibilities), some jurisdictions have specific definitions of 'worker' that might blur the lines and imply certain employment rights, thus contradicting the intended independent contractor status.",

                "explanation": "By replacing specific, legally definable deductions (like taxes and refunds) with 'discretionary deductions', the definition of 'Net Revenue' becomes vague. This can lead to disputes over commission calculations, as the company could arbitrarily reduce the 'Net Revenue,' contradicting standard business practices and potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall indemnify' to 'may indemnify' and specifying 'attorneys’ fees at Company's discretion' alters the obligatory nature of indemnification. Standard indemnification clauses provide a guaranteed right to defense and coverage under specific circumstances. By making it discretionary, the clause becomes unenforceable and contradicts the typical understanding of indemnification under commercial law, leaving the Reseller without assured protection against defined liabilities.",

                "explanation": "The change from “Minimum Annual Order Volume (MAOV)” which implies a legal obligation to “Recommended Annual Order Volume (RAOV)” changes the nature of the commitment from mandatory to advisory. Also, changing the wording 'shall be required' to 'endeavor to purchase' makes this volume not obligatory. In addition, changing the wording 'will be required to purchase' to 'may purchase' makes the annual amount of units to not obligatory as well.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - specifically relating to the enforceability of agreements based on clear obligations. Changing “shall” to “may” undermines the obligatory nature of the agreement.",

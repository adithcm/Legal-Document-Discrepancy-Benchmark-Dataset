                "original_text": "Company understands that as a not-for-profit charitable organization Association cannot promote or endorse Company’s products or services, either explicitly or implicitly. The Association may require that a disclaimer stating that Company’s participation in this Agreement does not convey or imply the Association's approval, endorsement, certification, acceptance, or referral of any product or service of Company.",
                "changed_text": "Company understands that as a not-for-profit charitable organization Association is generally discouraged from promoting or endorsing Company’s products or services, either explicitly or implicitly. The Association is under no obligation to provide a disclaimer stating that Company’s participation in this Agreement does not convey or imply the Association's approval, endorsement, certification, acceptance, or referral of any product or service of Company.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'cannot' with 'is generally discouraged from' and removing the mandatory nature of the disclaimer, this change introduces uncertainty regarding the Association's obligations to remain impartial. This contradicts established principles for non-profit organizations, which require them to maintain independence to avoid jeopardizing their tax-exempt status.",

The insurance shall be in an amount of: $2,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate with a $2,000,000 aggregate for products and completed operations. The Association must be a named additional insured, and shall be provided at least 30 days’ notice for cancellation of policy and 10 days’ notice for non-payment of premium. Such insurance shall be primary and non-contributory.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, and before any sponsorship or promotional activities are conducted under this Agreement, Company shall obtain Commercial General Liability Insurance. The insurance shall be in an amount deemed adequate by the Company's risk management department. The Association may request to be a named additional insured. The Company shall provide reasonable notice for cancellation of policy.",
                "explanation": "By removing specific requirements such as the Best's rating, the exact amounts of insurance, and the mandatory nature of the Association being named as an additional insured, this modification introduces ambiguity and contradicts standard risk management practices. The term 'reasonable notice' is also vague and legally contestable compared to the original defined notice periods.",

                "explanation": "This change undermines the original assurance of non-discrimination. By using hedging language like 'generally attempts to comply' and introducing the possibility of exclusion based on 'specific role requirements,' the company creates a loophole that could contradict anti-discrimination laws. The original clause provided a clear commitment, which this version weakens significantly.",

                "original_text": "Business Day: a day (other than a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday in Australia) when banks in Sydney are open for business.",
                "changed_text": "Business Day: Any day of the week, including Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays, regardless of bank operating hours.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Business Day' adheres to a standard definition linked to banking operations in Sydney. The modified definition directly contradicts this by including all days of the week, regardless of whether banks are open. This creates confusion and potential disputes regarding deadlines and obligations tied to 'Business Days' under the contract, particularly concerning payment terms (clause 5.3) and notice periods (clause 20.2).",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - Ambiguity and Interpretation; potentially conflicts with standard business practices and legal interpretations of 'business day'.",

                "changed_text": "Products: Products may be products that are similar or dissimilar, as the supplier deems fit for the distributor.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Products' originally has a defined scope via reference to Schedule 1 and written notice. The change removes the schedule completely and adds the ability for any products to be considered product. This creates confusion around the scope of the agreement. This introduces ambiguity regarding the distributor's rights and obligations, conflicting with standard contract interpretation principles which require clarity on essential terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - Essential Terms; Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) - Scope of Agreement.",

                "original_text": "Term: the term of this agreement, as determined in accordance with clause 11.",
                "changed_text": "Term: The agreement shall be from month to month unless the parties state otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Term' clearly links to Clause 11, which provides specifics on duration and termination. The modified definition introduces an automatic month-to-month renewal unless otherwise stated, which is in conflict with the requirements under clause 11. This creates uncertainty regarding the contract's duration, potentially leading to disputes over termination rights and obligations. It contradicts the detailed termination clauses outlined in the agreement, and can also be disputed with state laws regarding month-to-month agreements.",

Even though the parties will be\n                  joint ventureres as to the AMR market, neither party will have\n                  the right to bind the other in any way without the other\n                  party's express consent, and this Agreement shall not\n                  otherwise be construed to make any party the agent, assignee,\n                  employee,\n                  fiduciary, investor, joint venturer, partner, or\n                  representative of any other party.",
                "changed_text": "4.1 The parties will be joint venturers with shared control and shared liability for all activities described in section 3 above; otherwise they shall operate with separate accounts, maintaining individual discretion over aspects of work performed under distinct agreements. As joint venturers in the AMR market, each party has the authority to represent and bind the other within reasonable limits as understood in general commercial practices. This agreement designates both parties as joint venturers for the purposes of Section 3.",
                "explanation": "The original clause attempts to define a limited joint venture while simultaneously denying typical joint venture rights and liabilities. The modified clause contradicts this by asserting a broad joint venture relationship with the authority to bind each other, thus creating conflict in how the law would interpret the parties' responsibilities and potential liabilities.",

Such expenses can include any type of expenditure, and shall be determined by each party without needing approval from the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original contract bases 'Net Proceeds' on 'Production Costs', defined as 'actual cost'. The change replaces this with 'Discretionary Expenses', which are at each party's discretion. This could violate contract law principles because it introduces a subjective element in calculating profits and undermines the definition of Net Proceeds which is objective.",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the initial agreement to 'jointly pursue' the AMR market, replacing it with 'independently pursue'.

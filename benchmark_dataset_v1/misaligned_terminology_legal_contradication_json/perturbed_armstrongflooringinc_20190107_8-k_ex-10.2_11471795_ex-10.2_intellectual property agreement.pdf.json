                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Know-How\" includes 'trade secrets' and 'confidential information,' which have specific legal protections. The modified definition removes these protections by stating Know-How is 'generally known,' directly contradicting the established legal understanding that Know-How involves confidential information. This creates uncertainty in enforcing confidentiality agreements.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Arizona hereby grants to the Company a limited, non- exclusive, royalty-free, non-sublicensable (except as set forth in Section 7.1), non-assignable license in, to and under the Arizona Licensed Trademarks for the Arizona Trademark License Term for use in the Company Field throughout the world only in the form and manner that such Arizona Licensed Trademarks are used in the Business as of the Closing, provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to present the Arizona Licensed Trademarks in the form set forth on Schedule 6.1.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Arizona hereby grants to the Company a unlimited, exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable (except as set forth in Section 7.1), assignable license in, to and under the Arizona Licensed Trademarks for the Arizona Trademark License Term for use in the Company Field throughout the world in any form and manner.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the license is 'limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-assignable' and restricts the form and manner of use. The modified text directly contradicts these limitations by making the license 'unlimited, exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, and assignable' and removing restrictions on the form and manner of use. This complete reversal creates a legal contradiction regarding the scope and terms of the trademark license.",

The Buyer Entities acknowledge and agree that (a) Arizona and its Affiliates retain temporary ownership of the Arizona Licensed IP (other than the Arizona Licensed Trademarks), (b) AWI Licensing LLC retains temporary ownership of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks, (b) the Company, nor its Affiliates or its Sublicensees, will eventually acquire ownership rights in the Arizona Licensed IP, and (c) the Company shall represent or make any claim that it has an eventual ownership interest in any Arizona Licensed IP.

                "explanation": "The original section explicitly states Arizona retains ownership and the Company gains no ownership rights. The modified version implies that the Company will eventually gain ownership rights, contradicting the initial agreement. It allows the Company to take actions adverse to Arizona's ownership, which is directly conflicting. The terms 'temporary' and 'eventual' are ambiguous and create legal uncertainty.",

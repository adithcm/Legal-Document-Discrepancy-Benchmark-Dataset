                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Distributor is an independent contractor and nothing contained in this agreement shall be deemed or interpreted to constitute the Distributor as a partner or employee of the Principal, nor shall either party have any authority to bind the other in any respect, it being understood and agreed that all orders submitted by the Distributor are subject to acceptance by Principal in its sole discretion.",
                "changed_text": "The Distributor is an independent contractor; however, for tax purposes and compliance with certain regulations, the Distributor may be treated as an employee of the Principal. Either party shall have the authority to bind the other in matters directly related to product sales, and all orders submitted by the Distributor are deemed accepted unless explicitly rejected by the Principal within 72 hours.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the established definition of 'independent contractor.' By stating the distributor 'may be treated as an employee' for certain purposes, it blurs the legal distinction and creates uncertainty about the distributor's classification. The added authority to bind the principal and the automatic acceptance of orders further erode the independent contractor status.",
                "contradicted_law": "IRS guidelines for independent contractor classification, state labor laws regarding employee vs. contractor status.",

The Products are described on Exhibit A to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Principal appoints the Distributor as the primary distributor, to sell Principal’s qPCR infectious disease kits, Logix Smart COVID-19 PCR diagnostic test and Co-Dx Box™ instrument (the “Products”). The Products are samples and are for testing purposes only.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'non-exclusive' to 'primary distributor' implies a level of exclusivity that the contract doesn't explicitly grant, which could lead to disputes. Also, the Products' definition has changed. Originally, the Products could be sold. In this modified text, the products are testing materials, so can't be sold.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law regarding exclusivity and product usage.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be interpreted under the guidance of general business ethics and fairness, superseding any specific state laws or conflict of law principles.",
                "explanation": "By replacing Texas law with 'general business ethics,' the enforceability of the contract is significantly weakened. Legal interpretations are removed and replaced with a subjective understanding, which contradicts established legal standards. This causes uncertainty in the actual enforcement of the agreement since general business ethics is not a codified body of law.",

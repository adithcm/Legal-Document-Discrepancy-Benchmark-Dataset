                "explanation": "Changing 'products' to 'goods' introduces ambiguity. While 'products' typically refers to manufactured items, 'goods' is broader under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), potentially including raw materials or items not yet processed. This discrepancy could create disputes over what Heritage is obligated to produce and what Premier is obligated to accept.",

                "changed_text": "All deliverables created, packaged and delivered by Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement shall conform to the general guidelines provided to Heritage by Premier, which guidelines may from time to time be altered by Premier’s discretion (the “Specifications”), shall endeavor to align with Post Holding’s Quality Expectations Manual attached hereto as Schedule E, and shall attempt to conform in all practical aspects to samples previously supplied to Premier by Heritage.",
                "explanation": "Replacing “Products” with “deliverables”, 'specifications' with 'general guidelines', 'modified in writing' with 'altered by Premier's discretion', 'shall conform' to 'endeavor to align with', and 'shall conform' to 'attempt to conform', weakens the obligation for Heritage to adhere to strict standards. 'Deliverables' is much broader and more vague than 'Products', and 'general guidelines' gives Premier more latitude in unilaterally changing the requirements without a written modification. The change from 'shall conform' to 'endeavor to align' makes the quality standards more aspirational than obligatory, which introduces uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "By changing mandatory language ('shall purchase') to permissive language ('may procure'), the obligation for Heritage to provide certain materials is removed. Moreover, stating that Heritage 'may purchase extra materials' contradicts basic contract law because now the amount of materials Heritage procures is unbounded, in contradiction of the original text.",

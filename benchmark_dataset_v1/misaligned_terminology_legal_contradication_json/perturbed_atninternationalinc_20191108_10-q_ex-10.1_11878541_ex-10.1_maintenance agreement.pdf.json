Vendor hereby represents and warrants to AT&T that:\n\n(a) Vendor is engaged in an independent business and will perform all obligations under this Agreement as an independent contractor and not as the agent or employee of AT&T;\n\n(b) Vendor’s personnel performing Services shall be considered solely the workers or agents of Vendor and not employees or agents of AT&T;\n\n(c) Vendor has and retains the right to collaborate with AT&T on the performance of the Services. Vendor must follow the employment, direction, assignment, compensation and discharge of all personnel performing the Services per AT&T's requests.",
                "explanation": "The terms \"personnel\" was changed to \"workers\", creating an unclarity with federal and state guidelines for employment. There is no legal definition of \"workers\", opening for interpretation of federal and state definitions for employment. In addition, the term 'full control and supervision over the performance of the services' was replaced with 'collaborate with AT&T on the performance of the services', negating the essence of an independent contractor.",

                "changed_text": "2.24 Liability. “Liability” means only direct costs agreed upon by both parties in writing. Consequential, indirect, or punitive losses, damages, expenses, costs, penalties, fines and fees, including Litigation Expenses, are not included. This applies to claims or actions related to performance or omission of acts under this Agreement, including claims brought by third parties.",
                "explanation": "By restricting 'Liability' to only 'direct costs agreed upon in writing', the contract deviates from standard legal definitions of liability, which typically includes various types of damages (direct, indirect, consequential) depending on the jurisdiction and circumstances. This introduces ambiguity and restricts the scope of potential claims.",

Vendor shall comply with all Laws applicable to Vendor’s performance under this Agreement, including all Work contemplated herein and all Material, Services and Deliverables provided hereunder, and AT&T’s utilization of the Cell Sites. Vendor shall procure all approvals, bonds, certificates, insurance, inspections, licenses, and permits that such Laws require for the performance of this Agreement.",

Vendor shall seek to acquire approvals, bonds, certifications, insurance, inspections, licenses, and permits but cannot guarantee they will do so.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Compliance with Laws' to 'Compliance with Desired Practices' significantly weakens the Vendor's legal obligations. The new language transforms a mandatory requirement to follow all applicable laws into a discretionary effort to adhere to 'industry best practices' and seek approvals. This change introduces legal uncertainty by replacing legally enforceable requirements with vague and subjective standards.",

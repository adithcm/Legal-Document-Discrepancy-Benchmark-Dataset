                "original_text": "Integrity will obtain master lease and print agreements with all third party owners of masters embodied in the Product at its own expense. Mechanical rates will not exceed [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the then-current statutory rate, and Print licenses will not exceed a prorated portion of [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the retail selling price, Integrity will also manufacture the Product and sell to TL its requirements for resale.",
                "changed_text": "Integrity will obtain master lease and print agreements with all third party owners of masters embodied in the Product at its own expense. Mechanical rates will be at Integrityâ€™s discretion, and Print licenses will be determined by market conditions, Integrity will also manufacture the Product and sell to TL its requirements for resale.",
                "explanation": "By removing the defined limitations on mechanical and print license rates, the clause contradicts standard copyright law practice and creates uncertainty. The original text clearly defines rates based on statutory guidelines, while the altered text gives Integrity arbitrary control. This is not only conflicting but it also opens the door for legal disputes. This would violate copyright law where royalty rates are more clearly defined.",

                "changed_text": "TL may purchase from Integrity limited quantities of the Product for its promotional use, at a mutually agreeable cost. There is no specific limit on the amount TL can purchase. TL warrants that any units so purchased, whether or not labeled \"promotional only\" or cut-out, will be used at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific quantity limit (7% of royalty-bearing units) and the fixed manufacturing cost, and also removing the specific use case, the modified text introduces ambiguity and contradicts the original intent. The altered text gives TL unchecked control over product purchases and usages. This creates a conflict in contract provisions related to product distribution and royalty calculations. Without limitations, TL has the ability to resell promotional units, which directly violates established royalty agreements.",

The venue for any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or breach thereof, shall be determined by mutual agreement at the time of dispute.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific jurisdiction (Tennessee) and stating that the agreement will be interpreted based on 'principles of equity and fairness' rather than state laws, the modified text contradicts standard contract law. Contract law requires specificity regarding governing law and venue. Introducing ambiguity on which jurisdiction is overseeing the contract would make it unenforcable.",

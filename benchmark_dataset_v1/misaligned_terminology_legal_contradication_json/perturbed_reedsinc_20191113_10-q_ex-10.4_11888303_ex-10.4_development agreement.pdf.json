                "original_text": "(a) “Applicable Laws and Regulations” shall mean any law, statute, rule, regulation, ordinance or other binding pronouncements\nof any duly authorized court, tribunal, arbitrator, agency, commission, official or other instrumentality of any federal, state, province, county, city or\nother political subdivision (domestic or foreign) having the effect of law in the United States, any foreign country or territory or any domestic or\nforeign state, province, county, city or other political subdivision applicable to the Company or its business.",
                "changed_text": "(a) “Applicable Laws and Regulations” shall mean any suggestion, recommendation, rule, internal policy, or other non-binding pronouncements\nof any unauthorized entity, group, or organization within or outside the United States, including but not limited to opinions, advice, or interpretations that the Company chooses to adopt or disregard at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the standard definition of 'Applicable Laws and Regulations,' which refers to binding legal requirements. By redefining it as non-binding suggestions, the contract creates ambiguity regarding which rules the Company must follow. This could lead to disputes about compliance with actual laws and regulations.",

                "changed_text": "(b) Company may, at its convenience and without obligation, optionally inform the Development Committee about new Intellectual Property related to the Products or Product-specific production processes, whether developed solely by Company or jointly by the Company and Reed’s, this is not including any of the pre-existing Intellectual Property.",
                "explanation": "This change alters a mandatory disclosure obligation ('shall promptly disclose') to a discretionary action ('may optionally inform'). This is a contradiction because intellectual property law requires transparency in ownership and development. Changing 'shall' to 'may' would make it discretionary and uncertain.",

The Receiving Party shall disclose such information to third persons without\nthe prior written consent of the Disclosing Party if there is a reasonable motive. Receiving Party shall give access to the Confidential Information to any person that has a need to know the same and should advise such\nRepresentatives of, and hold them to, Receiving Party’s obligations under the terms of this Section 7.",
                "explanation": "Modifying 'shall hold in confidence' to 'should aspire to keep in confidence' significantly weakens the obligation. Changing 'shall not disclose' to allows them to disclose if they have a 'reasonable motive' directly contradicts confidentiality principles and allows for subjective interpretation. Modifying 'shall limit access' to 'shall give access' eliminates the restriction.",

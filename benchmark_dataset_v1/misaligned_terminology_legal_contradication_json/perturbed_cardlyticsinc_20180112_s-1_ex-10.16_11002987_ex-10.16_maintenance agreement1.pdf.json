                "original_text": "1.19\nError - an instance of failure of Software to be Operative. An Error is a Class 1 Error if it renders the Software unusable for its intended\npurpose. An Error is a Class 2 Error if the Software is still usable for its intended purpose, but such use is seriously inconvenient and the\nvalue to Bank of America of the use of the Software is substantially reduced. All other Errors are Class 3 Errors.",
                "changed_text": "1.19\nError - an instance of failure of Software to be Operative. An Error is a Class 1 Error if it renders the Software mostly unusable for its intended\npurpose. An Error is a Class 2 Error if the Software is still usable for its intended purpose, but such use is somewhat inconvenient. All other Errors are Class 3 Errors.",
                "explanation": "The definitions of Class 1 and Class 2 Errors were made more ambiguous by replacing 'unusable' with 'mostly unusable', 'seriously inconvenient' with 'somewhat inconvenient', leading to subjectivity and difficulty in determining the severity of errors. This creates a misalignment as the contract now uses vague terms that deviate from potentially more legally precise meanings of 'unusable' and 'seriously inconvenient.'",

                "explanation": "The term 'Error correction' was replaced with 'Error Patching', and 'online and on-site technical support' was replaced with 'occasional online and on-site technical support', and 'the provision of Updates' with 'the optional provision of Updates'. Error correction has a different meaning than Error Patching. Error patching may mean only providing a quick fix rather than a proper error correction. These modifications diminish Supplier's responsibility and make enforcement uncertain.",

                "explanation": "The language describing the handling of Class 3 errors was changed from 'shall correct the Errors by all reasonable means' to 'shall attempt to correct the Errors by some means'. Furthermore, 'shall correct the Errors and distribute the modified Software' was replaced with 'may correct the Errors and distribute the modified Software at their discretion'. These alterations replace definitive obligations with discretionary actions, creating uncertainty about the level of service to be provided and contradict legal expectations of diligent performance in service agreements.",

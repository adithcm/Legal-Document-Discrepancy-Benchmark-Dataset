                "original_text": "“Affiliate(s)” means any legal entity which, directly or indirectly, at the time in question, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the designated Party. For the purposes of this definition, “control” is defined as direct or indirect ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting interest or economic interest in the controlled entity or such other relationship whereby the controlling entity determines or has the right to determine the majority of the Board of Directors or an equivalent governing body of the controlled entity.",
                "changed_text": "“Affiliate(s)” means any legal entity which, directly or indirectly, at the time in question, has some association with the designated Party. For the purposes of this definition, “association” is defined as any relationship whereby the controlling entity determines or has the right to determine the minority of the Board of Directors or an equivalent governing body of the controlled entity.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' clearly defines 'control' as owning 50% or more of the voting interest. The modified definition replaces 'controls' with 'has some association with', and 'control' with 'any relationship', introducing ambiguity and contradicting standard legal definitions of affiliate relationships. This makes enforcement uncertain as it deviates from established legal thresholds for defining affiliates.",

                "changed_text": "“Background Information” in connection with a designated Party means any item the designated party deems to be related to this project, including but not limited to technical information, data, know-how, expertise, materials (including hardware, samples, models, algorithms, and software), calculations, innovations, inventions, discoveries, improvements, formulations, manufacturing techniques, equipment designs, methods, processes, and the like, of the designated Party or its Affiliates that is:\n(a)\tdeemed relevant by the designated party; and\n(b)\tclaimed as proprietary by the designated party.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Background Information' specifies clear criteria related to ownership, control, and development timeline. The modified definition broadens the scope using subjective terms like 'deems to be related' and 'deemed relevant' and 'claimed as proprietary', removing objective criteria and creating a conflict with standard IP law principles requiring clear identification and proof of ownership. This change leads to potential disputes over what constitutes background information and undermines enforceability.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly defines the relationship as 'independent contractors.' The modification introduces an exception ('unless circumstances require closer collaboration' and 'except where such a relationship improves project outcomes'), creating ambiguity and contradicting the initial clear statement. This could lead to misclassification issues under labor law, as it suggests potential scenarios where an employer-employee relationship might exist, despite the contract stating otherwise.",

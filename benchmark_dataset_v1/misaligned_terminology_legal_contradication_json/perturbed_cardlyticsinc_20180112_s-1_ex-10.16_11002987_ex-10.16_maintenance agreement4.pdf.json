                "original_text": "No-charge Maintenance Services shall be provided from the Delivery Date through the Warranty Period. The first paid (Initial) Maintenance Term shall commence upon expiration of the Warranty Period and shall continue for twelve (12) months thereafter. Thereafter, the Maintenance Term shall automatically renew for successive period, 12 months, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement unless Bank of America terminates Maintenance Services pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "No-charge Maintenance Services shall be provided from the Delivery Date through the Warranty Period. The first paid (Initial) General Support Term shall commence upon expiration of the Warranty Period and shall continue for twelve (12) months thereafter. Thereafter, the Maintenance Term shall automatically renew for successive period, 12 months, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement unless Bank of America terminates Maintenance Services pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Maintenance Term' with 'General Support Term' creates ambiguity because 'General Support Term' is not a defined term in the agreement, unlike Maintenance Term. This could lead to disputes about the scope and duration of the support services provided, especially if 'General Support' is interpreted differently than 'Maintenance Services'.",

                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding anything set forth elsewhere in this Agreement (or below), the Standard Support Period shall be normal business hours, excluding Bank of America holidays.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Maintenance Period' to 'Standard Support Period' and altering the availability from 24/7 to normal business hours creates a contradiction. The original clause guarantees continuous maintenance, while the modification limits it to standard business hours. This creates uncertainty about the level of support Bank of America is entitled to and conflicts with the initially agreed-upon intensive maintenance support.",

If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, Bank of America shall have the right to reinstate the Maintenance Services without paying any reinstatement fee.",
                "changed_text": "Bank of America may terminate Ongoing Assistance at their discretion. If Bank of America terminates the Ongoing Assistance, Bank of America may request to re-engage support with a re-engagement fee.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Maintenance Services' to 'Ongoing Assistance' and introducing a 're-engagement fee' creates a significant contradiction. The original clause explicitly allows reinstatement without a fee, while the modified clause introduces a fee. This conflicts with the original intent and could be challenged under contract law as a modification that requires additional consideration.",

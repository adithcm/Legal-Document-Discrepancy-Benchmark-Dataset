                "changed_text": "Licensee may develop any product that the Fox approves as Wireless Product related to “In Her Shoes”: one (1) 2-D casual-style puzzle game. (“IN HER SHOES Wireless Product”)",
                "explanation": "The term 'shall' creates a binding obligation to develop a specified 'Wireless Product.' Changing 'shall' to 'may' and adding 'any product that the Fox approves' gives Fox discretionary power and reduces Licensee's guaranteed rights. This contradicts standard contract law where 'shall' imposes a duty, thus, creating enforcement uncertainty.",

Licensee may recoup the Guarantee Forfeiture Payment (as defined in Paragraph 3 of this Amendment below) from the sales of the IN HER SHOES Wireless Product.",
                "explanation": "The original text says “There shall be no Individual Property Guarantee”, imposing a condition. The changed text introduces ambiguity and says “There can be an Individual Property Guarantee according to what the Fox says” which allows Fox to determine a guarantee that has previously been set for no guarantee. This contradicts the initial defined condition and creates uncertainty in obligation.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'all' with 'some' creates uncertainty about which Wireless Products are subject to Fox's distribution rights. Also, defining the distribution fee as a vague distribution fee introduces legal ambiguity as there would be no way to determine if there should be an additional distribution fee. The original text defined a specific paragraph, but is removed in the changed text.",

                "changed_text": "2.10 \"Improvement\" or \"Improvements\" means any alteration of a process or other technology described in a Patent, and any addition to Technical Information.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'modification' and 'alteration' are interchanged, and 'modification' and 'addition' are used instead of 'modification'. This creates ambiguity because 'alteration' is a broader and more vague term, while 'addition' would only mean adding, not changing anything.",

                "changed_text": "3.00 Company grants to Investor, for the duration of the Option Period, a worldwide, royalty-required, exclusive, revocable license (without the right to grant sublicenses) under the Patents to practice the methods therein described and claimed and to make and have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import products made using such methods, and to make basic changes, and to engage in any activity which would give rise to a claim of infringement (direct or indirect or otherwise) of one or more of the Patents in the absence of a license.",
                "explanation": "Several key terms are directly contradicted: 'royalty-free' becomes 'royalty-required,' 'non-exclusive' becomes 'exclusive,' and 'irrevocable' becomes 'revocable.' Further, the right to sublicense is removed, and the word 'Improvements' is replaced by 'basic changes'. These changes fundamentally alter the nature of the license granted, creating a contradiction with the original intent and standard definitions of these licensing terms under intellectual property law.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Improvement' is replaced with the ill-defined term 'Adjustment'. 'Irrevocable' is replaced with 'temporary,' and 'royalty-free' is replaced with 'royalty-bearing'. The term 'temporary' is vague and does not specify any kind of duration, and goes against the nature of patent rights.",

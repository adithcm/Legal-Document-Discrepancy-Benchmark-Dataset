                "explanation": "Changing \"Agreement\" to \"Understanding\" can introduce ambiguity. While both terms suggest a consensus, 'Agreement' has a stronger legal standing than 'Understanding'. This could affect the contract's enforceability, especially if one party later claims they only had an 'understanding' rather than a binding agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Agreement\" to \"Understanding\" and replacing \"shall prevail and govern\" with \"shall be interpreted according to the involved party's discretion\" creates significant uncertainty. The original text provides a clear hierarchy (the Amendment prevails). The changed text allows each party to interpret conflicting provisions as they see fit, undermining the contract's binding nature. Contract interpretation should generally be governed by objective standards rather than subjective discretion.",

                "changed_text": "Except as modified hereby, the parties acknowledge the Agreement and its potential provisions.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'ratified and confirmed' with 'acknowledge the Agreement and its potential provisions' significantly weakens the contractual commitment. 'Ratification and confirmation' imply a binding acceptance of the original terms. 'Acknowledging potential provisions' suggests a much weaker agreement, potentially allowing a party to later argue that they never fully agreed to specific terms.",

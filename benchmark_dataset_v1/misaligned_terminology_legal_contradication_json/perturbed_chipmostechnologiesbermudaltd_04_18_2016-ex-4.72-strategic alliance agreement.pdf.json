                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed according to principles of fairness.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the specific jurisdiction of Taiwan with 'principles of fairness' introduces ambiguity and contradicts established legal norms. Contract law relies on defined legal systems; 'fairness' is subjective and unenforceable, especially in international agreements. Taiwan law provides a predictable framework; 'fairness' does not.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party should consider providing assistance to, and may choose to cooperate with, the other Party, regarding this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text, uses the term 'reasonable best efforts' which is a legally recognized term with an understood set of obligations. Changing it to 'should consider' and 'may choose' introduces a contradiction. 'Reasonable best efforts' implies a commitment, where the changed text introduces optionality. This weakens the enforceability of the cooperation clause.",

However, the foregoing restriction shall not apply to disclosure made to the board of the directors, management team, and relevant employees who need to know such information, attorneys, accountants, financial counsel, and competent authorities for the purposes of performing this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties should aim to avoid disclosing information related to this Agreement to outside parties. However, this does not apply to internal staff or consultants, unless explicitly stated.",
                "explanation": "Replaced 'will not disclose' with 'should aim to avoid,' weakening the confidentiality clause and introducing optionality. Replaced specific roles (attorneys, accountants, etc) with 'internal staff or consultants, unless explicitly stated', making it ambiguous who is covered. This contradicts standard confidentiality practices and introduces uncertainty about who is bound by confidentiality.",

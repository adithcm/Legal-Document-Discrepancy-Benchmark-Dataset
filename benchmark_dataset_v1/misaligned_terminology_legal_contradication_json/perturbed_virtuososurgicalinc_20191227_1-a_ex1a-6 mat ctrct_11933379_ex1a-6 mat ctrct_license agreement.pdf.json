                "original_text": "“LICENSED PRODUCT(S)” as used herein in either singular or plural shall mean any material, compositions, or other product, the manufacture, use or sale of which would constitute, but for the license granted to Company pursuant to this Agreement, an infringement of a claim of PATENT RIGHT(S) (infringement shall include, but is not limited to, direct, contributory, or inducement to infringe).",
                "changed_text": "“LICENSED PRODUCT(S)” as used herein in either singular or plural shall mean any item, regardless of its potential infringement on any PATENT RIGHT(S). Infringement considerations are waived under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition ties the term 'LICENSED PRODUCT(S)' to potential patent infringement. The modified definition severs this link, stating that 'LICENSED PRODUCT(S)' encompasses any item irrespective of infringement, and waives infringement considerations. This creates a legal contradiction, as patent law explicitly addresses infringement, and the modified definition attempts to bypass this legal framework.",

                "changed_text": "2.7 “PATENT RIGHT(S)” shall mean, at Company's discretion, any intellectual property rights it deems relevant to the Licensed Field, regardless of whether those rights are formally patented or listed in EXHIBIT C. JHU retains ownership of the patents listed in Exhibit C; however, it relinquishes right of first refusal for enforcement against the Company for uses of such rights.",
                "explanation": "This change broadens the definition of 'PATENT RIGHT(S)' to include anything the Company considers relevant, even if it's not formally patented. This contradicts the established legal understanding of patent rights as those officially granted and registered. The added statement about JHU's relinquishing rights further muddies the waters by creating a situation where JHU technically owns the patents but can't necessarily enforce them against the licensee, thus contradicting its rights as a patent holder.",

Notwithstanding the above, JHU guarantees that there are no existing patent infringement claims.",
                "explanation": "Here, while maintaining the initial disclaimer, a contradictory statement is added guaranteeing no existing patent infringement claims. This directly conflicts with the initial disclaimer about JHU not warranting freedom from patent infringement.

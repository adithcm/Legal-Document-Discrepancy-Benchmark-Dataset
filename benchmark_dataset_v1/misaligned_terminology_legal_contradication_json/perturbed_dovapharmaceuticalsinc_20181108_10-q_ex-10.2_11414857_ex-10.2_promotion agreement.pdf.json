                "original_text": "Valeant shall direct to Dova any unsolicited requests for off-label medical information from health care professionals with respect to the Product promptly following receipt by Valeant (but in no event later than [***] after receipt). Dova shall, within [***] following receipt of any such request from Valeant, address any such requests directly.",
                "changed_text": "Valeant shall direct to Dova any unsolicited requests for off-label medical information from health care professionals with respect to the Product at their convenience. Dova may, at its convenience, address such requests through any channels it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a strict timeline and direct communication method for handling off-label medical information requests. Modifying 'promptly following receipt' to 'at their convenience' and replacing the direct addressing requirement with a discretionary method creates ambiguity. FDA guidelines require pharmaceutical companies to have clear procedures for handling unsolicited requests for off-label information, this change weakens that obligation.",

Such information may include data from the applicable reimbursement HUB, specialty data aggregator, market research, and market access contracting and Third Party-provided brand performance data ([***]). The timing of the delivery of such information shall be mutually agreed upon by the Parties, acting reasonably.",
                "changed_text": "Dova may, at its discretion, provide Valeant with data of its choosing. The provided data may or may not be relevant to the sale, commercialization, marketing, and promotion of the product. The provision and format of this data is purely at Dova's convenience.",
                "explanation": "This alteration changes a defined obligation to provide specific, mutually agreed upon data to a discretionary provision. The original text implies a collaborative exchange of information necessary for Valeant's activities. This is required as it concerns the scope of regulatory compliance. By making the data provision optional and unspecified, it jeopardizes transparency and makes it harder to assure promotional activities are regulatory-compliant.",

Valeant shall instruct the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing to, and will monitor the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing to ensure that such Field Force Personnel, limit their claims of efficacy and safety for the Product to those claims which are consistent with and do not exceed the Product Labeling and any Promotional Materials.",
                "changed_text": "Valeant will encourage the Field Force Personnel to use the Product Labeling and Product Materials approved by Dova. Valeant will, to a reasonable degree, make suggestions to its Field Force personnel that are engaged in Detailing to limit their claims of efficacy and safety for the Product to align with what they believe to be consistent with current clinical data.",
                "explanation": "The original text places a strict obligation on Valeant to ensure its Field Force Personnel use only approved materials and limit their claims to those within the approved labeling. The change weakens this to a 'suggestion' basis. By removing the strict 'shall' and replacing it with 'encourage' and 'reasonable degree,' the company can avoid being penalized for misleading claims as they may not directly instruct their field force personnel, but encourage them to do so.",

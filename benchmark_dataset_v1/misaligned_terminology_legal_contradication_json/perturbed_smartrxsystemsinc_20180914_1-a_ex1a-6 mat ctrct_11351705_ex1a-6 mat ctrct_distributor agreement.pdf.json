                "original_text": "Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. All references herein to sections of the Code shall include any\ncorresponding provision or provisions of succeeding law.",
                "changed_text": "Code means any set of guidelines or rules established by Smart RX Systems, Inc. All references herein to sections of the Code shall include any\ncorresponding provision or provisions established or modified by Smart RX Systems, Inc.",
                "explanation": "The modification redefines 'Code' to mean internal guidelines set by Smart RX Systems, Inc., conflicting with the established legal meaning of the Internal Revenue Code under US law. This creates uncertainty regarding the legal basis for financial and operational decisions referenced elsewhere in the contract.",

                "changed_text": "Territory shall mean primarily the state of Texas, USA, and potential distribution opportunities in other locations as arbitrarily determined by the Company. Florida may be included or excluded at the discretion of the Company.",
                "explanation": "The change alters the definition of 'Territory' to give the Company complete and arbitrary control over distribution rights outside of Texas. This contradicts the initial agreement granting exclusivity in Texas and creates uncertainty about the distributor's rights in other states, potentially violating contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms.",

The supplies costs are a flat fee of $0.75 per prescription filled). Operating costs\nexclude the cost of space and utilities.",
                "changed_text": "Operations Expense means any cost the Company deems necessary for the operation of the Pharmacy, including but not limited to wages, taxes, benefits, insurance, miscellaneous expenses, and other overhead. This may include space and utilities, if the Company sees fit.",
                "explanation": "The modification allows the Company to arbitrarily define what constitutes 'Operations Expense.' This conflicts with the original, more specific definition and could lead to disputes over the allocation of costs and the calculation of profits, especially concerning the exclusion of space and utilities.",

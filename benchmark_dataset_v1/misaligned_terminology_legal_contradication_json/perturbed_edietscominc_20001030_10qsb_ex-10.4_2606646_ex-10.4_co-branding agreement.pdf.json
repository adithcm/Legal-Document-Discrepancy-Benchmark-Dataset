                "original_text": "Confidential Information also includes proprietary or confidential information of any third party that may disclose such information to either party in the course of such party's business. Confidential Information may be disclosed in writing, in other tangible form, orally or visually.",
                "changed_text": "Confidential Information also includes proprietary or confidential information of any third party that may disclose such information to either party in the course of such party's business. Confidential Information will be disclosed only in writing and in no other form.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for Confidential Information to be disclosed in various forms, including orally. The modified text restricts this to only written form. This creates a contradiction because oral disclosures, which would normally be considered confidential, are now arguably excluded, leading to confusion about which disclosures are protected under the agreement's confidentiality provisions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by jurisdiction, but generally contradicts standard interpretations of trade secret and confidentiality laws which recognize that confidential information can be disclosed in various forms, not just writing.",

                "changed_text": "Each party represents and warrants to the other that: (a) such party has the full corporate right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and perform the acts required of it hereunder, (b) the execution of this Agreement by such party, and the performance by such party of its obligations and duties hereunder, may violate agreements to which such party is a party or by which it is bound, (c) when executed and delivered by such party, this Agreement will constitute the legal obligation of such party, regardless of its validity and enforceability and (d) such party will attempt to perform its obligations hereunder in compliance with applicable law and regulations.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'do not and will not violate' to 'may violate,' 'legal, valid and binding' to 'legal obligation, regardless of its validity and enforceability,' and 'will perform' to 'will attempt to perform,' the warranties are severely undermined. This contradiction creates uncertainty because the original text provides assurances that are crucial for a valid contract, whereas the modified text essentially admits the possibility of contractual breaches and non-compliance, undermining the foundational principle of the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles regarding warranties and representations; undermines the concept of a valid and enforceable contract.",

                "changed_text": "Any delay in or failure of performance by either party under this Agreement will be considered a breach of this Agreement but may be excused. Excuses for breach are solely at the discretion of the non-performing party. Events that are not considered beyond reasonable control of such party are, but not limited to, acts of God, power outages and governmental restrictions.",
                "explanation": "The original 'force majeure' clause provides specific instances excusing a breach due to circumstances beyond a party's control. The modified text first states the delay or failure *is* a breach, creating a contradiction. Then, it adds ambiguity by stating the excuse is at the discretion of the *non*-performing party, effectively eliminating the 'force majeure' protection since they would be unlikely to agree to be in breach. Finally, it states the events are *not* considered beyond reasonable control, creating ambiguity and negating accepted standards by reversing commonly accepted force majeure examples, which can be a violation of contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Standard interpretation of Force Majeure clauses; undermines the legal concept of 'impossibility of performance' or 'commercial impracticability'.",

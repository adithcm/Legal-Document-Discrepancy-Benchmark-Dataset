                "changed_text": "TERM: The rights granted hereunder shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2006 (the “Term”); provided, however, that with respect to each Property, including Robots, Kingdom of Heaven, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, In Her Shoes, Idiocracy (Oww My Balls) and Ice Age II, all right and licenses granted herein will continue in full force and effect until the earlier of March 31, 2008, or when Glu Mobile Inc. deems the content is no longer profitable.",
                "explanation": "The original contract specified a clear end date for the rights and licenses granted. By adding 'or when Glu Mobile Inc. deems the content is no longer profitable,' the definition of 'Term' becomes ambiguous and dependent on Glu Mobile Inc.'s subjective assessment of profitability. This introduces uncertainty, potentially conflicting with contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and definite contract terms; potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if profitability is used pretextually.",

                "explanation": "The original text designates 'General Counsel' as the point of contact for notices. Changing it to 'Any Available Employee' makes the responsible party vague. In some jurisdictions, particularly concerning legal notices, designating a specific individual or role is important for ensuring the notice is properly received and acknowledged. This change reduces the accountability and reliability of the notice provision.",

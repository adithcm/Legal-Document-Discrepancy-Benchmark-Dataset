CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers.",

CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims which the Buyers, at their sole discretion, deem valid, the Buyers, without any Inspection Certificate requirement, have the option to request replacement goods with prior notification, or accept the goods as is. All expenses are subject to negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear procedure for claims based on inspection by a specific bureau. The modified text introduces subjectivity ('deem valid'), eliminates the need for a certificate from the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, and makes expenses subject to negotiation, contradicting established trade practices and potentially violating implied warranty laws.",

LATE DELIVERY AND PENALTY: Should the Sellers fail to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, with exception of Force Majeure causes specified in Clause 17 of this Contract, the Buyers shall agree to postpone the delivery on condition that the Sellers agree to pay a penalty which shall be deducted by the paying bank from the payment. The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. The rate of penalty is charged at 0.5% for every seven days, odd days less than seven days should be counted as seven days.\nIn case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the contract and the Sellers, in spite of the cancellation, shall still pay the aforesaid penalty to the Buyers without delay, the seller should refund the money received and pay the 30% of the total goods price of the penalty",
                "changed_text": "18. LATE DELIVERY AND PENALTY: Should the Sellers fail to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, penalties are optional and at the Buyer's discretion. While Force Majeure events as outlined in Clause 17 will be considered, the Buyer reserves the right to impose penalties regardless of circumstances. Late delivery penalties, if applied, will be determined on a case-by-case basis.\nIn case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the option to either cancel the contract or modify the terms to accommodate the delay. Penalties may be waived at the Buyer’s sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause outlines a clear, formula-based penalty for late delivery. The modified clause makes penalties discretionary and waivable, removing the contractual obligation and contradicting the principle of 'quid pro quo.' This introduces uncertainty and potential unenforceability.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies the governing law as the People's Republic of China or the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, providing legal certainty. The modification replaces this with vague principles and the Buyer's discretion to choose any legal framework. This creates significant legal uncertainty and undermines the enforceability of the contract, contravening established conflict-of-laws principles.",

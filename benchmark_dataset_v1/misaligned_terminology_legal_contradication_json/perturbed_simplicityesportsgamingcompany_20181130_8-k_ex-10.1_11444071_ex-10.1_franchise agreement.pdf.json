                "original_text": "Franchisor desires to appoint Franchisee, and Franchisee desires to be so appointed, to act as Franchisor’s exclusive Franchisee in the territories of North America and South America (“Territory”) in the manner set out in this Agreement, for setting up, managing and operating entertainment centres and gaming arcades involving virtual reality, sports simulation technology and proprietary gamification technologies to provide sport and recreational activities/services to the public (“Smaaash Centres”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter provided.",
                "changed_text": "Franchisor desires to appoint Franchisee, and Franchisee desires to be so appointed, to act as Franchisor’s primary operator in the territories of North America and South America (“Territory”) in the manner set out in this Agreement, for setting up, managing and operating entertainment centers and gaming arcades involving virtual reality, sports simulation technology and proprietary gamification technologies to provide sport and recreational activities/services to the public (“Smaaash Centres”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter provided.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'exclusive Franchisee' to 'primary operator' introduces ambiguity. While the contract intends to grant franchise rights, 'primary operator' does not have a defined legal meaning in franchise law, especially considering the existence of sub-franchisees. This creates uncertainty as to the actual rights and obligations of the Franchisee under franchise law.",

                "changed_text": "Franchisee shall maintain adequate customer relations as perceived by the Franchisor.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'good customer relations in accordance with prudent and reasonable business practices' with 'adequate customer relations as perceived by the Franchisor' makes the standard subjective and entirely dependent on the Franchisor's opinion. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in most franchise agreements under US law, which requires objective standards.",

                "changed_text": "Franchisee shall endeavor to market, promote, and publicise the Smaaash Centres throughout the Territory.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"best efforts\" to \"endeavor\" significantly lowers the standard of effort required from the Franchisee. \"Best efforts\" is a legally recognized term that requires a high level of diligence. \"Endeavor\" implies a weaker obligation, potentially contradicting the Franchisor's expectation of active promotion of the Smaaash Centers, thus creating uncertainty in the franchisee's required level of marketing activity which can lead to unenforceability of the provision.",

                "original_text": "3.01. Throughout the Term and for a period of six (6) months after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, neither XSPA nor any of its affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, sell, offer for sale, market or promote any digital meditation or digital sleep products (other than the Products), including online or in any Store in the Territory, without the express prior written consent of Calm.",
                "changed_text": "3.01. Throughout the Term and indefinitely after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, neither XSPA nor any of its affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, sell, offer for sale, market or promote any digital relaxation or digital rest products (other than the Products), including online or in any Store in the Territory, without the express prior written consent of Calm.",
                "explanation": "The original contract specifies a six-month restriction post-termination on XSPA selling competing products. By changing \"six (6) months\" to \"indefinitely\" and \"meditation or digital sleep products\" to \"relaxation or digital rest products\", the contract creates an unreasonable and overly broad restriction, potentially violating antitrust laws regarding restraint of trade. The term 'digital relaxation or digital rest products' could include a broader range of items than originally intended, creating further ambiguity.",

EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO EACH PARTY’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, (A) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE), SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY OR OTHER SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT; AND (B) THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED $2,000,000.00 (EXCLUDING ANY AMOUNTS DUE AND PAYABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION ​8 HEREUNDER).",
                "changed_text": "10.06. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO EACH PARTY’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, (A) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE), SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT; AND (B) THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED $2,000,000.00 (EXCLUDING ANY AMOUNTS DUE AND PAYABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION ​8 HEREUNDER).",
                "explanation": "By removing the terms \"lost profits, loss of opportunity or other special, punitive, indirect, or consequential damages\" the clause creates ambiguity about what is included under 'any damages'. This could contradict established legal principles regarding the types of damages recoverable in contract disputes, and what 'damages' mean in general. This creates a contradiction by restricting the common meaning of the term 'damages'.",

Without limiting Section ​16.08, any and all disputes or claims arising from either Party’s rights or obligations under this Agreement shall be subject to arbitration. Any arbitration commenced with respect to a dispute or claim under this Agreement shall be conducted pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association and the Supplementary Procedures for Large, Complex Disputes then in effect (the “Rules”), except to the extent such rules conflict with this Section ​13. In any arbitration, New York law shall govern, except to the extent that such law conflicts with the Rules or this Section ​13.",
                "changed_text": "13. Arbitration. Without limiting Section ​16.08, any and all disputes or claims arising from either Party’s rights or obligations under this Agreement shall be subject to arbitration. Any arbitration commenced with respect to a dispute or claim under this Agreement shall be conducted pursuant to rules chosen by the arbitrator. In any arbitration, the law most favorable to the arbitrator shall govern, except to the extent that such law conflicts with this Section ​13.",
                "explanation": "By removing the American Arbitration Association rules and giving the arbitrator complete discretion in choosing rules and governing law, the clause undermines the predictability and fairness of the arbitration process. This contradicts the established legal understanding of arbitration as a structured and rule-bound process, leading to potential due process concerns and enforceability issues. It removes the guarantee that the law of a specific location will be the basis for arbitration.",

                "explanation": "The definition of \"Gross Revenues\" has been narrowed to \"net revenues\" and limited to only subscription fees, excluding advertising and other revenue streams. This contradicts standard accounting practices and could lead to disputes over royalty calculations, making enforcement uncertain.",

Removing 'information pertaining to business operations and strategies' and limiting the confidentiality of the Agreement to 'specific financial terms' contradicts common practices and legal precedents regarding trade secrets and confidential business information.

                "original_text": "As used herein, the following terms shall be defined as set forth below:\n\na.\n“Contract Period” shall mean that period of time from February 21, 2011 through December 31, 2012.",
                "changed_text": "As used herein, the following terms shall be defined as set forth below:\n\na.\n“Contract Period” shall loosely indicate the time from February 21, 2011, but its exact duration will depend on Company needs.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall mean' to 'shall loosely indicate,' the definition of 'Contract Period' becomes vague and contradicts the initial definitive timeframe. This introduces ambiguity regarding the term's legal interpretation, potentially leading to disputes over the agreement's duration and obligations.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to make one (1) Production Appearance' with 'may, if his schedule permits, consider making a Production Appearance' changes a mandatory obligation into a discretionary option. This contradicts the original contract and creates uncertainty regarding North's required appearances.",

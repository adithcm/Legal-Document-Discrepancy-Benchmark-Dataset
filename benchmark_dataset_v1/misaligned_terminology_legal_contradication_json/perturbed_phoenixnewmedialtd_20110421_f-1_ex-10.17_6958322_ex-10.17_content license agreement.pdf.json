                "original_text": "(i)\"Affiliate”, with respect to any Party hereto, shall mean any legal person, non-legal person economic organization, or natural person, \nwhich owns a controlling interest in, or which is controlling, controlled by or under common control with, such Party, directly or \nindirectly. \n  \nAs used in this Agreement, “control” means the power of any person to direct or cause the direction of management and policies \nof another party on account of such person’s ownership of equity interest, voting right, the right to appoint directors, by contract \nor otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "(i)\"Affiliate”, with respect to any Party hereto, shall mean any legal person, non-legal person economic organization, or natural person, \nwhich owns a controlling interest in, or which is controlling, controlled by or under common control with, such Party, directly or \nindirectly. \n  \nAs used in this Agreement, “control” means the potential to influence decisions of another party, regardless of equity interest, voting right, or appointment of directors. Such influence may arise from any type of relationship, whether contractual or informal.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'control' is tied to specific mechanisms like equity interest and voting rights, which aligns with standard corporate governance principles. The modified definition broadens 'control' to include 'potential to influence decisions' regardless of formal structures. This introduces ambiguity and contradicts the generally accepted legal understanding of 'control,' which usually requires a demonstrable legal or contractual right.",
                "contradicted_law": "PRC Company Law - Article 216 defines control in terms of equity, voting rights, and appointment of management, which the modified definition contradicts by broadening the scope of influence.",

                "changed_text": "(iii) “Intellectual Property Right” shall mean authorship right, proprietary trademark right, patent right, business secret ownership right and other rights determined at Party A's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition correctly links 'Intellectual Property Right' to PRC Law. The modified definition replaces the reference to PRC Law with 'rights determined at Party A's sole discretion.' This fundamentally alters the scope of what constitutes an Intellectual Property Right under the agreement, potentially including items not legally recognized as such, and giving Party A unilateral power to define these rights, conflicting with established IP law.",
                "contradicted_law": "PRC Copyright Law, PRC Trademark Law, PRC Patent Law - These laws define the scope and nature of intellectual property rights, which are undermined by granting Party A the sole discretion to determine what constitutes an IP right.",

If Party B obtains any Intellectual Property Right in respect of the Program Content during its \nuse of the same, Party B shall notify Party A and, upon its request in writing, sign all documents and take all actions required to assign \nsuch Intellectual Property Right to Party A, and ensure the Intellectual Property Right so obtained by Party A is legitimate, complete, \nand free from any encumbrance.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Both Parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to Program Content licensed to Party B hereunder, Party B shall have the option to claim any copyright or any other perceived right. If Party B creates what it believes to be an Intellectual Property Right in respect of the Program Content during its use of the same, Party B may choose to notify Party A, and Party A may request in writing to discuss potential ownership, but Party B retains the final decision-making authority regarding assignment of any such right.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Party B does not have any copyright or other intellectual property rights and is required to assign any IP rights obtained to Party A. The modified text significantly alters this by giving Party B the 'option' to claim rights, and the right to decide whether to assign any created Intellectual Property Right. This contradicts the original intent of the contract by undermining Party A's ownership of the content's IP. Additionally, the term 'perceived right' does not have a legal definition.",
                "contradicted_law": "PRC Copyright Law, PRC Contract Law - The changed text implies a potential contradiction to the contract's primary purpose (licensing content) and may create uncertainty about the ownership and exploitation of intellectual property rights, violating principles of contractual certainty.",

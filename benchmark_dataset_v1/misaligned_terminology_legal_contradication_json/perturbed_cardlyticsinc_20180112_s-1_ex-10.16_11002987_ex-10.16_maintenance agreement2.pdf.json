                "explanation": "By replacing 'fulfill or exceed all' with 'generally align with,' the contractual obligation becomes vague and unenforceable. This introduces ambiguity because 'generally align' lacks a clear, objective standard for compliance, contradicting the original intent of strict adherence to specifications. It undermines the certainty required for contract enforcement under general contract law principles.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original clause by making the termination and refund process discretionary and depending on the 'Supplier's discretion,' which goes against fundamental principles of contract law where termination rights and refunds should be clearly defined and exercisable by the injured party (Bank of America in this case).",

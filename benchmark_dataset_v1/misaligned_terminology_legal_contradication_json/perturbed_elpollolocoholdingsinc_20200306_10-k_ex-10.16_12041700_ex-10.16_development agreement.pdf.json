                "explanation": "Changing 'development rights' to 'temporary rights' creates a contradiction. Development rights imply long-term privileges, while 'temporary rights' introduces ambiguity and uncertainty, potentially conflicting with franchise laws that expect a clear grant of rights. Franchise law mandates certain rights and responsibilities for franchisees; describing the granted rights as 'temporary' undermines the stability and predictability expected in a franchise agreement. This creates uncertainty on the type of rights a developer receives from the development agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Competitive Business' to 'Similar Business' introduces a conflict in the definition. The original contract defines 'Competitive Business'. Replacing it with 'Similar Business' without defining this new term introduces legal uncertainty, as 'similar' is broader and more subjective than 'competitive,' potentially capturing businesses not intended by the original non-compete clause.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'best efforts' to 'reasonable efforts' with the inclusion of 'anyone claiming to be brokers' causes a contradiction because the developer might not want to hire anyone that claims to be a broker. 'Best efforts' imposes a high standard of diligence, while 'reasonable efforts' implies a lower standard. Additionally, suggesting the use of unlicensed brokers contradicts real estate laws requiring licensure. This creates a conflict because the contract appears to promote a violation of the real estate laws of a given state.",

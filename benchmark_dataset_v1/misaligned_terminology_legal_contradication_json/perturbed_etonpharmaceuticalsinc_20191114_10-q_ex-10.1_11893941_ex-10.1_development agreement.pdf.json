                "original_text": "1.31 “Product” or “Products” means a product or products set forth in Exhibit A for Marketing by or for ETON in the Territory (and covered or intended to be covered by a Dossier) and manufactured and supplied by Aucta (or a Third Party as permitted by this Agreement) to ETON in fully packaged and labeled form and ready for commercialization by ETON.",

This includes, but is not limited to, items manufactured and supplied by Aucta (or a Third Party as permitted by this Agreement) to ETON in any form.",
                "explanation": "The original definition ties 'Product' to specific items covered by a Dossier and manufactured according to the agreement. The modification broadens the definition to include any item sold by ETON, irrespective of these conditions. This contradicts the intended scope, potentially including non-approved or non-compliant items, creating legal uncertainty.",

L. No. 111-148) as amended or replaced, but not including taxes assessed against the income derived from such sale); (ii) trade, quantity and cash discounts, allowances, retroactive price adjustments, credit incentive payments, chargebacks, patient support programs, and rebates (including governmental rebates or other price reductions provided, based on sales by ETON to any Governmental Entity or regulatory authority in respect of state or federal Medicare, Medicaid, government pricing or similar programs;); and (iii) any costs incurred in connection with or arising out of compliance with any Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies approved by the FDA and (iv) any expenses associated with serialization of the Products.",

Deductions for returns, taxes, discounts, and other expenses are optional and at ETON's sole discretion. ETON is not required to follow GAAP when calculating Net Sales.",
                "explanation": "The original definition meticulously outlines deductions from gross sales to arrive at net sales, adhering to GAAP standards. The modification allows ETON to arbitrarily decide on deductions and disregards GAAP, providing leeway in royalty calculations.

The Agreement may be terminated by either Party by written notice to the other at any time if the other Party (the “Breaching Party”) is in material breach or default of any of its obligations hereunder or any of its representations or warranties as follows: (i) the terminating Party shall send a written notice of the material breach or material default to the Breaching Party and (ii) the termination shall become effective a) thirty (30) days after sending notice of the breach if the breach is non-payment of amounts due hereunder, such as milestone, minimum royalty or royalties amounts and b) sixty (60) days after sending notice of the breach for all other breaches unless the Breaching Party has cured any such material breach or material default prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) or sixty (60) day period as the case may be; or if for non-payment breaches such material default or material breach is not capable of being cured within such sixty (60) day period and the Breaching Party has commenced activities reasonably expected to cure such material breach or material default within such sixty (60) day period and thereafter uses diligent efforts to complete the cure as soon as practicable, but in no event shall such period exceed ninety (90) days.",

A written notice of dissatisfaction is required, but no cure period shall be provided. The termination is effective immediately upon delivery of the notice.",
                "explanation": "The original section specifies termination only for 'material breach' and includes a cure period. The modified version allows termination for any 'perceived dissatisfaction,' eliminating the materiality requirement and the cure period. This transforms a clause meant to address significant violations into one that enables arbitrary termination, contradicting the principle of good faith and fair dealing in contract law.",

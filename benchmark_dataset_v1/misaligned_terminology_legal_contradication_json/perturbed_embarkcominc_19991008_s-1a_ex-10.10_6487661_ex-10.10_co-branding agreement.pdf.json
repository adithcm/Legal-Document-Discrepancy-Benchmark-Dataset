                "original_text": "\"TRADEMARKS\" means any trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade names, corporate names, proprietary logos or indicia and other source or business identifiers.",
                "changed_text": "\"TRADEMARKS\" means any brand names or logos used by either party, which may or may not be registered with the relevant authorities.",
                "explanation": "The original definition aligns with standard trademark law. The modified definition removes the requirement for registration or legal protection, contradicting established trademark law, which requires either registration or established use to create trademark rights. This creates uncertainty about what constitutes a 'trademark' under the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark Law (Lanham Act in the US, or equivalent in other jurisdictions)",

                "original_text": "During the Term, Snap will not grant any third party any right to sponsor any products or services in the Exclusive Category on or through the Snap Web Site. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that the foregoing restriction applies only to persistent sponsorship placement as judged by Sponsor at its discretion, and not to run-of-site banner advertisements or other rotating promotional placements.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, Snap will not allow other companies to promote services like United Airlines. The definition of ‘services like United Airlines’ will be based on what United Airlines deems as competitive at any given moment, and it excludes routine online ads.",
                "explanation": "The original text defined 'Exclusive Category' clearly and provided a limitation on sponsorship. The modification introduces ambiguity by defining the scope of exclusivity subjectively based on Sponsor's discretion. This contradicts standard contract law principles requiring objective definitions and could lead to disputes about what constitutes a violation of the exclusive sponsorship agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - requirement for clear and objective terms",

During the Term, and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, the receiving party will not disclose to others or use for any purpose of its own, other than in performance of this Agreement, any Confidential Information of the other party. Each party shall take, at a minimum, measures consistent with those taken to protect its own similar types of Confidential Information (and in any event, at least reasonable measures) to protect the other's Confidential Information against disclosures prohibited by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "CONFIDENTIALITY. During the Term, and if deemed necessary by the disclosing party, the receiving party will not disclose what the disclosing party calls 'Confidential Information.' The receiving party needs to try their best to keep these secrets safe.",
                "explanation": "The original clause had a fixed period of confidentiality (5 years) and required reasonable measures to protect information. The modified version makes the duration subjective ('if deemed necessary') and weakens the protective measures ('try their best'), making the confidentiality obligation vague and difficult to enforce. This undermines legal standards for enforceable confidentiality agreements, which require definite terms.",

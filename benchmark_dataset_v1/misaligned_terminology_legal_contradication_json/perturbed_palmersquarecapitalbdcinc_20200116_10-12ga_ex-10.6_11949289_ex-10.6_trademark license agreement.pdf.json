                "original_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark solely and exclusively as a component of Licensee’s own corporate name and in connection with marketing the investment management, investment consultation and investment advisory services that Investment Advisor may provide to Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this License, and except as provided above, neither Licensee nor any affiliate, owner, director, officer, employee or agent thereof shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivative thereof in the Territory without the prior express written consent of Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion and shall not use the Licensed Mark for any purpose outside the Territory. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a broad, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing right and license to use the Licensed Mark as a component of Licensee’s own corporate name and in connection with business operations. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark, and neither Licensee nor any affiliate, owner, director, officer, employee or agent thereof shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivative thereof in the Territory. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall be jointly managed by both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement grants a 'personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right.' The modification introduces a 'broad, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing' right, which introduces conflicting obligations, undermining the clarity of the original license. Also, the original agreement dictates that 'All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor.' The edited version removes this, replacing it with: 'All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall be jointly managed by both parties.' This contradicts the initial grant and creates ambiguity about ownership and control of the licensed mark, and is very likely to have not been agreed upon by one of the parties.",

                "original_text": "In order to preserve the inherent value of the Licensed Mark, Licensee agrees to use reasonable efforts to ensure that it maintains the quality of the Licensee’s business and the operation thereof equal to the standards prevailing in the operation of Licensee’s business as of the Effective Date. The Licensee further agrees to use the Licensed Mark in accordance with such quality standards as may be reasonably established by Licensor and communicated to the Licensee from time to time in writing, or as may be agreed to by Licensor and the Licensee from time to time in writing.",
                "changed_text": "In order to enhance the perceived value of the Licensed Mark, Licensee is not required to maintain any specific quality standards in the Licensee’s business. The Licensee may use the Licensed Mark without regard to any quality standards established by Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original text emphasizes quality control to maintain the value of the Licensed Mark, aligning with standard trademark licensing practices. By removing the requirement for quality control and allowing the Licensee to disregard the Licensor's standards, the modification introduces a contradiction. Trademark law generally requires licensors to maintain quality control over the use of their marks to prevent them from becoming generic or diluted.",

The parties unconditionally and irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of New York and waive any objection with respect thereto, for the purpose of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies New York law and exclusive jurisdiction in New York courts, providing legal certainty. The modification introduces ambiguity by allowing the Licensee to choose the governing law and establishing non-exclusive jurisdiction. This contradicts the initial clear agreement on governing law and forum, making enforcement less predictable.",

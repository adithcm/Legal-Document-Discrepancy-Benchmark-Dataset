                "changed_text": "“Broadcast Television” means traditional, free, FCC-licensed, over-the-air broadcast television, which may require a subscription fee for access.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Broadcast Television\" explicitly states it's \"free.\" Modifying it to allow for a subscription fee directly contradicts this fundamental aspect. Under FCC regulations and general understanding, broadcast television is free over-the-air. Requiring a fee changes its nature and may misclassify it under communications law, potentially affecting consumer rights and regulatory oversight.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a legal contradiction by explicitly stating that the contractual definition of “MVPD” does not align with the FCC's regulatory definition. This is problematic because the term MVPD has a specific legal meaning and scope as defined by the FCC. By disregarding the regulatory definition, the contract introduces ambiguity and potential conflict regarding the rights, responsibilities, and regulatory obligations associated with MVPDs, potentially undermining the enforceability of contract provisions related to MVPDs.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that each station *shall* be entitled to protection against duplication under FCC rules. The modified text changes this to a discretionary entitlement ('may or may not'), subject to Network's approval. This directly contradicts the automatic entitlement provided by the FCC regulations, creating uncertainty about whether stations can actually rely on this protection. By adding the 'Network's approval' clause, this modification potentially undermines the regulatory protections intended for broadcast stations.",

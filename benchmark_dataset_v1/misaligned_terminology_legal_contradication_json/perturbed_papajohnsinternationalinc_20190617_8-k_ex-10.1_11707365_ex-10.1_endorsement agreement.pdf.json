                "original_text": "“Competitive Products” shall mean pizza intended primarily for carry-out or home delivery and prepared on the premises of a pizza carry-out/delivery restaurant, including but not limited to, pizza “take and bake” outlets, dine-in restaurants in which pizza is the principal food offering, and/or frozen pizza sold in grocery or mass merchandiser stores for in-home preparation.",
                "changed_text": "“Competitive Products” shall mean food items that have ingredients that are like PAPA JOHN’S Products.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Competitive Products' is specific to pizza and related outlets, providing a clear boundary for exclusivity. The modified definition replaces this with a vague and broad term, 'food items that have ingredients that are like PAPA JOHN’S Products.' This introduces legal uncertainty because 'ingredients that are like' is subjective and lacks a defined standard. It contradicts the initial intent by potentially including unrelated food categories.",

ABG has the right to Approve all uses of the Celebrity Endorsement and the Personality Rights, whether by PAPA JOHN’S or any of its approved designees (including, without limitation, the use of the Personality Rights in connection with any and all Products and Materials.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, “Approval” (and all grammatical variations thereof, e.g., Approve, Approved, etc.) shall be defined as ABG’s suggestion, but not required for any action.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Approval' grants ABG complete discretion over the use of Celebrity Endorsement and Personality Rights, a fairly standard protective clause. The modified definition changes this by stating that 'Approval' is merely a suggestion and not required. This directly contradicts the original intent of requiring ABG's consent, creating legal ambiguity on the extent of PAPA JOHN’S freedom in using these rights, and undermines ABG’s control over its intellectual property.",

                "changed_text": "PAPA JOHN’S shall not, during the Term or at any time thereafter: disparage CELEBRITY or the Personality Rights with intent to harm.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a strict and detailed list of prohibited associations to protect CELEBRITY's image. The modified version significantly narrows this by stating only that PAPA JOHN’S shall not disparage CELEBRITY or the Personality Rights 'with intent to harm.' This introduces ambiguity because 'intent to harm' is difficult to prove, effectively weakening the protective measures. It contradicts the original specific prohibitions by creating a loophole where PAPA JOHN’S could engage in previously prohibited activities without direct evidence of harmful intent.",

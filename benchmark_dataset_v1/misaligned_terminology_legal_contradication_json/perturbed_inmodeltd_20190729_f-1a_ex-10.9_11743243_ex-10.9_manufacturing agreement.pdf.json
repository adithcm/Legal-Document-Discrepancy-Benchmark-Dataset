                "original_text": "Contractor shall apply for and receive the ISO13488 standard for the production facility, by no later than . During the term of this Agreement, the manufacturing services provided by the Contractor hereto shall confirm in all material respects with the ISOl3488 standard.",
                "changed_text": "Contractor shall endeavor to maintain reasonable quality standards for the production facility, with the goal of achieving something similar to the ISO13488 standard. During the term of this Agreement, the manufacturing services provided by the Contractor shall adhere to quality levels that are deemed commercially acceptable.",
                "explanation": "Replaced a clear, defined quality standard (ISO13488) with vague language ('reasonable quality standards', 'commercially acceptable'). This makes enforcement uncertain because 'reasonable' and 'commercially acceptable' are subjective and open to interpretation, unlike the ISO standard which is objective and verifiable.",

                "original_text": "For the purpose of this Agreement, “Warranty Period” shall mean twelve (12) months as of the date of delivery to Customer. Contractor represents and warrants that, for the Warranty Period, the Products (i) will be free from defects in workmanship, material (only to the same extent as the original manufacturer of the material warrants the Contractor), and manufacture; (ii) will comply the Specifications IPC610.B standard (in all material respects and unless otherwise was instructed by Customer). Contractor further represents and warrants that the Product will consist of new materials.",
                "changed_text": "For the purpose of this Agreement, “Warranty Period” shall mean approximately twelve (12) months as of the date of delivery to Customer. Contractor represents and warrants that, for the Warranty Period, the Products (i) will be mostly free from defects in workmanship, material (only to the same extent as the original manufacturer of the material warrants the Contractor), and manufacture; (ii) will comply with general industry practice. Contractor further represents and warrants that the Product will consist of mostly new materials.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity by using terms like 'approximately,' 'mostly,' and 'general industry practice,' instead of clear, definable terms like 'twelve (12) months,' 'free from defects,' and a specific industry standard (IPC610.B). This makes it harder to enforce the warranty because the exact terms of the warranty are no longer well-defined and deviates the intention of the parties.",

                "explanation": "Modified clear legal terms (e.g., 'claims, liabilities, costs, damages') with vague, subjective terms ('possible claims, potential liabilities, expenses, harm'). Changed concrete timeframes (three (3) business days) to subjective timeframe ('reasonable timeframe following awareness'). These changes introduce significant ambiguity, making it difficult to determine the scope of the indemnity and the timeliness of notification, undermining the enforceability of the indemnification clause.",

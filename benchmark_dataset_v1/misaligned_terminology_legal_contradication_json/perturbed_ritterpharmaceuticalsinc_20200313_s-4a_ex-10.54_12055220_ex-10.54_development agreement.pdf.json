                "original_text": "Adverse Event shall mean an incident in which the Product was alleged to have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury of a patient or operator and would require submitting a Medical Devices Report to the FDA (as hereinafter defined) as per 21 CFR 803, or a similar report to a Competent Authority (as hereinafter defined) as per Vigilance Guidance MEDDEV 2.12-1.",
                "changed_text": "Adverse Event shall mean any incident involving the Product, regardless of severity or impact on patient or operator health, as determined at Qualigen's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition aligns with the FDA's reporting requirements for medical devices. The modified definition gives Qualigen sole discretion on what constitutes an 'Adverse Event,' contradicting the mandatory reporting requirements under 21 CFR 803 and related vigilance guidelines. This creates ambiguity about which events must be reported, undermining regulatory compliance.",

Neither Party shall have authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action which shall be binding on the other Party (except as may be explicitly provided for herein or authorized in writing), and each Party agrees not to purport to do so.",
                "changed_text": "For the purpose of the Agreement each Party shall be, and shall be deemed to be, an affiliate and shall have the power to represent the other party. Furthermore, all intellectual property created during the course of this agreement will be considered jointly owned by both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly defines the relationship as 'independent contractor,' preventing either party from binding the other. The modified text redefines this relationship as an 'affiliate', granting each party power to represent the other. This directly contradicts the original intent and the common legal understanding of 'independent contractor' versus 'affiliate', potentially leading to legal disputes over liability and representation.",

It is contemplated that in the course of the performance of this Agreement each Party may, from time to time, disclose proprietary and confidential information to the other (“Confidential Information”). Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed to in writing, during the Term and for a period of five (5) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the receiving Party shall disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information only to its own (or its Affiliates’) officers, employees, consultants, Third Party service providers, attorneys, accountants, agents, bankers, lenders, prospective lenders and prospective equity investors, and in each case only if and to the extent necessary to carry out their respective responsibilities under this Agreement or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under this Agreement or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit), and such disclosure shall be limited to the maximum extent possible consistent with such responsibilities and rights. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party without the other’s prior written consent.",
                "changed_text": "Confidentiality Obligation. It is contemplated that in the course of the performance of this Agreement each Party may, from time to time, disclose proprietary and confidential information to the other (“Confidential Information”). Each party has the complete rights to disclose any type of information to whomever they want to disclose the information to, as Confidential Information is considered non-binding.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a strict confidentiality obligation with specific exceptions. The modified version states that 'Confidential Information is considered non-binding,' directly negating the entire purpose of a confidentiality clause. This creates a legal contradiction, making the clause unenforceable and exposing sensitive information to potential misuse or unauthorized disclosure, in contradiction to standard contract law practices for protecting trade secrets and confidential business information.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Confidential Information' with specific exceptions, aligning with trade secret laws. The modified text replaces objective criteria ('came to Member’s attention by lawful means prior to disclosure,' 'part of the public domain') with a subjective standard ('Member believes to be already known by the public'). This creates ambiguity and contradicts established legal definitions of trade secrets, making enforcement difficult. A member could claim they 'believed' something was public knowledge, regardless of whether it truly was, weakening the protection of confidential information.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses 'Competitive Business' and defines a three-mile radius non-compete zone, which, while potentially subject to scrutiny, provides a clear, objective standard. The modified text replaces 'Competitive Business' with the vague term 'Similar Business' and the defined three-mile radius with 'reasonable distance.' This introduces significant ambiguity. What constitutes a 'similar business' and a 'reasonable distance' is open to interpretation and legal challenge, contradicting the need for clear and enforceable terms in non-compete agreements. This weakens the enforceability of the non-compete clause.",

                "changed_text": "(d) As used in this Agreement, the term “Post-Term Period” shall mean a period deemed appropriate by the Franchisor following: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement (regardless of the cause for termination); (c) termination of Member’s employment with Franchisee; and/or (d) a final order of a duly authorized arbitrator, panel of arbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been taken) with respect to any of the foregoing or with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement; either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or entity).",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the 'Post-Term Period' as a two-year period, providing certainty and predictability. The modified text replaces this with a period 'deemed appropriate by the Franchisor.' This gives the Franchisor complete discretion to determine the length of the non-compete period, which is likely unenforceable and contradicts the principles of fair contracting. Courts generally require non-compete agreements to have reasonable timeframes. Giving one party unilateral control over the duration creates an unreasonable and potentially oppressive term, making it unlikely to be upheld.",

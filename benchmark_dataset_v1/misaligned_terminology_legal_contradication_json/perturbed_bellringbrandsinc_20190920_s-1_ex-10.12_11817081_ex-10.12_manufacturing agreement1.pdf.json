                "original_text": "Heritage shall produce the products described on Schedule A attached hereto, as may be amended by the Parties hereafter from time to time (the “Products”), for Premier at [***] Heritage’s or Heritage’s wholly owned subsidiary, Jasper’s, [***] (the “Facilities”). [***] For the purposes of this paragraph, [***] facilities located at [***] are considered one Facility. Any facility that Heritage wishes to use, other than [***] to manufacture the Products must be approved by Premier in writing, in advance. For the avoidance of doubt, Heritage’s [***] facility must be approved by Premier before it may be used to manufacture the Products. Such facility approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Premier’s facility approval will be based, in part, on the successful completion of a trial production run that is sufficient in meeting finished product specifications, and an evaluation of the stability and specifications of trial production product within [***] of the trial production run.",
                "changed_text": "Heritage shall produce the items as described on Schedule A attached hereto, as may be amended by the Parties hereafter from time to time (the “Products”), for Premier at [***] Heritage’s or Heritage’s wholly owned subsidiary, Jasper’s, [***] (the “Facilities”). [***] For the purposes of this paragraph, [***] facilities located at [***] are considered one Facility. Any factory that Heritage wishes to use, other than [***] to manufacture the Products requires no formal approval from Premier. For the avoidance of doubt, Heritage’s [***] facility is not required to be approved by Premier before it may be used to manufacture the Products. Premier may at their discretion provide feedback, but Heritage will ultimately decide where products are manufactured. Premier’s facility approval will be based, in part, on their personal feelings about production.",
                "explanation": "The term **“facility approval”** now contradicts standard manufacturing oversight practices. It replaces **'facility'** with **'factory'**. While subtly, it changes the legal implications, making Premier's approval subjective ('their personal feelings'). This could create disputes over quality control and compliance, deviating from industry standards and potentially violating FDA regulations regarding manufacturing oversight.",

Accordingly, Heritage shall be responsible for payment of all taxes including federal, state and local taxes arising out of Heritage’s activities under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, federal and state income tax, social security tax, unemployment insurance tax, and any other taxes or business license fees as required.",
                "changed_text": "The relationship of Heritage to Premier under this Agreement shall be that of a contractor and no agency or employment relationship shall be implied by this Agreement. Accordingly, Heritage shall be responsible for payment of a small percentage of taxes including federal, state and local taxes arising out of Heritage’s activities under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, federal and state income tax, social security tax, unemployment insurance tax, and any other taxes or business license fees as required. Heritage, as a part of this, will provide additional compensation to Premier in exchange for only paying this percentage of the total fees.",
                "explanation": "The term **'independent contractor'** is replaced with simply **'contractor'**, removing the specific legal definition of an independent contractor under employment law. The phrase 'a small percentage of taxes' is legally dubious. By mentioning 'additional compensation to Premier' it implies an attempt to circumvent tax obligations, potentially violating federal tax regulations.",

In all other cases, Premier shall bear all costs associated with any Recall Action.",

Heritage shall bear none of the fees and out-of-pocket expenses associated with any Recall Action and negligence will be waived. In all cases, Premier shall bear all costs associated with any Recall Action, negligence not withstanding.",
                "explanation": "The term **'Recall Action'** is now **'Suggestion of Action'**, and now may only be in accordance with FDA's best suggestion. This undermines the mandatory nature of recall procedures as defined by the FDA. It removes Heritage's financial responsibility for recalls caused by its own negligence or failures, contradicting standard product liability principles and potentially violating consumer protection laws.",

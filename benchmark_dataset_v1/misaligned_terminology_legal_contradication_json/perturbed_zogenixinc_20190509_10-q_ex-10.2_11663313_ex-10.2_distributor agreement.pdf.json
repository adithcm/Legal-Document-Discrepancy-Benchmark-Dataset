                "original_text": "1.10 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means, with respect to a Party’s specific obligations under this Agreement, that level of efforts and resources, [***]. Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires that the applicable Party: (i) [***], (ii) [***], and (iii) [***].",
                "changed_text": "1.10 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means, with respect to a Party’s specific obligations under this Agreement, whatever efforts the party deems are reasonable. Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires that the applicable Party: (i) [***], (ii) [***], and (iii) [***].",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the meaning of \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" from a defined standard to a subjective determination by each party. This could contradict legal interpretations of 'reasonable efforts' which often require objective criteria and benchmarks, especially in pharmaceutical distribution agreements. This creates uncertainty as enforceability now depends on subjective judgment rather than defined standards.",

                "changed_text": "1.33 “Indirect Losses” means any damages or other losses the party wants to claim, involving, but only to the extent of, any loss of profits, diminution in value, or incidental, indirect, consequential, special or punitive damages.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the definition of “Indirect Losses” to depend on what the party wants to claim introduces ambiguity. Under contract law, the definition and limitation of indirect losses are usually predefined to allocate risk and prevent speculative claims. The term's legal implications are weakened by introducing a subjective element, creating uncertainty in enforcing damage claims.",

                "explanation": "This modifies 'Regulatory Approval' to depend on what the party deems necessary instead of what regulatory authorities require. This introduces significant legal uncertainty because compliance with regulatory laws is mandatory, not discretionary. This alteration contradicts the statutory and regulatory requirements for pharmaceutical products.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The MDO will be payable within ninety (90) days from the date of the transaction (First Month payable by the end of ninety (90) days from the end of the month).",
                "changed_text": "The MDO will be payable within one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of the transaction (First Month payable by the end of one hundred and twenty (120) days from the end of the month).",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates payment within 90 days. Changing it to 120 days could create a violation if state laws (Texas, in this case) mandate faster payment terms for certain types of distributor agreements, potentially conflicting with prompt payment laws or regulations depending on how the relationship is classified.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Business and Commerce Code, potentially related to prompt payment or contract regulations.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Distributor agrees to provide Company, within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter, with a report depicting sales and sales leads, including volume projections. Distributor shall commence providing Company such reports within thirty (30) days following the end of the calendar quarter in which this Agreement is executed.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor agrees to provide Company, within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar quarter, with a report depicting sales and sales leads, including volume projections. Distributor shall commence providing Company such reports within sixty (60) days following the end of the calendar quarter in which this Agreement is executed.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the reporting deadline from 30 to 60 days could violate state laws that mandate quicker reporting timelines, especially in regulated industries or if the reports relate to financial performance and compliance. If the information is critical to regulatory reporting, then 60 days may be non-compliant.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially Texas state laws regarding business reporting or specific industry regulations.",

                "original_text": "This contract shall remain in effect initially for the five (5) year term (\"Initial Term\") from the date signed and shall be automatically extended for one (1) year periods after the Initial Term (\"Renewal Term\") unless (i) either party provides written notice of its intention not to renew the Agreement within 180 days prior to any Renewal Term; or (ii) this Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 12.",
                "changed_text": "This contract shall remain in effect initially for the five (5) year term (\"Initial Term\") from the date signed and shall be automatically extended for one (1) year periods after the Initial Term (\"Renewal Term\") unless (i) either party provides written notice of its intention not to renew the Agreement within 30 days prior to any Renewal Term; or (ii) this Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 12.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the non-renewal notice period from 180 days to 30 days may conflict with Texas franchise laws or other regulations that necessitate a longer notice period for non-renewal of distributor agreements, especially if significant investments were made by the distributor. A shorter notice period might be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially Texas franchise laws or contract regulations related to reasonable notice periods.",

                "original_text": "4.2 Payment. All fees are due and payable within thirty (30) days of the applicable VOTOCAST invoice. Any payments made later than the due date will accrue interest from the date due until the date paid at the rate of one percent (I%) per month on the amount due, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. In addition, failure of Licensee to fully pay any fees within sixty (60) days after the applicable due date, shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement, justifying suspension of the performance of Services by VOTOCAST, and will be sufficient cause for immediate termination of this Agreement by VOTOCAST. Any such suspension does not relieve Licensee from paying fees past due plus interest and in the event of collection enforcement, Licensee shall be liable for any costs associated with such collection, including, but not limited to, legal costs, attorneys' fees, court costs and collection agency fees.",
                "changed_text": "4.2 Payment. All fees are due and payable within ninety (90) days of the applicable VOTOCAST invoice. Any payments made later than the due date will accrue interest from the date due until the date paid at the rate of five percent (5%) per month on the amount due, regardless of any conflicting law. In addition, failure of Licensee to fully pay any fees within thirty (30) days after the applicable due date, shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement, justifying suspension of the performance of Services by VOTOCAST, and will be sufficient cause for immediate termination of this Agreement by VOTOCAST.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction by extending the payment due date to 90 days, which may violate prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions. Additionally, the interest rate is set to 5% per month regardless of conflicting law, this interest rate may exceed the maximum legal interest rate (usury laws) allowed in California or Nevada, potentially rendering the interest clause unenforceable. Finally, it reduces the failure to pay the due date to 30 days.",

                "explanation": "The original contract requires 180 days' notice for termination, but it has been reduced to fifteen (15) days. This contradicts the principle of reasonable notice, particularly in ongoing service agreements. Courts often require a more substantial notice period to allow the other party to make alternative arrangements. Also, The reduction of the notice period could be deemed unconscionable, especially if one party is significantly more reliant on the agreement than the other.",

If any such action occurs and results in an employee accepting employment with the other Party, the Party with whom the employee accepts employment agrees to pay to the other Party as liquidated damages, an amount equal to two times that particular individual's annual salary and bonus.",

If any such action occurs and results in an employee accepting employment with the other Party, the Party with whom the employee accepts employment agrees to pay to the other Party as liquidated damages, an amount equal to two times that particular individual's annual salary and bonus. Also, the hiring party needs to pay 100% of all revenue generated by the hired employee.",
                "explanation": "The extended non-solicitation period of 36 months may be deemed an unreasonable restraint of trade, especially in California, which has a strong public policy against such restrictions. Courts often scrutinize non-solicitation agreements to ensure they are narrowly tailored to protect legitimate business interests without unduly limiting an individual's ability to find employment. Also, the additional payment of 100% of all revenue generated by the hired employee is excessive and could be considered a penalty rather than liquidated damages, making it unenforceable.",

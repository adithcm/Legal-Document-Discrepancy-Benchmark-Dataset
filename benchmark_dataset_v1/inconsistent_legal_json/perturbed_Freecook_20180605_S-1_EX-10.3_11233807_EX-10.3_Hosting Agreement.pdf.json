                "original_text": "2. Payment Terms. Upon the signing of this Agreement, Client agrees to pay to Company a total of\n$5,000. Client shall make a prepayment of $1,900 and pay the remaining $3,100 on completion of the\nScope of Work.",
                "changed_text": "2. Payment Terms. Upon the signing of this Agreement, Client agrees to pay to Company a total of\n$5,000. Client shall make a prepayment of $4,900 and pay the remaining $100 one year after completion of the\nScope of Work.",
                "explanation": "This change alters the payment terms to require an almost complete prepayment and delays the final payment for a year. This could be deemed unconscionable or violate consumer protection laws in many jurisdictions (including in the US), which often regulate the fairness and timing of payments, especially where there is a significant power imbalance or potential for abuse.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violations of state consumer protection laws related to unfair or deceptive business practices; possible issues with unconscionability under contract law principles.",

Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May\n3, 2018. Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to\ndelay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the\nrequired format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Due Dates and Delays. Company will use its best efforts to deliver the Client Website; however, there is no guarantee of delivery at any point. Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May\n3, 2018. Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to\ndelay for any reason, including reasons attributable to the Company, or no reason at all.",
                "explanation": "This revision gives the company broad discretion to delay or even not deliver the website without consequence. This lack of a definite delivery commitment and unlimited allowance for delays would make the contract illusory and unenforceable in many jurisdictions. Good faith and fair dealing principles are implied in contracts, and this change eliminates those principles.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; potentially unenforceable contract due to illusory promise.",

Any email or telephone\ncorrespondence received after normal business hours will be processed the following business day. Client\nshall pay an additional surcharge for any services requiring work to be performed outside of normal\nbusiness hours by reason of a rush deadline requested by Client or as a result of Client’s failure to meet\nscheduled times for delivery and/or review and approval of information, content and materials. The\nsurcharge for rush work shall be the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%).",
                "changed_text": "3. Business Hours; Rush Work. Company representatives are available during Company’s normal\nbusiness hours which are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. UTC +2, Monday through Friday. Any email or telephone\ncorrespondence received after normal business hours will be processed at the Company's discretion. Client\nshall pay an additional surcharge for any services requiring work to be performed outside of normal\nbusiness hours. The surcharge for rush work shall be determined by the company at the time of the rush work request.",
                "explanation": "This removes the transparency and fixed rate for rush work, allowing the company to charge arbitrary amounts. This could be viewed as unconscionable, particularly if the company takes advantage of the client's urgent need. Also, the Company can decide when it wants to address the client's issues. This violates the concept of good faith.",

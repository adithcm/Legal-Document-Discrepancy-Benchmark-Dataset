Each Party agrees that, during the Term and for a period of [***] thereafter, it shall keep confidential and shall not publish or otherwise disclose and shall not use for any purpose other than as provided for in this Agreement (which includes the exercise of its rights or performance of any obligations hereunder) any Confidential Information furnished to it by or on behalf of the other Party pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties.",

Each Party agrees that, during the Term and for a period of 1 year thereafter, it shall keep confidential and shall not publish or otherwise disclose and shall not use for any purpose other than as provided for in this Agreement (which includes the exercise of its rights or performance of any obligations hereunder) any Confidential Information furnished to it by or on behalf of the other Party pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties.",
                "explanation": "In many jurisdictions, including the United States, trade secrets and confidential information can be protected indefinitely, provided that the information remains confidential and provides a competitive advantage. Limiting the confidentiality period to just one year is an insufficient duration, and fails to provide adequate protection for sensitive confidential information. This undermines the reasonable expectations of confidentiality and conflicts with standard practices that aim to protect trade secrets for much longer durations, thus contradicting common law and trade secret protections.",

Each Party shall make all proposals for agenda items and shall provide all appropriate information with respect to such proposed items at least ten (10) days in advance to the applicable meeting; provided that under exigent circumstances requiring input by the JSC, a Party may provide its agenda items to the other Party within a shorter period of time in advance of the meeting, or may propose that there not be a specific agenda for that particular meeting, so long as the other Party consents to such later addition of such agenda items or the absence of a specific agenda for such meeting, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The chairperson shall prepare and circulate for review and approval of the Parties minutes of each meeting within thirty (30) days after the meeting.

Each Party shall bear its own costs for its members to attend such meetings.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for JSC meetings to five days, and agenda item submission to two days, may not provide sufficient time for preparation and input, potentially undermining the effectiveness of the committee. Similarly, extending the time to circulate meeting minutes to sixty days could lead to delays in addressing critical issues, which may not meet the standard of reasonable business practice, depending on the specifics of the industry and the nature of decisions made at the meetings.",

If Valeant does not receive payment of any sum due to it on or before the due date, simple interest shall thereafter accrue on the sum due to Valeant from the due date until the date of payment at the Prime Rate plus [***] or the maximum rate allowable by Applicable Law, whichever is less; provided, however, if it is discovered that any payment is past due as of the result of any audit conduct by Valeant pursuant to Section 7.2, such interest shall not accrue until [***] after the completion of such audit and not at the time the payment was originally due. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the reason for any late payment is resulting from or arising out of any act or omission on the part of Valeant, including but not limited to any delay providing the requisite reports in Section 4.2.2, or the payment instructions pursuant to Section 6.3.4, such interest shall not accrue.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for interest on late payments, the contract conflicts with standard commercial law principles. Many states have laws that mandate interest on overdue payments, especially in commercial transactions. This change disadvantages Valeant by eliminating its right to compensation for the time value of money, thereby contradicting legal and equitable principles.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Constellation agrees, at its sole cost and expense, to supply the HOF Entities with camera-ready artwork required for the production of advertising signs and/or promotional materials covered by this Agreement and to be produced by or on behalf of the HOF Entities at least thirty (30) days before such material is scheduled to be produced. Constellation hereby specifically authorizes the HOF Entities to use such artwork in the production of such advertising signs and/or promotional materials and represents and warrants that all of its advertising copy shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws pertinent to the advertising of its products.",
                "changed_text": "Constellation agrees, at its sole cost and expense, to supply the HOF Entities with camera-ready artwork required for the production of advertising signs and/or promotional materials covered by this Agreement and to be produced by or on behalf of the HOF Entities at least ten (10) days before such material is scheduled to be produced. Constellation hereby specifically authorizes the HOF Entities to use such artwork in the production of such advertising signs and/or promotional materials and represents and warrants that all of its advertising copy shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws pertinent to the advertising of its products.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the artwork submission deadline from 30 to 10 days could create inconsistency. Ohio advertising law or specific regulations governing promotional material production might mandate a longer lead time to ensure compliance reviews, especially for certain regulated industries or products. This creates a risk of non-compliance and potential legal challenges.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Ohio advertising regulations or consumer protection laws requiring sufficient lead time for compliance checks.",
                "location": "Section 3.2(b)"

                "changed_text": "Payment with respect to such invoice will be due sixty (60) days following receipt by Constellation of such invoice.",
                "explanation": "Extending the payment term to 60 days following receipt of the invoice could contradict the Ohio Prompt Payment Act, which mandates specific payment timelines for certain types of contracts, especially those involving construction or public works. This change might unduly delay payments to subcontractors or suppliers, violating their rights under the Act.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of the Ohio Prompt Payment Act or other similar state regulations governing payment terms.",
                "location": "Section 3.2(c)"

                "original_text": "In the event Constellation fails to pay to the HOF Entities when due any sum required by this Agreement to be paid, whether pursuant to this Section 3.4 or otherwise, interest shall accrue from the date due on the unpaid amount at the rate of [***] per month or, if less, the highest rate permitted by law.",
                "changed_text": "In the event Constellation fails to pay to the HOF Entities when due any sum required by this Agreement to be paid, whether pursuant to this Section 3.4 or otherwise, interest shall accrue from the date due on the unpaid amount at the rate of 25% per month or, if less, the highest rate permitted by law.",
                "explanation": "Setting the default interest rate to 25% per month may violate Ohio usury laws, which set limits on the maximum interest rates that can be charged on loans or debts. Charging such a high interest rate could be deemed usurious and unenforceable, leading to legal challenges and penalties.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violation of Ohio usury laws regarding maximum permissible interest rates.",

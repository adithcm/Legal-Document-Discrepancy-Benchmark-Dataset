                "explanation": "This modification reduces the cure period for breaches related to content frequency/quantity from 12 hours to 2 hours. This could be deemed unreasonably short, especially considering potential technical difficulties or time zone differences. Many jurisdictions require a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach before termination is permitted. A 2-hour window may be seen as an insufficient and commercially unreasonable time frame.",

                "explanation": "This modification reduces the cure period for trademark issues from 10 days to 2 days. Trademark disputes often require investigation and corrective action, and a 2-day cure period may be insufficient.

                "explanation": "This modification shortens the cure period for a material breach of contract from 15 days to 5 days. Depending on the nature of the breach, 5 days may be an unreasonably short time to rectify the problem, particularly for complex or technical issues. Many jurisdictions would consider whether this period is commercially reasonable, and 5 days introduces a risk of unenforceability.",

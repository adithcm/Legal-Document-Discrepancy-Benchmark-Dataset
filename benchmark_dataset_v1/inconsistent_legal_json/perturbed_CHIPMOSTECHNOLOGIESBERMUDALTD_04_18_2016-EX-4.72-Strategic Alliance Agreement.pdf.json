                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators.",
                "changed_text": "If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within fifteen (15) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the negotiation period to 15 days could be seen as an unreasonably short timeframe to resolve complex disputes under Taiwan law, potentially hindering fair negotiation processes. While Taiwan law doesn't explicitly mandate a minimum negotiation period, reducing it drastically could be challenged as a violation of good faith principles.",

                "changed_text": "The notices and other expressions of intent for the purpose of this Agreement shall be deemed received: when delivered by express delivery or personal delivery, five (5) days after sending; when delivered by mail, twenty (20) days after mailing.",
                "explanation": "Changing the notice period to 'five days after sending for express delivery and twenty days for mail' is highly problematic, especially internationally. Taiwan law requires a reasonable timeframe for notification to be considered valid, particularly in legal contexts. A 20-day period for mailed notices and a 5 day period for express delivery creates an unreasonable burden, and contradicts norms of prompt and effective legal communication, and international regulations.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties agree that the Parties may disclose information in connection with the execution, existence, content, and performance of this Agreement to any third party at their own discretion.",
                "explanation": "Removing the restriction on disclosing confidential information before a public announcement, allowing parties to disclose at their own discretion, contradicts standard confidentiality practices in Taiwan and international business agreements. It undermines the purpose of confidentiality clauses and could violate trade secret laws if sensitive information is disclosed without consent.",

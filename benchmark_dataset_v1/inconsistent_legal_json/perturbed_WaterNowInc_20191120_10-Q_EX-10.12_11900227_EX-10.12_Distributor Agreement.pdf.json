                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity within ten (10) business days of the date the opportunity is presented to Distributor, Hydraspin shall have no obligation to enter into a contract with Distributor regarding the new territory.",
                "changed_text": "If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity within two (2) business days of the date the opportunity is presented to Distributor, Hydraspin shall have no obligation to enter into a contract with Distributor regarding the new territory.",
                "explanation": "This change shortens the negotiation period for exclusivity terms to two business days. This timeframe may be deemed unreasonably short and could potentially conflict with laws related to fair business practices, especially considering the complexity and financial implications of such agreements. Depending on the specific industry and applicable state laws, such a short period might be considered coercive or not providing sufficient opportunity for due diligence.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and potentially violates state laws on unfair business practices.",
                "location": "Section 2.1"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If termination is the result of a Change of Control, Distributor shall be entitled to receive a onetime payment, within three (3) business days of the effective date of the Change of Control, equal to the greater of the following 1) the aggregate amount of the Distributor Share received during the 18 months prior to the effective date of such Change of Control or 2) the aggregate amount of the Distributor Share received on the 30 days prior to the effective date of such Change of Control multiplied by 18.",
                "changed_text": "If termination is the result of a Change of Control, Distributor shall be entitled to receive a onetime payment, within one hundred twenty (120) business days of the effective date of the Change of Control, equal to the lesser of the following 1) the aggregate amount of the Distributor Share received during the 6 months prior to the effective date of such Change of Control or 2) the aggregate amount of the Distributor Share received on the 15 days prior to the effective date of such Change of Control multiplied by 6.",
                "explanation": "This modification alters both the timeline for payment and the calculation of the one-time payment due to the Distributor upon a Change of Control. The original text requires payment within three business days, which is a relatively prompt timeframe. The modified text extends this to 120 business days (approximately six months), which may violate prompt payment laws in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, it reduces the compensation amount, which could be viewed as a breach of good faith dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of prompt payment laws and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All such notices, requests and other communications shall be deemed to have been received (i) on the date of delivery thereof, if delivered by hand, (ii) on the fifth day after the mailing thereof, if mailed, (iii) on the next business day after the sending thereof, if sent by overnight courier, (iv) on the day of sending, if sent by email transmission prior to 5:00 p.m. on any business day, or (v) on the next business day, if sent by email transmission after 5:00 p.m. on any business day or on any day other than a business day.",
                "changed_text": "All such notices, requests and other communications shall be deemed to have been received (i) never, if delivered by hand, (ii) on the tenth day after the mailing thereof, if mailed, (iii) on the second business day after the sending thereof, if sent by overnight courier, (iv) on the seventh day of sending, if sent by email transmission prior to 5:00 p.m. on any business day, or (v) on the eighth business day, if sent by email transmission after 5:00 p.m. on any business day or on any day other than a business day.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a reasonable and standard framework for determining when notices are considered 'received'. The modification introduces several points of contention. First, deeming hand-delivered notices as 'never' received is inherently unreasonable and legally suspect. Second, extending the mailing receipt period to ten days is significantly longer than the average postal delivery time, potentially causing delays and disputes. Delaying the email receipt days could conflict laws about digital data delivery.",
                "contradicted_law": "Conflicts with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; may violate state laws regarding the enforceability of notice provisions; could potentially be challenged under contract law principles of reasonableness and unconscionability; potentially digital data laws.",

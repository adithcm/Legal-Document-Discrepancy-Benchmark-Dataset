                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to five days creates a contradiction. While Hong Kong law allows parties to agree on termination clauses, such clauses must be reasonable. A five-day notice period for a 20-year agreement could be deemed unreasonable and challenged in court, as it doesn't provide CEIS sufficient time to find an alternative licensee or mitigate potential losses.",

                "changed_text": "8.2  Either Party may terminate this Agreement:\n     (a)  if the other Party commits any breach of this Agreement, regardless of materiality or remediability;\n     (b) (REMOVED FOR CONFLICT) if the other Party commits a material breach of this Agreement which\n          is capable of being remedied but not remedied within thirty (30) days\n          upon receiving written notice from the non-breaching party requiring\n          remedy; and\n     (c)  if the other Party becomes insolvent or bankrupt.",
                "explanation": "Modifying clause 8.2(a) to allow termination for *any* breach, regardless of its materiality or whether it can be fixed, is contradictory. Under Hong Kong contract law, termination rights are generally reserved for 'material breaches' that substantially undermine the contract's purpose. Terminating for trivial, easily rectified breaches is generally not permitted and could be viewed as a breach of good faith or an abuse of contractual power. This creates a potential conflict as the original clause impliedly recognizes the 'materiality' standard, whereas the modified clause eliminates it.",

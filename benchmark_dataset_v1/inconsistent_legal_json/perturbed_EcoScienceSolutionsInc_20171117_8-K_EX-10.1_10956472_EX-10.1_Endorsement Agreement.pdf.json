                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a thirty-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\").",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a five-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\").",
                "explanation": "The modified text shortens the notice period for termination to five days, which may be inconsistent with standard contract law principles that require reasonable notice, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Many jurisdictions require a reasonable period for termination which is commonly 30 days or more.",

                "explanation": "The modified text reduces the approval timeframe to one business day. This timeframe is unreasonably short and could be deemed insufficient for Talent to properly review and approve Commercial Placements and press releases. This violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing and could expose ESSI to claims that they did not provide Talent with a reasonable opportunity to protect his image and likeness.",

Talent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to ESSI in the event of the occurrence of any of the following: (1) ESSI adjudicates as insolvent or declares bankruptcy余 or (2) ESSI fails to provide consideration due pursuant to this Agreement, within ten (10) days following the date such consideration is due hereunder, provided that ESSI is notified in writing of such non-payment by Talent and such payment by ESSI is not made within three (3) days following such notification余 or (3) ESSI breaches any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth herein and fails to cure same (if curable) within seven (7) days of receipt of written notice.",

Talent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to ESSI in the event of the occurrence of any of the following: (1) ESSI adjudicates as insolvent or declares bankruptcy余 or (2) ESSI fails to provide consideration due pursuant to this Agreement, within ten (10) days following the date such consideration is due hereunder, provided that ESSI is notified in writing of such non-payment by Talent and such payment by ESSI is not made within one (1) day following such notification余 or (3) ESSI breaches any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth herein and fails to cure same (if curable) within three (3) days of receipt of written notice.",
                "explanation": "The modification shortens the cure periods for non-payment and breach of contract to one and three days respectively. These periods may be deemed unreasonably short, especially for curing financial breaches or complex contractual issues. This could conflict with principles of fairness and reasonableness in contract law, potentially giving Talent an unfair advantage in terminating the agreement and violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing owed to ESSI.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, general contract law regarding reasonable opportunity to cure breaches.",

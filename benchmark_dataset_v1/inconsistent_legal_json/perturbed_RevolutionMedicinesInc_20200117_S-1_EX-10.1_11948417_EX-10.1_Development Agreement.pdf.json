Sanofi will reimburse RevMed in Dollars all undisputed amounts within such expense reports under this Section 4.5 within [***] following receipt of the invoice therefor.

                "explanation": "The original text likely has a shorter, redacted timeframe for submitting expense reports and reimbursement. The modification extends the timeframe for both submission (to 90 days) and reimbursement (to 180 days).  This could violate state laws regarding prompt payment, especially if the contract applies to work performed in states with stricter payment deadlines (e.g., California Labor Code Section 201 dictates immediate payment of final wages upon termination)",

                "explanation": "The modification extends the timeframe for royalty reporting (to 180 days) and payment (to 270 days) which creates a legal contradiction. Delayed royalty payments can violate legal and industry standards, depending on the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under contract law in Delaware (the state the contract is governed by) or potentially breach fiduciary duty if the agreement creates a de facto partnership.",

                "explanation": "The original text likely specifies a redacted, longer timeframe for maintaining confidentiality.  Reducing the confidentiality period to a mere 6 months is a contradiction. Depending on the type of confidential information (e.g., trade secrets), this timeframe may be unreasonably short.  For trade secrets, confidentiality obligations generally last as long as the information remains a trade secret. The provided change thus creates a legal contradiction.",

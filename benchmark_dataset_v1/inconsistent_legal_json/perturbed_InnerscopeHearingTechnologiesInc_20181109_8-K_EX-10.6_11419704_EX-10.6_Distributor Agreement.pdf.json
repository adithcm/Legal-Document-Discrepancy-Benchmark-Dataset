                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Distributor shall pay half (1/2) of the purchase price prior to shipment and the remaining balance 30 days after shipment of the Products. Payments received after the 30 day calendar period will be subject to a late fee of 1.5% of the invoice amount.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall pay half (1/2) of the purchase price prior to shipment and the remaining balance 90 days after shipment of the Products. Payments received after the 30 day calendar period will be subject to a late fee of 1.5% of the invoice amount.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment period to 90 days. While seemingly generous, this could violate the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA) if such an extended payment term is used to exploit small businesses or create unfair leverage, particularly if Erchonia imposes other restrictive conditions. FDUTPA prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.",

                "changed_text": "If the breach is not cured within five days of such notice, the Agreement will terminate immediately.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to five days may be considered unreasonable, especially for complex breaches. This could be argued as a violation of good faith and fair dealing, implied in all contracts under Florida law, if it leads to premature termination without giving the distributor a reasonable opportunity to rectify the breach, especially since the Distributor is located in California, and it may take time to resolve disputes across state lines. This shortened period potentially contradicts the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Florida law.",

                "changed_text": "Prices will remain in effect for the period of the initial 1 year term.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the price guarantee to one year allows Erchonia to raise prices more frequently. If this significantly increases costs for InnerScope without a corresponding increase in revenue potential, it could be deemed unconscionable under Florida law, particularly if InnerScope made significant investments based on the original 5-year pricing agreement. This change might violate the principle of unconscionability.",

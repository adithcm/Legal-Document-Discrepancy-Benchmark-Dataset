                "explanation": "The original payment terms require payments within 10 and 60 days of execution and 10 days prior to the production session. Modifying these deadlines to 30 and 90 days and 30 days before session introduces potential inconsistencies with standard payment terms, creating uncertainty and potential disputes under contract law. If the production session doesn't occur within a commercially reasonable timeframe after payment, this could cause disputes.",

                "changed_text": "Said written approval is optional and may be given at any time.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires written approval within five business days, protecting the Celebrity's image. Removing this requirement and making approval optional weakens the Celebrity's control over their image and likeness. This could potentially violate right of publicity laws, which protect individuals from unauthorized commercial use of their image, especially in states like California and New York. The right of publicity generally requires consent for commercial use.",

                "changed_text": "HDS shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately without notice if Celebrity breaches any term of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires a 10-day notice and a 7-day cure period, providing the Celebrity an opportunity to rectify any breach. Removing the notice and cure period and allowing immediate termination for any breach is unduly harsh and could be deemed unconscionable, violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most US jurisdictions. This covenant requires parties to act honestly and fairly in the performance and enforcement of the contract.",

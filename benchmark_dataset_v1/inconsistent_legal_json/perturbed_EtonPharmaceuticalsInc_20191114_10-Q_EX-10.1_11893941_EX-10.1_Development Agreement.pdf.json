            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "ETON shall enter into a commercial supply agreement with a contract manufacturing organization and Aucta shall enter into a commercial supply agreement with an active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier within ninety (90) days from the Execution Date unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing.",
                "changed_text": "ETON shall enter into a commercial supply agreement with a contract manufacturing organization and Aucta shall enter into a commercial supply agreement with an active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier within one hundred eighty (180) days from the Execution Date unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the deadline from 90 days to 180 days introduces an inconsistency with standard commercial practice and could potentially violate implied duties of good faith and timely performance. While not a direct violation of a specific statute, unreasonably extending the deadline without a clear business justification could be deemed a breach of contract under general contract law principles, particularly if it impacts other time-sensitive obligations in the agreement. In Delaware, courts consider industry standards and the reasonable expectations of the parties when assessing contractual performance.",

                "original_text": "ETON has the right to terminate this Agreement after approval of the Dossier or marketing application for the Product (or added new product), at its sole discretion, upon providing one hundred eighty (180) days’ written notice to Aucta.",
                "changed_text": "ETON has the right to terminate this Agreement after approval of the Dossier or marketing application for the Product (or added new product), at its sole discretion, upon providing thirty (30) days’ written notice to Aucta.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period from 180 days to 30 days may be deemed unreasonable, especially considering the investments and reliance Aucta places on the agreement's continuation after dossier approval. This could potentially conflict with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, as a short notice period could unduly prejudice Aucta's ability to mitigate losses or find alternative arrangements. Delaware law requires parties to act reasonably and in good faith when exercising contractual rights, and a drastically shortened notice period may be seen as a violation of these principles.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract, implied duty of good faith and fair dealing",

                "original_text": "ETON and Aucta shall calculate and record calculations under this Section 6 and with respect to Product(s) cost in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and shall maintain all books and records related thereto in accordance with standard cost accounting policies and practices, in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the Term plus an additional three (3) years thereafter.",

                "explanation": "Deviating from U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) for financial calculations and record-keeping can lead to inconsistencies and potential legal challenges. GAAP provides a standardized framework for financial reporting, and departing from it without justification could be viewed as a breach of contract, particularly if it impacts royalty calculations or milestone payments. Additionally, reducing the record retention period to one year may violate regulatory requirements for certain pharmaceutical records. This could also lead to audit discrepancies, violating Delaware's laws regarding maintaining accurate books for financial transparency.",

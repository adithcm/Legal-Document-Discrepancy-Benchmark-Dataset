                "original_text": "Payment terms are net 30 days after the date of the invoice, or the date of receipt by Liquidmetal of the invoice if the invoice is received more than 10 days after the date of the invoice. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Order or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, payment shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "changed_text": "Payment terms are net 90 days after the date of the invoice, regardless of when the invoice is received by Liquidmetal. All payments shall be made in a mutually agreed-upon cryptocurrency.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a payment term that might violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, especially if the industry standard or the parties' prior dealings involve shorter payment cycles. The introduction of cryptocurrency as the sole payment method, without specifying which one and without ensuring both parties are equipped to handle such transactions, creates ambiguity and potential for disputes.",

                "original_text": "Unless Liquidmetal notifies Eutectix that the Liquidmetal Product does not meet the Specifications within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Liquidmetal Product, then the Liquidmetal Product shall be deemed Accepted.",
                "changed_text": "Unless Liquidmetal notifies Eutectix that the Liquidmetal Product does not meet the Specifications within five (5) calendar days after receipt of the Liquidmetal Product, then the Liquidmetal Product shall be deemed Accepted.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the acceptance period to 5 days is unreasonably short, especially for complex products. This timeframe doesn't allow sufficient time for thorough inspection and testing. This could be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable under Arizona law, as it severely disadvantages one party.",

                "original_text": "Upon reasonable prior notice to Eutectix and at Liquidmetal’s expense, no more than once per year, during the Term of this Agreement and for one (1) year following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Liquidmetal or its designee shall have the right from time to time to confirm and validate:\n(a)\tthat Eutectix has complied with the pricing provisions of this Agreement;\n(b)\tEutectix’s financial condition, successorship planning, and ability to continue operations;\n(c)\tthat Eutectix’s performance is consistent with the Agreement;\n(d)\tthat Eutectix has complied with Article 10 (Compliance) of this Agreement. Upon reasonable and prior notice to Eutectix, Eutectix will also provide Liquidmetal or its designee from time to time with reasonable access to Eutectix’s facility and the facilities of its sub-suppliers and other subcontractors to permit Liquidmetal to inspect the production, handling, and storage of Liquidmetal Products and the Licensed Equipment and inventories of raw materials and components. Eutectix shall maintain an orderly storage bookkeeping so that the respective inventory of the Licensed Equipment, Liquidmetal Products and property of Liquidmetal can be immediately recognized; and\n(e)\tsuch confirmation and validation to be conducted with minimal disruption to Eutectix’s business operations and all information disclosed during such exercise to be deemed to be Confidential Information.",
                "changed_text": "Upon one hour prior notice to Eutectix and at Eutectix’s expense, up to four times per year, Liquidmetal or its designee shall have the right to confirm and validate the following:\n(a)\tthat Eutectix has complied with the pricing provisions of this Agreement;\n(b)\tEutectix’s financial condition, successorship planning, and ability to continue operations;\n(c)\tthat Eutectix’s performance is consistent with the Agreement;\n(d)\tthat Eutectix has complied with Article 10 (Compliance) of this Agreement. Upon one hour prior notice to Eutectix, Eutectix will also provide Liquidmetal or its designee with immediate and unfettered access to Eutectix’s facility and the facilities of its sub-suppliers and other subcontractors to permit Liquidmetal to inspect the production, handling, and storage of Liquidmetal Products and the Licensed Equipment and inventories of raw materials and components. Eutectix is not required to maintain storage bookkeeping and all information disclosed during such exercise to be deemed to be non-Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "This change severely curtails Eutectix's rights regarding audit procedures. Reducing the notice period to one hour and increasing the audit frequency to four times a year is unreasonable and disrupts Eutectix's business operations. Forcing Eutectix to bear the cost of Liquidmetal's audits places an undue financial burden on them. Eliminating the confidentiality of the disclosed information nullifies their protection rights. These conditions may be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable under Arizona law.",

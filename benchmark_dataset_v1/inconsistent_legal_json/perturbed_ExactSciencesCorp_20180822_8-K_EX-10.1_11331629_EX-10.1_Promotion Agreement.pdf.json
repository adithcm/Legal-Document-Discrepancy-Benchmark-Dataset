Exact, within thirty (30) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter of the Term, shall deliver to Pfizer a consolidated report in the form of and containing the information necessary to confirm the calculation of the Promotion Fee for such Calendar Quarter, together with the underlying spreadsheets with respect to such Calendar Quarter. The Promotion Fee due with respect to such Calendar Quarter and reflected on the consolidated report shall be remitted at the time such report is made.",

Exact, within ninety (90) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter of the Term, shall deliver to Pfizer a consolidated report in the form of and containing the information necessary to confirm the calculation of the Promotion Fee for such Calendar Quarter, together with the underlying spreadsheets with respect to such Calendar Quarter. The Promotion Fee due with respect to such Calendar Quarter and reflected on the consolidated report shall be remitted at the time such report is made.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment within 30 days of the end of each quarter. The modification extends this to 90 days. Many jurisdictions and standard business practices support shorter payment terms for service fees; extending it to 90 days without reasonable justification could be viewed as an unreasonably long delay, especially if it negatively impacts Pfizer's cash flow. This creates a legal contradiction since payment terms must be fair and commercially reasonable.",

                "explanation": "The original confidentiality clause extends for five years post-agreement. Reducing this to one year weakens protection of trade secrets and proprietary information. Trade secrets may require longer protection to maintain their value and competitive advantage.

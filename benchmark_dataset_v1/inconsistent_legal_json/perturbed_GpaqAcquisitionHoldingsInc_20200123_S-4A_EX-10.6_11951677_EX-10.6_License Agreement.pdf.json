                "original_text": "PFHOF shall, within fourteen (14) days of its receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, either approve or reject the proposal as set forth in the Notice. If PFHOF does not approve the proposal as set forth in the Notice within fourteen (14) days of PFHOF’s receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, such proposal shall be deemed rejected by PFHOF.",
                "changed_text": "PFHOF shall, within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, either approve or reject the proposal as set forth in the Notice. If PFHOF does not approve the proposal as set forth in the Notice within five (5) days of PFHOF’s receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, such proposal shall be deemed rejected by PFHOF.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a legal contradiction by making the time for PFHOF to approve or reject the proposal as 5 days, while setting the time for the entity to approve or reject the proposal as 30 days. This discrepancy introduces uncertainty and potential disputes regarding the actual deadline for approval.",

                "original_text": "Thereafter, the agreement shall automatically renew for successive five (5)-year terms, unless either Party gives written notice to the other Party of intent not to renew at least six (6) months prior to the expiration of the then-current Term. If either party elects not to renew the Agreement and the other party wishes to continue the Agreement, the Parties shall attempt in good faith to negotiate an amendment to the Agreement to renew the Term on such terms as may be negotiated by the Parties. Such good faith negotiation shall continue until both Parties agree to cease negotiations or until expiration of the Term.",
                "changed_text": "Thereafter, the agreement shall automatically renew for successive five (5)-year terms, unless either Party gives written notice to the other Party of intent not to renew at least one (1) month prior to the expiration of the then-current Term. If either party elects not to renew the Agreement and the other party wishes to continue the Agreement, the Parties shall attempt in good faith to negotiate an amendment to the Agreement to renew the Term on such terms as may be negotiated by the Parties. Such good faith negotiation shall continue until both Parties agree to cease negotiations.",
                "explanation": "The modified text reduces the notification period for non-renewal from six months to one month. While Ohio law does not explicitly mandate a specific notice period for contract renewals, a one-month notice may be deemed commercially unreasonable, especially for a long-term agreement. This could lead to claims of insufficient notice and breach of good faith, potentially violating general contract law principles of fairness and reasonableness.",

                "original_text": "After good faith consultation with the Advisory Board, either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time for an uncured material breach by the other Party, including the non-payment of the Annual Guarantee, license fees and staffing fees, provided that the non-breaching Party provides prior written notice to the breaching Party, specifying the alleged material breach, and further provided that the breaching Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to cure the material breach, to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party; provided, further, that if such breach (other than a breach for non-payment) cannot be cured during such 30-day period, but the allegedly breaching Party has commenced and is continuing good faith efforts to cure such breach within such 30-day period, then the cure period shall be extended until the allegedly breaching Party has stopped making good faith efforts to cure such breach, such extension not to exceed ninety (90) days.",
                "changed_text": "After consultation with the Advisory Board, either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time for an uncured material breach by the other Party, including the non-payment of the Annual Guarantee, license fees and staffing fees, provided that the non-breaching Party provides verbal notice to the breaching Party, specifying the alleged material breach, and further provided that the breaching Party shall have ten (10) days after receipt of such notice to cure the material breach, to the satisfaction of the non-breaching Party.",
                "explanation": "The modified text changes 'prior written notice' to 'verbal notice' and reduces the cure period for a material breach from thirty (30) days to ten (10) days. A verbal notice is unlikely to satisfy legal requirements for notification. It also reduces the cure period, which may be commercially unreasonable.",

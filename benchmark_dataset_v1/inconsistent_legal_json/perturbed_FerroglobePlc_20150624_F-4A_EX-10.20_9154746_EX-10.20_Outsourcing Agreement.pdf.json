                "changed_text": "Such invoice must be paid by the customer within 90 days of the date on which the invoice is issued.",
                "explanation": "According to the South African law, for large enterprises, the payment term should not exceed 30 days. By extending the payment period to 90 days, the contract violates South African payment regulations, negatively impacting smaller suppliers. This change introduces non-compliance and contradiction with regional laws.",

                "explanation": "Under Spanish law, trade secrets are typically protected for a longer period than one year, especially in technology-heavy outsourcing agreements. Limiting the confidentiality period to one year may be considered insufficient to protect sensitive business information and could contradict common business practices and legal expectations regarding trade secret protection. Introducing contradiction with reasonable confidentiality terms",

                "explanation": "Decreasing the conflict resolution timeframe to five natural days introduces contradiction with the time typically needed for fair and effective conflict resolution. Under Spanish law and general business practice, complex contract disputes often require more than five days for proper investigation and negotiation. By reducing the resolution period, the contract creates the risk of rushed or incomplete resolutions, potentially violating procedural fairness and due process expectations in dispute resolution. Introducing a contradiction to standards of due process.",

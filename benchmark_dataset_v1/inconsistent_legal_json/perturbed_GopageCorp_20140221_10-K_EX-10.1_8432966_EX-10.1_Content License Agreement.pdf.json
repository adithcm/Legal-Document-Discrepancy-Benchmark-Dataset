The License Term for each such Content Item terminates at the end of such 24-hour period.",
                "changed_text": "If Licensor instructs Licensee to delete or make inaccessible any Content Item because such Content Item may contain errors, is or could be subject to a third-party claim or for any other good faith reason, Licensee shall comply with such instruction within twelve (12) hours. The License Term for each such Content Item terminates at the end of such 12-hour period.",
                "explanation": "The modification shortens the compliance timeframe from 24 hours to 12 hours. This creates a potential contradiction with reasonable timeframes required to address complex content takedown requests, especially if legal review or technical adjustments are needed. While the contract does not specify a jurisdiction, general contract law implies a 'reasonable' timeframe for compliance, and a court could find 12 hours unreasonable depending on the complexity of the request.",

All payments under this Agreement shall be made in US dollars.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the payment deadline to the 30th day may cause inconsistencies, since most laws require that there must be some payments to the employee as frequent as at least monthly depending on the employment context and the agreement with the employee.",

                "explanation": "The change reduces the confidentiality period from five years to one year. This could conflict with trade secret laws, which in some jurisdictions (like under the Defend Trade Secrets Act in the US) may protect trade secrets indefinitely as long as they remain secret and provide economic value. A one-year confidentiality period might be deemed insufficient to protect certain types of confidential information, potentially undermining trade secret protection.",

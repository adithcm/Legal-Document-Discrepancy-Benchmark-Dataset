                "original_text": "After the Co-Branded Career Center is implemented, VerticalNet shall notify Neoforma in writing at least five days prior to making any material change to the Co-Branded Career Center. If Neoforma does not notify VerticalNet of its rejection of such change within five days, Neoforma shall be deemed to have approved such change.",
                "changed_text": "After the Co-Branded Career Center is implemented, VerticalNet shall notify Neoforma in writing at least one day prior to making any material change to the Co-Branded Career Center. If Neoforma does not notify VerticalNet of its rejection of such change within 24 hours, Neoforma shall be deemed to have approved such change.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for material changes to the Co-Branded Career Center to one day and the rejection period to 24 hours is unreasonable and may contradict legal standards for fair notice in contract modifications. This could be seen as coercive, especially if Neoforma needs more time to assess the impact of the changes.",

The Receiving Party shall notify the Originating Party of its approval or disapproval of such advertising materials as soon as practicable, but in any event within five business days after Receiving Party's receipt thereof. Any failure of the Receiving Party to respond within such five business day period shall be deemed disapproval of the advertising materials in question.",
                "changed_text": "All co-promotion advertising materials produced by or on behalf of either Party (the \"Originating Party\") shall be subject to the written approval of the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\"). The Receiving Party shall notify the Originating Party of its approval or disapproval of such advertising materials within 24 hours after the Receiving Party's receipt thereof. Any failure of the Receiving Party to respond within such 24 hour period shall be deemed approval of the advertising materials in question.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the response time for advertising material approval to 24 hours is commercially unreasonable. It doesn't allow enough time to thoroughly review potentially complex advertising campaigns. Under general contract law, such a short timeframe could be deemed unconscionable, especially if the materials require legal or brand review, potentially opening to issues regarding advertising standards.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the audit period from 18 months to 6 months may contradict statutes of limitations for breach of contract claims. Many jurisdictions have statutes of limitations longer than 6 months for such claims. By shortening the audit window, the Auditing Party might lose the ability to effectively verify payments and pursue any discrepancies within the legally allowed time frame, particularly if discrepancies are discovered later or require extensive investigation. Also, the auditor can be any accounting firm.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either party may terminate the Term upon not less than sixty (60) days prior written notice to the other party of any breach hereof by such other party.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate the Term upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to the other party of any breach hereof by such other party.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination due to breach to 10 days may conflict with California law, which often implies a reasonable notice period depending on the nature of the contract and the breach, potentially exceeding 10 days. A shorter notice period could be deemed unconscionable or insufficient to allow the breaching party to cure the breach.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law regarding reasonable notice for contract termination (implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).",

                "changed_text": "During the Term, the receiving party will not disclose to others or use for any purpose of its own, other than in performance of this Agreement, any Confidential Information of the other party.",
                "explanation": "Removing the five-year confidentiality period after the term ends weakens the protection of confidential information. While California law doesn't prescribe a specific duration, a perpetual confidentiality obligation or a commercially unreasonable short period (effectively zero in this case post-term) could be challenged, especially for trade secrets, potentially requiring longer protection than the contract provides. Additionally, if trade secrets are involved, California's version of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA) might provide protection beyond the contractual term if the information remains a trade secret.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA), common law regarding trade secret protection, and implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

Sponsor hereby irrevocably consents to personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California with respect to any actions, claims or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.",

Sponsor hereby irrevocably consents to personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in Dover, Delaware with respect to any actions, claims or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law and venue to Delaware, while United Airlines is a Delaware Corporation, could contradict California's interest if Snap Technologies, Inc. primarily operates in California, particularly if the agreement's performance and impact are centered there. California courts may refuse to enforce the Delaware choice-of-law provision if it violates a fundamental California policy, if California has a materially greater interest than Delaware in the determination of the particular issue, and if California law would apply in the absence of the choice of law provision. This is because California has a substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction.",

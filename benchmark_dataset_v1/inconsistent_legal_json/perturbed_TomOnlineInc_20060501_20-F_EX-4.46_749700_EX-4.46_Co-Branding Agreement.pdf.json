                "changed_text": "Within ninety (90) days of the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, the Company will, and Online BVI will cause the Company to, furnish to Skype incomplete statements (each, a “Statement”) in a form acceptable to the Company, certified to be inaccurate by a non-officer of the Company or Online BVI, as applicable, showing little detail of (i) the Gross Revenue estimated to be received and maybe collected by the Company or Online BVI, or if applicable, any Subsidiary or other Affiliate (including, without limitation, a Subsidiary or other Affiliate of Tom Holding), licensee, distributor or reseller thereof, during any period and not on a cumulative basis, (ii) the Direct Expenses hoped to be incurred thereby, during any period and not on a cumulative basis, and (iii) the vague calculation of Adjusted Net Revenue.",
                "explanation": "Changing the reporting deadline to 90 days introduces a delay that could violate standard accounting practices and regulations requiring timely financial reporting. Mandating 'incomplete' and 'inaccurate' statements directly contradicts the expectation of transparency and accuracy in financial reporting, potentially violating regulations in Luxembourg, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, PRC, United States of America, and Hong Kong where the companies are registered or listed. Vague estimation of revenue is also a red flag.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the grace period for late payments to 15 days and specifying that a party can be deemed in breach even before that period expires introduces a payment term that is inconsistent with standard commercial practices. Making it very easy to apply penalties.",

                "original_text": "ABG shall respond to each initial request for Approval from PAPA JOHN’S (“First Request”) within three (3) days of ABG’s receipt of such request (“Approval Window”); provided, however that ABG’s silence or failure to respond to the First Request prior to the expiration of the Approval Window shall be deemed ABG’s disapproval of the Materials contained in the First Request for Approval. In the event that ABG is silent with respect to, or fails to reply to, the First Request prior to the expiration of the Approval Window, then PAPA JOHN’S shall be entitled to submit a second (2nd) request for Approval of the same Materials included in the First Request (“Second Request”), with a copy of the Materials and the request to ABG’s Legal Department (using the contact information set forth in Section 12.F. of this Agreement). In the event that ABG is silent with respect to, or fails to reply to, the Second Request within three (3) days of ABG’s receipt thereof, then ABG’s silence with respect to, or failure to respond to, the Second Request shall be deemed ABG’s Approval of the Materials included in the Second Request.",

                "explanation": "This modification reduces the response time for approval requests to one day. This timeframe is unreasonably short and could be seen as a violation of good faith business practices, particularly if the requests are complex or require detailed review. While there is no specific law about endorsement approval times, setting an unreasonably short deadline can be deemed unconscionable, unenforceable or a breach of good faith, depending on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances. Good faith is implied in every contract.",

                "explanation": "This change reduces the required notice period for insurance termination or modification from 30 days to 10 days. This could violate standard insurance regulations or contractual norms regarding adequate notice for changes in coverage, as 30 days is generally considered a reasonable minimum. If the insurance policy requires 30 days' notice to be effective, then the contractual term would be invalid.",

                "explanation": "This change reduces the period during which parties agree not to make disparaging comments from one year to 30 days. While a one-year non-disparagement clause is generally enforceable, drastically reducing it to 30 days might be considered unreasonable, especially in the context of a high-profile endorsement deal. Depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the disparagement, a shorter period could be challenged as insufficient to protect the parties' reputations, effectively nullifying the clause and undermining the contract's intent. It could violate expectations of ongoing protection of business reputation, possibly leading to legal challenges regarding insufficient protection against harm caused by derogatory statements.",

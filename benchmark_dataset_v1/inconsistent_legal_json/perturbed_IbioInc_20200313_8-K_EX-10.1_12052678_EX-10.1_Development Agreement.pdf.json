                "original_text": "If either Party to this Agreement fails to perform or violates any material obligation of this Agreement, then, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the breaching Party specifying such failure or violation, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement without liability, unless: (a) the failure or violation specified in the default notice has been cured within the thirty (30) day notice period; or (b) the failure or violation reasonably requires more than thirty (30) days to correct, and the breaching Party has begun substantial corrective action to remedy the failure or violation within the thirty (30) day notice period and diligently pursues such action, in which event, termination shall not be effective unless sixty (60) days has expired from the date of the default notice without such corrective action being completed and the failure or violation remedied.",
                "changed_text": "If either Party to this Agreement fails to perform or violates any material obligation of this Agreement, then, upon ten (10) days written notice to the breaching Party specifying such failure or violation, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement without liability, unless: (a) the failure or violation specified in the default notice has been cured within the ten (10) day notice period; or (b) the failure or violation reasonably requires more than ten (10) days to correct, and the breaching Party has begun substantial corrective action to remedy the failure or violation within the ten (10) day notice period and diligently pursues such action, in which event, termination shall not be effective unless fifteen (15) days has expired from the date of the default notice without such corrective action being completed and the failure or violation remedied.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 30-day notice period for curing a breach of contract. The modified text shortens this period to 10 days. This creates a contradiction because in Texas, while there isn't a statutory requirement for a specific notice period, courts generally require a reasonable period. Ten days might be deemed unreasonable depending on the complexity of the breach and the effort required to cure it. This change makes the termination clause potentially unenforceable under Texas law if a court finds the notice period unreasonably short.",

                "changed_text": "Each of the parties agrees that for one (1) year from the date of disclosure, the receiving Party agrees to limit disclosure of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to only the receiving party's direct employees, and the receiving Party agrees to use minimal care and discretion to avoid disclosure, publication or dissemination outside of those employees as the receiving Party does with information of its own.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement stipulates a 5-year confidentiality period and requires the receiving party to protect confidential information with the same care they use for their own sensitive data. The modified text reduces the confidentiality period to one year, limits disclosure to only direct employees (excluding contractors), and lowers the standard of care for protecting confidential information. This introduces a legal contradiction because Texas trade secret law, specifically the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (TUTSA), requires reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy for information to qualify as a trade secret. Reducing the confidentiality period and lowering the standard of care could be deemed commercially unreasonable and insufficient to protect trade secrets under TUTSA, potentially invalidating the confidentiality provisions.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement allows 60 days for a party to decide whether to negotiate a license for an invention and 90 days for negotiations. The modified text reduces these periods to 10 and 30 days, respectively. While there is no specific statute in Texas dictating these timelines, reducing the decision and negotiation periods to such short durations could be deemed commercially unreasonable, especially for complex technology transfer agreements. A court could find that these shortened timeframes do not provide sufficient opportunity for due diligence and negotiation, potentially making the licensing provisions unenforceable due to unconscionability or failure to negotiate in good faith.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Within [***] ([***]) days of the achievement of any such milestone, Bioeq shall invoice the relevant milestone amount to Licensee and Licensee shall remit payment to Bioeq within [***] ([***]) days upon receipt of Bioeq’s invoice relating thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Within [***] ([***]) days of the achievement of any such milestone, Bioeq shall invoice the relevant milestone amount to Licensee and Licensee shall remit payment to Bioeq within 60 days upon receipt of Bioeq’s invoice relating thereto.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment term to 60 days. While not inherently illegal, excessively long payment terms (especially in the pharmaceutical industry where prompt payment is expected) could be deemed an unfair business practice in some jurisdictions or violate prompt payment laws if they exist in a specific state. This creates uncertainty regarding compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state-specific prompt payment laws or unfair business practice regulations.",
                "location": "Section 7.2"

                "changed_text": "As of the First Commercial Sale of any Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory, within 90 days after the end of each calendar quarter, Licensee shall deliver to Bioeq",
                "explanation": "Changing the reporting period to 90 days after each quarter could contradict standard accounting practices or specific regulatory requirements for financial reporting timelines, particularly if GAAP requires more frequent or timely reporting of sales and gross margins. This introduces non-compliance with potentially applicable regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential conflict with GAAP standards or SEC financial reporting requirements.",
                "location": "Section 7.3.2"

                "original_text": "Within [***] ([***]) days after the date of expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall furnish the Disclosing Party with a certificate, duly executed by an officer of the Receiving Party, confirming that the Receiving Party has complied with its obligations under this Section 11.4.",
                "changed_text": "Within 180 days after the date of expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall furnish the Disclosing Party with a certificate, duly executed by an officer of the Receiving Party, confirming that the Receiving Party has complied with its obligations under this Section 11.4.",
                "explanation": "Extending the deadline for providing the certificate of compliance to 180 days may be considered an unreasonably long delay. Such a delay could undermine the protection of confidential information, particularly in industries with rapidly evolving technology, or contravene typical expectations of compliance timeframes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing. While not a direct violation, the unreasonable delay could be viewed as acting contrary to the spirit of the agreement and undermining its purpose.",

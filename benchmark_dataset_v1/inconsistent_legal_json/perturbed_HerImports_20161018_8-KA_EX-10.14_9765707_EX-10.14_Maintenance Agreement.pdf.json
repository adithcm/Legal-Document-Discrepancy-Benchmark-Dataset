                "original_text": "The representations and warranties in this Agreement shall terminate one year from the Closing Date, and such representations or warranties shall thereafter be without force or effect, except any claim with respect to which notice has been given to the party to be charged prior to such expiration date.",
                "changed_text": "The representations and warranties in this Agreement shall terminate 90 days from the Closing Date, and such representations or warranties shall thereafter be without force or effect, except any claim with respect to which notice has been given to the party to be charged prior to such expiration date.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the survival period of representations and warranties to 90 days may be considered unconscionable or against public policy, especially in complex transactions. Nevada law does not specify a minimum survival period, but unreasonably short periods can be challenged in court.",
                "contradicted_law": "Nevada Revised Statutes and common law principles regarding fair dealing and unconscionability in contract law.",

                "explanation": "Requiring notice only via email may be insufficient and conflict with legal requirements for certain types of notices. Nevada law might require specific methods for legal notices. Relying solely on email could create issues of proof of delivery and receipt, especially in legal disputes.",

However, if any legal action or other proceeding is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement, or because or arising out of an alleged dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and other costs incurred in that action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it or he may be entitled.",

Under no circumstances will any party be entitled to recover attorney's fees, regardless of the outcome of any legal action.",
                "explanation": "Eliminating the prevailing party's right to recover attorney's fees in all circumstances might be unenforceable or against public policy in some cases. While Nevada generally respects contractual agreements on attorney's fees, there are situations where statutes or common law principles allow or mandate fee-shifting, overriding the contract.",

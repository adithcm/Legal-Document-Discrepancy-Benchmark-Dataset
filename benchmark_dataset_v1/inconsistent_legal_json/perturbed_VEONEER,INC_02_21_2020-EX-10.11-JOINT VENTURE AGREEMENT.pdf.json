                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Delaware.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law to Delaware when the agreement involves parties and entities based in Japan and China introduces a conflict of laws issue. Choice of law provisions are generally respected, but only if there is a reasonable relationship to the jurisdiction chosen and the law does not violate a fundamental policy of a state with a materially greater interest. Here, a US court might not enforce a Delaware choice of law clause when the JV primarily operates in Japan and China. This is because Japan and China have a greater interest in matters related to companies that are operated there. This makes compliance with contract law more ambiguous.",

                "original_text": "This Amendment shall only become effective upon the VNBJ Closing with respect to Article 1.1 and the VNBZ Closing with respect to Article 1.2, and shall terminate without any force or effect in the event that the VNBJ SPA and the VNBZ SPA are terminated in accordance with the terms thereof.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall become effective immediately upon signing by all parties, regardless of the VNBJ Closing or VNBZ Closing, and shall not terminate even if the VNBJ SPA and the VNBZ SPA are terminated.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the amendment is contingent upon the VNBJ and VNBZ closings. The change makes the amendment immediately effective and independent of these closings. This creates a legal contradiction because the stated purpose of the amendment is to address the consequences of those closings. If the closings don't occur but the amendment is effective, the amendment's provisions may become nonsensical or create unintended obligations and rights, as they were designed to function only after the closing events. The effectiveness of this agreement becomes very ambiguous which makes it impossible to fulfill.",

                "original_text": "Amounts not received within ten (10) days following their respective due dates shall be assessed a late charge equal to one and one-half percent (1 _%) per month of the overdue amount until paid, commencing on the eleventh day.",
                "changed_text": "Amounts not received within thirty (30) days following their respective due dates shall be assessed a late charge equal to five percent (5%) per month of the overdue amount until paid, commencing on the thirty-first day.",
                "explanation": "Florida Statute 687.03 limits interest rates to 18% per annum (1.5% per month) for most loans and transactions. Charging 5% per month (60% per year) violates this usury law. Additionally, shortening the grace period before a late fee is assessed can be viewed as predatory. While Florida law doesn't explicitly prohibit it, such a short grace period could be challenged under fair business practice regulations if deemed excessively harsh or unconscionable.",

Company shall make said books available to North or North’s representative on reasonable notice during the Term of this Agreement and the two (2) year period immediately following thereafter. The cost of any and all inspections shall be paid by North, unless an inspection shows an under-reporting or under-payment of more than five-percent (5%) for any quarterly period, in which event Company shall reimburse North for all such inspection costs.",
                "changed_text": "Said books and records shall be maintained for a one (1) year period following the expiration or termination of this Agreement. Company may, at its discretion, allow North or North’s representative to inspect the books on seven (7) days written notice during the Term of this Agreement and the one (1) year period immediately following thereafter. The cost of any and all inspections shall always be paid by North, regardless of the findings.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period to one year may violate generally accepted accounting principles that advise longer retention periods for financial records. Also, shifting the inspection cost burden to North regardless of audit findings discourages proper oversight and could be seen as an attempt to conceal financial irregularities. This can contradict the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "Company agrees that it will not use North’s Likeness or North’s Endorsement hereunder unless and until all Advertising Materials and their intended use has been approved by North. North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Company to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by North within seven (7) business days after receipt thereof. North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Company will be advised of the specific grounds for the disapproval. Company shall not use such disapproved Advertising Materials until it has written approval from North.",
                "changed_text": "Company has the right to use North’s Likeness or North’s Endorsement hereunder without requiring any approval from North. All Advertising Materials are deemed approved. If North disapproves any Advertising Materials, it will be at Company's descretion to remove the advertisment. Company may use such disapproved Advertising Materials without any approval from North.",
                "explanation": "Removing the approval requirement for advertising materials potentially violates North's right of publicity, which is protected under Florida law (and many other states). By eliminating North's control over his image and endorsement, the company can use his likeness in a way that damages his reputation. Also, allowing the use of 'disapproved' material directly contradicts the purpose of an endorsement agreement, creating misleading advertising.",

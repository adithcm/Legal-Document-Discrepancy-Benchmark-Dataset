                "explanation": "Extended payment terms to 90 days could violate prompt payment laws or industry standards, making it difficult for Dexcel to maintain cash flow and potentially breaching standard business practices. Although there isn't a specific law for 30 days in Israel, extending it this far can still be seen as not following the regular course of conduct.",

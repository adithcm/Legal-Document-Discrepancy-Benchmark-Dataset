The original text requires PlanetCAD to provide Dassault Systemes with necessary media and licensing keys within 2 weeks of the agreement's execution. The modified text extends this to 30 days. The change ensures compliance with business timelines, avoiding potential legal issues arising from an overly restrictive deadline.",

                "explanation": "Reduced timeframe for disputing tax withholdings. This creates an inconsistency by shortening the time the Non-Billing Party has to respond to a request for tax withholding. While there isn't a universal law mandating a specific timeframe, providing only 10 days could be deemed unreasonable and potentially contradict principles of good faith and fair dealing, especially if complex tax laws or international treaties are involved.",

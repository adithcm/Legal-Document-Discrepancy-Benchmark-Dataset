                "original_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 90 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'NET 30 days' to 'NET 90 days' for payment of the lead-finder fee could be a violation of prompt payment laws, depending on the state and the specific industry. While Texas doesn't have a specific prompt payment law for all industries, extending payment terms significantly without clear justification can be viewed as an unfair business practice, especially if it puts undue financial strain on Bravatek. Some states have laws requiring payments within a reasonable time frame, and 90 days may be considered unreasonable in certain contexts.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and potential violation of state-specific prompt payment laws if applicable to the industry or considered an unreasonable delay.",

Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof, and will be automatically renewed for one (1) additional twelve month period unless either party shall notify the other in writing of its intention not to renew. Such notice must be given fifteen (15) days prior to expiration of the original term. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon fifteen (15) days written notice.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for non-renewal or termination from 90 days to 15 days may be considered unreasonable and could violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. A shorter notice period may not provide sufficient time for the other party to find a replacement partner or adjust their business operations, leading to potential damages and legal challenges.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; potentially unconscionable contract term depending on the industry standard and bargaining power of the parties.",

The parties agree to take all steps\nreasonably necessary and appropriate to ensure that their employees, agents, and/or assistants treat all information as confidential and to\nensure that such employees, agents, and/or assistants are familiar with and abide by the terms of this Agreement.",

The parties agree to take all steps\nreasonably necessary and appropriate to ensure that their employees, agents, and/or assistants treat all information as confidential and to\nensure that such employees, agents, and/or assistants are familiar with and abide by the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period from five years to one year might be considered unreasonably short, especially concerning trade secrets or sensitive business information. Texas law, particularly regarding trade secrets, often assumes a longer period is necessary for protection. A one-year term could be deemed insufficient to prevent misappropriation and competitive harm, especially if the information has a longer lifespan of economic value. This could contradict reasonable expectations for confidentiality and trade secret protection.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially inadequate protection of trade secrets under Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (TUTSA) and common law principles related to confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.",

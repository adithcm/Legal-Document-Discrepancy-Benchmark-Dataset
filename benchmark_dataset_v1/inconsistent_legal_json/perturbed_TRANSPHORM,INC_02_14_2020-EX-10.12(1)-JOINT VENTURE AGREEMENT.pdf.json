                "original_text": "As soon as it becomes practicable after the end of each quarter, but not later than thirty (30) days thereafter, the Parties shall review the actual revenue of the Company versus the Business Plan based on the wafer loading by each of FSL/AFSL and TPH/TPH-A for the previous quarter, and if there are any shortfalls in revenue from the Business Plan in such quarter, the compensation for such shortfalls shall be made by a Party who caused such shortfalls to the Company within sixty (60) days after the end of the fiscal year of the Company where such quarter resides.",
                "changed_text": "As soon as it becomes practicable after the end of each quarter, but not later than sixty (60) days thereafter, the Parties shall review the actual revenue of the Company versus the Business Plan based on the wafer loading by each of FSL/AFSL and TPH/TPH-A for the previous quarter, and if there are any shortfalls in revenue from the Business Plan in such quarter, the compensation for such shortfalls shall be made by a Party who caused such shortfalls to the Company within thirty (30) days after the end of the fiscal year of the Company where such quarter resides.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the compensation should be made within 60 days. By changing it to 30 days, this timeline could create conflicts, especially in situations where a thorough financial reconciliation or dispute resolution is necessary, thus not providing sufficient time for proper compensation. Making it a legal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "In the event that the Board has been unable to resolve any matter set forth in Section 4.7 within thirty (30) Business Days after such matter was referred to the Board, then any Party may bring the matter to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer of FSL and the Chief Executive Officer of TPH (the “Designated Individuals”) for a decision, which joint decision of the Designated Individuals shall be final and binding on the Company, and the Parties shall direct the Directors nominated by them to exercise their voting rights and take all other necessary steps to ensure that such resolution is fully and promptly carried into effect. Should no solution be agreed upon within sixty (60) days after submission of the matter to the Designated Individuals, then any Party may refer the matter for resolution in accordance with the dispute resolution procedure set forth in Section 11.15.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that the Board has been unable to resolve any matter set forth in Section 4.7 within fifteen (15) Business Days after such matter was referred to the Board, then any Party may bring the matter to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer of FSL and the Chief Executive Officer of TPH (the “Designated Individuals”) for a decision, which joint decision of the Designated Individuals shall be final and binding on the Company, and the Parties shall direct the Directors nominated by them to exercise their voting rights and take all other necessary steps to ensure that such resolution is fully and promptly carried into effect. Should no solution be agreed upon within ninety (90) days after submission of the matter to the Designated Individuals, then any Party may refer the matter for resolution in accordance with the dispute resolution procedure set forth in Section 11.15.",
                "explanation": "By reducing the Board's resolution period to 15 days, it pressures decision-making, creating potential conflicts of interest, especially if stakeholders have differing opinions, thus resulting in insufficient time for resolution, which causes a legal contradiction. Increasing the time for solution agreed upon to 90 days after submission could introduce inefficiencies and delays in resolving critical issues, especially if such delays can cause damage.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'one hundred eighty (180) days' to 'thirty (30) days' significantly shortens the period during which FSL and AFSL can exercise the Put Option. This curtailed timeframe may unduly restrict their ability to assess market conditions or company performance before deciding to sell, which contradicts standards of reasonable opportunity.",

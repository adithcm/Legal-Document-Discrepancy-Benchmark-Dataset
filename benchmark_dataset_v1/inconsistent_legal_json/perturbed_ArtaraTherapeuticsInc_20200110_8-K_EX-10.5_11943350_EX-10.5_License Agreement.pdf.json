ArTara shall have […***…], after receipt of said copy to object to such proposed Publication because there is Confidential Information which needs protection. In the event that ArTara makes such objection, University and/or Principal Investigator shall refrain from submitting such Publication for a maximum of […***…] from date of receipt of such objection in order for ArTara to file patent application(s) directed to patentable subject matter contained in the proposed Publication. If in its review, ArTara identifies information it considers to be its Confidential Information, ArTara may require redaction of that Confidential Information; provided, however, that ArTara shall not require removal of information necessary for complete and accurate presentation and interpretation of the Program Data and results. The Publication shall occur within […***…] of the date the Project is closed or terminated, or University and/or Principal Investigator shall be free to publish Program Data and results at that time.",

ArTara shall have 2 days, after receipt of said copy to object to such proposed Publication because there is Confidential Information which needs protection. In the event that ArTara makes such objection, University and/or Principal Investigator shall refrain from submitting such Publication for a maximum of 5 days from date of receipt of such objection in order for ArTara to file patent application(s) directed to patentable subject matter contained in the proposed Publication.

                "explanation": "This change reduces the review and objection periods for publications and shortens the time to file patent applications, potentially conflicting with academic norms and best practices that usually allow for more thorough review and action which can affect intellectual property rights. Academic institutions often need more time, especially if external counsel needs to be involved to review the documents.",

Should ArTara fail to obtain replacement insurance providing comparable coverage within such 10-day period, University will have the right to termination this Agreement effective as of the end of the 10-day period without notice or any additional cure period.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for insurance changes to 10 days is inconsistent with industry standards and legal expectations, potentially violating the University's right to adequate protection. Insurance policies typically require at least 30 days' notice for significant changes.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring reasonable notice periods; potential conflict with industry best practices regarding insurance notification periods.",

                "explanation": "Delaying payment can introduce conflict by potentially impacting the University's research budget and financial planning, especially if the agreement does not specify clear interest or compensation for the extended payment timeline. It contradicts the reasonable and timely payment principle often implied or regulated in business transactions.",
                "contradicted_law": "While not directly violating a specific statute, it can create disputes based on implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts, where timely payment is reasonably expected.",

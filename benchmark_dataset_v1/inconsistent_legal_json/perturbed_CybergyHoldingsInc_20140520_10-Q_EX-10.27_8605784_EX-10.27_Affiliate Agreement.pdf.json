                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement may be terminated by either party at the expiration of its term or any renewal term upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party. Company acknowledges that this Agreement shall not be terminated for MA’s failure to follow an operating plan, standard procedure, training manual, or substantial equivalent published in Paragraph 3 (k) of this Agreement, except that Company does reserve the right to terminate this Agreement for MA’s failure to follow required procedures relating to the processing of sales contracts, invoices and billing related to Technology sold under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated by either party at the expiration of its term or any renewal term upon ten (10) days written notice to the other party. Company acknowledges that this Agreement shall not be terminated for MA’s failure to follow an operating plan, standard procedure, training manual, or substantial equivalent published in Paragraph 3 (k) of this Agreement, except that Company does reserve the right to terminate this Agreement for MA’s failure to follow required procedures relating to the processing of sales contracts, invoices and billing related to Technology sold under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 10 days may violate state laws that require longer notice periods for contract termination, especially if the agreement implies an ongoing business relationship or investment by the Marketing Affiliate. Many states require 30 days' notice.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates state laws regarding contract termination notice periods. Specifics depend on the state.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 3 days could be considered unreasonable and contradict principles of good faith and fair dealing implied in contract law. Many jurisdictions consider 10 days the legal minimum and even that can be challenged.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates principles of good faith and fair dealing; conflicts with standard commercial reasonableness.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the warranty claim period to 10 days is likely to be deemed unreasonably short under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and similar state laws, especially for complex technologies. UCC generally requires a reasonable time for warranty claims, and 10 days is unlikely to meet that standard. This significantly prejudices the MA's ability to discover and report defects.",

                "original_text": "With respect to each year of such Facility’s Warranty Period, the Service Fees shall be invoiced not later than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the calendar month in which the anniversary of the date of Commencement of Operations for such Bloom System occurred, and shall be payable within thirty (30) days of invoice. Interest shall accrue daily on the Service Fees not paid when due, at the lesser of the monthly rate of one and five-tenths percent (1.5%) or the highest rate permissible by law on such unpaid balance. Operator shall be under no obligation to provide or perform services hereunder for any Bloom System whose Service Fee has not been paid in full for the then-current warranty year.",
                "changed_text": "With respect to each year of such Facility’s Warranty Period, the Service Fees shall be invoiced not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the end of the calendar month in which the anniversary of the date of Commencement of Operations for such Bloom System occurred, and shall be payable within forty-five (45) days of invoice. Interest shall accrue daily on the Service Fees not paid when due, at a fixed monthly rate of two percent (2.0%), regardless of state usury laws. Operator shall be under no obligation to provide or perform services hereunder for any Bloom System whose Service Fee has not been paid within 30 days of the invoice due date.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within 30 days of invoice. The modified text extends the payment period to 45 days, which could conflict with prompt payment laws in some states that mandate shorter payment periods, especially for specific industries or government contracts. Additionally, setting a fixed monthly interest rate of 2.0% regardless of usury laws creates a contradiction, as some states have lower legal limits on interest rates. Also, the modified text stipulates that the Operator can stop performing services if payments are not made within 30 days of the invoice due date, potentially creating an inconsistency if state laws require a longer grace period or a formal notice process before service termination is permitted.",

                "original_text": "If such repair or replacement is not possible (as determined at Operator’s sole option and discretion), Operator will refund the Purchase Price of any such Bloom System to Owner notwithstanding Section 7.1. in which case Operator shall be deemed to have taken title to such Bloom System, and such Bloom System shall be deemed to no longer constitute a portion of the Portfolio. Operator shall make such determination as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 90 days of Operator’s receipt of notice of the claim unless the specific nature of the problem requires a longer period in which to make such determination. If it is determined that a Bloom System will be removed pursuant to this Section 2.5. Operator shall at its sole cost and expense remove the Bloom System and any other ancillary equipment (including the concrete pad and any other improvements to the Site to extent required under the Site Lease) from the Site, restoring the Site to its condition before the installation, including closing all utility connections in the manner required by all applicable Legal Requirement and Site Lease.",
                "changed_text": "If such repair or replacement is not possible (as determined at Operator’s sole option and discretion), Operator will refund 50% of the depreciated Purchase Price of any such Bloom System to Owner, regardless of Section 7.1. In such cases, Operator will assume immediate title to the Bloom System, and such Bloom System will no longer be part of the Portfolio. Operator has up to 180 days from the claim notice to make this determination, irrespective of the problem's nature. If removal is necessary, Owner will bear all costs associated with removing the Bloom System and restoring the site to its original condition, and Owner is responsible for closing all utility connections.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a full refund of the purchase price if repair is not possible. The modified text reduces this to 50% of the depreciated price, which may conflict with warranty laws requiring full compensation for non-performing goods. Additionally, it increases the determination period to 180 days and shifts the removal and restoration costs to the Owner, contravening standard warranty practices where the warrantor (Operator) bears these costs. In some jurisdictions, imposing site restoration costs on the owner may violate environmental regulations or lease agreements.",

                "original_text": "In the event a dispute, controversy or claim arises hereunder, including any claim whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict product liability or otherwise, the aggrieved Party will promptly provide written notification of the dispute to the other Party within ten (10) days after such dispute arises. Thereafter, a meeting shall be held promptly between the Parties, attended by representatives of the Parties with decision-making authority regarding the dispute, to attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the dispute. If the Parties are not successful in resolving a dispute within twenty-one (21) days, then, subject to the limitations on remedies set forth in Section 4.1 and Article 7, either Party may pursue whatever rights it has available under this Agreement, at law or in equity.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of any dispute arising under this Agreement, the aggrieved Party must notify the other Party within 5 days. If the Parties do not resolve the dispute within 10 days, they waive their right to pursue any legal remedies and agree to resolve the matter through mandatory arbitration conducted by Operator's chosen arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision will be final and non-appealable, and the Parties forfeit their right to a jury trial or any judicial review.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for legal recourse after a 21-day negotiation period. The modified text forces mandatory arbitration within 10 days, effectively shortening the allowed negotiation timeframe and potentially violating due process rights. Forcing arbitration by an arbitrator chosen by the Operator and waiving all rights to judicial review contradicts the principle of fair and impartial dispute resolution, conflicting with federal and state arbitration laws that require a fair process. Also, some state laws require a longer notification period for disputes.",

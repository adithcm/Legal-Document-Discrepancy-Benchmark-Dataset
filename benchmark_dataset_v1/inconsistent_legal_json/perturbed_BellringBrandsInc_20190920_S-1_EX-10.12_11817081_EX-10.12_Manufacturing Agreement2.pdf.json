                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (“MAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (“MAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. Approval of Heritage’s [***] facility by Premier is required by July 2, 2018, regardless of facility readiness, waiving any right to inspect.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a deadline of January 1, 2019, for Premier's approval of Heritage's facility, contingent on commercial aseptic production. The modified text forces Premier to approve the facility by July 2, 2018, immediately following the contract's start, irrespective of its readiness or Premier's ability to inspect. This creates an unreasonable and potentially illegal constraint on Premier's due diligence rights, violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, as it requires approval without allowing adequate time for assessment. Some states will look at the 'reasonableness' of contract terms, which could cause this to be challenged.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contract law; potentially violates state laws regarding reasonable inspection periods and due diligence.",

                "changed_text": "For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier must guarantee payment for [***] by June 1, 2022, regardless of production or delivery.",
                "explanation": "This change forces Premier to pre-pay by June 1, 2022, for goods deliverable during a six-month period commencing July 1, 2022, and ending December 31, 2022. This prepayment requirement, irrespective of production or delivery, could be deemed unconscionable or violate Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provisions related to payment obligations, which generally require payment upon tender of delivery unless otherwise agreed upon through commercially reasonable terms. Some states have consumer protection laws that prohibit unreasonable advance payments.",
                "contradicted_law": "Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provisions on payment terms (e.g., 2-310, 2-513); Potential violation of state consumer protection laws against unconscionable contract terms.",

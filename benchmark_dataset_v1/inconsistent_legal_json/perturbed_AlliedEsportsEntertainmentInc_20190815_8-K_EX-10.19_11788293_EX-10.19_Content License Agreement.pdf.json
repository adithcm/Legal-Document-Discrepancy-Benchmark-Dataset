                "original_text": "Notice shall be deemed given as follows: upon delivery if sent by courier service, express mail or personal delivery; and five (5) days after the date of mailing, postage prepaid, certified or registered mail if sent by mail.",
                "changed_text": "Notice shall be deemed given as follows: upon sending if sent by courier service, express mail or personal delivery; and one (1) day after the date of mailing, postage prepaid, certified or registered mail if sent by mail.",
                "explanation": "California law requires specific timeframes for providing legal notice. Reducing the mail delivery timeframe to one day and acknowledging on sending may not provide sufficient time for receipt and response, potentially violating due process requirements, especially where certified or registered mail is involved. This creates non-compliance with regulatory notice standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Code of Civil Procedure §1013, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 5(b)(2)(C)",

                "changed_text": "The other party shall have ten (10) days from the effective date of such notice in which to correct any such default(s) (except those which are not curable), and failing such correction by the end of such ten (10) day cure period, this Agreement shall thereupon immediately terminate.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to ten days may be deemed unreasonable and conflict with legal standards requiring adequate opportunity to cure a breach of contract. Certain complex breaches may require more than ten days to rectify, and this timeframe could be considered commercially unreasonable, making the clause potentially unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "By reducing the threshold for Zynga to bear the costs of the audit examination from $1,500 to $500, the contract imposes a potentially disproportionate financial burden on Zynga. This alteration could violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, especially if the audit costs significantly outweigh the adjustment amount, potentially violating established commercial standards.",

Each such royalty payment when made shall be accompanied by all interest so accrued.",

Each such royalty payment when made shall be accompanied by all interest so accrued.",
                "explanation": "Changing the late payment terms to accrue interest only after 60 days and at a rate of 1% annually may violate state usury laws or prompt payment laws in Maryland, which might require interest to accrue sooner and at a higher rate, especially for commercial transactions. Some states have laws specifying acceptable interest rates for late payments in commercial contexts and setting a period by which the person must pay for the item.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 10 days may be considered unreasonable and contradict the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in Maryland contract law.

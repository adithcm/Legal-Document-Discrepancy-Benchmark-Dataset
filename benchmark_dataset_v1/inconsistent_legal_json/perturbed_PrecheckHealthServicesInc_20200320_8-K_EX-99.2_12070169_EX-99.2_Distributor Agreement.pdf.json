                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be in effect until March 18. 2021, unless sooner terminated by either party upon (10) days written notice, without cause.",
                "explanation": "In Texas, a 30-day notice is reasonable and commonly accepted. Reducing it to 10 days creates a potential conflict, as it may be deemed insufficient time for the distributor to wind down operations or secure alternative arrangements, potentially leading to legal challenges based on breach of contract or unfair business practices. Under common law principles, reasonable notice is often required for contract termination, especially when significant investments or reliance are involved. This change introduces a risk of non-compliance with such principles.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of termination, the Distributor shall be entitled to receive all orders accepted by the Principal prior to the date of termination and may sell the ordered Products in the Territory. Payment to be made 120 days after shipment.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states 'Payment to be made upon shipment'. Changing this to 'Payment to be made 120 days after shipment' contradicts standard commercial practices and potentially violates prompt payment laws. In many jurisdictions, including the US, extending payment terms significantly beyond industry norms (typically 30-60 days) can be considered an unfair business practice. This change places an undue burden on the distributor, particularly post-termination, and increases the risk of legal disputes.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.",
                "explanation": "While seemingly innocuous, changing the governing law from Texas to Delaware can create significant legal inconsistencies if the parties' operations and the contract's subject matter are primarily centered in Texas. Different states have different interpretations of contract law, especially concerning distributor agreements. This change introduces uncertainty and potential conflicts, particularly if Texas law offers greater protections to distributors compared to Delaware law, or vice versa, regarding issues like termination, intellectual property, or dispute resolution. This contradiction could lead to forum shopping and legal challenges to the enforceability of specific contract provisions.",

                "original_text": "Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites within 48 hours after it becomes aware of such offending Content, regardless of any timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction because it forces the Licensee to adhere to a strict 48-hour removal window, which may be shorter than the timeframe mandated by the relevant Governmental Authority in China for content removal. Chinese law and regulations often allow for more flexibility and case-by-case evaluation, and do not always impose such a rigid deadline. By imposing this shorter timeline, the change puts the Licensee at risk of non-compliance with the actual requirements of Chinese regulatory bodies.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various regulations issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and other governmental authorities concerning content control and censorship, which do not uniformly prescribe a 48-hour removal deadline.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Any Dispute which remains unresolved within sixty (60) days after the date of such written notice shall be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the “Commission”) to be finally settled by arbitration in Beijing, PRC in accordance with the Commission’s then effective rules (the “Rules”) and this Section 10.12.",
                "changed_text": "Any Dispute which remains unresolved within thirty (30) days after the date of such written notice shall be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the “Commission”) to be finally settled by arbitration in Beijing, PRC in accordance with the Commission’s then effective rules (the “Rules”) and this Section 10.12.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the dispute resolution period from 60 to 30 days could be problematic under PRC law if it unreasonably curtails the opportunity for parties to genuinely attempt amicable resolution, which Chinese courts often favor and may see as a prerequisite to arbitration. While not directly illegal, it creates a situation where a rushed arbitration process might be viewed unfavorably and potentially challenged, thereby conflicting with the spirit of encouraging mediated settlements under Chinese legal practice.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the reimbursement period for tax payments to one day is inconsistent with standard business practices and might not align with the timelines required for financial transactions and internal approvals under Chinese tax law and accounting regulations. This unrealistic timeline could lead to breaches of contract due to the practical difficulties of complying within such a short timeframe, potentially violating regulatory expectations around reasonable payment schedules.",
                "contradicted_law": "Tax Administration Law of the People's Republic of China and related regulations, which do not mandate a one-day reimbursement period and imply a reasonable timeframe for financial transactions related to tax liabilities.",

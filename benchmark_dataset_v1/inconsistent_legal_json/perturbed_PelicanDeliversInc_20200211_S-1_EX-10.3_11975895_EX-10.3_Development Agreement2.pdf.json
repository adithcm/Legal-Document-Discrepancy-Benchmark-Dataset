                "original_text": "Client will notify Developer in writing of any failure of a Milestone Deliverable to comply with the Specifications, or of any other objections, corrections, changes or amendments required (a Change Request), within ten (10) days of such Milestone's Acceptance Test Date. Any Change Request shall be sufficient to identify, with clarity, any objection, correction, change or amendment to such Milestone Deliverable. In the absence of a Change Request from Client within the time periods detailed herein, the Milestone Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",
                "changed_text": "Client will notify Developer in writing of any failure of a Milestone Deliverable to comply with the Specifications, or of any other objections, corrections, changes or amendments required (a Change Request), within two (2) days of such Milestone's Acceptance Test Date. Any Change Request shall be sufficient to identify, with clarity, any objection, correction, change or amendment to such Milestone Deliverable. In the absence of a Change Request from Client within the time periods detailed herein, the Milestone Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for Milestone Deliverable failures to two days places an unreasonable burden on the client, potentially conflicting with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under Washington state law. Such a short timeframe may not allow adequate time for thorough testing and evaluation, potentially leading to premature acceptance of defective deliverables.",

                "original_text": "If any Milestone Deliverable does not satisfy the Client's Acceptance Test and Client provides Developer a Change Request concerning the same, Developer will have twenty (20) days from the receipt of such Change Request to correct the deficiencies, errors, corrections, modifications, bug-fixes or changes to the Deliverables as identified in the Change Request. Upon Client's receipt of a Milestone Deliverable following Developer's modification pursuant to Change Request (a Modified Deliverable), Client will have five (5) days to inspect, test and reevaluate such Modified Deliverable to determine acceptance. If Client does not notify Developer of any further failures, objections, changes, defects, or bugs in such Modified Deliverable, the Modified Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the developer's correction period to five days and the client's re-evaluation period to two days is unreasonable and may not provide sufficient time for adequate correction and testing. This could be interpreted as a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, as it creates conditions that make it difficult for the developer to adequately address issues and for the client to properly assess the revised deliverable, potentially leading to acceptance of substandard work, which could be an impediment to proper performance and thus be unconscionable under Washington law.",

Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all provision of Service and Deliverables by Developer will immediately cease余 (b) Client will pay Fees or all Services and Deliverables provided by Developer to Client up to and including the ate of termination余 and (c) in compliance with Section 6.1 of this Agreement, Developer will transfer all Works to Client as of the date of termination.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to one day is unreasonably short. Washington courts examine whether the notice period is so short as to be oppressive or shocking to the conscience. A one-day notice does not allow adequate time for the other party to prepare for the termination and could be seen as violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Washington State law.",

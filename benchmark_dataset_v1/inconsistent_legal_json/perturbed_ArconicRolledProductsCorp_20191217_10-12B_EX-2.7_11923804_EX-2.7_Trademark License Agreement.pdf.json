                "original_text": "In the event that Licensee has not taken appropriate steps to restore such quality within one-hundred twenty (120) days after notification by Licensor, Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that Licensee has not taken appropriate steps to restore such quality within fifteen (15) days after notification by Licensor, Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for the Licensee to restore quality after notification to 15 days is unreasonably short, potentially conflicting with reasonable timeframes required for quality restoration processes. This could be considered an unfair business practice under state laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws regarding unfair business practices and reasonable contract performance timeframes.",

                "original_text": "Licensor and Licensee will be entitled to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the event the other party is in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder and shall fail to remedy any such default within one hundred twenty (120) days after notice thereof by the non-breaching party.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor and Licensee will be entitled to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the event the other party is in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder and shall fail to remedy any such default within thirty (30) days after notice thereof by the non-breaching party.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 30 days might be considered insufficient in certain jurisdictions, especially for complex contractual obligations. A 120-day cure period is more standard; shortening it increases the risk of wrongful termination claims and potential breach of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may not be assigned by Licensee under any circumstances.",
                "explanation": "This modification imposes an absolute prohibition on assignment by the Licensee, eliminating the standard clause that consent should not be unreasonably withheld. This is potentially problematic under state contract law, as many jurisdictions recognize the right to assign contracts unless explicitly prohibited and even then, such prohibitions are sometimes disfavored, especially if they unreasonably restrain trade. An absolute prohibition could be deemed an unreasonable restraint and thus unenforceable.",

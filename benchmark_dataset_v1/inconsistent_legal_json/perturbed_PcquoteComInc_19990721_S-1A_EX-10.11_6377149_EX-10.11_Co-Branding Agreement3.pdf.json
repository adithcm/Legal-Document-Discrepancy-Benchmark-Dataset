Watley, Inc., with its principal place of business at\n33 West 17th Street, New York, New York 10011 (\"ABW\").",

                "explanation": "Changing the effective date from 1998 to 1997 could create statute of limitations issues regarding the enforcement of the agreement. Depending on the specific cause of action and applicable state law, the statute of limitations could have expired, rendering the agreement unenforceable. This introduces a legal contradiction since a stale agreement might be presented as valid.",

                "explanation": "Deleting key sections of the original agreement (Section 2. A and B) and not replacing it with anything creates ambiguity and could render parts of the original agreement unenforceable. Contract law requires clearly defined terms, and removing these terms entirely can lead to legal disputes about the parties' obligations. This could lead to a breach of contract, which contradicts principles of contract law.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the very purpose of the amendment. The original clause states that any conflicts should be resolved in favor of the SECOND AMENDMENT. The modified version states the Original Agreement prevails irrespective of the Amendment, thus rendering the entire amendment potentially useless, conflicting with intent to modify the original agreement.",

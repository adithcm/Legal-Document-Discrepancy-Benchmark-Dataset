                "original_text": "If the indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Claim and in such event, the maximum liability of the indemnifying Party as to such Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer.",
                "changed_text": "If the indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within two (2) days after its receipt of such notice, the indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Claim and in such event, the maximum liability of the indemnifying Party as to such Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time for the indemnified party to respond to a settlement offer to two days could be considered unreasonable and conflict with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in most contracts, as well as principles of due process if litigation ensues. Such a short time frame may not allow sufficient time for proper evaluation of the offer and consultation with legal counsel.",

Each Monthly Statement shall be fully completed and signed and certified as accurate by one of XSPA’s senior officers.",
                "changed_text": "With respect to Products sold in Stores in the Territory, XSPA shall deliver to Calm within forty-five (45) days after each calendar month, a statement (“Monthly Statement”) identifying (i) the total sales of each Product during said calendar month and (ii) the total commission paid to XSPA employees or contractors under Section ​8.02, which shall include a breakdown by each individual Product and Store. Each Monthly Statement shall be completed at XSPA's convenience.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the delivery of the Monthly Statement to 45 days could violate accounting laws requiring companies to deliver timely financial data to investors. Moreover, this amendment eliminates the obligation to sign and certify the statement as accurate, directly conflicting with regulations that mandate businesses to guarantee the truth and precision of their financial reports. This undermines investor confidence and regulatory compliance.",

                "original_text": "Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Calm (at its sole expense) may engage a third party to audit XSPA’s inventory of any and all Product Collateral then on hand at each Store and XSPA shall promptly return or dispose of such inventory as instructed by Calm at Calm’s sole expense. In addition, if Calm does not provide XSPA with instructions within twenty (20) days of the termination or expiration of this Agreement, XSPA shall be permitted to dispose of any inventory of any and all Product Collateral then on hand at each Store. The Parties agree to promptly settle all accounting associated with such inventory of any and all Product Collateral then on hand at each Store upon termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Calm (at its sole expense) may engage a third party to audit XSPA’s inventory of any and all Product Collateral then on hand at each Store and XSPA shall return or dispose of such inventory at their discretion. In addition, if Calm does not provide XSPA with instructions within five (5) days of the termination or expiration of this Agreement, XSPA shall be permitted to dispose of any inventory of any and all Product Collateral then on hand at each Store. The Parties will not engage in any reconciliation or accounting practices.",
                "explanation": "Changing the timeline to 5 days for Calm to provide instruction on inventory disposal puts undue pressure on Calm and may violate the implied duty of good faith. Furthermore, removing any requirement for settling accounts associated with the inventory directly contradicts standard accounting principles and could be seen as an attempt to avoid financial obligations.",

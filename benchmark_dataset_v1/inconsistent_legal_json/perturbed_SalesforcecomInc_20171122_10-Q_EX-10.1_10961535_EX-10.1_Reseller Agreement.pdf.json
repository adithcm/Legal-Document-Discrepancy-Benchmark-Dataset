                "explanation": "The original text specifies that if the dates of the parties’ signatures are separated by a period greater than ten (10) business days, the agreement is null and void. By changing this period to thirty (30) business days, we introduce a deviation from what is considered a standard or reasonable timeframe for contract execution, potentially creating enforceability issues, as unduly long periods may suggest a lack of mutual agreement or changed circumstances. While there is no specific law that states the days need to be a maximum of 10, this change is relevant in general contract law regarding mutual agreement. A period of more than 10 days could invalidate the contract due to potentially lacking agreement. This is under the common law.",

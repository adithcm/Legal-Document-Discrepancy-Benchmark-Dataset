                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "in the event that either party fails to make its capital contribution, in whole or in part, within [90] days of the due date, or in the event that any of the conditions precedent set forth in Article 34 of this Contract have not been satisfied or waived within [120] days of the date on which this Contract is signed by the parties",
                "changed_text": "in the event that either party fails to make its capital contribution, in whole or in part, within [30] days of the due date, or in the event that any of the conditions precedent set forth in Article 34 of this Contract have not been satisfied or waived within [45] days of the date on which this Contract is signed by the parties",
                "explanation": "The modified text shortens the timeframe for capital contribution and satisfaction of conditions precedent. This may create non-compliance with Chinese law, which requires reasonable timeframes for fulfilling contractual obligations, especially concerning foreign investments.",

                "changed_text": "The Party claiming Force Majeure shall inform the other Party whenever practically possible and shall furnish sufficient evidence of the occurrence and duration of such Force Majeure at its earliest convenience.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 15-day deadline for providing evidence of a Force Majeure event. The modified text removes this deadline, replacing it with vague language like 'whenever practically possible' and 'at its earliest convenience.' This is a legal contradiction because it conflicts with the principle that contractual terms should be clearly defined and enforceable, which is essential under Chinese Contract Law.",

                "original_text": "If the dispute is not resolved through consultations within sixty (60) days after one Party has served a written notice on the other Party requesting the commencement of consultations, then any Party may refer the dispute to arbitration in Singapore under the auspices of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the rules of that Centre for the time being in force and the provisions of Article 117 of this Contract.",
                "changed_text": "If the dispute is not resolved through consultations within thirty (30) days after one Party has served a written notice on the other Party requesting the commencement of consultations, then any Party may immediately refer the dispute to arbitration in Singapore under any regulations.",
                "explanation": "The modified text reduces the consultation period before arbitration from sixty to thirty days. Although seemingly minor, this change can be problematic as it may conflict with requirements for sufficient negotiation periods before resorting to arbitration. It could be argued that thirty days is insufficient, especially in complex international joint ventures. Also, changing 'Singapore International Arbitration Centre' to 'any regulations' may make conflict of laws.",

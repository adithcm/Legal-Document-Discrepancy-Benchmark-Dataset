Even if the Master Franchise Agreement contains provisions that are inconsistent with the law, the Master Franchise Agreement will control.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts California law, which states that the law controls in cases of inconsistency between franchise agreements and the Business and Professions Code concerning termination or non-renewal. The modified text attempts to supersede state law, making it legally unenforceable.",

Prospective franchisees are encouraged to consult private legal counsel to determine the applicability of California and federal laws (such as Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281) to any provisions of a franchise agreement restricting venue to a forum outside the State of California.",

Prospective franchisees are not required to consult legal counsel regarding the applicability of California or federal laws.",
                "explanation": "This modification is inconsistent with California law and general principles of fairness in franchise agreements. Requiring the franchisee to bear all mediation costs in a forum outside of California can be considered an unconscionable burden. Further, discouraging consultation with legal counsel directly undermines the franchisee's ability to understand their rights and obligations, which is against public policy and potentially violates disclosure requirements under California franchise law.",

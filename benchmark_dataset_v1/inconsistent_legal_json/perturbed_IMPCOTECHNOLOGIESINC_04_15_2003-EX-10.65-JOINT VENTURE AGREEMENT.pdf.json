                "original_text": "If within half an hour from the time appointed for holding a General Meeting a quorum as specified above is not present, the General Meeting shall stand adjourned by seven (7) days on the same time and place or to such other day and such other time as the Board may determine and if at such adjourned General Meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for holding the General Meeting, the members present shall constitute a valid quorum .",
                "changed_text": "If within one hour from the time appointed for holding a General Meeting a quorum as specified above is not present, the General Meeting shall stand adjourned by two (2) days on the same time and place or to such other day and such other time as the Board may determine and if at such adjourned General Meeting a quorum is not present within one hour from the time appointed for holding the General Meeting, the members present shall constitute a valid quorum.",
                "explanation": "The original text adheres to the legal standards in India for adjourning a general meeting when a quorum is not present and setting a reasonable period for the adjourned meeting. The modified version reduces the adjournment period to two days, which is inconsistent with standard practices and could potentially violate shareholder rights by not allowing sufficient time for arranging attendance at the adjourned meeting.",

                "original_text": "Meetings of the Board shall take place in Delhi or such other place as may be decided by the Board. For calling a Board meeting, a notice of at least fourteen [14 ] days in advance in writing shall be given to each of the Directors, including those outside India. However, a meeting of Directors may be called by giving a shorter notice provided it is mutually agreed by the Directors. Subject to the provisions of the Act, a resolution circulated and signed by all Directors shall be effective, as a resolution duly passed at a meeting of Directors. Sitting fees, travel and stay expenses (incurred by the Directors) for attending the Board meeting, if claimed by the Director(s) shall be met by the JVC as per Articles of Association of the JVC.",
                "changed_text": "Meetings of the Board shall take place in Delhi or such other place as may be decided by the Managing Director. For calling a Board meeting, a notice of at least three [3] days in advance in writing shall be given to each of the Directors, including those outside India. However, a meeting of Directors may be called by giving a shorter notice provided it is approved by the Managing Director. Subject to the provisions of the Act, a resolution circulated and signed by the Managing Director shall be effective, as a resolution duly passed at a meeting of Directors. Sitting fees, travel and stay expenses (incurred by the Directors) for attending the Board meeting, if claimed by the Director(s) shall be met by the JVC at the discretion of the Managing Director.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly reduces the notice period for board meetings to three days, potentially violating corporate governance norms that require adequate notice for directors to prepare and attend meetings. Further, allowing the Managing Director to approve shorter notices and sign resolutions unilaterally undermines the board's collective decision-making authority, conflicting with the principle of board oversight.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides a standard confidentiality obligation, which ensures the protection of sensitive information for a reasonable duration. This modification eliminates the confidentiality obligations, and permits unlimited disclosure of confidential information, which contradicts standard business practices and legal expectations regarding the protection of trade secrets and proprietary data.",

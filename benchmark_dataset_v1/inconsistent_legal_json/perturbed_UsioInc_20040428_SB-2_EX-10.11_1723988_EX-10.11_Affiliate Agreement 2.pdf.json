                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for non-renewal from 30 days to 10 days conflicts with standard contract law principles and potentially state laws that often require reasonable notice periods, particularly in agreements with automatic renewal clauses. 10 days is likely too short a period to be considered 'reasonable'.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a default from 30 days to 5 days is inconsistent with typical commercial reasonableness standards. Many jurisdictions would consider 5 days insufficient, especially for complex defaults, and would deem it unconscionable. This change significantly favors one party and undermines fairness.",

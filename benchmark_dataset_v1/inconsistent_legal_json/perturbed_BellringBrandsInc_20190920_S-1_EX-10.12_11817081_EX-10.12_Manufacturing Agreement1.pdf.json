                "original_text": "Heritage agrees to disclose to Premier and provide a list, upon request, of any material violations or deficiencies noted during any inspection by the FDA, United States Department of Agriculture, PHS, or any other federal, state or local health or food regulatory agency of the Heritage Facilities, Jasper Facility or any other Facility used to produce the Products, which have a material adverse effect on the manufacture or packaging of the Products. Heritage agrees to provide to Premier each FDA Form 483 and any related Establishment Inspection Report (“EIR”) that is received from the FDA by Heritage or Jasper, along with any response provided to the regulatory authority by Heritage or Jasper, as long as this Agreement is in effect. Heritage agrees to do so within [***] of Heritage or Jasper receiving the Report or of sending the response as appropriate.",

Heritage agrees to provide to Premier each FDA Form 483 and any related Establishment Inspection Report (“EIR”) that is received from the FDA by Heritage or Jasper, along with any response provided to the regulatory authority by Heritage or Jasper, as long as this Agreement is in effect. Heritage agrees to do so within 90 days of Heritage or Jasper receiving the Report or of sending the response as appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires Heritage to provide the FDA Form 483 and EIR report within a certain timeframe. Delaying the timeframe to 90 days could impede Premier's ability to respond promptly to regulatory concerns, potentially conflicting with regulations that demand faster responses to issues discovered during inspections. This creates a contradiction because food safety regulations often require more immediate corrective actions and notifications.",

For Product produced at Heritage facilities, Heritage shall invoice Premier on the date the Products are loaded onto Premier’s carrier. Payment terms for all these Product invoices shall be [***]. Failure by Premier to meet payment terms of any invoice shall result in interest being imposed on any unpaid balance at the rate of [***] per month, pro rata on a daily basis for partial months, accrued from its due date or in the event such rate exceeds that permitted to be charged by law, the maximum rate permitted by law.",

For Product produced at Heritage facilities, Heritage shall invoice Premier on the date the Products are loaded onto Premier’s carrier. Payment terms for all these Product invoices shall be 90 days. Failure by Premier to meet payment terms of any invoice shall result in interest being imposed on any unpaid balance at the rate of 25% per month, pro rata on a daily basis for partial months, accrued from its due date or in the event such rate exceeds that permitted to be charged by law, the maximum rate permitted by law.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces an extended payment term of 90 days and drastically increases the interest rate to 25% per month. Both changes contradict standard commercial practices and potentially usury laws. Many states have usury laws that set limits on the maximum interest rate that can be legally charged on a debt. A 25% monthly interest rate (300% annually) far exceeds these limits in most jurisdictions, including California, where the contract is governed.",

                "explanation": "The original contract requires the insurance carrier to give Premier a certain amount of written notice for any cancellation or change in coverage. Reducing the notice period to 5 days does not provide Premier adequate time to find a replacement. Also changing the time to provide the certificate insurance to 120 days from the original time frame is too long. This directly contrasts with what is considered commercially reasonable and standard in insurance contracts.",

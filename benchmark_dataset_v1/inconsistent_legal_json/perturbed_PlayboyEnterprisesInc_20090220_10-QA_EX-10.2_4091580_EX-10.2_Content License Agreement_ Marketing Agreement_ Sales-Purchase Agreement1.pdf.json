EFS shall, at its own expense, submit to Client or its designee for written approval, samples of any EFS Produced Merchandise and the Materials at each stage of development thereof, which shall include, but not be limited to: (i) an initial sketch or photograph prior to any manufacture thereof; (ii) a sample prototype or equivalent acceptable to Client; and (iii) two final production-quality samples of that which will be mass produced or manufactured. EFS must obtain Client’s written approval of each stage of development before proceeding to the next stage, and in no event shall EFS commence or permit the mass manufacture, advertising, promotion, sale or distribution of any EFS Produced Merchandise or Materials unless and until EFS has received Client’s written approval of the samples provided pursuant to (iii) of this Section 1. In the event Client fails to provide its approval or disapproval of any or all things submitted to Client pursuant to this Section 1 within ***** of Client’s receipt thereof, EFS may send written notice to Client advising no response was received.

                "explanation": "The reduction of the approval timeframe to '1 day' for Playboy's decision conflicts with general business practices and could be deemed unreasonable, thereby risking enforceability under contract law principles, particularly regarding implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause 'as approved by Client' allows EFS to enter agreements that may contain clauses unfavorable to Client, without Client's consent. This contradicts agency law principles, where a principal (Client) is generally bound by the actions of their agent (Licensee) within the scope of authority. If Licensees enter agreements detrimental to the Playboy brand, Client has limited recourse.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period from 30 days to 10 days for a material breach of contract may be deemed unreasonably short, potentially conflicting with principles of equity and fairness, especially for complex breaches requiring significant remediation.

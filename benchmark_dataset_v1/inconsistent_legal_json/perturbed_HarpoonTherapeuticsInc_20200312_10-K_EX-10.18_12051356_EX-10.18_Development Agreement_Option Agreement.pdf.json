                "original_text": "Within [***] after the Effective Date, the Parties shall establish a joint governance committee (the “Joint Governance Committee” or “JGC”). The JGC shall consist of [***] representatives from each of the Parties, each with the requisite experience and seniority to enable such person to make decisions on behalf of the Parties with respect to the issues falling within the jurisdiction of the JGC. From time to time, each Party may substitute [***] or more of its representatives to the JGC on written notice to the other Party.",
                "changed_text": "Immediately after the Effective Date, the Parties shall establish a joint governance committee (the “Joint Governance Committee” or “JGC”). The JGC shall consist of [***] representatives from each of the Parties, each with the requisite experience and seniority to enable such person to make decisions on behalf of the Parties with respect to the issues falling within the jurisdiction of the JGC. Each Party may substitute [***] or more of its representatives to the JGC with no prior notice to the other Party.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for a reasonable timeframe ([***]) to establish the JGC, providing some flexibility. The modified text mandates immediate establishment, which is unrealistic and potentially contradictory to practical requirements for setting up such a committee, such as scheduling conflicts or logistical challenges. Also, requiring no prior notice for substituting representatives contradicts principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

The Parties shall agree on the minutes of each meeting promptly, but in no event later than the next meeting of the JGC.",
                "changed_text": "The chairperson of the JGC may prepare and circulate for review and approval of the Parties minutes of each meeting at their convenience. The parties are not required to agree on the minutes.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a timeframe ([***]) for circulating meeting minutes and requires agreement on those minutes. The modified text removes the deadline, grants the chair discretion over preparation and circulation, and eliminates the need for parties to agree. This creates inconsistencies with standard practices that promote accountability and creates uncertainty. It also removes the enforceability of the minutes as a record of decisions.",

The contents and frequency of these reports is not fixed.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a specific reporting schedule and content, granting Harpoon a clear right to receive this information. The modified text makes reporting discretionary, undermining Harpoon's ability to monitor the project's progress and creating uncertainty around diligence obligations. This directly conflicts with the spirit of providing information and could prevent Harpoon from exercising other rights.",

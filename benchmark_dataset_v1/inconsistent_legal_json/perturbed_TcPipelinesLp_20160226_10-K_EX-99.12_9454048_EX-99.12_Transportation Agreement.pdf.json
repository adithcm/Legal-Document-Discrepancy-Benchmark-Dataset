                "original_text": "Any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved by the parties shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan.",
                "changed_text": "Any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved by the parties shall be determined exclusively through binding arbitration, initiated within 30 days of the dispute arising, governed by the laws of the province of Ontario, Canada.",
                "explanation": "This clause originally specifies that Michigan law governs disputes. The modified clause mandates binding arbitration in Ontario, Canada, and sets a 30-day deadline for initiating arbitration.  This could contradict Michigan's statutes of limitations for contract disputes, which may allow for a longer period to file a lawsuit. Also, forcing arbitration in Ontario when the contract is between a Michigan based company and a Delaware based company could conflict with standard choice of law principles and create enforceability issues.",

                "changed_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement, all obligations of both Shipper and Transporter to each other, arising under this Agreement, shall immediately cease, including any pre-existing obligations, regardless of whether they were performed before the date of termination.",
                "explanation": "This modification stipulates that upon termination, ALL obligations cease, including those that existed prior to termination. This conflicts with general contract law principles, which state that obligations that have accrued before termination (e.g., payment for services already rendered) typically survive termination. It can also conflict with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates written notices. The modified clause allows oral notices, which can conflict with legal requirements for written notice in certain contractual contexts, like breach of contract or force majeure. Moreover, the contract states that the addresses do not constitute mandatory notification points, which implies either party may claim to not be notified under legal disputes of the contract.",

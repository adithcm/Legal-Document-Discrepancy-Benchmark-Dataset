                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Company shall not create or use any corporate or trade names that include the Arizona Licensed Trademarks, other than those in existence immediately prior to the Effective Date. No later than thirty (30) days following the Closing, each of AWP and the Company shall change its respective corporate name and trade name and cause its organizational documents to be amended to remove any reference to “Armstrong.”",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall not create or use any corporate or trade names that include the Arizona Licensed Trademarks, other than those in existence immediately prior to the Effective Date. No later than ninety (90) days following the Closing, each of AWP and the Company may change its respective corporate name and trade name if they choose, and can cause its organizational documents to be amended to remove any reference to “Armstrong.”",
                "explanation": "Delaying the name change to ninety days is inconsistent with business norms which encourages companies to quickly change names. Also, making the trade name change optional rather than obligatory introduces uncertainty and potential ambiguity, as the original text mandated this change within a strict timeframe.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the event that Arizona declines to institute any Proceedings against third-party infringers or violators of any Arizona Licensed Patents, regarding activities that would fall within the Company Field if conducted by the Company, within forty-five (45) days after being notified or becoming aware of such infringing conduct, the Company or Buyer shall have the right to institute any Proceedings against such third-party infringers or violators. In the event that the Company or Buyer elects to institute such Proceedings, Arizona will reasonably cooperate with the Company or Buyer in such Proceedings, and the Company or Buyer shall reimburse Arizona for all reasonable costs and fees incurred by Arizona as a result of such cooperation. Such cooperation by Arizona will include joining such Proceeding as a party, if deemed necessary by the Company or Buyer.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that Arizona declines to institute any Proceedings against third-party infringers or violators of any Arizona Licensed Patents, regarding activities that would fall within the Company Field if conducted by the Company, within fifteen (15) days after being notified or becoming aware of such infringing conduct, the Company or Buyer shall have the right to institute any Proceedings against such third-party infringers or violators. In the event that the Company or Buyer elects to institute such Proceedings, Arizona has no obligation to cooperate with the Company or Buyer in such Proceedings, and the Company or Buyer shall not be reimbursed for any costs and fees incurred by Arizona.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe to fifteen days for Arizona to act on patent infringements places an unreasonable burden on Arizona and makes it more difficult for them to adequately assess and respond to potential infringements. Eliminating the obligation for Arizona to cooperate and reimburse expenses hinders the Company's ability to effectively enforce the licensed patents.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement if the other Party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within thirty (30) days’ written notice thereof; provided, however, that if the material breach of this Agreement by the breaching Party is limited to the Licensed Copyrights, Licensed Know-How, the Arizona Licensed Patents, or the Licensed Trademarks, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to termination solely with respect to the affected part of the license (i.e., in such case, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Copyrights or the Licensed Know-How or the Arizona Licensed Patents or the Licensed Trademarks, as applicable).",
                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement if the other Party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within ten (10) days’ written notice thereof; provided, however, that if the material breach of this Agreement by the breaching Party is limited to the Licensed Copyrights, Licensed Know-How, the Arizona Licensed Patents, or the Licensed Trademarks, the non-breaching Party shall not be entitled to termination with respect to the affected part of the license (i.e., in such case, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety)",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from thirty to ten days provides insufficient time for the breaching party to address and rectify the issue, potentially leading to premature termination of the agreement. Also, the changed text that the non-breaching Party can terminate the agreement entirely even if the material breach is limited to a specific license is disproportionate to the nature of the breach",

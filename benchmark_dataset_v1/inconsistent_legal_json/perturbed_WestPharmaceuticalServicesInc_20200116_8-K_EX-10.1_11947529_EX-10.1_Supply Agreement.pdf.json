All claims for any cause whatsoever, whether based in contract, negligence or other tort, strict liability, breach of warranty or otherwise, shall be deemed waived unconditionally and absolutely unless Seller receives written notice of such claim not later than one hundred fifty (150) days after Buyer's receipt of Product as to which such claim is made.",

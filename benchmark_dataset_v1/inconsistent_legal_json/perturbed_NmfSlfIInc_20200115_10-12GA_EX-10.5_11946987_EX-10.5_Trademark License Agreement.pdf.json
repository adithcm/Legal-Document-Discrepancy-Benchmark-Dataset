                "original_text": "Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor’s quality standards in any material respect, such Licensee shall take appropriate steps, in a commercially reasonable time frame, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to cure such noncompliance.",
                "changed_text": "Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor’s quality standards in any material respect, such Licensee shall take appropriate steps, in a commercially reasonable time frame, not to exceed fifteen (15) days, to cure such noncompliance.",
                "explanation": "This modification reduces the cure period for noncompliance to 15 days. Depending on the nature of the noncompliance and the jurisdiction, a 15-day period might be considered unreasonably short and could contradict legal standards of reasonableness, especially in cases involving complex operational adjustments. This creates a potential breach of contract even if the licensee is diligently working to cure the issue but needs more time.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles of 'reasonableness' and 'good faith' implied in all contracts, specific state laws regarding cure periods in commercial contracts, depending on jurisdiction.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be terminable (a) by the Licensor (i) at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that the Licensor or the Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of the Licensee’s use of the Licensed Mark or (ii) upon fifteen (15) days’ written notice by the Licensor to the Licensee or (b) by the Licensee (i) at any time in the event such Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of the Licensee’s rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Licensor or (ii) upon fifteen (15) days’ written notice by the Licensee to the Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires a sixty-day written notice for termination. Reducing this to fifteen days could be problematic if it violates implied duties of good faith and fair dealing. Depending on the investment made by the Licensee and the market conditions, a fifteen-day notice may be deemed commercially unreasonable, particularly if it leads to significant financial losses or disruption of business operations. Some jurisdictions might view this as an unfair or oppressive termination clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, potential violation of state-specific franchise laws or business opportunity laws if the agreement is interpreted as such.",

                "changed_text": "For six (6) months following termination of this Agreement, the Licensee shall specify on all public- facing materials in a prominent place and in prominent typeface that the Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with the Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by the Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",
                "explanation": "Extending the disclaimer period to 24 months protects the Licensor’s brand and minimizes confusion in the market, avoiding risks related to consumer protection and anti-trust laws by maintaining clear distinctions between businesses. Reducing it to 6 months may not effectively prevent consumer confusion or adequately protect the Licensor's brand, particularly if the Licensee's business remains similar and operates in the same market. This could lead to trademark infringement issues if consumers mistakenly associate the Licensee with the Licensor. Moreover, failing to adequately disclaim association might be construed as a violation of consumer protection laws by creating a misleading impression of continued affiliation.",

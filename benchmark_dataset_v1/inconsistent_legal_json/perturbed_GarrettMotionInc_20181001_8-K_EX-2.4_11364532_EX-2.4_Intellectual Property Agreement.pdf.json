                "original_text": "For a period of five (5) years after the Distribution Date, in the event any member of the SpinCo Group, in SpinCo’s reasonable judgment, requires a license under any Honeywell IP in order to initiate and pursue any new technical projects not covered by the licenses granted in Section 3.01(a), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to license such Honeywell IP to the applicable member of the SpinCo Group on commercially reasonable terms.",
                "changed_text": "For a period of one (1) year after the Distribution Date, in the event any member of the SpinCo Group, in SpinCo’s reasonable judgment, requires a license under any Honeywell IP in order to initiate and pursue any new technical projects not covered by the licenses granted in Section 3.01(a), the Parties are not obligated to negotiate and Honeywell has the right to refuse licensing such Honeywell IP to the applicable member of the SpinCo Group on commercially reasonable terms.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the negotiation period for licensing Honeywell IP from five years to one year. Additionally, Honeywell is not obligated to negotiate and has the right to refuse licensing such Honeywell IP, potentially restricting SpinCo's ability to pursue new technical projects and contradicts the intent of good-faith negotiation, raising concerns under contract law about fair dealing and potentially violating antitrust principles if it unreasonably restricts competition. Courts favor reasonable terms, and this might not be considered reasonable.",

                "changed_text": "Honeywell is not required to give notice to SpinCo of any actual or threatened, unauthorized use or infringement of the SpinCo IP of which it receives notice, in each case for a period of five (5) years after the Distribution Date.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for Honeywell to notify SpinCo of IP infringements, SpinCo loses the ability to take timely action to protect its IP. This could be seen as a violation of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, especially if Honeywell becomes aware of infringements that could severely damage SpinCo's business. This raises concerns about whether the contract is unconscionable or against public policy, particularly if SpinCo relied on Honeywell's notification for IP protection.",

                "changed_text": "SpinCo shall, and shall cause each member of the SpinCo Group to, remove any Honeywell Trademarks or reference to the Honeywell Business appearing on any Honeywell Content at their own discretion following the Distribution Date, and they have no liability if trademarks are not removed.",
                "explanation": "By allowing SpinCo to remove Honeywell trademarks or references at their own discretion and absolving them of liability for not doing so, this weakens Honeywell's brand control and could lead to trademark infringement issues if Honeywell's trademarks continue to be used in a way that confuses consumers. This could violate trademark laws and create potential liability for Honeywell, as they are ultimately responsible for protecting their trademarks. The change conflicts with standard trademark licensing practices and increases the risk of consumer confusion.",

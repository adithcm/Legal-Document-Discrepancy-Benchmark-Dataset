                "original_text": "Subject to the provisions of this Section, in the event that CHT does not pay the Royalties or any portion thereof, when due, Ehave may immediately suspend CHT’s and each of its End Users’ right to access and use the Ehave Companion Solution. However, Ehave shall not suspend CHT’s or its End Users’ right to access and use the Ehave Companion Solution or any End User Data by reason of CHT’s good faith withholding of any payment or amount, or in the event of any payment dispute between the parties arising under or concerning this Agreement, in each case, unless and until such dispute is resolved pursuant to Section 19, provided that CHT shall have a period of five (5) Business Days to pay any amount agreed to in settlement or determined by arbitration pursuant to Section 19 to be payable by it.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the provisions of this Section, in the event that CHT does not pay the Royalties or any portion thereof, when due, Ehave may immediately suspend CHT’s and each of its End Users’ right to access and use the Ehave Companion Solution. However, Ehave shall not suspend CHT’s or its End Users’ right to access and use the Ehave Companion Solution or any End User Data by reason of CHT’s good faith withholding of any payment or amount, or in the event of any payment dispute between the parties arising under or concerning this Agreement, in each case, unless and until such dispute is resolved pursuant to Section 19, provided that CHT shall have a period of one (1) Business Day to pay any amount agreed to in settlement or determined by arbitration pursuant to Section 19 to be payable by it.",
                "explanation": "By reducing the payment period following a dispute resolution to one business day, the contract creates an inconsistency, as it fails to provide the licensee with an adequate or legally reasonable timeframe to comply with the settlement or arbitration decision. This unreasonably short timeframe is particularly problematic as it does not account for standard banking procedures or potential delays in fund transfers, potentially leading to unwarranted service suspensions and breach of contract claims due to circumstances beyond CHT's immediate control.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination without cause from thirty business days to ten business days could be considered unreasonable. This is especially true given the potential need for Ehave to find a replacement licensee or adjust its business operations. Shorter notice periods can contradict standard business practices that typically require more extended periods to allow for orderly transitions.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for data destruction to \"immediately\" after termination or expiration is problematic, as it may conflict with data retention policies in Canada. It deprives CHT and its End Users of a reasonable opportunity to ensure that all necessary data has been migrated. Further, immediate destruction could potentially clash with legal or regulatory requirements for data preservation, such as pending litigation or audits.",

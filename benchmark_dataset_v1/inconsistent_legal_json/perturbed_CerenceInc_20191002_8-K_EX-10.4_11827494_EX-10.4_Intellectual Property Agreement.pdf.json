                "original_text": "Section 2.02. Recordation. The relevant assignee Party shall have the sole responsibility, at its sole cost and expense, to file the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements and any other forms or documents with the appropriate Governmental Authorities as required to record the transfer of any registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP that is allocated under the Separation Agreement, as applicable, and the relevant assignor Party hereby consents to such recordation.",

The relevant assignee Party shall have the sole responsibility, at its sole cost and expense, to file the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements and any other forms or documents with the appropriate Governmental Authorities as required to record the transfer of any registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP that is allocated under the Separation Agreement, as applicable, but such filing must be completed within 30 days of the Distribution Date. The relevant assignor Party has no obligation to consent to such recordation, and may withhold consent at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a legal contradiction because it imposes a strict 30-day deadline for filing intellectual property assignment agreements. Such a rigid deadline may not be feasible or legally compliant in all jurisdictions, especially considering the variations in governmental authority processing times and requirements. Furthermore, giving the assignor Party the right to withhold consent directly contradicts the purpose of the Separation Agreement, which mandates the transfer of IP rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by jurisdiction; however, generally, laws governing intellectual property assignment do not impose such rigid deadlines and require mutual cooperation for effective transfer.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as of the Distribution Date, Nuance hereby grants to SpinCo and the\nmembers of the SpinCo Group a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual and irrevocable, transferable (subject to ARTICLE VIII), sublicensable\n(subject to Section 3.01(g)) license under the Nuance Patents, solely to the extent that claims of the Nuance Patents cover products or services of the\nSpinCo Business in the SpinCo Field of Use, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof, in each case to make, have made, use, sell, offer for\nsale, import and otherwise exploit such products and services, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof.",

This license shall automatically expire after 1 year from the distribution date.",
                "explanation": "By removing the terms \"perpetual and irrevocable\", and adding a condition for the license to automatically expire after one year introduces a contradiction with typical IP licensing practices, where perpetual licenses are common for significant IP transfers in corporate separations. The initial agreement aimed for long-term stability in IP usage, while the modification imposes an unreasonable restriction.",

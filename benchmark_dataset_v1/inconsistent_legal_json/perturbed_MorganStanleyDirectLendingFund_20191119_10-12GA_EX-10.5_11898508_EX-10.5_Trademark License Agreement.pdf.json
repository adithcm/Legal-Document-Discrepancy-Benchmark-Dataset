If either party materially breaches one or more of its obligations hereunder, the other party may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice, if the breaching party does not cure such breach within 15 days after written notice thereof (or any mutually agreed extension). Licensor may terminate this Agreement immediately, effective upon written notice, if (i) Licensee attempts to violate Section 8 or (ii) a sublicensee materially breaches its sublicense in a manner that harms the Brand, and (a) such sublicensee does not cure the same within 15 days after notice from Licensor or Licensee or (b) Licensee does not terminate such sublicense within 15 days after notice from Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "Section 4.3. Termination for Breach. If either party materially breaches one or more of its obligations hereunder, the other party may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice, if the breaching party does not cure such breach within 5 days after written notice thereof (or any mutually agreed extension). Licensor may terminate this Agreement immediately, effective upon written notice, if (i) Licensee attempts to violate Section 8 or (ii) a sublicensee materially breaches its sublicense in a manner that harms the Brand, and (a) such sublicensee does not cure the same within 5 days after notice from Licensor or Licensee or (b) Licensee does not terminate such sublicense within 5 days after notice from Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 15-day cure period for breaches. Reducing this to 5 days may be considered an unreasonably short cure period under New York law (which governs the agreement based on Section 9.4) for certain types of breaches, especially if significant remedial action is required. This creates an inconsistency.",

                "explanation": "New York law requires that contract terms, including notice provisions, be commercially reasonable. Eliminating standard notice methods (like email or express mail) and replacing them with impractical methods like telepathy and carrier pigeon would be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable, especially given the business context. Also, prohibiting electronic mail could be a violation of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN Act) if it is interpreted to invalidate electronic signatures or records.",

                "explanation": "Choosing the \"laws of the Principality of Sealand\" is likely to be viewed as unenforceable. Sealand is a micronation, and its legal system (or lack thereof) is not recognized or enforceable in the United States. This clause would likely be struck down as against public policy, and a court would likely apply the law that has the most significant relationship to the contract (likely New York, given the location of the parties and other contractual provisions).",

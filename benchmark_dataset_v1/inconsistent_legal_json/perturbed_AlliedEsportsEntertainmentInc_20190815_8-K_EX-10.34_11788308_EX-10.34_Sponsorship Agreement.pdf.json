                "original_text": "Without limiting any other provision of this Section 6.3, if at any time Newegg reasonably determines that Allied’s use of the Newegg Marks fails to comply with this Agreement or to conform to the Acceptable Quality Standards, Allied shall, within five (5) days of receipt of notice from Newegg, correct its use of the Newegg Marks so that its use is in compliance with this Agreement and the Acceptable Quality Standards or cease using, and remove, the Newegg Marks from all of Allied’s videos, streams and other publications in all media (“Allied’s Correction Action”).",

                "explanation": "The original text provides Allied with five days to correct its use of Newegg Marks. Decreasing this cure period to one day is unreasonable and potentially conflicts with general contract law principles, which typically allow a reasonable timeframe for curing breaches, especially given the scope of potential corrective actions (removing marks from 'all of Allied’s videos, streams and other publications in all media'). California law generally requires a 'reasonable time' for cure, and one day might be deemed insufficient depending on the circumstances.",

If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates a 30-day period for amicable resolution before legal proceedings can commence. Reducing this period to 10 days could be deemed insufficient, particularly for complex disputes, and thus conflict with California's requirements for meaningful pre-litigation dispute resolution. Many California courts encourage longer periods for mediation or settlement discussions, especially in commercial disputes.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for material breaches from fifteen days to two days creates an unreasonably short timeframe for Allied to rectify any failures.

                "explanation": "This change extends the deadline for appointing the Technical Committee. While not directly illegal, delaying the appointment could impact project timelines and efficient management. If projects are time-sensitive due to regulations (e.g., clinical trial phases), a delayed appointment may impede regulatory compliance and progress milestones.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties may notify each other about the achievement of the Scope, as mentioned in point 2 (“the Results”) , that may be subject to Industrial and Intellectual Property Rights, at their convenience from the achievement of such Results and to cooperate in the evaluation of the existence of the necessary requirements for the patenting/registration of such Results.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 'promptly' notification and timeframe gives a longer period to determine the existence of Intellectual Property rights, which can lead to non-compliance. This goes against regulations since there needs to be a timeframe set for time-sensitive items.",

                "changed_text": "Withdrawal must be exercised by written notice, to be sent to the other Party by certified letter or PEC, with minimum notice of 15 days.",
                "explanation": "This reduces the minimum notice period for withdrawal from the JV. While seemingly minor, reducing it to 15 days from 30 days can potentially disrupt the ongoing development process of clinical trial programs, especially if significant financial or resource commitments were made based on the assumption of a longer notice period. The original time must be at least 30 days.",

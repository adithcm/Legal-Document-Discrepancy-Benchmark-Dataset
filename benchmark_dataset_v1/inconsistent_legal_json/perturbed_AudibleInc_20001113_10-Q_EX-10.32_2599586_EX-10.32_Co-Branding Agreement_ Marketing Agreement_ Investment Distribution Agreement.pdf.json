                "original_text": "Payments called for by this Section 5 which are not\nreceived within five (5) business days after the date upon which payment is due\nwill bear interest at a rate equal to the lesser of one and one-half percent (1-\n1/2%) per month or the maximum legal rate permitted under the controlling Laws.",
                "changed_text": "Payments called for by this Section 5 which are not received within thirty (30) business days after the date upon which payment is due will not bear any interest, irrespective of state or federal usury laws.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts standard business practices and potentially violates state usury laws, which often mandate interest on late payments and set maximum allowable interest rates. Removing any interest for late payments and setting the payment due date to an extreme of thirty days introduces non-compliance.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter beginning on the first full quarter [three (3) month period] of the Agreement and continue on a quarterly basis thereafter for the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter beginning on the last day of the contract term. There will be one lump sum payment for all sales to the Northern California Chapter at the end of the contract.",
                "explanation": "California law requires charitable donations from commercial ventures to be distributed to the intended recipient within a reasonable timeframe. Delaying the entire donation until the contract's end may be deemed unreasonably late, potentially violating California's laws regarding charitable solicitations and the timely transfer of funds to the intended beneficiaries.",

                "changed_text": "The Company may, at its sole discretion, provide a sales report if requested. There is no obligation to provide specific sales data, and the format and content of any provided report will be determined solely by the Company.",
                "explanation": "Under California law, parties to a contract have a duty of good faith and fair dealing. By making the provision of sales reports entirely discretionary and allowing the company to determine the format and content, the modified text undermines the NFLA-NC's ability to verify the accuracy of the donation amounts. This could be seen as a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it allows the company to potentially obscure the actual sales figures and underpay the donation.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement is considered valid and enforceable immediately upon one party's signature, regardless of other parties' signatures.",
                "explanation": "Contract law requires mutual agreement and consideration. Stating the agreement is valid upon only one signature directly contradicts the fundamental requirement of mutual consent and agreement to terms by all parties involved. It can allow one party to bind the others without their knowledge or consent, which is not enforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Basic principles of contract formation requiring mutual assent and consideration under both California and federal contract law.",

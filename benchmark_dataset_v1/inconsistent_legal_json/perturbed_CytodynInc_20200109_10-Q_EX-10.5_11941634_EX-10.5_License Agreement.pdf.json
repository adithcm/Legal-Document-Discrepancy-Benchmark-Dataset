                "original_text": "Within forty-five (45) days following the end of each Calendar Quarter after the First Commercial Sale of each Licensed Product in the Territory, Vyera shall provide CytoDyn with a report in a form reasonably acceptable to CytoDyn containing the following information for the applicable Calendar Quarter for such Licensed Product: (a) the amount of gross sales of the Licensed Product in the Territory; (b) an itemized calculation of Net Sales in the Territory showing reasonably detailed deductions; provided for in the definition of “Net Sales”; (c) a reasonably detailed calculation of the royalty payment due on such sales; (d) an accounting of the number of units of the Licensed Product sold; and (e) the application of the reduction, if any, made in accordance with the terms of Section 8.7. Vyera shall pay all amounts due to CytoDyn with respect to Net Sales by Vyera or its Affiliates for such Calendar Quarter at the time of the submission of such quarterly report.",
                "changed_text": "Within ninety (90) days following the end of each Calendar Year after the First Commercial Sale of each Licensed Product in the Territory, Vyera shall provide CytoDyn with a report in a summary form containing the following information for the applicable Calendar Year for such Licensed Product: (a) the amount of gross sales of the Licensed Product in the Territory; (b) a calculation of Net Sales in the Territory showing total deductions; (c) a calculation of the royalty payment due on such sales; (d) an accounting of the number of units of the Licensed Product sold; and (e) the application of the reduction, if any, made in accordance with the terms of Section 8.7. Vyera shall pay all amounts due to CytoDyn with respect to Net Sales by Vyera or its Affiliates for such Calendar Year one hundred and eighty (180) days after the submission of such yearly report.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires quarterly reports and payments within 45 days, while the modified text only requires annual reports and allows 180 days for payment after report submission. This is a significant change that negatively impacts CytoDyn's financial interests and reporting transparency. Some states require more frequent and timely royalty reporting and payments, especially in exclusive licensing agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract, potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and potential conflict with state-specific regulations on royalty payments and reporting frequency. May also violate SEC regulations if CytoDyn relies on timely reports for financial reporting.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the obligations of confidentiality and non-use with respect to any Know-How or trade secret within such Confidential Information shall survive such ten (10) year period for so long as such Confidential Information remains Know-How and/or protected as a trade secret under Applicable Law.",

The obligations of confidentiality with respect to any trade secret within such Confidential Information shall expire after five (5) years.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 10-year confidentiality period, with trade secrets protected indefinitely. The modified text reduces the confidentiality period to 5 years and eliminates indefinite trade secret protection. This conflicts with trade secret law, which protects trade secrets as long as they remain confidential. Additionally, the reduced standard of care from 'not less than the efforts such Receiving Party uses to maintain in confidence its own confidential or proprietary information of similar kind and value' to 'reasonable efforts' weakens the protection of confidential information.",
                "contradicted_law": "State and federal trade secret laws, such as the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) and the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which protect trade secrets indefinitely as long as they remain confidential. Contract law principles requiring adequate consideration and mutual benefit, as weakened confidentiality provisions may render the contract less enforceable.",

The modified text eliminates this obligation, allowing Vyera to sell off inventory without compensating CytoDyn. This undermines CytoDyn's financial interests and conflicts with contract law principles requiring fair compensation for intellectual property use.",

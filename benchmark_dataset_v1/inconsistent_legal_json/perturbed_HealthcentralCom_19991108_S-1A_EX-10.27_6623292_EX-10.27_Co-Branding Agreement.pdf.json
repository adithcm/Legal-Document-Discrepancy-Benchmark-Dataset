This Monthly Payment shall be due by the 30th\n     day of the following month;",
                "explanation": "Modifying the payment due date to the 30th of the following month introduces potential inconsistency with standard business practices and could violate prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions, which often require payment within a shorter timeframe (e.g., 15-30 days).",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state-specific prompt payment laws for commercial transactions. The Ontario Construction Act requires payments to be made within 28 days, though this act doesn't directly apply, it showcases the general guideline of the Canadian legal system.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the advance written notice for audits to two days is unreasonable and may conflict with legal standards of fairness and adequate notice, potentially hindering the audited party's ability to prepare and cooperate. Auditing standards often require a more substantial notice period to ensure proper preparation and prevent undue disruption.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the restriction period on using user data for competitive purposes to one month is insufficient to protect the confidentiality of user data and could conflict with privacy regulations, especially concerning health information, which often require longer protection periods to prevent misuse or unauthorized disclosure.

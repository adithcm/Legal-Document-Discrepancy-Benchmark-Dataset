                "explanation": "The original text specifies that royalty payments are to be made no later than January 30th. Changing this date to March 15th creates a potential conflict with wage payment laws in Arizona, which requires prompt payment of earned wages, especially upon termination or separation. Delaying royalty payments for an extended period could violate these laws, as royalties can be considered a form of compensation for services rendered.",
                "contradicted_law": "Arizona Revised Statutes § 23-353 regarding timely payment of wages.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, EHS or EHN may immediately terminate the Services Term without notice\nshould Dr. Murray be in breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "EHS or EHN, on the one hand, and Dr. Murray, on the other, may terminate any Services Term of this Agreement by delivering 15 days\nwritten notice to the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, EHS or EHN may immediately terminate the Services Term without notice\nshould Dr. Murray be in breach of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a 60-day written notice is required to terminate the agreement. Reducing this to 15 days may be considered an unreasonably short notice period, particularly if Dr. Murray relies on this agreement for a significant portion of his income. Some jurisdictions could view this as a breach of good faith and fair dealing, as it does not allow adequate time for Dr. Murray to find alternative opportunities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contract law; potentially Arizona employment laws regarding reasonable notice periods.",

The mediation shall take place no more than sixty (60) days after written notice from the party requesting\nsuch mediation. Any disputes remaining unresolved after mediation shall be settled by binding arbitration conducted in Phoenix, Arizona\nunder the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).",

Any disputes remaining unresolved after mediation shall be settled by binding arbitration conducted in Phoenix, Arizona\nunder the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).",
                "explanation": "The original text allows 60 days for the mediation to take place after a written notice. Reducing this to 15 days could be problematic. It may not provide sufficient time to adequately prepare for mediation, secure legal representation, or gather necessary evidence. This may contradict principles of fairness in dispute resolution.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates principles of procedural fairness and adequate opportunity to prepare for dispute resolution, which could be challenged under Arizona law regarding arbitration and mediation.",

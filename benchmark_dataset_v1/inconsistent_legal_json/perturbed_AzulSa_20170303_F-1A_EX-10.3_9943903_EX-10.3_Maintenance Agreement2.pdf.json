                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year could be deemed unreasonably short, especially considering the sensitive nature of the information exchanged in maintenance agreements. This may conflict with trade secret laws and general principles of contract law that require reasonable protection of confidential information, potentially making the clause unenforceable under New York law, which governs the contract.",

                "explanation": "Setting the time limit to come to an amicable settlement as 'immediately' and also the appointment of arbitrators within 24 hours is unreasonable and might be seen as contradictory to due process rights under New York law, especially considering the complexity of disputes that might arise in such a maintenance agreement. Courts in New York may refuse to enforce such strict timelines.",

                "explanation": "Removing the written notice requirement and stating that Parties shall immediately come to a settlement contradicts fundamental principles of contract law relating to dispute resolution. New York law, which governs the agreement, generally requires clear communication and a reasonable opportunity to respond in dispute resolution processes.

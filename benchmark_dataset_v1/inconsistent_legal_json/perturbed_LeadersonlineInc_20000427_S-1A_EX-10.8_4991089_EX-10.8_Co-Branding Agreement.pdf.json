                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 15-day payment window for underpaid amounts following an audit. This has been shortened to 5 days. Such a short payment period may violate state laws requiring a reasonable timeframe for businesses to address discrepancies and remit payments, especially considering potential complexities in accounting and reconciliation.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows a 30-60 day cure period for breaches. The modified text reduces this to 10-20 days. This shorter cure period may be deemed unreasonable and conflict with principles of good faith and fair dealing, particularly for complex breaches that require more time to resolve.

                "explanation": "The original text mandates a 90-day notification period for renewal by LeadersOnline and a 30-day response from VerticalNet. The revised terms shorten these periods to 15 and 5 days respectively. Such a condensed notification period could be considered commercially unreasonable, especially concerning the complexity and significance of renewing such agreements. The original time frame provides a more practical frame to decide to renew a partnership than the changed values.",

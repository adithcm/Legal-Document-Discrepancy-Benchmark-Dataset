                "original_text": "Within three business days of receiving Application Provider's written update, Excite@Home will remove any advertising from Application Provider's listed competitors displayed on the Co-Branded Pages.",
                "changed_text": "Within ten business days of receiving Application Provider's written update, Excite@Home will remove any advertising from Application Provider's listed competitors displayed on the Co-Branded Pages.",
                "explanation": "This change increases the time Excite@Home has to remove competitor ads from three to ten business days. While seemingly minor, this delay could cause harm to Application Provider if competitorsâ€™ ads run longer than agreed. This delay may fail to meet industry standard reasonable timelines for ad removal after notification, potentially violating advertising standards and fair competition laws. Most advertising agreements require prompt action, making an extended period potentially unreasonable.",

                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment deadline post-termination from 30 to 90 days. This could cause financial distress if the payout delay puts undue strain on the operational costs. This extension potentially introduces non-compliance with prompt payment regulations, which in many jurisdictions dictate quicker payment timelines to prevent undue financial burden, making the 90-day term potentially unreasonable and legally questionable.",

                "changed_text": "Any notice under this Agreement will be in writing and delivered by standard mail, and will be deemed given twenty (20) days after deposit in the mail.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces accepted methods of delivery such as personal delivery, express courier, confirmed email, or facsimile with standard mail and changes the receipt timeframe to 20 days after mailing. This extended timeframe is inadequate and poses risks, especially for time-sensitive legal notifications, potentially impacting parties' rights. The change could conflict with regulations that require reasonable and timely notification, making a 20-day standard mail timeline problematic for critical legal and contractual communications.",

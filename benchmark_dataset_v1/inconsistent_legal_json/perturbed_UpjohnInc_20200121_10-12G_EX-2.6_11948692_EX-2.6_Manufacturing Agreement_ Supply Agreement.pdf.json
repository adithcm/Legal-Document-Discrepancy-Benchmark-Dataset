If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of Customer’s rights under this Agreement. If any payment required to be made under this Agreement is not made within twenty (20) days of the applicable date when such payment is due (the “Late Payment Date”), interest shall accrue on such past due amount from the Late Payment Date until the date payment is actually made at a quarterly rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Three-Month U.S. dollar LIBOR (Reuters Page LIBOR01) on the Late Payment Date (or the next Business Day if such Late Payment Date is not a Business Day), and (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law. Time for any payments hereunder shall be of the essence.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum with respect to a particular Product or Products, Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within ninety (90) calendar days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute within 120 calendar days. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall result in a waiver of all of Customer’s rights under this Agreement. If any payment required to be made under this Agreement is not made within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the applicable date when such payment is due (the “Late Payment Date”), no interest shall accrue on such past due amount from the Late Payment Date until the date payment is actually made. Time for any payments hereunder is not of the essence.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts typical prompt payment laws and general contract principles. Extending the payment term to 90 days without reasonable justification may violate certain state laws regarding payment terms for goods and services. Waiving all customer rights upon any payment is an unconscionable term. Removing interest on late payments and stating that time is not of the essence removes any incentive for prompt payment.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the rejection timeframe to 1 business day and removing the auto-acceptance clause creates an impossibly short review window. This contradicts contract law principles of reasonable opportunity to review and accept terms, potentially making the acceptance terms unenforceable.",

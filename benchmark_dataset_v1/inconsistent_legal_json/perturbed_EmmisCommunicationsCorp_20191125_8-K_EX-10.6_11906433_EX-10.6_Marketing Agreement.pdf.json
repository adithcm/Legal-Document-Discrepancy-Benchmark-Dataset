Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Event of Default will not be deemed to have\noccurred until fifteen (15) days after the non-defaulting party has provided the defaulting party with written notice specifying the\nEvent of Default and such Event of Default remains uncured.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Event of Default will be deemed to have\noccurred if the defaulting party does not provide remediation for the specified breach within five (5) days after the non-defaulting party has issued a written notice articulating the Event of Default.",
                "explanation": "The modified text shortens the cure period for an Event of Default from fifteen (15) days to five (5) days. This could be considered unreasonably short and conflict with general principles of contract law, especially in New York or Indiana (where the companies are located), which usually implies a reasonable time to cure a default. What is considered a reasonable time to cure a default depends on the circumstances surrounding the default, but a five-day cure period is unlikely to be considered a reasonable amount of time for most breaches of contract. Thus, the shortened period may not be enforceable.",

                "changed_text": "18.\nNotices. Any notice pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed delivered only when actually received by the intended recipient, regardless of the method of delivery.",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes specific and reasonable methods and timelines for delivering notices (personal delivery, overnight courier, or certified mail with return receipt). The modified version states that notice is only effective upon actual receipt, regardless of the delivery method. This introduces ambiguity and potential conflict with standard contract law. If a party sends a notice via certified mail as originally allowed, but the recipient claims they never received it, the notice is deemed ineffective. This shift contradicts the principle that proper dispatch of notice, as defined in the original contract, constitutes effective notice. This increases the burden of proof and may lead to disputes.",

                "explanation": "By removing the 'which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed' clause, the modified text now permits the Programmer to assign the agreement freely without needing the Licensee's consent. In certain jurisdictions, this lack of restriction on assignment may be viewed unfavorably, especially if it substantially alters the Licensee's rights and obligations. Furthermore, removing the Licensee's successors and permitted assigns as beneficiaries while specifically stating the contract is for the benefit of the Programmer could imply that the Licensee has no recourse, which significantly alters the balance of the agreement and could be viewed as an unconscionable or unenforceable term.",

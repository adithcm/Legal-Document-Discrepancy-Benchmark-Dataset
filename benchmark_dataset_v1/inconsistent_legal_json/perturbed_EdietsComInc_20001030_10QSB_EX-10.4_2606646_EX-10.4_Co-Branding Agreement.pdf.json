                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a 'timely manner to be agreed upon by the parties,' which is vague. The modified text forces eDiets to respond within 24 hours. Such a short timeframe could be considered unreasonable, depending on the volume and complexity of the requested content updates. This may contradict general contract law principles of 'reasonableness' regarding response times, particularly if the requests are extensive.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows Women.com to withdraw permission to use its marks with 72 hours' notice. The modified text reduces this to 12 hours. This could be considered an unreasonably short notice period, especially if eDiets has substantial marketing materials or campaigns already in progress featuring the marks. It potentially contradicts the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in contracts, particularly in California, where the contract is governed.",

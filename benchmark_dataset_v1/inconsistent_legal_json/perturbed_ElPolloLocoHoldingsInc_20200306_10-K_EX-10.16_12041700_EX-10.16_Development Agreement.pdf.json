                "original_text": "All public liability and property damage policies shall contain a provision that El Pollo Loco, although named as an insured, shall nevertheless be entitled to recover under such policies on any loss incurred by El Pollo Loco, its affiliates, agents and/or employees, by reason of the negligence of Developer, its principals, contractors, agents and/or employees. All policies shall provide Franchisor with at least thirty (30) days’ notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.",
                "changed_text": "All public liability and property damage policies shall contain a provision that El Pollo Loco, although named as an insured, shall nevertheless be entitled to recover under such policies on any loss incurred by El Pollo Loco, its affiliates, agents and/or employees, by reason of the negligence of Developer, its principals, contractors, agents and/or employees. All policies shall provide Franchisor with at least ten (10) days’ notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cancellation notice period to 10 days contradicts standard insurance regulations, which typically require insurers to provide at least 30 days' notice to additional insureds like El Pollo Loco. This shorter notice period could leave El Pollo Loco vulnerable to coverage lapses without adequate time to secure alternative insurance, violating typical risk management practices and potentially breaching insurance laws.",

The Market Plan shall include proposed areas where sites may be located, ranking and prioritization of site locations and other information customarily used by market planners in the restaurant industry. Developer and Franchisor shall jointly approve the Market Plan.",

The Market Plan shall include proposed areas where sites may be located, ranking and prioritization of site locations and other information customarily used by market planners in the restaurant industry. Franchisor shall have sole approval of the Market Plan.",
                "explanation": "Changing the market plan approval to 'sole approval' by the Franchisor may cause issues with the Franchisee. Many states have franchise laws, such as the California Franchise Relations Act, that protect franchisees from unfair practices. By not having a joint approval of the marketing plan, the Franchisor has the sole right to determine the market plan. By removing the 'joint' approval requirement, the franchisor has ultimate control over the franchisee. Depending on the state and the specifics of how this control is exerted, it could violate franchise laws designed to protect franchisees from overbearing franchisors.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the FDD review period to seven days violates the FTC Franchise Rule and most state franchise laws, which mandate a 14-day review period to allow potential franchisees adequate time to assess the risks and benefits before signing the agreement or paying fees. This change directly contradicts legal requirements for franchise disclosure.",

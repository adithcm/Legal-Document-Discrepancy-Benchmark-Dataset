                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Theismann agrees that such material, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Bizzingo to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by the Theismann in writing within fourteen (14) days after Theismann’s receipt thereof. Theismann agrees that any material submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Theismann shall advise Bizzingo in writing of the specific grounds therefor at the time of disapproval and provide Bizzingo with specific changes or alterations to such materials. Bizzingo thereafter shall have the right and privileged to use such Property as provided in this Agreement subject to such changes or alterations.",
                "changed_text": "Theismann agrees that such material, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Bizzingo to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by the Theismann in writing within three (3) days after Theismann’s receipt thereof. Theismann agrees that any material submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Theismann shall advise Bizzingo in writing of the specific grounds therefor at the time of disapproval and provide Bizzingo with specific changes or alterations to such materials. Bizzingo thereafter shall have the right and privileged to use such Property as provided in this Agreement subject to such changes or alterations.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the approval timeframe to 3 days is unreasonable and could be considered an unfair business practice, particularly in states that have laws against unfair or deceptive trade practices. The original 14-day period provides a reasonable opportunity for review and consultation, while 3 days may not be sufficient, creating potential legal challenges based on lack of due diligence or coercion.",

                "original_text": "Payment of the Royalty shall be made no later than 45 days after the termination of the preceding full calendar quarter.",
                "changed_text": "Payment of the Royalty shall be made no later than 90 days after the termination of the preceding full calendar quarter.",
                "explanation": "Extending the royalty payment deadline to 90 days after the quarter's end may violate state wage payment laws, depending on how the 'Royalty' is legally classified. If the royalty is considered a form of compensation or wage, exceeding typical payment deadlines (often 30 days or less) can trigger penalties and legal action, creating a conflict with labor regulations.",

                "location": "Section 3.b"

                "changed_text": "Any notice, request, demand or other communication required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed properly given when actually received or within thirty (30) days of mailing by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, whichever first occurs,",
                "explanation": "Increasing the notice period to 30 days may violate state laws regarding contract rescission or cancellation rights, where shorter notice periods are mandated to protect consumers. For example, if a dispute arises that allows Theismann to terminate the contract, forcing him to wait 30 days for the notice to be considered 'properly given' could conflict with consumer protection laws designed to allow prompt action in cases of breach or misrepresentation.",

                "original_text": "In the event of parcel damage resulting from leakage or fire, Party B shall indemnify at the standard rate of RMB200 per parcel, and indemnify the actual price for high-end insured parcel (or indemnify by the value of the parcel provided by arbitration department determined by Party A).",
                "changed_text": "In the event of parcel damage resulting from leakage or fire, Party B shall indemnify at the standard rate of RMB20 per parcel, and indemnify 50% of the actual price for high-end insured parcel, at Party B's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the compensation rate for damaged parcels, setting it at a lower fixed rate and a percentage of the actual price which can be less than the legal requirement. By granting Party B sole discretion, it contradicts laws mandating fair and adequate compensation for damages.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates Article 312 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, which stipulates that carriers are liable for damages to goods during transportation unless the damage is due to force majeure, the nature of the goods, or the shipper's fault. Article 312 does not allow carriers to unilaterally decide the compensation amount.",

Unless otherwise approved by Party A, in the event of parcel transfer due to Party B’s vehicle delay, Party B shall pay liquidated damages to Party A at the standard rate of RMB500 per trip on the first working day, RMB1,000 per trip on the second working day and RMB2,000 per trip on the third working day (based on the time records on the parcel transfer documents) and such liquidated damages will be deducted from the current month’s freight.",
                "changed_text": "Party B shall arrive at the network partners determined by Party A according to the time and route stipulated in this Agreement, and strictly comply with the start time and end time. In the event of parcel transfer due to Party B’s vehicle delay, Party B shall pay liquidated damages to Party A at the rate of RMB5,000 per trip, irrespective of the delay duration, and such liquidated damages will be deducted from the current month’s freight. Party A will not provide any notification.",
                "explanation": "The modified text mandates a fixed, high liquidated damage fee, regardless of the length of the delay or the actual damages incurred by Party A. This contradicts the principle of fair and reasonable compensation and potentially violates laws against excessive liquidated damages.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates Article 114 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, which states that liquidated damages should be equivalent to the loss caused by the breach and can be adjusted by the court or arbitration institution if they are excessively high or low. This clause could be deemed excessive and unreasonable.",

Party B shall pay one-month freight as liquidated damages in case of termination of the Agreement without consent. Within the contract period, Party B shall not charge the freight difference if Party A rents same-level vehicles. Party B shall also compensate Party A’s other losses.",
                "changed_text": "Party B shall have no right to terminate this Agreement under any circumstances. If Party B attempts early termination, Party A is entitled to all of Party B's assets.",
                "explanation": "The modified text completely eliminates Party B's right to terminate the agreement early, regardless of circumstances, and imposes a disproportionate and punitive penalty (transfer of all assets) for attempting to do so. This is likely to be considered unconscionable and unenforceable under Chinese contract law, which emphasizes fairness and reasonableness.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates Articles 4 and 5 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, which require parties to adhere to principles of fairness, good faith, and reasonableness when exercising their rights and fulfilling their obligations. This clause is likely considered unconscionable.",

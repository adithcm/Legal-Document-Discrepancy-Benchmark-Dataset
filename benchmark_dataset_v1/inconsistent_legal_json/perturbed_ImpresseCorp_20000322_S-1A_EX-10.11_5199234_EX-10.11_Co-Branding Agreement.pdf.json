                "explanation": "The original text provides a 30-day negotiation period before resorting to arbitration. The modified text reduces this to 5 days. This contradicts generally accepted principles of contract law that emphasize providing a reasonable timeframe for dispute resolution before escalating to more formal and costly processes like arbitration. Courts in Delaware, whose law governs this agreement, generally expect parties to make good faith efforts to resolve disputes amicably. A 5-day negotiation period may be deemed unreasonably short, potentially undermining the enforceability of the arbitration clause itself. Additionally, some state laws mandate specific minimum periods for certain pre-arbitration dispute resolution steps.",

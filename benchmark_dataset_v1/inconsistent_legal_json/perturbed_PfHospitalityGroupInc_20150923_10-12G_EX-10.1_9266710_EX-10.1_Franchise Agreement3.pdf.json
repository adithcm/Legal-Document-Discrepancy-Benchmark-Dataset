                "original_text": "(d) As used in this Agreement, the term “Post-Term Period” shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of two (2) years from the date of: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement (regardless of the cause for termination); (c) termination of Member’s employment with Franchisee; and/or (d) a final order of a duly authorized arbitrator, panel of arbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been taken) with respect to any of the foregoing or with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement; either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or entity).",
                "changed_text": "(d) As used in this Agreement, the term “Post-Term Period” shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of five (5) years from the date of: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement (regardless of the cause for termination); (c) termination of Member’s employment with Franchisee; and/or (d) a final order of a duly authorized arbitrator, panel of arbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been taken) with respect to any of the foregoing or with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement; either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or entity).",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the non-compete period to five years. Depending on the state, this could be deemed an unreasonably long duration, making it unenforceable under state laws governing non-compete agreements. California, for example, generally prohibits non-compete agreements, while other states may view a five-year restriction as excessive without very specific justifications.",

Member shall not, during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose other than the operation of the Franchised Business, any confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how which may be communicated to Member or which Member may learn by virtue of Member’s relationship with Franchisee. All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (“Confidential Information”) is deemed confidential, except for information that Member can demonstrate came to Member’s attention by lawful means prior to disclosure to Member; or which, at the time of the disclosure to Member, had become a part of the public domain.",

Member shall not, only during the term of the Franchise Agreement, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose other than the operation of the Franchised Business, any confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how which may be communicated to Member or which Member may learn by virtue of Member’s relationship with Franchisee.

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'or thereafter,' the modified clause limits the confidentiality obligation to only the duration of the Franchise Agreement. This alteration is problematic because trade secrets are protected under both federal and state laws, like the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) and the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), respectively, for as long as they remain confidential. Limiting the protection to only the term of the agreement could jeopardize the enforceability of the confidentiality provision and potentially allow for the misappropriation of trade secrets after the agreement's expiration.",

                "changed_text": "3. Injunctive Relief. Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury, and Member will be liable for a flat fine of $100 for each violation. This fine is the Franchisor's sole and exclusive remedy.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces the possibility of injunctive relief and the recovery of court costs and attorney's fees with a fixed, nominal fine. This is inconsistent with the purpose of injunctive relief, which is to prevent ongoing harm. Limiting the remedy to a $100 fine may be deemed unconscionable or inadequate, especially in cases involving substantial damages from a breach of confidentiality or non-compete obligations. Furthermore, many states have laws that allow prevailing parties in certain contract disputes to recover attorney's fees; this clause attempts to contract around those laws.",

                "original_text": "Each driver will have a set amount of time (e.g. 10 seconds) to accept or reject the order, or the order will automatically be rejected by time and the lack of response will be recorded for future reference/internal driver ranking in the future.",
                "changed_text": "Each driver will have a set amount of time (e.g. 2 seconds) to accept or reject the order, or the order will automatically be rejected by time and the lack of response will be recorded for future reference/internal driver ranking in the future.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the driver's acceptance time to 2 seconds creates an unreasonable timeframe, potentially violating labor laws related to fair working conditions and opportunity. This may violate laws regarding reasonable opportunity for drivers to assess and accept delivery requests.",
                "contradicted_law": "Unreasonable working conditions standards; potentially violates minimum wage laws if drivers are not given reasonable time to accept requests and therefore earn less.",

                "explanation": "The new milestone delivery schedule stipulates extremely short gaps between milestones (3-4 days). This is an unreasonably aggressive timeline for software development and introduces inconsistencies, potentially leading to breach of contract. This unreasonably short timeframe may violate labor laws if the company forces its employees to meet this deadline by working overtime without compensation.",

                "explanation": "Storing users' bank account information indefinitely, regardless of account status, contradicts data privacy regulations like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and similar laws in other states and countries. These laws require businesses to have a legitimate business reason for storing personal data and to delete it when it is no longer needed.",

                "original_text": "3.2 Payment. All payments hereunder will be in US Dollars and are due and payable within thirty (30) days after the date of invoice. iPass may terminate or modify these payment terms with reasonable notice, when, in its reasonable discretion, iPass believes that its payments may be at risk. All rights of Channel Partner are expressly made conditional upon timely payment, without the right of set off, of all amounts due by Channel Partner under the Agreement. Without limiting iPass’ other available rights and remedies, iPass reserves the right to suspend or to terminate any Services ten (10) days after sending written notice of a payment that is thirty (30) or more days past due. iPass may include on an invoice, and Channel Partner agrees to pay for: (i) any Services used within one hundred eighty (180) days before the date of the invoice; and (ii) any corrections to amounts invoiced within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the original invoice. If Channel Partner reasonably disputes an invoiced amount, Channel Partner may: (a) withhold such amount from Channel Partner’s payment, provided that Channel Partner gives iPass written notice of the dispute and the reason for such dispute within thirty (30) days after the date of invoice, and pays all invoiced amounts not subject to such dispute by the due date; or (b) in the event that the invoiced amount has already been paid in full, submit a claim to iPass within sixty (60) days following the date of the original invoice. The parties will cause their authorized representatives to meet within fifteen (15) days after Channel Partner’s notice of dispute to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. If such representatives have not resolved the dispute within fifteen (15) days after their first meeting, the parties will either decide mutually to continue negotiations or, if either party does not desire to continue negotiations, each party may exercise its available remedies with respect to the disputed amounts. To the extent a dispute resolution requires payment of disputed amounts, Channel Partner shall pay such disputed amounts promptly after the dispute is resolved.",

                "explanation": "The payment deadline has been extended to 60 days, and the time frame for disputing invoices is reduced to 15 days, which may conflict with standard business practices and potentially violate laws related to fair payment terms, prompt payment, and dispute resolution periods, depending on the jurisdiction. Additionally, the deadline to submit a claim to iPass has been reduced, which can be considered legally inconsistent. The period to invoice services used has been extended to 360 days which could be considered unreasonable and not legally binding. Reducing the notice period for service termination to five days may be deemed unreasonably short, violating the standard practice of allowing sufficient time for businesses to rectify payment issues or find alternative service providers.",

For all other Confidential Information, such obligations shall continue for one (1) year from the date of initial disclosure.",
                "explanation": "Changing the confidentiality period for 'Licensed Software' to the duration 'iPass deems necessary' introduces ambiguity and could be deemed unenforceable due to lack of a definite term. Reducing the confidentiality period for other confidential information to one year may be considered unreasonable in certain industries, especially concerning trade secrets, conflicting with standard practices and potentially violating related intellectual property laws. This can be seen as a legal contradiction since the original text set a fixed obligation which has now been reduced to a non-fixed and ambiguous obligation.",

If either party materially breaches this Agreement or terms or conditions within this Agreement, and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice is given to the breaching party, then the other party may, by giving written notice to the breaching party, terminate this Agreement as of the end of such thirty (30) day notice period or such later date as is specified in such notice of termination",

If either party materially breaches this Agreement or terms or conditions within this Agreement, and such breach is not cured within ten (10) days after verbal notice is given to the breaching party, then the other party may, without any notice to the breaching party, terminate this Agreement immediately.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to ten days after only 'verbal notice' is given is unreasonably short. It also allows for no notice of termination, making the action immediate. This could be seen as unfair and violate principles of good faith and fair dealing, depending on the specific nature of the breach. A verbal notification may not be legally compliant as it is not a written record and may lead to miscommunication or misunderstandings. This is a legal contradiction because the original text set a specific period and notice, while the change reduces the period, changes the type of notice, and also negates the action of a notice of termination.",

The invoice shall state the amount to be paid by the Distributor for all Products in such shipment, as well as any taxes, duties or excises paid by JRVS which shall be reimbursed by the Distributor in accordance with Section 5.4. Terms of payment shall be net thirty (30) days. All payments shall be in U.S. Dollars.",

The invoice shall state the amount to be paid by the Distributor for all Products in such shipment, as well as any taxes, duties or excises paid by JRVS which shall be reimbursed by the Distributor in accordance with Section 5.4. Terms of payment shall be net ninety (90) days. All payments shall be in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment terms from net 30 days to net 90 days. While seemingly beneficial to the distributor, this could violate Taiwan's Fair Trade Act or related regulations concerning reasonable payment periods, potentially leading to penalties or legal challenges if such extended terms are deemed exploitative, particularly if the distributor is a smaller entity.",

If the Distributor determines any unit of Products defective, the Distributor shall promptly notify JRVS of such defects. Defective Products may be returned for retest, evaluation and examination subject to JRVS Returned Material Authorization (“RMA”) procedure; provided, that such written notification and request for an RMA number must be received by JRVS during the Inspection Period. Returns must be prepaid by Distributor. When requesting a return authorization, Distributor must supply Distributor’s purchase order number and JRVS’s invoice number. Product description must include lot number and wafer numbers.",

                "explanation": "The change reduces the inspection period from 30 days to 5 days.

                "explanation": "The modification reduces the statute of limitations for legal actions from one year to six months. This may conflict with Taiwan's Civil Code, which generally provides for longer statutory limitation periods for contract-related claims. Shortening this period could be viewed as unduly restrictive and unenforceable under Taiwanese law.",

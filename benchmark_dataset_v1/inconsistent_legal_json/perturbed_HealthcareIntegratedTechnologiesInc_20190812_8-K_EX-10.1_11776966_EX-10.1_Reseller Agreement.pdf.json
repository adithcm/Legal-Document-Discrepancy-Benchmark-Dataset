                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If Reseller fails to submit Orders with an aggregate value equal to or greater than the MOQ, then Reseller shall pay Supplier a sum equal to the shortfall, within 30 days after the end of the Initial Term. Upon payment of such amount, Seller shall deliver the Products paid for to Reseller in a commercially reasonable timeframe (and in no event any later than 150 days from the date such payment is received in full) to be sold by Reseller in accordance with this Agreement as contemplated by the last sentence of Section 12.4.",
                "changed_text": "If Reseller fails to submit Orders with an aggregate value equal to or greater than the MOQ, then Reseller shall pay Supplier a sum equal to the shortfall, within 90 days after the end of the Initial Term. Upon payment of such amount, Seller shall deliver the Products paid for to Reseller in a commercially reasonable timeframe (and in no event any later than 365 days from the date such payment is received in full) to be sold by Reseller in accordance with this Agreement as contemplated by the last sentence of Section 12.4.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment deadline to 90 days after the initial term and the product delivery timeframe to 365 days after payment introduces a significant delay that may violate standard commercial practices and could be deemed unreasonable, especially if the Reseller requires a quicker turnaround to fulfill their obligations. Although not directly violating a specific law, unreasonably long delays in delivery after payment can be construed as a breach of implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under contract law; potential violation of UCC standards for reasonable delivery timeframe.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Following the Initial Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon written notice to the other Party of at least 3 months.",
                "changed_text": "Following the Initial Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon written notice to the other Party of at least 1 month.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period from 3 months to 1 month could be considered unreasonable and may conflict with industry standards or state laws regarding fair notice in contract terminations, particularly if the reseller has invested significantly in setting up the sales infrastructure or has inventory on hand. This may not directly violate a specific law but may create a situation where the termination is deemed commercially unreasonable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential conflict with implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; may violate state laws requiring reasonable notice for contract termination.",

                "original_text": "All notices or other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given in person, by courier or by registered mail (provided that written confirmation of receipt is provided) addressed as set forth in the heading of this Agreement or such other address as any Party may designate to the other in accordance with this procedure. All communications delivered in person or by courier service shall be deemed to have been received upon delivery, shall be deemed to have been received on the business day following transmission with confirmed answer back, and all notices and other communications sent by registered mail shall be deemed to have been received within 3 business days after posting.",
                "changed_text": "All notices or other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given only by standard mail addressed as set forth in the heading of this Agreement or such other address as any Party may designate to the other in accordance with this procedure. All notices and other communications sent by standard mail shall be deemed to have been received within 30 business days after posting.",
                "explanation": "Restricting communication methods to only standard mail and extending the deemed receipt time to 30 business days significantly delays official notifications. This could conflict with legal requirements for timely notification, especially in cases involving breaches of contract, termination notices, or other time-sensitive matters. The original text specifies multiple methods for notification, including in person, courier, or registered mail. The change from 3 days to 30 days is also problematic.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential conflict with state laws requiring timely notification for legal and contractual obligations; unreasonable delay in communication.",

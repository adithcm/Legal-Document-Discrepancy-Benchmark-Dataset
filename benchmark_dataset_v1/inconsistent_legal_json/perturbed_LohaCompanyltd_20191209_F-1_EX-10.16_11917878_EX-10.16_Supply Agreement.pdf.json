                "original_text": "2.2 The seller shall be confirmed within three working days after receipt of order. If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should\nnote entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or\nmodifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party shall not\nunilaterally cancel the order before the two sides agreed .",
                "changed_text": "2.2 The seller must confirm receipt of the order within one working day. If the seller deems the order unacceptable or requires modifications, they must notify the entrusted party within one working day of receipt. Failure to confirm or notify within this timeframe implies acceptance. Once the seller accepts the order, unilateral cancellation by either party is permitted at any time.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates several legal contradictions. First, it reduces the time for the seller to respond to an order, potentially violating reasonable business practice standards depending on the industry and complexity of the order. Second, allowing unilateral cancellation after acceptance directly contradicts fundamental contract law principles, which require mutual agreement for cancellation unless specific conditions are met.",

CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity\nwith the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the\nstrength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or\nfor compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance\npremium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers.",
                "changed_text": "16. CLAIMS: Any claims regarding the quality, specification, or quantity of goods must be made within 2 days of arrival at the destination. Failure to notify the seller within this timeframe waives all rights to claims, regardless of inspection results or other evidence.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the claim period to 2 days is unreasonably short and likely contradicts established commercial law standards, which provide a reasonable timeframe for inspection and claim notification. Depending on the nature of the goods and the complexity of inspection, 2 days may be insufficient, rendering the clause unconscionable.",

                "original_text": "18. LATE DELIVERY AND PENALTY: Should the Sellers fail to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, with exception of Force Majeure\ncauses specified in Clause 17 of this Contract, the Buyers shall agree to postpone the delivery on condition that the Sellers agree to pay a penalty\nwhich shall be deducted by the paying bank from the payment. The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved\nin the late delivery. The rate of penalty is charged at 0.5% for every seven days, odd days less than seven days should be counted as seven days.\nIn case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the\ncontract and the Sellers, in spite of the cancellation, shall still pay the aforesaid penalty to the Buyers without delay, the seller should refund the\nmoney received and pay the 30% of the total goods price of the penalty",
                "changed_text": "18. LATE DELIVERY AND PENALTY: If the Sellers fail to deliver on time, as stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers are entitled to a penalty of 50% of the total contract value. This penalty is due immediately and is non-refundable, irrespective of any force majeure events or other circumstances.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the penalty for late delivery to 50% of the total contract value is likely to be deemed an unenforceable penalty clause under many legal jurisdictions, as it is disproportionate to the actual damages incurred by the buyer. Additionally, stating that the penalty is due regardless of force majeure directly contradicts standard contract law principles that excuse performance due to unforeseen circumstances.",

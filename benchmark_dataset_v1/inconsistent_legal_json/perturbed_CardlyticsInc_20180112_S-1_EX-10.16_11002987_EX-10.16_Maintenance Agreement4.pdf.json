                "explanation": "The original contract states a 120-day acceptance period. Reducing this to 30 days may be insufficient for Bank of America to thoroughly test and accept the software, potentially conflicting with implied warranties or reasonable acceptance standards under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs commercial transactions in the United States. UCC requires a reasonable time for inspection and rejection.",

                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding anything set forth\nelsewhere in this Agreement (or below),\nthe Maintenance Period shall be during Cardlytics regular business hours, excluding all Cardlytics company holidays.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement provides for 24/7 maintenance including Bank of America holidays. This change significantly reduces the maintenance availability, potentially leaving Bank of America without critical support during off-hours or during incidents. This could conflict with reasonable standards for software maintenance, especially in critical infrastructure or financial systems, violating implicit service level expectations.",

                "changed_text": "WARRANTY\nPERIOD\nDURATION\n\n30 days",
                "explanation": "The original contract states a 120-day warranty period. Reducing the warranty to 30 days is unfavorable and creates a perturbation. A shorter warranty duration may be deemed unreasonable, especially for complex software systems, and may conflict with implied warranties or industry standards. This could violate the implied warranty of merchantability under the UCC.",

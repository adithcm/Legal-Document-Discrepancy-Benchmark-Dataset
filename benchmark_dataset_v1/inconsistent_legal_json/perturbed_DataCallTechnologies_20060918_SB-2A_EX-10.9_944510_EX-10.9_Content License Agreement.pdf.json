                "changed_text": "LICENSOR shall make a first delivery of Content to plan_b within 30 days after the signing of this Agreement unless separately agreed between the Parties.",
                "explanation": "Many jurisdictions require businesses to fulfill contractual obligations promptly. Lengthening the delivery timeframe to 30 days could be seen as unreasonable and contradicts implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in contract law.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the reporting timeframe to 16 weeks following the end of each quarter could be viewed as an unreasonable delay in providing crucial financial information, potentially contradicting the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in the contract, as timely reporting is vital for revenue calculations and business decisions.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for termination to 15 days prior to the end of the term could be considered commercially unreasonable. Contract law implies a reasonable notice period, and such a short timeframe may not allow the other party sufficient time to make alternative arrangements, thus contradicting standard commercial practice.",

                "original_text": "AT&T shall pay Vendor no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of such monthly payment request for Structured Payments. AT&T shall pay, or provide a written notice of any good faith dispute to, Vendor no later than ninety (90) days after receipt of an invoice for Maintenance Fees.",
                "changed_text": "AT&T shall pay Vendor at its discretion after receipt of such monthly payment request for Structured Payments. AT&T shall pay, or provide a written notice of any dispute to, Vendor when feasible after receipt of an invoice for Maintenance Fees.",
                "explanation": "This change makes the payment terms ambiguous and discretionary, conflicting with standard contract law principles that require clearly defined payment deadlines. This introduces uncertainty and makes the contractual terms potentially unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "By removing the mandatory monthly submission requirement and giving Vendor discretion, this change contradicts the need for regular, predictable payment cycles, potentially violating laws related to timely payments for services rendered and creating legal ambiguity regarding when payment obligations arise.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for invoice submission to 30 days is unreasonable, and may conflict with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, especially if external factors (like AT&T's own delays) hinder timely invoicing. Some states require reasonable timeframes which could be considered longer than 30 days.",

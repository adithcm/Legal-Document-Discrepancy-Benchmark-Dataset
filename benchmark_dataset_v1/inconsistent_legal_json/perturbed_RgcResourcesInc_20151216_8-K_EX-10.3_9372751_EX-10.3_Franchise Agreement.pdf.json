                "changed_text": "For calendar year 2016, the Franchise Fee shall be paid to Grantor on or before December 31, 2017.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the franchise fee payment deadline to December 31, 2017, introduces a potential conflict. Virginia law specifies reasonable and timely payment schedules for franchise fees. Delaying payment for nine additional months without a valid reason could be challenged as an unreasonable delay, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing inherent in Virginia contract law.",

For each calendar year during the term of this Franchise, Grantor’s percentage share shall be determined\npursuant to this Section, and paid to Grantor on or before March 31 of the succeeding calendar year.",
                "changed_text": "(b) For each succeeding calendar year during the term of this Franchise, the total annual Franchise Fee paid by Grantee to the localities shall be the base year total annual Franchise Fee increased by ten (10) percent compounded annually over the term of the Franchise. For each calendar year during the term of this Franchise, Grantor’s percentage share shall be determined pursuant to this Section, and paid to Grantor at the Grantee's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the annual Franchise Fee increase to 10% compounded annually and changing the payment to Grantor to at the Grantee's discretion, creates a potential legal issue. Virginia law requires franchise agreements to be fair and reasonable. An excessively high increase in fees without justification could be deemed unconscionable or a violation of good faith, making this clause unenforceable. Moreover, allowing the Grantee to make payments at its discretion contradicts the definiteness required for contract terms and makes the agreement to pay illusory, undermining enforceability.",

                "explanation": "Specifying telepathy as a valid method of notice directly contradicts the requirement for written notice, which is standard practice and often legally mandated for significant contractual communications. This change makes the notice provision unenforceable due to its impracticality and lack of legal precedent, conflicting with basic contract law principles requiring reasonable and verifiable notice methods.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either Party may terminate this agreement for non-cause with a sixty (60) written notice.",
                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this agreement for non-cause with a ten (10) day written notice.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the non-cause termination notice period to 10 days may violate state laws requiring longer notice periods to protect business interests, depending on the specifics of Virginia law and the nature of the reseller relationship.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates Virginia state laws regarding reasonable notice for contract termination.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Company shall notify reseller of any changes, modifications or the discontinuation of any of the Company Products within thirty (30) days. Company shall make reasonable accommodations for any ongoing sales or existing sales.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall notify reseller of any changes, modifications or the discontinuation of any of the Company Products within five (5) days. Company shall not be obligated to make any accommodations for ongoing sales or existing sales.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for product changes to 5 days and eliminating the obligation to accommodate ongoing sales could be deemed unreasonable, especially if Reseller has invested significantly in marketing or inventory based on the original product specifications. This could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, which Virginia recognizes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Virginia contract law.",
                "location": "Section 4"

                "changed_text": "Referral Fees will be paid at Company's discretion, with no guaranteed timeline.",
                "explanation": "Removing the definite payment timeline of 30 days and replacing it with 'at Company's discretion' creates uncertainty and could be interpreted as a breach of contract or violation of fair business practices, particularly if Reseller relies on timely payments. This introduces a legal contradiction since Virginia law requires clarity of payment terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates Virginia contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms, particularly regarding payment obligations.",

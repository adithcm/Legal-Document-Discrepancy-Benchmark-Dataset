(“Supplier”) and Bank of America, N. A, (“Bank of America”), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (“SLCMA”).\nEach capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned in the SLCMA.",

(“Supplier”) and Bank of America, N. A, (“Bank of America”), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (“SLCMA”).\nCapitalized terms used but not explicitly defined herein will be subject to interpretation by the Supplier, Cardlytics, Inc., without any requirement to align with the SLCMA.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and potential conflicts regarding the interpretation of capitalized terms. By granting Cardlytics, Inc. the sole discretion to interpret undefined terms without aligning with the SLCMA, it creates a legal contradiction as contract interpretation is generally subject to established legal principles and potentially state laws governing contracts and business relationships.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty and ambiguity to the agreement. It now uses wording that states the parties may or may not intergrate Supplier Offer Placement System Software, which goes against clear language of a legal document.

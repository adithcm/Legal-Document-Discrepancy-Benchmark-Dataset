                "original_text": "9.3 Payment. Payments of Royalties and Service Fees will be due on a calendar quarterly basis, within [***] days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the applicable Licensed Products were Sold or services were rendered. From the date a payment is due, unless otherwise agreed, any late payment will accrue a late payment fee of [***] per month, or the highest interest rate permitted by law, whichever is less.",
                "changed_text": "9.3 Payment. Payments of Royalties and Service Fees will be due on a calendar quarterly basis, within 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the applicable Licensed Products were Sold or services were rendered. From the date a payment is due, unless otherwise agreed, any late payment will accrue a late payment fee of 10% per month, or the highest interest rate permitted by law, whichever is less.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payments within a period to be defined by '[***]' days after the quarter ends. The modified version shortens this payment window to '10 days', which may not provide sufficient time for accurate calculation and processing, potentially violating standard business practices and prompt payment laws depending on jurisdiction and specific circumstances. Also, charging a 10% late payment fee per month can be considered usurious under certain state laws, especially if it exceeds the maximum permissible interest rate.  California law, for example, sets limits on interest rates for certain types of transactions.",

The receiving party agrees (a) not to copy or use the disclosing party’s Confidential Information except and only for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement, (b) to maintain it as confidential, and exercise reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized access, use and disclosure, (c) not to disclose it to any third party other than the receiving party’s employees and contractors who have a need to know for the permitted purpose and who are bound by obligations that are at least as protective as the restrictions in this Agreement and (d) not to export or re-export in violation of U.S. or other export control laws or regulations any such Confidential Information or product thereof. Each party will bear the responsibility for any breach of this Section 10 by its and its Affiliates’ employees and contractors. Upon any termination of this Agreement or, in the event of any Wind Down Period or Continuing Obligation period, upon the expiration of such period, and within fifteen (15) days after request by the disclosing party, each receiving party will return the Confidential Information of the other or destroy such Confidential Information and all copies of it and all information, records and materials developed therefrom, except that the recipient may retain one copy for archival purposes to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and nothing contained herein will require the erasure, deletion, alteration or destruction of any Confidential Information required to be retained for legal or regulatory purposes or stored on back-up tapes or other back-up media or archiving systems made in the ordinary course of business, subject in each case to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein.",

The receiving party agrees (a) not to copy or use the disclosing party’s Confidential Information except and only for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement, (b) to maintain it as confidential, and exercise reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized access, use and disclosure, (c) not to disclose it to any third party other than the receiving party’s employees and contractors who have a need to know for the permitted purpose and who are not necessarily bound by confidentiality obligations and (d) not to export or re-export in violation of U.S. or other export control laws or regulations any such Confidential Information or product thereof. Each party will bear the responsibility for any breach of this Section 10 by its and its Affiliates’ employees and contractors.

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the receiving party's employees and contractors with access to Confidential Information must be bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those in the agreement. The modified version removes the requirement that employees and contractors be bound by confidentiality agreements. This weakens the protection of confidential information and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure, potentially conflicting with trade secret laws. Also, the modified text allows the receiving party to 'at its discretion' return or destroy Confidential Information, removing the 'fifteen (15) days after request by the disclosing party' deadline and removes the limitation of retaining 'one copy for archival purposes'. This conflicts with standard confidentiality practices that require a clear process and timeline for the return or destruction of confidential information upon termination or expiration of an agreement.",

DIALOG must notify ENERGOUS within thirty (30) business days after receipt of actual notice of any Claim by a third party for which it seeks indemnification; provided, however, any failure or delay in notice will not relieve ENERGOUS of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that ENERGOUS is actually prejudiced by such failure to notify. ENERGOUS will have control and authority with respect to the defense, litigation, compromise or settlement of such third party Claim (except to the extent that any settlement involves any commitments, responsibilities or obligations on the part of DIALOG, in which case such settlement will require the prior written consent of DIALOG, which consent will not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld).",
                "changed_text": "12.3 Conditions. DIALOG must notify ENERGOUS within ten (10) business days after receipt of actual notice of any Claim by a third party for which it seeks indemnification; failure to provide notice within this timeframe will automatically void ENERGOUS's indemnification obligations, regardless of whether ENERGOUS is prejudiced by the delay. ENERGOUS will have sole and absolute control and authority with respect to the defense, litigation, compromise, or settlement of such third-party Claim, without requiring any consent from DIALOG, even if such settlement involves commitments, responsibilities, or obligations on the part of DIALOG.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 30-day notification period for claims and requires DIALOG's consent for settlements that affect it. The modified version reduces the notification period to 10 days and stipulates that failure to notify within this period automatically voids ENERGOUS's indemnification obligations, even if the delay causes no prejudice. This stringent notification requirement may be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable, especially if circumstances prevent prompt notification. This alteration may contradict legal standards requiring reasonable notice and opportunity to cure. Furthermore, granting ENERGOUS sole control over settlements, even if they impose obligations on DIALOG, is likely unenforceable, as it deprives DIALOG of its right to protect its own interests and may violate principles of fairness and good faith.",

                "original_text": "Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority. Licensee’s failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites within **12 hours** after it becomes aware of such offending Content. Licensee’s failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "According to Chinese law, specifically the 'Regulations for Administration of Internet Information Services,' content providers are required to remove prohibited content 'immediately.' While 'immediately' is subject to interpretation, specifying '12 hours' could be deemed insufficient for compliance, especially for highly sensitive content, and may contradict the requirement for immediate action mandated by Chinese regulations.",

                "explanation": "While not explicitly illegal, shortening the consultation period to 30 days may conflict with common commercial practice and expectations for resolving complex disputes amicably. Chinese contract law emphasizes good faith negotiation; setting an unreasonably short period may be viewed as undermining this principle, particularly if the dispute involves substantial issues or multiple parties.",

                "explanation": "Under Chinese tax regulations, there are strict timelines for tax payments and reimbursements. Delaying the reimbursement to 'may reimburse within thirty days' introduces uncertainty and potential non-compliance with mandatory tax laws, where prompt action is typically required, and can incur legal penalties. The 'may' suggests that reimbursements are discretionary, which is likely to violate tax law.",

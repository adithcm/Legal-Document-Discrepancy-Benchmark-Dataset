All the negotiations between Company and Distributor will be by INCOTERMS Ex-works, in origin farm, in Brazil. So will must be respected the Transite Time to destiny delivery.

                "explanation": "The original contract provides 7 business days for the Company to accept or reject orders. By changing this to 2 business days, the contract becomes unreasonable, particularly given the complexities of international transactions and potential delays in communication. Also, the original text provided 7 business days to fulfill the order, and this was changed to 15 days. This could cause delays in fulfilling customer orders, potentially leading to dissatisfaction and conflict. These inconsistencies may violate general principles of good faith and fair dealing implied in contract law, particularly under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) which governs commercial transactions in the United States, as Florida's laws mirror the UCC.",

                "explanation": "The original contract requires the Distributor to notify the Company of any issues within 7 days of receiving the products. Changing this to 2 days places an unreasonable burden on the Distributor, as it may not be feasible to thoroughly inspect the products within such a short timeframe. Also, change the company to replace the product free of charge and in prompt time, this generate a new cost and also does not define a time frame, leaving uncertainty to the Distributor and conflicts with standard business practices that prioritize resolving defects at no cost to the distributor, especially given the implied warranty of merchantability.",

                "explanation": "The original contract specifies that confidentiality obligations survive for three years after termination. Reducing this period to one year weakens the protection of Proprietary Information. In certain industries and for specific types of confidential data, a one-year period may be considered insufficient to maintain a competitive advantage or protect trade secrets. Many jurisdictions recognize that the appropriate duration for confidentiality depends on the nature of the information and the industry standard. By shortening the period, the contract risks being deemed unreasonable or inadequate, potentially undermining its enforceability and contradicting established legal expectations for protecting sensitive business information.",

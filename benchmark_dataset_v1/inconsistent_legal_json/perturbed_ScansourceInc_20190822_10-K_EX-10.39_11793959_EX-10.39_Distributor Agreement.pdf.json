                "explanation": "Extending the training period to 36 months may not comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-corruption laws, which typically require regular and up-to-date training to prevent bribery and corruption. A longer interval between training sessions increases the risk that personnel will not be fully informed about current laws and regulations, potentially violating compliance standards. Best practices and legal interpretations often suggest annual or bi-annual training to ensure effectiveness.",

Distributor will inform Cisco of these changes only if requested specifically by Cisco.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by eliminating the distributor's obligation to promptly inform Cisco of changes regarding government affiliations or potential conflicts of interest, making it conditional on Cisco's request. This undermines compliance efforts as it removes the proactive reporting requirement, potentially violating regulations that mandate timely disclosure of such information to ensure transparency and prevent corruption. Proactive disclosure of conflicts of interest is a critical component of compliance under the FCPA and similar laws.",

                "explanation": "This modification restricts the avenues for reporting concerns, removing the helpline and other regional hotline numbers. Many regulations, including those related to whistleblower protection and corporate governance, emphasize the importance of providing multiple, accessible channels for reporting potential misconduct. Limiting reporting to only one method may discourage individuals from reporting, particularly if they prefer anonymity or have concerns about retaliation, thus hindering compliance with legal requirements.",

                "original_text": "The NFLA agrees that any material, advertising or otherwise, submitted for approval as provided in this section may be deemed by Company to have been approved under this section if the same is not disapproved in writing within ten (10) business days after receipt of the material. The NFLA agrees that it will reasonably cooperate with Company and that any material submitted under this section will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Company will be advised of the specific grounds for disapproval.",
                "changed_text": "The NFLA agrees that any material, advertising or otherwise, submitted for approval as provided in this section may be deemed by Company to have been approved under this section if the same is not disapproved in writing within two (2) business days after receipt of the material. The NFLA agrees that it will reasonably cooperate with Company and that any material submitted under this section will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Company will be advised of the specific grounds for disapproval.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the approval timeframe to two business days places an unreasonable burden on the NFLA, potentially hindering their ability to conduct due diligence and protect their brand. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in California contract law, as it doesn't allow sufficient time for review, especially for complex materials.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract, which requires each party to refrain from doing anything that would injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement. Setting an unreasonably short review period may violate this covenant.",

Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the NFLA-NC beginning on the first full quarter (three month period) of the Agreement and continue on a quarterly basis thereafter for the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "All payments shall be made by wire transfer drawn to the account of NFLA-NC no later than thirty (30) business days after the end of each year as follows:\n\n$0.05 per Unit as described herein of Company’s Products sold in the Contract Territory payable to NFLA-NC. Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the NFLA-NC beginning on the first full year of the Agreement and continue on an annual basis thereafter for the term of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment frequency from quarterly to annually and extending the payment deadline to 30 days after the end of the year significantly delays the NFLA-NC's receipt of funds. This change introduces uncertainty and potential financial strain for the charity, potentially violating California's Non-profit Integrity Act which requires funds to be released within the year for charities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under California contract law. Also, conflicts with the intent and best practices for charitable donations and the Non-Profit Integrity Act.",

                "original_text": "Company may liquidate and sell its inventory of Licensed Products (including any inventory then in production) for a period of ninety (90) days after the termination date of the Contract Period, subject to the Company’s continued obligation to pay the Fee as provided above, and will deliver the Sales Report with respect to such liquidation sales within 30 days following the end of the first reached full quarter following termination.",
                "changed_text": "Company may liquidate and sell its inventory of Licensed Products (including any inventory then in production) indefinitely after the termination date of the Contract Period, without the Company’s obligation to pay any fees and will deliver the Sales Report at the Company's descretion.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 90-day limit on liquidation sales after termination and eliminating the obligation to pay fees and provide sales reports creates an open-ended period for the company to sell products using the NFLA's licensed marks without any oversight or compensation. This contradicts trademark laws, potentially infringing on the NFLA's rights and creating an unfair advantage for the Company.",

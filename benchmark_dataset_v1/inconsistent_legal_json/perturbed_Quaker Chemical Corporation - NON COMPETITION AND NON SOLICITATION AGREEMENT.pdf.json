                "original_text": "(d) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the “Non-Solicit Period”), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.",
                "changed_text": "(d) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending one year after the Closing Date (the “Non-Solicit Period”), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business.

                "explanation": "The modification reduces the non-solicitation period from three years to one year and the waiting period for soliciting former employees from six months to three months. This creates a potential issue as courts in Pennsylvania (governing law) often scrutinize non-solicitation agreements, and such a short period, while not automatically invalid, might be deemed unreasonable depending on the specific facts and circumstances, potentially rendering the clause unenforceable. Pennsylvania courts consider factors like the nature of the business, the employee's position, and the geographic scope when assessing the reasonableness of such restrictions.",

                "changed_text": "Each Seller agrees that this covenant is unreasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a direct contradiction within the agreement itself. The original clause states the non-compete is reasonable, while the change asserts it is unreasonable. This undermines the enforceability of the non-compete agreement, as courts rely on the expressed intent of the parties regarding reasonableness. An unreasonable non-compete, especially considering the global scope excluding only India, is less likely to be enforced under Pennsylvania law, which requires such agreements to be narrowly tailored to protect legitimate business interests.",

                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Sellers, together with the Company, may or may not have been involved in the Company’s operations and management and may or may not possess trade secrets and other confidential information relating to the Company Business and the Company’s clients, customers, vendors, suppliers and operations.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces uncertainty regarding the Sellers' involvement and possession of trade secrets and confidential information. This weakens the justification for the non-compete and non-solicitation clauses. Under Pennsylvania law, a non-compete agreement must be supported by a legitimate business interest, such as protecting trade secrets and customer relationships. By casting doubt on whether the Sellers even possess such information, the agreement's foundation is undermined, making it more vulnerable to challenge in court. A court is less likely to enforce restrictions if the employer can't clearly demonstrate the employee possesses protectable confidential information.",

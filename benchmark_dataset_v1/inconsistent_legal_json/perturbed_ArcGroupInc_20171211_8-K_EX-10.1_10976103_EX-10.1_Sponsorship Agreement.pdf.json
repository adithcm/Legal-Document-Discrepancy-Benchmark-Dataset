                "original_text": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) equal installments, each\ndue on or prior to the 1st of each month between June and November of the applicable Contract Year.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) equal installments, each\ndue on or prior to the 30th of each month between June and November of the applicable Contract Year.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment due date to the 30th of each month from the 1st can create accounting and reconciliation issues. Many businesses and individuals schedule payments at the beginning of the month to manage cash flow effectively, and altering this deadline can lead to potential late fees or breach of contract if Sponsor follows regular payment scheduling. While not strictly illegal, consistently moving deadlines to the end of the month without clear justification can be seen as an unfair practice that puts undue burden on the Sponsor.",

                "changed_text": "If any portion of the Annual Trade Value is not used at the end of the Term, Club shall forfeit the right to use such unused amount.",
                "explanation": "This change alters the disposition of unused trade value. The original text allows the Club to use the remaining trade value within twelve months after the agreement expires. The modified text removes this provision, resulting in the Club forfeiting any remaining value. While not explicitly illegal, this clause could be seen as unreasonable if a significant trade value remains unused at the end of the contract. Courts often look to the fairness and reasonableness of contract terms, and this clause could be challenged if it leads to a substantial loss for the Club without a valid reason.",

                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates a 30-day payment window after receiving an invoice and asserts that failure to deliver the invoice does not relieve the sponsor of payment obligations. Reducing the payment window to 10 days and asserting that payment is only due if an invoice is issued introduces potentially unfair terms. This places undue pressure on the Sponsor to make prompt payments without the guarantee of timely invoicing, and the Sponsor would not be held responsible for the payment if an invoice wasn't sent.",

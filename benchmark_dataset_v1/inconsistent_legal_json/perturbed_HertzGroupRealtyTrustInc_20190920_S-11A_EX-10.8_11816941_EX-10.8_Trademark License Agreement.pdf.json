                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement by giving the other Party ten (10) days' prior written notice.",
                "explanation": "California law, which governs this agreement (see section 4.10), typically requires longer notice periods for contract termination, particularly in agreements involving real estate or significant business relationships. Reducing the notice period to 10 days may be deemed unreasonable and contradict the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under California contract law.",

                "explanation": "California law favors providing reasonable timeframes for winding down contractual obligations to avoid undue hardship. Immediately terminating the agreement upon acquisition or change in management, without any transition period, could be considered commercially unreasonable and potentially violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under California law.",

                "explanation": "While immediate cessation might seem reasonable, trademark law often allows for a brief, reasonable period to exhaust existing marketing materials or transition branding. Forcing immediate cessation, especially for a real estate investment trust that needs time to rebrand or transition marketing collateral, could be argued as commercially unreasonable and violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under California contract law, particularly given the potential financial impact.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a condition that the Guarantee can be forfeited only after a 10-day written notice, regardless of the circumstances. This might conflict with standard contract law principles of 'good faith and fair dealing', particularly if the breach leading to forfeiture is minor or easily rectifiable. It also could contradict specific state laws regarding notification periods for breach of contract.",

                "explanation": "By shortening the exclusivity and distribution periods, this modification may be considered an unreasonable restriction on the licensee's rights, potentially conflicting with regulations that prevent unfair contract terms. A very short exclusivity period could be deemed commercially unreasonable, especially if the licensee invested significantly in marketing and distribution. States often have regulations to protect businesses from contracts with excessively short or restrictive terms.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity and potential conflict with standard business practices and potentially state laws concerning timely payments. By stating there's no obligation to remit within a defined timeframe, it contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing and could violate laws related to payment terms and contract performance, which often require payments to be made within a reasonable timeframe or according to industry standards. This is especially true if the contract is under United States jurisdiction.",

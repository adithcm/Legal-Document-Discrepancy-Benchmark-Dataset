                "original_text": "The Breaching Party shall have sixty (60) days (thirty (30) days in the event of non-payment) after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default. Unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment), such termination shall become effective upon receipt of the written notice of termination by the Breaching Party to be given within ten (10) days of the end of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment).",
                "changed_text": "The Breaching Party shall have fifteen (15) days (ten (10) days in the event of non-payment) after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default. Unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period (ten (10) day period for non-payment), such termination shall become effective upon receipt of the written notice of termination by the Breaching Party to be given within five (5) days of the end of such fifteen (15) day period (ten (10) day period for non-payment).",
                "explanation": "This change shortens the cure period for a material breach from 60 days to 15 days and the cure period for non-payment from 30 days to 10 days, which is less than what courts often deem reasonable, potentially violating principles of contract law regarding adequate opportunity to cure a breach. This creates a scenario where the breaching party has significantly less time to rectify the situation, making the termination clause more easily triggered and potentially unenforceable. In many jurisdictions, such a short cure period may be viewed as unconscionable, especially for complex breaches.",

Aimmune shall promptly notify Xencor in writing of, but in no event later than [***] ([***]) days after, the achievement of each such milestone event with respect to a Product. Aimmune shall pay the applicable milestone payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds within [***] ([***]) days after the achievement (and only upon the first occurrence) of the applicable milestone event into an account designated by Xencor in writing.",
                "changed_text": "Aimmune shall pay to Xencor the one-time milestone payments described in this Section 7.2 following achievement (and only upon the first occurrence) of the corresponding milestone event for a Product. Aimmune shall notify Xencor only when Aimmune deems it necessary. Aimmune shall pay the applicable milestone payment at Aimmune's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the obligation for Aimmune to 'promptly notify Xencor in writing' within a specific timeframe and replacing the payment deadline with 'Aimmune's discretion,' the contract violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which exists in every contract. This change essentially allows Aimmune to indefinitely delay or avoid milestone payments, conflicting with general contract principles requiring reasonable and timely performance of obligations.",

Xencor shall have the right, upon [***] ([***]) days’ prior written notice to Aimmune, to cause an independent, certified international public accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Aimmune or reasonably acceptable to its Affiliates or Sublicensees, as applicable, to audit such records during Aimmune’s, or its Affiliate’s or Sublicensees’, as applicable, normal business hours to confirm the number of Product units sold, the gross sales and Net Sales of Product, the royalties payable, the method used to calculate the royalties payable, and the exchange rates used in accordance with Section 8.2.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, Aimmune will keep records relating to the sale or other disposition of Product at its discretion. Xencor shall not have any right to audit such records.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for Aimmune to keep complete and accurate records for a specified period and denying Xencor the right to audit those records, the modified text violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This deprives Xencor of the ability to verify royalty payments, creating an imbalance of power and potentially enabling Aimmune to underreport sales without accountability. This also limits the rights a licensor has to confirm the licensee is paying correct royalties.",

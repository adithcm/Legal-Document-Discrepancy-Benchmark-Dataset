                "changed_text": "3. This Termination Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law to the British Virgin Islands could create conflicts if the agreement is primarily executed and performed in China, potentially voiding certain protections afforded under PRC law regarding contract termination and enforcement. This may contradict established legal norms and jurisdictional principles.",

Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions of the Original Agreement survive such termination.",
                "changed_text": "1. Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that the Agreement shall terminate immediately upon notice from either party, and for the avoidance of doubt, provisions regarding intellectual property and confidentiality from the Original Agreement shall remain in effect for only 30 days after termination.",
                "explanation": "Under PRC law, certain intellectual property protections and confidentiality clauses may need to survive termination for a reasonable period. Limiting these protections to only 30 days may be deemed insufficient and unreasonable, potentially conflicting with established legal practices for IP protection in China. According to the PRC Contract Law, parties must act in good faith when terminating a contract, and such a short duration may be considered a violation of this principle in some circumstances, depending on the specific content of the original intellectual property and confidentiality agreements.",

                "changed_text": "2. This Termination Agreement represents the agreement between the parties, and may be modified orally if both parties agree, regardless of prior written agreements.",
                "explanation": "PRC Contract Law generally requires modifications to written agreements to also be in writing. Allowing oral modifications directly contradicts this requirement and could render the modification unenforceable. This change also undermines the 'entire agreement' clause, which is a standard practice in contract law and typically upheld in PRC courts, and creates uncertainty around the terms of the contract.",

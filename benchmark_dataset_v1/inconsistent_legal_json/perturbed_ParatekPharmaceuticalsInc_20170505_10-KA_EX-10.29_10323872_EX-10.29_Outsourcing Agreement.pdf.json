In the event that Customer is of the opinion that the Product is Out Of Specification at the time of delivery, Customer shall, within [* * *] after the date of physical receipt of Product, provide Supplier with a written notice to reject the Product (a “Notice of Rejection”), which shall include a description of the grounds for rejection and copies of test reports and testing methodology conducted on the Product, if any. However, with respect to any Out Of Specification Product which would not be apparent from a reasonable visual inspection on delivery, including in the case of any hidden defects, such Notice of Rejection shall be provided to Supplier not later than [* * *].",
                "changed_text": "Customer or its designees shall, within a period of 5 days after the date of physical receipt of any shipment of Product from Supplier, inspect the Product for any shortages or any defects or deviations of the Product Specifications (hereinafter “Out Of Specification”) that would be apparent from visual inspections of the Product. In the event that Customer is of the opinion that the Product is Out Of Specification at the time of delivery, Customer shall, within 2 days after the date of physical receipt of Product, provide Supplier with a written notice to reject the Product (a “Notice of Rejection”), which shall include a description of the grounds for rejection and copies of test reports and testing methodology conducted on the Product, if any. However, with respect to any Out Of Specification Product which would not be apparent from a reasonable visual inspection on delivery, including in the case of any hidden defects, such Notice of Rejection shall be provided to Supplier not later than 10 days.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a period of time denoted as [* * *] for the customer to inspect the delivered product and to provide a notice of rejection. The changed text modified that period to 5 days, 2 days, and 10 days. This introduces a potential legal contradiction because under the UCC, specifically section 2-602, the buyer must reject goods within a 'reasonable time' after their delivery or tender. What constitutes a 'reasonable time' is a question of fact, depending on the nature, purpose and circumstances, but a very short period like 2 or 5 days for complex pharmaceutical products could be deemed unreasonable, especially if more detailed testing is required. This may not allow enough time for adequate inspection and could be deemed non-compliant with standard commercial practices. Furthermore, it exposes the buyer to the risk of acceptance by failing to reject within a reasonable timeframe.",

                "explanation": "The original contract contains a variable timeframe denoted as [* * *] for invoice payments. Modifying this to a fixed 60-day period creates a contradiction with potential prompt payment laws that may exist in the relevant jurisdiction (defaulting to United States). Many states have prompt payment laws that mandate specific payment timelines, particularly for government contracts or specific industries (e.g., construction). While this is a commercial contract, and those prompt payment rules may not apply, payment terms are still subject to general principles of reasonableness and industry standards. Setting the payment timeline for a large product purchase so high could be viewed as unconscionable or against normal business practices.",

                "explanation": "The original text contains a variable term denoted as [* * *] for how long to keep records for cGMP requirements. Changing it to a fixed two-year retention period can cause the contract to violate federal regulations. 21 CFR 211.180(a) generally requires that all records required under current good manufacturing practice regulations be retained for at least one year after the expiration date of the batch, and for some products, this period can be extended. A two-year period may be inadequate for products with longer shelf lives or when regulatory investigations or litigations necessitate longer retention. This fixed period can make the contract non-compliant.",

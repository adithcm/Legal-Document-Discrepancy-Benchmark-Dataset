                "original_text": "You shall submit to us copies of all Unit Franchise Agreements executed with Unit Franchisees within ten (10) days of the date of their execution, together with a copy of all checks presented to you at closing. You shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, not later than the first (1 st ) day of each month, of Franchise Sales Revenue generated by you during the previous calendar month. Contemporaneously with the submission of the Franchise Sales Revenue report, you shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, in such form and including such detail as we require, reflecting royalty fees paid and owed to you by your Unit Franchisees for the previous calendar month. Any report not actually received by us when due shall be deemed overdue and you shall pay us a late charge as described above.",
                "changed_text": "You shall submit to us copies of all Unit Franchise Agreements executed with Unit Franchisees within two (2) days of the date of their execution, together with a copy of all checks presented to you at closing. You shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, not later than the fifteenth (15th) day of each month, of Franchise Sales Revenue generated by you during the previous calendar month. Contemporaneously with the submission of the Franchise Sales Revenue report, you shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, in such form and including such detail as we require, reflecting royalty fees paid and owed to you by your Unit Franchisees for the previous calendar month. Any report not actually received by us when due shall be deemed overdue and you shall pay us a late charge as described above.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires copies of Unit Franchise Agreements within ten days of execution. Some state franchise laws, aiming to protect franchisees, mandate that franchisees have a reasonable time to review the agreement and seek legal counsel. Shortening this to two days creates a legal contradiction, putting undue pressure on the franchisee and potentially violating disclosure requirements. Also, changing the report submission deadline from the 1st to the 15th could conflict with other sections that mandate payment by the 15th, creating a logistical and potentially contractual inconsistency.",

If any such default is not cured within the specified time, or such longer period as applicable law may require, we shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice of termination to you. You shall be in default pursuant to this Section 10.3 for failure to substantially comply with any of the requirements imposed by this Agreement, as it may from time to time reasonably be modified or supplemented by the Manuals, or your failure to carry out the terms of this Agreement in good faith.",

                "explanation": "Many state franchise laws mandate a reasonable cure period for defaults to protect franchisees from arbitrary termination. Reducing the cure period to five days may be deemed unreasonable and contradict state statutes designed to balance the power between franchisors and franchisees. This potentially violates franchisee protection laws.",

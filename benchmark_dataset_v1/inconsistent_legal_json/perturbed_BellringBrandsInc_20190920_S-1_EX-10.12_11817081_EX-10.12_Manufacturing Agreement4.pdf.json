                "original_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (“Heritage”) Premier Nutrition Corporation (“Premier”) is effective as of July 3, 2019 (“Third Amendment Effective Date”) and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (“Agreement”).",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (“Heritage”) Premier Nutrition Corporation (“Premier”) is effective retroactively as of January 1, 2015 (“Third Amendment Effective Date”) and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (“Agreement”).",
                "explanation": "Changing the effective date to a date significantly in the past (January 1, 2015) can create legal issues regarding the enforceability and validity of the agreement. Retroactive application of contracts, especially in areas like manufacturing and supply chain, can violate statutes of limitations and create conflicts regarding past performance and liabilities. Under US contract law, retroactive application can be problematic if it affects vested rights or obligations that existed before the amendment.",

                "explanation": "Limiting dispute resolution to 10 days contradicts standard legal practices and statutes of limitations, which allow significantly longer periods for filing claims and resolving disputes. This extremely short timeframe is highly unreasonable and likely unenforceable under most state and federal laws in the United States, potentially violating due process and fair access to legal remedies.",

                "original_text": "2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, WPD hereby agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable or advisable under applicable laws to develop and commercialize the Development Products, with a goal of eventual approval of Development Products in the Development Territory. In exchange for the payment by WPD of the Development Fee to CNS, CNS hereby agrees to pay WPD the following payments: (i) within thirty Business Days from the date of this Agreement, CNS will make an upfront payment of $225,000 to WPD; and (ii) within thirty days of the verified achievement of the Phase II Milestone, (such verification shall be conducted by an independent third party mutually acceptable to the parties hereto), CNS will make a payment of $775,000 to WPD.",

In exchange for the payment by WPD of the Development Fee to CNS, CNS hereby agrees to pay WPD the following payments: (i) within ninety Business Days from the date of this Agreement, CNS will make an upfront payment of $225,000 to WPD; and (ii) within sixty days of the verified achievement of the Phase II Milestone, (such verification shall be conducted by an independent third party mutually acceptable to the parties hereto), CNS will make a payment of $775,000 to WPD.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment deadlines, potentially conflicting with prompt payment laws or regulations that require payments to be made within a reasonable and shorter timeframe in some jurisdictions. This delay could also constitute a breach of contract if it is deemed unreasonably long and causes financial harm to WPD. Though Texas does not explicitly have prompt payment laws for private contracts, extending the payment terms this significantly without proper justification could be deemed unreasonable and a breach of good faith.",

Thereafter, WPD shall furnish to CNS Development Fees no later than forty-five days after the end of each Calendar Quarter for the Sale of Development Products through the end of such Calendar Quarter and shall further furnish CNS with a written statement setting forth an accounting showing the calculation of the Development Fees.",

                "explanation": "Extending the payment deadline to 120 days after the end of the calendar quarter is unreasonable and exceeds commonly accepted payment terms. This could lead to cash flow issues for CNS and contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing inherent in the contract. While Texas law doesn't specify mandatory payment deadlines for all commercial contracts, excessively long delays could still be challenged as breaches of contract or violations of good faith principles.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year might be deemed unreasonable and insufficient to protect trade secrets and other confidential business information.

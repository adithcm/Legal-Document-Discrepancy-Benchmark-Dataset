                "original_text": "Western Copper covenants and agrees with Glamis that, for a period of 2 years\nafter the Effective Date, it will not, directly or indirectly, either individually or in partnership or \njointly or in conjunction with any Person, which will include being a principal, agent, \nshareholder, or advisor of such Person or in any other manner whatsoever,\n(a) \ncairy on or be engaged in Mining Activities, or\ni 162967.3",
                "changed_text": "Western Copper covenants and agrees with Glamis that, for a period of 6 months\nafter the Effective Date, it will not, directly or indirectly, either individually or in partnership or \njointly or in conjunction with any Person, which will include being a principal, agent, \nshareholder, or advisor of such Person or in any other manner whatsoever,\n(a) \ncairy on or be engaged in Mining Activities, or\ni 162967.3",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a non-competition period of 2 years. Reducing this period to 6 months could be deemed unreasonably short and unenforceable under British Columbia law, especially given the nature of the agreement and the potential for significant harm to Glamis's business interests if Western Copper quickly re-enters the market. Courts in British Columbia consider the reasonableness of non-competition clauses, and a very short duration may be viewed as insufficient to protect legitimate business interests.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the negotiation period from 30 days to 5 days and the disposition period from 3 months to 1 month could be considered commercially unreasonable and a breach of the implied duty of good faith in contract law under British Columbia Law. The duty of good faith requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in performing their contractual obligations. A 5-day negotiation period may be insufficient for a complex transaction involving mineral properties, potentially hindering Western Copper's ability to conduct due diligence and secure financing, thereby undermining the purpose of the right of first offer.",

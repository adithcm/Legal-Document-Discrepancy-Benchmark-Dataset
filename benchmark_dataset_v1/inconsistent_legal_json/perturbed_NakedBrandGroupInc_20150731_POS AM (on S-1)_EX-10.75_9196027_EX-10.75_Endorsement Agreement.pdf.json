                "original_text": "Naked shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Wade in the event Wade fails to perform the Wade Services or breaches any other covenant or agreement set forth herein (including the essence of this Agreement), and fails to cure same (if curable) within seven (7) days of receipt of written notice.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice and cure periods to two days and one day, respectively, is unreasonable and may contradict legal standards for fair notice and opportunity to cure in contract law, especially in California. California law typically requires reasonable notice, and such short timeframes could be deemed unconscionable.",

                "explanation": "Decreasing the notice and cure periods for termination to one and two days, respectively, is highly aggressive and likely violates principles of fair dealing and commercial reasonableness. Such short timeframes severely limit Naked's ability to respond to or rectify breaches, potentially conflicting with legal standards for contract enforcement and good faith, especially under New York law which governs this agreement.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the review period for design comments to just one day places an unrealistic burden on the Wade Team, potentially hindering their ability to provide thoughtful and constructive feedback. This unreasonably short timeframe may be deemed commercially unconscionable and contradict principles of good faith and fair dealing, especially in collaborative agreements. This violates standard business practices and could be viewed as an attempt to undermine Wade's creative input.",

                "changed_text": "1.2\nTerm\nThis agreement is for a term of fifty (50) years.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the contract term to fifty years. Depending on the jurisdiction (defaulting to US law as none is specified), such an excessively long term might be deemed unconscionable or against public policy, especially if it unduly restricts competition or creates an unreasonable restraint of trade. Many states have statutes or common law principles that allow courts to invalidate contracts with excessively long durations.",

A six (6) months notice must be given by either party of their intention to terminate relations due to any reason other than breach of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "Extending the renewal term to fifty years exacerbates the potential legal issues of the original ten-year renewal. Combining this with a clause requiring six months' notice for termination (excluding breach) makes it significantly more difficult for either party to exit the agreement. This could be viewed as an unreasonable restraint on trade and potentially unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame for rejection of defective products to two days is likely to be considered commercially unreasonable, especially given the complexities of international shipping and potential delays in inspection. Most jurisdictions require a reasonable time for inspection. A two-day window is overly restrictive and could be deemed unconscionable, particularly if the products are complex or require specialized testing.  This could violate implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which would be relevant in a US jurisdiction.",

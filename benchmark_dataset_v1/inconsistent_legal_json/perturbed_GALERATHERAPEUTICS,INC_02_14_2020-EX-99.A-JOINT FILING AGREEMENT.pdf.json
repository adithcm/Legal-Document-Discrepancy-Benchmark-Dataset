                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until 30 days after notification of intent to revoke by any party hereto in a verbal statement to at least one other party hereto, and then with respect to all parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a signed writing for revocation, offering certainty. This has been changed to a verbal notification with a 30-day delay and affects all parties. The change to a verbal statement contradicts the Statute of Frauds, which in many states (including Delaware, where Galera Therapeutics, Inc. is incorporated) requires certain agreements, particularly those involving significant financial transactions or lasting over a year, to be in writing to be enforceable. Making the revocation applicable to 'all parties' further alters the agreement's fundamental principle of individual responsibility and conflicts with the intent of the original agreement.",

                "changed_text": "Each party is solely responsible for their initial filing; subsequent amendments are the responsibility of a designated Filing Agent, selected by simple majority of the parties, irrespective of individual accuracy or completeness. No party holds responsibility for inaccuracies, even if known.",
                "explanation": "Under the original agreement, each party is responsible for the accuracy of their filings and any amendments. This is altered to state that only the initial filing is the party's responsibility, but subsequent changes and amendments are assigned to a 'Filing Agent'. This contradicts securities laws, such as the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which holds individuals accountable for the accuracy of information they provide to the SEC. Furthermore, absolving parties of responsibility for known inaccuracies violates securities regulations that require truthful and complete disclosures. The designation of a Filing Agent does not absolve each party of their legal responsibilities.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement is only valid if all parties sign a single, original document on the same date and location. Digital signatures or counterparts are prohibited.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly permits the agreement to be executed in counterparts, which is a standard practice and legally acceptable. The modification restricts the execution to a single original document signed by all parties at the same time. This contradicts established contract law principles, which recognize the validity of agreements executed in counterparts. Many jurisdictions, including Delaware, recognize digital signatures as legally binding under laws like the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). Prohibiting counterparts and digital signatures creates an unnecessary obstacle to contract formation and contradicts accepted legal norms.",

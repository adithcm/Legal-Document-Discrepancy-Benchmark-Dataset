                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be terminable by Licensor at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that Licensor or Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of Licensee’s use of the Licensed Mark; by Licensor or Licensee upon sixty (60) days’ written notice to the other party; or by Licensee at any time in the event Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of Licensee’s rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be terminable by Licensor at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that Licensor or Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of Licensee’s use of the Licensed Mark; by Licensor or Licensee upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the other party; or by Licensee at any time in the event Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of Licensee’s rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of Licensor.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for termination from 60 days to 30 days could be considered unreasonable and may conflict with legal standards for fair notice, especially if the licensee has made significant investments based on the agreement. This shorter notice period could be deemed a breach of contract under certain state laws if it is found to be unduly burdensome or prejudicial to the Licensee. While no specific law is directly contradicted, the reduced timeframe may not meet the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most U.S. contract laws, potentially making the termination clause legally vulnerable.",

                "changed_text": "For six (6) months following termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall specify on all public-facing materials in a small and inconspicuous place, using regular typeface, that Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the duration of the post-termination notice period from 24 months to 6 months, and requiring the notice to be displayed in a small and inconspicuous manner, undermines the original intent of protecting the Licensor's brand and preventing consumer confusion. This modification potentially violates consumer protection laws (such as the Lanham Act in the US) that aim to prevent deceptive trade practices and ensure clarity regarding brand affiliation. The change could be seen as insufficient to adequately inform the public about the change in brand association, thus causing potential harm to consumers and the Licensor's reputation. By reducing the prominence and duration of the notice, the agreement increases the risk of misleading consumers and infringing on the Licensor's trademark rights, in violation of consumer protection laws and trademark regulations.",

                "explanation": "Switching the governing law from New York to Delaware, while seemingly a minor change, could potentially impact the enforceability of certain provisions within the agreement. For instance, the interpretation of corporate governance matters, specifically regarding the duties and obligations of the Licensee as a Maryland corporation, may be influenced by Delaware law, potentially conflicting with Maryland's corporate regulations. This alteration could lead to disputes over the applicable legal standards, particularly if the specific issue at hand is treated differently under New York and Delaware law, potentially affecting the rights and obligations of the parties involved. Since the Licensee is incorporated in Maryland, changing the governing law could cause inconsistencies and legal challenges related to corporate law compliance.",

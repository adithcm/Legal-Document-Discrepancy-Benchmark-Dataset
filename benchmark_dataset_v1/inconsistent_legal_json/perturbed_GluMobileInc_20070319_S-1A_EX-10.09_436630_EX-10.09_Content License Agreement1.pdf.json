                "original_text": "For each of the Major Releases and Targeted Releases, within ***** after receipt from Fox of the applicable PSM Materials, Licensee will deliver to Fox a concept / treatment for the applicable Wireless Products, which will outline the technical and creative aspects of the Wireless Products (each, a “Treatment”). Each Treatment shall be subject to Fox’s approval, which approval is within Fox’s discretion.",
                "changed_text": "For each of the Major Releases and Targeted Releases, within *1 day* after receipt from Fox of the applicable PSM Materials, Licensee will deliver to Fox a concept / treatment for the applicable Wireless Products, which will outline the technical and creative aspects of the Wireless Products (each, a “Treatment”). Each Treatment shall be subject to Fox’s approval, which approval is within Fox’s discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the time for Licensee to deliver the concept/treatment to 1 day. This is an unreasonably short amount of time, particularly considering the complexity of the task and the potential need for consultation and research, potentially contradicting standards of reasonable timeframes for contractual obligations.",

Once approval has been granted by Fox, Licensee will not make alterations, modifications or revisions to the Licensee Marketing Materials without the prior written consent of Fox.",
                "explanation": "Changing the approval timeframe to 6 months is unreasonable and could significantly delay the marketing and release of the Wireless Products. Such a delay may not align with industry standards and expectations for timely project execution, potentially conflicting with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame for bid submission and negotiation to 2 and 1 business days respectively is an unreasonably short period for complex licensing negotiations. This undermines the 'Right of First Negotiation' by making it difficult for Licensee to properly evaluate opportunities and formulate bids, potentially conflicting with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing and standard business practices.",

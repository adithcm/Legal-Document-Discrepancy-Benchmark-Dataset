                "explanation": "The change in the deadline from two days to one day for providing and substituting the VerticalNet Link representation creates a legal contradiction. While seemingly minor, such compressed timelines can violate standard business practice laws, particularly regarding reasonable notice and opportunity to review, especially in cases where integration requires technical expertise.",

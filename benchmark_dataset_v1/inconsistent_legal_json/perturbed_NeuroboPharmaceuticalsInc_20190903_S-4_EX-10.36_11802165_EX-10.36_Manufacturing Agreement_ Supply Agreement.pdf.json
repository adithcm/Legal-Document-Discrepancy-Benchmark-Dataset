                "original_text": "2.3 NeuroBo shall, at its costs and expenses, deliver the API to the place designated by Dong-A no later than [***] days prior to the requested delivery date for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in accordance with the Firm Order.",
                "changed_text": "2.3 NeuroBo shall, at its costs and expenses, deliver the API to the place designated by Dong-A no later than 5 days prior to the requested delivery date for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in accordance with the Firm Order.",
                "explanation": "This modification may create an inconsistency, because 5 days might not be a sufficient time period for API delivery considering international shipping and customs clearance, thus potentially causing a breach of contract due to circumstances outside of Neurobo's control. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs contracts for the sale of goods, the delivery timeframe must be commercially reasonable.",
                "contradicted_law": "UCC § 2-309(1): The time for shipment or delivery or any other action under a contract if not otherwise agreed shall be a reasonable time.",

                "changed_text": "3.3 Within 1 day after receipt of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo hereunder, NeuroBo may, in its discretion, perform a quality control test (the “Product Test”) in accordance with the methods of the test on such Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for acceptance (the “Product Test Methods”), which shall be separately agreed in writing by and between Dong-A and NeuroBo and attached hereto as Exhibit B, as may be amended by the Parties’ agreement in writing from time to time.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time for quality control testing to 1 day is likely insufficient for a thorough assessment of pharmaceutical products. This could be considered commercially unreasonable and could potentially lead to disputes under the UCC, as the time provided for inspection must be reasonable given the nature of the goods and industry standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "UCC § 2-513: Buyer's Right to Inspection of Goods. (1) Unless otherwise agreed and subject to subsection (3), where goods are tendered or delivered or identified to the contract for sale, the buyer has a right before payment or acceptance to inspect them at any reasonable place and time and in any reasonable manner. When the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer, the inspection may be after their arrival.",

                "original_text": "4.3 Upon agreement by the Parties of the Firm Order, Dong-A shall issue to NeuroBo an invoice in Korean Won for each shipment of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo based on the Firm Order. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Dong-A, NeuroBo shall pay the invoiced supply price (i) in Korean Won (KRW) or (ii) in United States Dollars (USD) which amount shall correspond the invoiced amount converted from KRW to USD at the exchange rate of the payment date, no later than [***] days prior to the shipment date by way of wire transfer to Dong-A.",
                "changed_text": "4.3 Upon agreement by the Parties of the Firm Order, Dong-A shall issue to NeuroBo an invoice in Korean Won for each shipment of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo based on the Firm Order. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Dong-A, NeuroBo shall pay the invoiced supply price (i) in Korean Won (KRW) or (ii) in United States Dollars (USD) which amount shall correspond the invoiced amount converted from KRW to USD at the exchange rate of the payment date, no later than 1 day prior to the shipment date by way of wire transfer to Dong-A.",
                "explanation": "Requiring payment just 1 day before shipment is quite stringent and could be deemed commercially unreasonable. Wire transfers, especially international ones, can take several business days to clear. This term puts undue burden on NeuroBo, potentially leading to late payments even if they initiate the transfer promptly, and can trigger default or interest penalties. Under the UCC, payment terms must be commercially reasonable.",
                "contradicted_law": "UCC § 2-310: Open Time for Payment or Running of Credit; Authority to Ship Under Reservation. Unless otherwise agreed (a) payment is due at the time and place at which the buyer is to receive the goods even though the place of shipment is the place of delivery.",

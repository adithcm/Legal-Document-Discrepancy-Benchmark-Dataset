                "changed_text": "Distributor is not obligated to provide Zogenix with a copy of each Sub-distributor agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the obligation for Distributor to provide Sub-distributor agreements to Zogenix. This is a legal contradiction because it restricts Zogenix's ability to ensure compliance with applicable laws, such as the FCPA, as outlined in Section 2.2, potentially violating due diligence requirements.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor will provide a brief summary of the total payments, however, it is not required to provide a detailed financial report.",
                "explanation": "This creates a legal contradiction by limiting Zogenix's access to essential financial data required for accurate royalty calculations and auditing, undermining transparency, and potentially violating financial reporting standards under US law.",

                "changed_text": "Confidentiality obligations will terminate 1 year after the contract has terminated.",
                "explanation": "This modification reduces the confidentiality period which will violate trade secret laws. Trade secret laws such as the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) require companies to take reasonable measures to protect their trade secrets. A short confidentiality period may be viewed as an unreasonable measure, thus conflicting with the DTSA.",

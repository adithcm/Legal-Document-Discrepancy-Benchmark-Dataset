                "changed_text": "Contractor and Customer agree to terms of payments of current plus sixty (60) days from the date of invoice. Payment shall be affected in US Dollars.",
                "explanation": "Extended payment terms to 60 days could violate prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions (including the United States, if applicable based on the parties' conduct and the contract's interpretation) that require payment within a shorter timeframe (e.g., 30 days) for certain types of commercial transactions. This may create financial hardship for the contractor, particularly if they are a smaller entity. In Israel, while not a strict law, it deviates from standard commercial practice and could be deemed unreasonable depending on the industry.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of prompt payment laws or general principles of fair dealing and commercial reasonableness.",

                "changed_text": "Customer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Contractor from all claims, liabilities, costs, damages, judgments and attorney’s fees resulting from or arising out of any alleged and/or actual infringement or other violation of any patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights, copyrights, trade secrets, proprietary rights and processes or other such rights elated to the Product or claims relating to Customer’s instructions, tooling, specifications and designs (“Claims”) provided that: (i) Contractor will provide the Customer with prompt written notice of any Claim no later than one (1) business day following receipt of notice by Contractor; (ii) Contractor will grant Customer sole control of the defense and settlement of Claims, taking into account any reasonable request of Contractor; and (iii) Contractor will provide Customer with reasonable assistance, at Customer’s sole expense.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for infringement claims to one business day places an unreasonable burden on the Contractor. This is especially problematic in complex intellectual property matters. This abbreviated timeframe could prejudice the Contractor's ability to gather information, assess the claim, and properly notify the Customer. It could be deemed an unfair or unconscionable term, particularly if the Contractor lacks internal legal resources.",

                "changed_text": "Contractor and the Customer will not be allowed to employ employees of the other party, directly or indirectly, for five (5) years from the date the employee has ceased to be employed by the other party. The above mentioned restriction may be waived by either party provided that it is done by a written and specific consent.",
                "explanation": "Extending the non-compete period to five years is likely unenforceable in many jurisdictions (including Israel, where the contract is governed) as it's considered an unreasonable restraint of trade. Most jurisdictions have laws limiting the duration and scope of non-compete agreements to protect employee mobility and competition. Such a long duration is unlikely to be justifiable and would be deemed void as against public policy.",

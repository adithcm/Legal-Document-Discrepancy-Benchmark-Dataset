                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A.  Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement on the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof.",
                "changed_text": "A.  Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement within 90 days of the date specified in the invoice, regardless of the payment terms outlined in the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction because it imposes a 90-day payment deadline, irrespective of potentially shorter payment terms specified elsewhere in the Master Franchise Agreement. Many franchise agreements require payments within a much shorter timeframe (e.g., 30 days), and state laws may imply a reasonable time for payment that is less than 90 days, particularly for invoices. By overriding the original terms, this clause creates uncertainty and potential legal conflict.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract principles and implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, potentially violating state laws regarding payment terms.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "D. Franchisor shall not be obligated to proceed against Master Franchisee or exhaust any security from Master Franchisee or pursue or exhaust any remedy, including any legal or equitable relief against Master Franchisee, before proceeding to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee, and the enforcement of such obligations may take place before, after, or contemporaneously with, enforcement of any debt or obligation of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "D. Franchisor may immediately proceed against the Guarantors without any obligation to first pursue Master Franchisee or exhaust any remedies. The Franchisor's sole discretion shall determine the timing and order of enforcement actions.",
                "explanation": "This change is problematic because while a guarantee often allows the franchisor to pursue the guarantor, it is subject to certain legal limitations and the duty of good faith. Some jurisdictions require the franchisor to make a reasonable effort to pursue the franchisee first, especially if the guarantor's obligations are tied directly to the franchisee's performance. This provision attempts to eliminate any such obligation, potentially conflicting with legal protections afforded to guarantors and creating an unconscionable advantage for the Franchisor.",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws regarding guarantor rights and the duty of good faith and fair dealing in contract enforcement.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "E.  Without affecting the Guarantorsâ€™ obligations under this Guarantee, Franchisor, without notice to the Guarantors, may extend, modify, or release any indebtedness or obligation of Master Franchisee, or settle, adjust, or compromise any claims against Master Franchisee. Guarantors waive notice of amendment of the Master Franchise Agreement and notice of demand for payment or performance by Master Franchisee.",
                "changed_text": "E.  Franchisor may unilaterally alter the Master Franchise Agreement, including increasing financial obligations, without any notification to the Guarantors. The Guarantors' obligations remain absolute and unaffected, regardless of any changes to the underlying agreement, even if those changes materially increase the Guarantors' risk.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a potential conflict with the principle that guarantors are only liable to the extent of the obligations they guaranteed. Allowing the Franchisor to unilaterally increase the Master Franchisee's financial burdens, without notice or consent from the Guarantors, could be deemed a violation of the Guarantors' rights and an unfair modification of their obligations. Many states have laws protecting guarantors from such drastic, unconsented changes.",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws relating to guarantor rights, contract modification, and the principle that a guarantor's liability is limited to the scope of the guaranteed obligation at the time the guarantee was made.",

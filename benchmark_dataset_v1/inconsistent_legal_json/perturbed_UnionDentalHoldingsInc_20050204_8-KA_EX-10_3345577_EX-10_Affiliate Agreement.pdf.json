                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Report to the other Party, in writing, any use and/or disclosure of the Confidential Information that is not permitted or required by this Agreement of which a Party becomes aware within five (5) days of a Party=s discovery of such unauthorized use and/or disclosure",
                "changed_text": "Report to the other Party, in writing, any use and/or disclosure of the Confidential Information that is not permitted or required by this Agreement of which a Party becomes aware within one (1) day of a Party=s discovery of such unauthorized use and/or disclosure",
                "explanation": "Reducing the reporting timeframe for unauthorized disclosures of confidential information to one day is inconsistent with the HIPAA regulations and general privacy laws, which allow for a reasonable timeframe to investigate and report breaches. A one-day timeframe may be too short to conduct a thorough investigation, potentially leading to incomplete or inaccurate reports. HIPAA typically requires reporting breaches within 60 days of discovery.",

                "explanation": "Extending the timeframe for producing records related to confidential information to thirty days contradicts the general principle of timely access to information under privacy laws and regulations. Ten days is more reasonable and a requirement that allows parties to promptly address compliance concerns and investigate potential breaches, without undue delay.",

                "original_text": "A Party will have ten (10) days to provide adequate assurances of performance to the other Party in a form acceptable to the other Party in its good faith discretion.",
                "changed_text": "A Party will have two (2) days to provide adequate assurances of performance to the other Party in a form acceptable to the other Party in its good faith discretion.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time to provide adequate assurances to two days contradicts the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code, Section 2-609, which, while not specifying an exact timeframe, generally implies a 'reasonable time' that is typically longer than two days, especially considering the complexity of assessing and providing such assurances. This creates undue pressure and potentially forces premature termination.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period for non-trade secret information to 12 months may be deemed unreasonable and insufficient under Illinois trade secret law, especially considering the nature of the disclosed information, potentially leading to disputes over adequate protection and enforceability.",

                "explanation": "Charging a late payment fee of 10% per month may violate usury laws in Illinois depending on the specific context and the nature of the transaction as it could be considered an excessive interest rate. Illinois law sets limits on the interest rates that can be charged. This modification introduces a conflict with state law.",

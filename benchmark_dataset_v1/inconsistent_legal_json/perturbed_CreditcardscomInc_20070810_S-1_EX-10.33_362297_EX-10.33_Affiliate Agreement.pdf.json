                "original_text": "Prior to using any of the Licensed Materials, Affiliate will submit to Chase for approval a draft of all proposed material that incorporates the Licensed Materials, together with a brief statement setting forth the proposed use of such materials and any other background or supporting material reasonably requested by Chase to allow Chase to make an informed judgment. All such materials shall be submitted to Chase at least seven (7) days prior to the date of first intended use. Chase will notify Affiliate of its approval or disapproval of such materials within five (5) business days of its receipt of all information required to be submitted.",
                "changed_text": "Prior to using any of the Licensed Materials, Affiliate will submit to Chase for approval a draft of all proposed material that incorporates the Licensed Materials, together with a brief statement setting forth the proposed use of such materials and any other background or supporting material reasonably requested by Chase to allow Chase to make an informed judgment. All such materials shall be submitted to Chase at least two (2) days prior to the date of first intended use. Chase will notify Affiliate of its approval or disapproval of such materials within ten (10) business days of its receipt of all information required to be submitted.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement requires the Affiliate to submit materials for approval at least seven (7) days before use, and Chase to respond within five (5) business days. This change reduces the Affiliate's submission window to two (2) days, which may be insufficient for a thorough review, and extends Chase's response time to ten (10) business days, creating a legal contradiction, as it might not allow enough time for the affiliate to make the changes.",

                "changed_text": "Either Affiliate or Chase may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other party verbal notice of termination. At the time of termination, any links to Chase’s Website must be removed within 24 hours.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement requires written or e-mail notice for termination. The modified version allows verbal notice, which is problematic as verbal agreements are hard to prove. In many jurisdictions, including the default US Law position, material contracts often require written notice for termination to be legally sound. Additionally, the change allows links to be removed within 24 hours instead of immediately.",

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the amount of Commissions, the definition of Approved Accounts, and all other provisions of this Agreement are subject to change without notice other than posting such information on the Chase Website. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO AFFILIATE, THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT. AFFILIATE’S CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM FOLLOWING CHASE’S POSTING OF A NEW AGREEMENT ON ITS WEB SITE WILL CONSTITUTE BINDING ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE.",

AFFILIATE’S CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM WILL CONSTITUTE BINDING ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement requires Chase to post a new agreement on its website to notify the affiliate of changes. The modified version removes the requirement for any prior notice, allowing Chase to change the terms without informing the Affiliate. This could violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in most US jurisdictions, as it deprives the affiliate of the opportunity to review and potentially terminate the agreement based on the changes.",

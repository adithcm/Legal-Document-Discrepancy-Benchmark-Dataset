                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month for sales during the previous month.",
                "changed_text": "All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within ninety (90) days after the end of each calendar month for sales during the previous month.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment period for royalties to 90 days. While a longer payment period isn't inherently illegal, it could contradict state-level prompt payment laws if applicable to royalty agreements, especially if the individual is considered an independent contractor. Illinois, where Lifeway is located, doesn't have a specific prompt payment law for royalties but has one for contractors, this modification might introduce a point of contention where it could be argued that 90 days is an unreasonable delay, potentially conflicting with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential conflict with implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Illinois contract law, and potential misclassification of Individual as not an employee or contractor, therefore circumventing labor standards.",

                "original_text": "13. Notice - Notices to the parties shall be sent via overnight mail or U.S. Certified Mail or overnight express or priority mail to the addresses listed in the Agreement. Either party may change its address upon written notice to the other party. Written notices for approvals under this agreement may be via email.",
                "changed_text": "13. Notice - Notices to the parties shall be sent via regular U.S. Mail to the addresses listed in the Agreement. Either party may change its address upon oral notice to the other party. Written notices for approvals under this agreement may be via telepathy.",
                "explanation": "This modification changes the notice provisions to be less reliable. Requiring only regular U.S. Mail could be problematic for time-sensitive legal notices, especially regarding breach of contract or termination. Oral notice for address changes introduces ambiguity and lack of record-keeping, potentially conflicting with the principle of providing adequate and verifiable notice. Finally, legal notices are required to be written and not through the communication method of telepathy.",
                "contradicted_law": "Conflict with principles of adequate notice and verifiable communication, potentially violating due process requirements.",

                "changed_text": "15. Choice of Law and Forum - This Agreement will be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of the Principality of Sealand, without regard to conflict of laws principles.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the governing law to that of the Principality of Sealand, a micronation not recognized as a sovereign state. This choice of law is likely unenforceable as it has no reasonable relationship to the parties or the transaction. US Courts will generally not enforce a choice of law provision if it is contrary to public policy, or if the jurisdiction has no substantial relationship to the parties or the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Conflict with principles of choice of law and forum non conveniens, as well as established legal precedent regarding the enforceability of choice of law clauses.",

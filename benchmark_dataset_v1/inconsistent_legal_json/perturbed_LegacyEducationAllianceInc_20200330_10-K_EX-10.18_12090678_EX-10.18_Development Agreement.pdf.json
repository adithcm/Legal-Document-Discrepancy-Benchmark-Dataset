                "original_text": "Base Royalties and Marketing Royalties shall be paid monthly to T&M within 15 days after the end of the applicable month. Payments will be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "changed_text": "Base Royalties and Marketing Royalties shall be paid quarterly to T&M within 45 days after the end of the applicable quarter. Payments will be made at LEA's discretion, based on available funds.",
                "explanation": "The original contract mandates royalty payments within 15 days of the month's end. The modified text extends this to 45 days after each quarter, which violates California Labor Code Section 204, requiring more frequent payments. Additionally, making payments 'at LEA's discretion' contradicts wage payment laws, requiring a fixed and regular payment schedule.",

                "original_text": "The Term shall commence upon the Effective Date and shall continue for an initial term of five (5) years. The Term shall automatically renew thereafter for successive 5-year terms unless either party provides prior written notice of termination not less than 90 days prior to the end of such five-year term.",
                "changed_text": "The Term shall commence upon the Effective Date and shall continue indefinitely, with no automatic renewal. Termination requires mutual agreement, but if disputes arise, either party may terminate with only 10 days written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows automatic renewal with 90 days' notice, providing stability. The modified text allows termination with only 10 days' notice, potentially conflicting with contract law principles requiring 'reasonable notice' for termination, particularly impacting vested interests. California law requires 'reasonable notice' depending on the contract's nature and duration. Also, indefinite contracts with no renewal clause can cause uncertainty and can conflict with general contract principles.",

The provisions of this Agreement shall apply with full force and effect during the Sell-Off Period. Upon expiration of the Sell-Off Period, LEA shall immediately cease and desist from using or displaying any forms of advertising containing any of the Licensed Marks.",
                "changed_text": "LEA shall immediately cease all operations and marketing related to the Licensed Marks upon termination. No Sell-Off Period is permitted, regardless of existing customer commitments.",
                "explanation": "The original clause grants a 6-month 'Sell-Off Period' to fulfill commitments. The modified text eliminates this period, conflicting with commercial law and potentially consumer protection laws. Abruptly ceasing operations could breach existing customer contracts, leading to legal issues. Some states (including California) have laws protecting consumers and requiring businesses to honor existing contracts or provide adequate compensation.",

                "original_text": "In the event that DeltaThree disputes any amounts set forth on the report, DeltaThree shall provide PrimeCall with written notice of such dispute, which notice shall detail the reasons for the dispute, within seven (7) days of its receipt thereof. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputes.",

The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputes.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the dispute notice period to two days is unreasonable and could be considered a breach of good faith negotiation, potentially violating contract law principles requiring reasonable timeframes for dispute resolution. This may be deemed legally contradictory as it doesn't provide adequate time for a thorough review of financial reports, especially considering the complexity of revenue and expense calculations.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the dispute notice period to one day and removing the obligation to negotiate disputes is unreasonable and contradicts principles of good faith and fair dealing under New York contract law. A one-day window is insufficient for reviewing financial reports and preparing a dispute notice, and removing the negotiation requirement undermines the purpose of the reporting and dispute resolution process, effectively denying PrimeCall a meaningful opportunity to challenge inaccuracies. This could potentially violate legal precedents that enforce reasonable and collaborative dispute resolution processes in contracts.",

                "original_text": "which breach shall not be cured within thirty (30) days after written notice is given to the breaching party specifying the breach, then either PrimeCall or DeltaThree, as the case may be, may, by giving written notice thereof to the other, terminate this Agreement as of a date specified in such notice of termination, which date shall be no earlier than ten (10) days after the date of such notice.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 10 days and the termination notice period to 1 day is significantly shorter than what courts typically deem reasonable, especially in complex commercial agreements. This could be considered a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, potentially making the termination clause unenforceable. The shortened timeframe unduly favors the non-breaching party and deprives the breaching party of a reasonable opportunity to remedy the breach, potentially conflicting with legal standards for fair contract enforcement.",

                "original_text": "5.7 Payment for Products. Todos shall invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to the Reseller, and the Reseller shall pay such sums by no later than thirty (30) days from the date of shipment. All payments made to Todos shall be in New Israeli Shekels.",

Todos shall invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to the Reseller, and the Reseller shall pay such sums by no later than ninety (90) days from the date of shipment. All payments made to Todos shall be in New Israeli Shekels.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the payment term to 90 days without proper justification can potentially create inconsistencies. While generally permissible, excessively long payment terms could be viewed as an unfair trade practice or a violation of standard commercial norms if they significantly disadvantage Todos, particularly if Todos is a smaller entity compared to the Reseller. Many jurisdictions have laws that protect smaller businesses from unfair trade practices by larger entities. Extending payment terms significantly without clear mutual benefit or industry practice could be deemed exploitative. It is pertinent to note that Israeli law, like most commercial jurisdictions, implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing in contractual performance (see, for example, Sections 39 and 61 of the Israeli Contract Law (General Part), 1973). A grossly extended payment term, imposed unilaterally or without sufficient justification, may be challenged as a breach of this duty.",

Within fifteen (15) days of the end of each quarter, the Reseller shall provide Todos with a written report of (a) the quantities of Products distributed, sold, or otherwise transferred; the prices at which the Products were sold; and payments received therefore; and (b) the identity and location of all Customers to whom Products were sold, during the preceding quarter (each a “Quarterly Report”).",

                "explanation": "Extending the reporting deadline to 90 days from the end of each quarter significantly delays the availability of crucial sales and customer data for Todos. This delay could hinder Todos' ability to promptly address any issues, monitor market trends, and make informed business decisions. Israeli law, like many jurisdictions, expects reasonable cooperation and information exchange between parties to a contract, especially in a distribution agreement where ongoing performance monitoring is essential. Unduly delaying reporting, especially when the original contract specifies a shorter, more reasonable timeframe, might be construed as a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Israeli contract law. (Again, see Sections 39 and 61 of the Israeli Contract Law (General Part), 1973).",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 15 days could potentially be viewed as unreasonable and inconsistent with standard commercial practice. While parties can agree on cure periods, excessively short periods can be deemed unconscionable, especially if the breach requires significant time or resources to rectify. The Israeli Contract Law (Remedies for Breach of Contract) Law, 1970, addresses remedies for breach of contract, including termination. While the law allows for termination in cases of material breach, a court might scrutinize whether the stipulated cure period is fair and reasonable under the circumstances. If a 15-day cure period is manifestly insufficient for the nature of the breach, a court could potentially invalidate the termination based on principles of fairness and good faith (again referring to Sections 39 and 61 of the Israeli Contract Law (General Part), 1973).",

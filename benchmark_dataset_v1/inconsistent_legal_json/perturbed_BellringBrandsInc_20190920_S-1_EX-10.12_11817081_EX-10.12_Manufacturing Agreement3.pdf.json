                "original_text": "This Second Amendment shall be effective from The Second Amendment Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2021. Upon\nexpiration, this Second Amendment shall be of no further force or effect, and the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall as they were\nbefore the Second Amendment Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Party’s right to enforce the terms and\nconditions of this Second Amendment shall survive the Second Amendment’s expiration.",
                "changed_text": "This Second Amendment shall be effective from The Second Amendment Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2021. Upon\nexpiration, this Second Amendment shall be of no further force or effect, and the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall as they were\nbefore the Second Amendment Effective Date. A Party’s right to enforce the terms and conditions of this Second Amendment shall expire immediately upon the Second Amendment’s expiration.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for the enforcement of terms and conditions even after the agreement's expiration. The modified text removes this right and stipulates immediate expiration of enforcement rights which could be problematic depending on the nature of the agreement and applicable state law regarding statutes of limitations for breach of contract claims. In California, for example, the statute of limitations for a written contract is four years. This change might force a party to initiate legal action much sooner than legally required or permitted.",

Heritage shall invoice Premier through the [***] billing as identified on Schedule C. Premier is required to make payment on all invoices within 60 days from the invoice date, notwithstanding any disputes regarding the invoice.",
                "explanation": "The modification adds a payment term of 60 days with no allowance for disputes. Under California's Prompt Payment laws for certain industries (though manufacturing agreements may not directly fall under them, this creates a problematic precedent), withholding payment due to a legitimate dispute is a protected right. This modification forces payment even with a valid dispute, potentially violating good faith and fair dealing principles.",

                "changed_text": "All Products manufactured, packaged and delivered to Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement shall conform to the\nspecifications unilaterally determined by Premier at the time of delivery. Heritage holds no liability for changes in specifications after the order date.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear specification process (Schedule A, modified in writing, Post Holdings manual, and samples). The modified version gives Premier complete unilateral control over specifications *at delivery*, making it impossible for Heritage to know what standards to meet during manufacture. This undermines the entire contract. This is a direct contradiction, violating basic fairness and contract formation principles by creating an illusory promise and potential for arbitrary enforcement.",

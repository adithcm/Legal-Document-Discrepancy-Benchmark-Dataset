                "explanation": "Reducing the objection period to one week may be considered an unreasonably short timeframe under German law, potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing, especially if the invoices are complex or the affiliate is a small business. This could be seen as exploiting the affiliate's position.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates general principles of good faith and fair dealing under German Civil Code (BGB) if the timeframe is deemed unreasonably short.",

IF NO\nOBJECTION IS RECEIVED DURING THIS TIME, THE PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED TO HAVE\nACCEPTED THE CHANGES AND THEY WILL BECOME PART OF THE EXISTING RELATIONS\nUNDER THE AGREEMENT.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the objection period for changes to participation terms to 3 days is likely insufficient, especially for complex agreements. This may violate German law, requiring reasonable notice and opportunity to review contractual changes, particularly as it may lead to unfair contract terms being imposed.",

                "explanation": "Changing the retention period of final payment to \"indefinitely\" contradicts principles of reasonable payment terms. Under German law, such an indefinite delay in payment is likely unenforceable as it places the affiliate in an unfairly disadvantaged position and violates principles of good faith.",

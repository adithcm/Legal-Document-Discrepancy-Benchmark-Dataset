                "original_text": "4.\nContinuation.\nThis Amendment will apply and be effective only with respect to the provisions of the Non-\nCompetition Agreement specifically referred to herein. Except as otherwise set forth in this Amendment, the Non-Competition\nAgreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.",
                "changed_text": "4.\nContinuation.\nThis Amendment will apply and be effective only with respect to the provisions of the Non-\nCompetition Agreement specifically referred to herein. Except as otherwise set forth in this Amendment, the Non-Competition\nAgreement will continue in full force and effect, except that any claims arising under the Non-Competition Agreement must be brought within 30 days of the event giving rise to the claim.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contractual deadline for bringing claims that is likely shorter than the statutory limitations period under Delaware law (where Vivint Solar is incorporated) and Utah law (where Vivint, Inc. is incorporated), creating a legal contradiction. The 30-day requirement is far shorter than the typical statute of limitations for contract disputes, which is usually several years.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with Delaware Statute of Limitations (likely 3 years for contract claims) and Utah Statute of Limitations (likely 4-6 years for contract claims).",

                "changed_text": "5.\nMaster Framework Agreement. This Amendment is governed by the Master Framework Agreement, including,\nwithout limitation, the provisions of Sections 4 (Confidentiality) and 6 (Miscellaneous) of the Master Framework Agreement. However, the confidentiality obligations outlined in Section 4 shall expire after one year, regardless of the type of confidential information.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a legal contradiction by arbitrarily limiting the duration of confidentiality obligations to one year. Trade secrets, for example, are generally protected as long as they remain secret and provide a competitive advantage, which can extend far beyond one year. This conflicts with trade secret laws. Depending on the specific nature of the confidential information, a one-year limitation may be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which has been adopted in Delaware and Utah, and common law protections for trade secrets.",

                "original_text": "NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, agreements and conditions set forth herein, and for other\ngood and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:\n1.\nDefinitions. Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Amendment will have the meaning set forth for that\nterm in the Non-Competition Agreement or the Master Framework Agreement, dated September 30, 2016, by and between the\nParties (the “Master Framework Agreement”).",

Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Amendment will have the meaning determined solely by Vivint Solar, in its sole discretion. Vivint's interpretation is not binding.",
                "explanation": "This modification makes the definition of the terms within the contract solely dependent on Vivint Solar. This could be challenged legally as it creates an imbalanced contract where one party has disproportionate control over the interpretation of key definitions, potentially to the detriment of the other party (Vivint). This lack of mutuality of obligation could render portions of the agreement unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts basic principles of contract law requiring mutuality of obligation and good faith.",

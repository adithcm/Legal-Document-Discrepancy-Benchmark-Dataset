Franchisor may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to Franchisee upon the occurrence of any of the following:\n(a) Franchisee fails to make any payment required under or in connection with this Agreement;",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination due to non-payment to 10 days could be considered an unreasonably short timeframe, potentially violating good faith and fair dealing principles that are implied in contracts under New York law, which governs this agreement.",

Franchisee shall be under an obligation to provide any information as may be requested by Franchisor with respect to the Smaaash Centres, including the books of accounts and other relevant documents or records maintained in relation to the Smaaash Centres.",

During the Term, Franchisor shall have the right to conduct audits of Franchisee with respect to the Smaaash Centres, and inspect the Smaaash Centres, after providing a verbal notice of 24 hours.

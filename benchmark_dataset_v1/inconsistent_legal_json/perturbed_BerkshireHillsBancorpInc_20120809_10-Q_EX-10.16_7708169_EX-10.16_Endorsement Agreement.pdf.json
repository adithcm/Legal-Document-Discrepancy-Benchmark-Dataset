                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Past due cash payments (i.e., payments due more than thirty (30) days after Berkshire’s receipt of the applicable invoice) shall bear interest at the rate of one (1%) percent per month.",
                "changed_text": "Past due cash payments (i.e., payments due more than ninety (90) days after Berkshire’s receipt of the applicable invoice) shall bear interest at the rate of one (1%) percent per month.",
                "explanation": "By extending the period before late payment interest applies to 90 days, the contract now contradicts typical prompt payment laws and standard business practices that consider payment delays beyond 30-60 days as potentially problematic and subject to quicker interest accrual, deviating from norms that ensure timely payments.",

                "changed_text": "Berkshire shall give Auriemma as much advanced notice as possible for any requested appearances, but in no event shall Berkshire give Auriemma less than three (3) days’ notice of the time and place Berkshire desires Auriemma to appear.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the minimum notice period for appearances to three days may not provide Auriemma with sufficient time to manage scheduling conflicts with existing obligations. This could potentially lead to breach of contract issues, as it makes it more difficult for Auriemma to fulfill his obligations under the agreement, increasing the risk of non-compliance with contractual obligations regarding providing sufficient notice for appearances.",

                "changed_text": "Upon the breach of either of the above conditions, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: (A) as to a default under clause (i) above, if payment is not made within two (2) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make payment; or (B) as to a default under clause (ii) above, if such default is not cured within five (5) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default and such action the defaulting party must take in order to cure each such item of default.",
                "explanation": "By reducing the cure periods for defaults to just two days for payment failures and five days for other breaches, the contract now provides an unreasonably short timeframe for the defaulting party to rectify the situation. This could be deemed commercially unreasonable and potentially unenforceable, as it does not allow sufficient time to address and resolve complex issues or financial difficulties, contradicting fair dealing standards.",

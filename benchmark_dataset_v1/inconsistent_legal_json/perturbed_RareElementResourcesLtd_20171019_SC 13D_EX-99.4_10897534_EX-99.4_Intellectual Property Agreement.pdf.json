If Company fails to cure the identified breach within thirty (30) days after the date of the notice, Investor may terminate this IP Agreement by written notice to Company.",
                "changed_text": "16.01 Investor at any time may provide written notice to Company of a material breach of this IP Agreement. If Company fails to cure the identified breach within ten (10) days after the date of the notice, Investor may terminate this IP Agreement by written notice to Company.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 10 days may be considered unreasonable in some jurisdictions and could conflict with principles of good faith and fair dealing, particularly in complex commercial agreements where a longer period may be necessary to remedy the breach. This is an issue because contract laws generally expect reasonable time for remediation depending on the complexity of the breach. Under California law, for example, a breach of contract claim might be challenged if the breaching party wasn't given a commercially reasonable cure period.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the negotiation period to two business days may not provide sufficient time for complex disputes to be resolved, potentially conflicting with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing required by New York law (specified in Article 13.00). New York courts may view this as an unreasonably short time frame, especially considering the nature of intellectual property disputes which are frequently complicated and time-consuming.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period to 10 days before abandoning a patent application may be deemed insufficient under patent law principles, as it might not provide the investor enough time to assess the patent's value, secure legal counsel, and prepare to take over prosecution. This is especially crucial in the US, as patent prosecution can be complex and require substantial preparation. A shorter timeframe could be viewed as a breach of good faith, as it hinders the investor's ability to protect its licensed rights effectively.",

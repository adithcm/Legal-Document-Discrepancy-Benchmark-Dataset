You may avoid termination by curing the default to our satisfaction within the 10-day period (or such longer period as applicable law may require). If you do not cure the default within such 10-day period (or such longer period as applicable law may require), this Agreement will terminate automatically and without further notice, effective immediately upon the expiration of the specified time period.",

You may avoid termination by curing the default to our satisfaction within the 5-day period. If you do not cure the default within such 5-day period, this Agreement will terminate automatically and without further notice, effective immediately upon the expiration of the specified time period.",

You may avoid termination by curing the default to our satisfaction within the 30-day period (or such longer period as applicable law may require).

You may avoid termination by curing the default to our satisfaction within the 14-day period. If you do not cure the default within the specified time, this Agreement will terminate automatically and without further notice, effective immediately upon the expiration of the specified time period.",

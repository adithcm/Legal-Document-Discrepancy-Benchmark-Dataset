                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Company will prepare quarterly statements for review by the Parties, released on the 15th day of each subsequent quarter.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will prepare annual statements for review by the Parties, released within 18 months of the fiscal year end.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts standard accounting practices and legal requirements for timely financial reporting. Publicly traded companies in the U.S. (NVOS is a U.S. reporting publicly traded corporation) are generally required to file quarterly and annual reports within much shorter timeframes (e.g., 45 days for 10-Q and 90 days for 10-K).",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC regulations (e.g., rules regarding filing deadlines for 10-Q and 10-K reports).",

                "changed_text": "All company records will be destroyed after two (2) years, irrespective of federal or provincial law.",
                "explanation": "This change violates various record-keeping requirements under both US and Canadian law. Many regulations, including tax laws, environmental regulations, and securities regulations, require records to be maintained for significantly longer periods.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various federal and provincial laws related to taxation (e.g., IRS regulations in the U.S., Canada Revenue Agency guidelines), environmental protection, and securities regulations.",

                "original_text": "The distribution will be based on NVOS audited review and will be made within three months of annual considerations on the basis of a seventy percent (70%) of net profit to NVOS and thirty percent (30%) of net profit to HGF.",
                "changed_text": "The distribution will be based on NVOS sole discretion with no fixed timeline on the basis of a percentage deemed acceptable by NVOS each year.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and potential unfairness in profit distribution, contradicting the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in contracts. Giving NVOS complete discretion without a fixed timeline or percentage violates standard profit sharing agreements and could be seen as a breach of contract if it is deemed unreasonable or exploitative. Furthermore, it could conflict with corporate governance principles requiring fair treatment of joint venture partners.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contract law; potentially corporate governance regulations depending on the structure of the joint venture.",

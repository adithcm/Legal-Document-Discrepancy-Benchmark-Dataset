                "original_text": "On or before sixty (60) days after the end of each month during the Term, NCM shall pay to Network Affiliate $30.00 per digitized screen (i.e., a screen connected to the Digital Content Network), provided Network Affiliate provides the required attendance and screen count information as such information time frames are established by NCM on a monthly basis.",
                "changed_text": "NCM will remit payment to the Network Affiliate at its discretion, without specifying a deadline for payments. The payment amount is subject to deductions based on any factor NCM deems relevant, without needing to follow any particular standard of justification, as long as the network affiliate provides the attendance.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a legal contradiction by removing the clearly defined payment deadline and criteria. Labor laws and contract regulations typically require that payment terms, including deadlines, must be clearly specified in contracts to prevent arbitrary delays or non-payment. The changed text is vague, grants excessive discretion to NCM, and violates fundamental principles of contract law that promote clarity and predictability in financial transactions.",

For purposes of this Section 11.3 the term NCM shall include NCM and its affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term and for a period of five (5) years thereafter Network Affiliate will not, without NCM’s prior written consent, either alone or in concert with others directly or indirectly solicit, entice, induce, or encourage: (i) any employee, contractor or agent of NCM to terminate his or her employment, contractor or agency relationship with NCM, (ii) any client of NCM to discontinue using NCM’s services or products, (iii) any client of NCM to refer prospective clients to one or more competitors of NCM or to discontinue referring prospective clients to NCM, (iv) any NCM employee, client, or prospective client to breach any agreement with NCM, or (v) any existing or proposed arrangement or other community or institutional affiliation to discontinue the affiliation or relationship with NCM. For purposes of this Section 11.3 the term NCM shall include NCM and its affiliates.",
                "explanation": "This modification extends the non-solicitation period from twelve (12) months to five (5) years after the term, which may be considered unreasonably long and create a legal contradiction. Courts often scrutinize non-compete and non-solicitation agreements to ensure they are reasonable in scope and duration. An overly long period can be deemed an unreasonable restraint of trade, violating state laws designed to promote competition and protect individuals' ability to earn a living.",

Network Affiliate shall not use, publish, or distribute any Marketing Materials or other material unless and until NCM has approved it in writing. Upon receipt of such approval from NCM for a particular Marketing Materials or other material, Network Affiliate shall not be obligated to submit to NCM substantially similar material for approval; provided, however, Network Affiliate shall timely furnish samples of all such material to NCM.",
                "changed_text": "NCM retains unlimited discretion to approve or reject any Marketing Materials submitted for review. The Network Affiliate acknowledges that NCM's decision is final and not subject to dispute. The Network Affiliate cannot distribute any marketing materials that contain any resemblance with those of NCM's.",
                "explanation": "This modification contradicts legal principles of good faith and fair dealing, which are implied in every contract. By granting NCM 'unlimited discretion' and making its decisions 'final and not subject to dispute', the clause becomes one-sided and potentially oppressive. This could be seen as an attempt to avoid any obligation to act reasonably, which can render the clause unenforceable under the legal concept of unconscionability or lack of mutuality.",

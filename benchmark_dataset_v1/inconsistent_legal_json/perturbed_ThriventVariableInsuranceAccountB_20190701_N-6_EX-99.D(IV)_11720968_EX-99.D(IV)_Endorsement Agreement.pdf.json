                "original_text": "If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "If you do not make the extra payment within 15 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "explanation": "This change shortens the payment window from 60 days to 15 days, potentially conflicting with state laws that require reasonable timeframes for insurance policyholders to rectify deficiencies before penalties are applied. Some states mandate longer grace periods for premium payments or deficiency corrections.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates state insurance regulations regarding grace periods and deficiency notifications. States often have consumer protection laws mandating reasonable timeframes.",

                "changed_text": "DIVIDENDS. We will determine our divisible surplus when the board of directors deems it necessary. This contract’s share, if any, will be credited as a dividend. Since we do not expect this contract to contribute to divisible surplus, it is not expected that any dividends will be credited.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Each year, we will determine our divisible surplus' to 'We will determine our divisible surplus when the board of directors deems it necessary' gives the company absolute discretion in when to determine and possibly pay out dividends. This contradicts the regulatory compliance for insurance companies to fairly and periodically determine and distribute divisible surplus.",

                "explanation": "Adding 'at the Society's discretion' allows the Society to arbitrarily deny the transfer of ownership, potentially conflicting with state laws that protect contract owners' rights to transfer ownership of their assets. This creates an unbalanced agreement that could be deemed unconscionable.",

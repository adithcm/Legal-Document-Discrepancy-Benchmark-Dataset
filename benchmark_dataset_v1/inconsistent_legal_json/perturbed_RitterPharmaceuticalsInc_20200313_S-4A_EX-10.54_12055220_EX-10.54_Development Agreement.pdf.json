                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within 30 days. Increasing the payment term to 90 days could violate California prompt payment laws (where Qualigen's principal office is located, see page 1 of the agreement) if there isn't a valid dispute. California law requires payment within a shorter timeframe (e.g., 30 days) unless a good faith dispute exists. Changing the payment deadline introduces non-compliance if standard payment terms are legally mandated and shorter than 90 days. This violates California Business and Professions Code Section 7159.5",

Each Party shall advise the other Party promptly (but in any event within no more than 48 hours) of any warning (including any FDA Form 483), citation, indictment, claim, lawsuit, or proceeding issued or instituted by any federal, state or local governmental entity or agency against the Party, or of any revocation of any license or permit if, and only to the extent that, the manufacture, storage, or handling of the Product, or the marketing, selling, promotion or distribution of the Product, is affected.",
                "changed_text": "12.4.\tGovernmental Warnings. Each Party shall advise the other Party when reasonably practical of any warning (including any FDA Form 483), citation, indictment, claim, lawsuit, or proceeding issued or instituted by any federal, state or local governmental entity or agency against the Party, or of any revocation of any license or permit if, and only to the extent that, the manufacture, storage, or handling of the Product, or the marketing, selling, promotion or distribution of the Product, is affected.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates notification within 48 hours. Changing this to 'when reasonably practical' weakens the obligation and could conflict with FDA regulations or other legal requirements mandating prompt reporting of adverse events or regulatory actions.  FDA regulations often require reporting within specific, short timeframes (e.g., 24 hours, 3 days, 30 days depending on the type of report), so failing to notify within the legally required timeframe because it wasn't deemed 'reasonably practical' violates those reporting requirements. This introduces non-compliance with regulatory reporting standards, e.g. 21 CFR Part 803 for medical device reporting.",

If an investigation is needed in response to a complaint or inquiry related to the Product, Qualigen shall perform the investigation and shall bear the cost of such investigation. The documentation of such investigation shall include, but not be limited to, investigation results, cause analysis, corrective and preventative action and health hazard/medical assessment, as appropriate. In the event a Product is returned by a customer for investigation, Qualigen shall ship a replacement Product to the customer. (Provided, that if a request for a return of Product is due to a change of mind over using the Product or the Sekisui customer has overstocked the product, rather than due to a warranty issue, Qualigen need not accept the return or provide any replacement or substitute.) Qualigen shall retain records of all Product related complaints, or Adverse Events for a period of not less than five (5) years beyond the expiration date of the Product or for such longer period as may be required by applicable law. Qualigen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all complaints are appropriately closed within 90 days or less from the receipt of such complaint.",
                "changed_text": "12.6.\tComplaints. Qualigen shall receive customer complaints in the Territory, and shall address them if Qualigen finds them to be important. If an investigation is needed in response to a complaint or inquiry related to the Product, Qualigen may perform the investigation and may decide to bear the cost of such investigation. The documentation of such investigation shall include investigation results, cause analysis, corrective and preventative action and health hazard/medical assessment, as Qualigen deems appropriate. In the event a Product is returned by a customer for investigation, Qualigen may ship a replacement Product to the customer. Qualigen shall retain records of Product related complaints, or Adverse Events for two (2) years beyond the expiration date of the Product. Qualigen will try to ensure complaints are closed.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines specific requirements for Qualigen to receive, investigate, and resolve customer complaints, including the maintenance of records for at least five years beyond the product expiration date and a goal to close complaints within 90 days. The modified text weakens these obligations significantly. By stating that Qualigen will address complaints 'if Qualigen finds them to be important', and that Qualigen 'may' perform and bear the cost of investigations, the agreement no longer ensures a proper system to address customer complaints. Additionally, reducing the record retention period to two years is a direct contradiction to the FDA requirements for medical device companies found in 21 CFR 820.198 (requiring a device history record to be kept for a period equivalent to the design life of the device, but not less than two years from the date of release for commercial distribution).",

                "explanation": "This modification shortens the return and refund period to 14 days. This could be a contradiction to consumer protection laws in certain states (including California) that mandate a longer return window in specific circumstances, thus creating non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the warranty period to 30 days may conflict with implied warranty laws like the implied warranty of merchantability that could extend longer than 30 days depending on the jurisdiction and product.

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law to Delaware is not itself a direct contradiction. However, stating that 'The United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall apply' might become one, because the contract does not specify where the parties are in different countries or not. It could create a conflict if the contract should be governed under United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods based on location of the parties.",

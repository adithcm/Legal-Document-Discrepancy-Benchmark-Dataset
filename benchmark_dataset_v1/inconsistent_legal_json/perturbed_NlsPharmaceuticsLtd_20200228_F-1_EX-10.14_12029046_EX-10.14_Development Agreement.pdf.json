            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Royalty payments shall be paid quarterly within thirty (45) days following the close of the calendar quarter.",
                "changed_text": "Royalty payments shall be paid annually within one hundred and eighty (180) days following the close of the calendar year.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that royalty payments should be made quarterly, within 45 days of the quarter's close. The modified text changes this to annual payments within 180 days of the year's close. This introduces non-compliance as it significantly delays the frequency of payments. Laws in many jurisdictions, including Brazil, often require more frequent payments to ensure timely remittance and reporting of royalties and taxes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Tax and royalty remittance regulations in Brazil and other Latin American countries generally require more frequent reporting and payment schedules. Delaying payments to an annual schedule may violate these regulations.",
                "location": "Article 3.3"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Subject to a written advance notice of thirty (30) calendar days, all relevant records supporting the preparation of the Reports shall be made available during normal business hours for inspection at the expense of Licensor by Licensor or by a selected representative of Licensor for the sole purpose of verifying the Reports and the accuracy of the payments made or due to Licensor under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to a written advance notice of five (5) calendar days, all relevant records supporting the preparation of the Reports shall be made available during normal business hours for inspection at the expense of Licensor by Licensor or by a selected representative of Licensor for the sole purpose of verifying the Reports and the accuracy of the payments made or due to Licensor under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a 30-day advance notice for auditing relevant records. The modified text shortens this to 5 days. This is a contradiction because depending on the jurisdiction, laws and regulations governing audits often specify minimum notification periods to allow the Licensee adequate time to prepare for an audit, collect relevant documents, and arrange for personnel to be available. Five days may be deemed insufficient and therefore unreasonable under applicable auditing standards, conflicting with legal norms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Auditing standards and regulations in various countries, including those applicable to financial and contractual audits, typically require a reasonable notice period, which is generally longer than 5 days.",
                "location": "Article 3.5"
            },
            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the event any payment due under this Agreement is not made at the agreed term and/or for the corresponding full amount, a late payment charge of ten percent (10 %) p.a. is due, calculated on a pro-rata basis of the number of days between the date at which the outstanding amount was due for payment to Licensor and the date is actually paid.",
                "changed_text": "In the event any payment due under this Agreement is not made at the agreed term and/or for the corresponding full amount, a late payment charge of fifty percent (50 %) p.a. is due, calculated on a pro-rata basis of the number of days between the date at which the outstanding amount was due for payment to Licensor and the date is actually paid.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 10% per annum late payment charge. The modified text increases this to 50% per annum. This modification is an inconsistency. Many jurisdictions have laws that limit the maximum permissible interest or late payment charges to prevent usury. A 50% annual interest rate may exceed these legal limits, rendering the clause unenforceable or illegal under the laws governing usury and interest rate caps.",
                "contradicted_law": "Usury laws and interest rate caps in many jurisdictions, which prohibit excessively high interest rates on debts and contractual payments. Brazil, for instance, has regulations limiting interest rates to prevent abusive lending practices.",

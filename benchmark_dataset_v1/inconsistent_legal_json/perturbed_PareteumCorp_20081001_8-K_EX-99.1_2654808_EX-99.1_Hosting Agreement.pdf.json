                "original_text": "ELEPHANT TALK shall pay all invoices no later than *** after the invoice date. ELEPHANT TALK ***, in the event that ELEPHANT TALK fails to meet ***",
                "changed_text": "ELEPHANT TALK shall pay all invoices no later than 10 days after the invoice date. ELEPHANT TALK shall be subject to immediate service termination, in the event that ELEPHANT TALK fails to meet payment obligations.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for a period of time (denoted by '***') for invoice payment, implying a grace period. Reducing the payment term to '10 days' and imposing 'immediate service termination' for non-payment conflicts with standard business practices and regulations in the Netherlands, which generally require a reasonable grace period and formal notice before service termination. This strict payment term and immediate termination clause can be considered unreasonable and potentially unenforceable under Dutch law, especially considering the complexities of international transactions.",

                "changed_text": "This article 11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement as provided for in articles 17 and 18 for a period of six (6) months but shall not in any way limit or restrict either Party's use of its own Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "Dutch law and standard international business practices often recognize that confidential information, particularly trade secrets and sensitive business data, requires protection for a longer duration than six months, depending on the industry and nature of the information. Reducing the confidentiality period to only six months is unreasonable and insufficient to protect proprietary information of this nature. It fails to meet the standard of care and protection expected under contract law for Confidential Information, which typically warrants several years of protection.  This creates an inconsistency and renders this part of the agreement unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Any claim for damages must be notified to the other Party within one (1) month as from the date on which the damage was caused, failing which such claim is deemed to be waived.",
                "explanation": "According to Dutch law, the statute of limitations for contractual claims is typically five years. Reducing the notification period for damages to only one month is considered unreasonably short and may be deemed unenforceable. This unreasonably short period severely limits the ability of the injured party to investigate the damages, gather evidence, and prepare a valid claim, thus creating a contradiction with the legal statute of limitations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Conflicts with the standard Dutch statute of limitations (verjaringstermijn) for contractual claims, which is typically five years (Burgerlijk Wetboek Book 3, Article 3:310).",

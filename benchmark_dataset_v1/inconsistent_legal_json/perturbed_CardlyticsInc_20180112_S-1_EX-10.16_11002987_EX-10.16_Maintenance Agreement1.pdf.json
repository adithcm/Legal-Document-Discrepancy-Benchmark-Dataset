                "original_text": "Supplier shall make reasonable efforts to respond within two (2) hours to Bank of America’s initial request for assistance in correcting or\ncreating a workaround for an Error. Supplier’s response shall include assigning fully-qualified technicians to work with Bank of America to\ndiagnose and correct or create a workaround for the Error and notifying the Bank of America Representative making the initial request for\nassistance of Supplier’s efforts, plans for resolution of the Error, and estimated time required to resolve the Error. Supplier shall correct\nErrors caused by the Object Code by modifying Source Code and distributing the modified Software to Bank of America on the schedule\ncalled for in this Section.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to Bank of America’s initial request for assistance in correcting or creating a workaround for an Error. Supplier’s response will include assigning technicians. Supplier will correct Errors caused by the Object Code when it is convenient for the supplier.",
                "explanation": "The original contract specifies a 2-hour response time for error correction, which may be considered a strict requirement. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating, \"Supplier will use commercially reasonable efforts\" without defining what constitutes reasonable efforts. This could allow Supplier to delay responses beyond what is legally acceptable for critical systems. Also, the supplier will correct Errors caused by the Object Code when it is convenient for the supplier. This could violate the legal agreements.",

Supplier shall require any Subcontractors and\nother persons or entities who provide services to Supplier for delivery to Bank of America directly or indirectly or who hold Confidential\nInformation to implement and administer an information protection program and plan that complies with Bank Security Requirements.\nSupplier shall include or shall cause to be included in written agreements with such Subcontractors or other persons or entities substantially\nthe terms of this Section and the provisions of SCHEDULE E.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier is not obligated to make modifications to its Information Security Program or its procedures and practices, regardless of Bank of America’s security requirements. Subcontractors do not have to implement or administer an information protection program that complies with Bank Security Requirements. The terms of this Section or provisions of SCHEDULE E do not have to be included.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the supplier to adhere to Bank of America's security standards and to ensure that subcontractors also comply. The modified text removes these obligations, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities and non-compliance with regulations that protect customer financial data. This contradicts industry best practices and increases the risk of data breaches, which can have legal and financial consequences.",

At Bank of America’s written request, Supplier shall reasonably cooperate with Bank of America in seeking a protective\norder with respect to such Records.",

Bank of America does not have rights to the Supplier records. Supplier does not have to provide notice of federal or state authorities examining Bank of America records. Supplier does not have to cooperate with Bank of America in seeking a protective order.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the Supplier to maintain records for seven years and allows Bank of America audit rights. Some laws require financial institutions to maintain data for a specified period. By weakening the requirements, the agreement is in violation of financial data maintenance laws.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Receiving Party will have ten (10) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity.",
                "changed_text": "The Receiving Party will have two (2) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period to two business days may be unreasonably short, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most US jurisdictions, including Illinois (governing law as per Section 4). This covenant requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in the performance and enforcement of contracts. Two days may not be sufficient time to conduct due diligence and make an informed decision, especially concerning significant real estate development opportunities. Therefore, this modification introduces a legal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall to the extent possible be settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties within fifteen (15) days from the date of written notice by either Party of the existence of such dispute, and, failing such amicable settlement, shall be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“Rules”).",
                "changed_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall to the extent possible be settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties within five (5) days from the date of written notice by either Party of the existence of such dispute, and, failing such amicable settlement, shall be immediately settled by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“Rules”).",
                "explanation": "Reducing the amicable settlement period to five days introduces a perturbation. Courts generally expect parties to make reasonable efforts to resolve disputes before resorting to arbitration. A five-day negotiation period may be deemed unreasonably short, conflicting with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. Moreover, stating the dispute will be *immediately* settled by arbitration upon failing amicable settlement removes any reasonable time for the involved parties which contradicts procedural fairness.",

                "original_text": "Any required notice shall be effective two business days after it is sent by a recognized international courier service to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and any receipt issued by the courier service shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice.",
                "changed_text": "Any required notice shall be effective immediately upon sending by any means of communication, including but not limited to verbal communication, to any employee of the other Party.",
                "explanation": "Changing the notice requirement to allow verbal communication and immediate effectiveness contradicts standard contract law principles. Contract law typically requires written notice for significant matters to ensure a clear record and prevent disputes over whether notice was actually given. Moreover, specifying 'any employee' introduces ambiguity and potential for unreliable notice, since the employee may not have the authority to receive the notice. This could be deemed commercially unreasonable and violate the duty of good faith, potentially making the notice provision unenforceable. The contract specifies that matters will be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois. Under Illinois law, for such a significant business matter, a written record would be necessary.",

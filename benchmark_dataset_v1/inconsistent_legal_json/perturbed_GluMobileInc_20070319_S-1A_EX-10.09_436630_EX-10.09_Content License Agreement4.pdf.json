                "original_text": "NOTICE PROVISION: The notice information for Licensee in Section 17(a) of the Agreement shall be amended such that “Paul Zuzelo” is deleted and replaced with “General Counsel”, and such that the email address for Paul Zuzelo is deleted.",
                "changed_text": "NOTICE PROVISION: The notice information for Licensee in Section 17(a) of the Agreement shall be amended such that all notices must be delivered exclusively via fax, and responses are not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction because it restricts the method of notice to fax only, and disclaims guaranteed responses. Many states and federal laws require reasonable methods of communication, and courts may find exclusive reliance on fax to be unreasonable, especially with no guarantee of a response. This could render the notice provision unenforceable, conflicting with general contract law principles that require clear and reliable communication methods.",

                "changed_text": "TERM: The rights granted hereunder shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall expire immediately upon Fox's request, regardless of prior agreements or investments made by Glu Mobile Inc.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the principle of good faith and fair dealing, which is implied in most contracts. Allowing Fox to terminate the agreement immediately at will, without any cause or notice, and regardless of Glu Mobile's investments or prior agreements, is likely unenforceable under state contract law. This creates an unconscionable term favoring one party excessively, a violation of contract law.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'unless superseded by Fox's sole discretion without prior notice', the clause undermines the entire agreement. This allows Fox to unilaterally change any term at any time, contradicting the basic requirements of a valid contract which necessitates mutual agreement and certainty of terms. This creates an illusory promise from Fox, as they are not truly bound by the original agreement, rendering it potentially unenforceable.",

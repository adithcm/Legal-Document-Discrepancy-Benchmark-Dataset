                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Upon written demand of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall cease using the Confidential Information and return the Confidential Information and all copies, notes or extracts thereof to the Disclosing Party within seven (7) days of receipt of notice.",
                "changed_text": "Upon written demand of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall cease using the Confidential Information and return the Confidential Information and all copies, notes or extracts thereof to the Disclosing Party within two (2) days of receipt of notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for a 7-day period to return confidential information upon demand. Reducing this period to 2 days may be unreasonably short, especially considering the volume and complexity of information potentially involved. This conflicts with the 'reasonable time' expectation applicable under California law (where the contract is governed), potentially making the clause unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Civil Code ยง1657 (Reasonable Time for Performance) and general contract law principles requiring reasonable terms.",
                "location": "Section 6.2"

                "original_text": "NETTAXI may terminate this Agreement at any time for its convenience, for no reason or for any reason, upon sixty (60) days prior written notice to SpinRecords.com.  In the event of such termination, Spinrecords.com shall be entitled to receive and retain all payments made or payable by NETTAXI prior to the date of termination.",
                "changed_text": "NETTAXI may terminate this Agreement at any time for its convenience, for no reason or for any reason, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to SpinRecords.com. In the event of such termination, Spinrecords.com shall forfeit all payments made or payable by NETTAXI prior to the date of termination.",
                "explanation": "Changing the notice period from 60 to 30 days and adding a clause that makes Spinrecords.com forfeit all payments is an inconsistency and can be seen as a penalty, especially in California. This may be deemed unconscionable if the forfeiture is disproportionate to any actual damages suffered by NETTAXI, violating California's prohibition against penalty clauses in contracts.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Upon reasonable notice of not less than seven (7) business days, but in no event more than once per year (unless the immediately preceding audit showed a material underpayment), NETTAXI shall have the right, subject to suitable confidentiality measures, to cause a certified public accountant to inspect those portions of the books of account and records which relate to the royalties owed NETTAXI, to confirm that the correct amount owing NETTAXI under this Agreement has been paid.",

SpinRecords.com shall allow NETTAXI to view and copy any of its data at its sole discretion, regardless of confidentiality obligations.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 'reasonable notice' and limiting the audit to once per year, while granting NETTAXI unfettered access at any time, is an inconsistency. This provision can be challenged as it imposes an unreasonable burden on SpinRecords.com and potentially violates implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under California law by allowing NETTAXI to disrupt SpinRecords.com's business operations without justification.",

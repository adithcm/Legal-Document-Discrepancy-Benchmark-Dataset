                "changed_text": "Before expiration of the Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon: (i) any material breach of the Agreement by the other Party, if such breach is not remedied to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party within two (2) business days after written notice",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to two business days may be unreasonably short and could be considered a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it doesn't provide sufficient time to address complex issues. Many jurisdictions require a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach, and two days may not meet that standard, especially in Virginia.",

The insurance shall be in an amount of: $2,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate with a $2,000,000 aggregate for products and completed operations. The Association must be a named additional insured, and shall be provided at least 30 days’ notice for cancellation of policy and 10 days’ notice for non-payment of premium. Such insurance shall be primary and non-contributory.",

The insurance shall be in an amount of: $500,000 per occurrence and $500,000 aggregate with a $500,000 aggregate for products and completed operations. The Association must be a named additional insured, and shall be provided at least 5 days’ notice for cancellation of policy and 2 days’ notice for non-payment of premium. Such insurance shall be primary and non-contributory.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the insurance coverage amounts and shortening the notice periods for cancellation or non-payment of premium could violate standard insurance regulations and create potential liability issues. $500,000 may be insufficient coverage for a national sponsorship agreement, given the potential risks. Also, 5 days' notice for cancellation and 2 days' notice for non-payment are significantly shorter than legally required in many jurisdictions and could render the insurance clause unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the deadline for destruction of materials to 15 business days after termination creates a potential trademark infringement issue by extending the period during which the Company could improperly use the Association's marks. This contradicts the Association's right to control its trademark immediately upon termination of the agreement and could expose both parties to legal liability.",

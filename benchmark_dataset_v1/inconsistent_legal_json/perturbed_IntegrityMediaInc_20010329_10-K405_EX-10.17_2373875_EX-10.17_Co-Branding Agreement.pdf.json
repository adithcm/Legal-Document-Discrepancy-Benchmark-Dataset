                "explanation": "This modification reduces the response time for approval requests to one business day. This might be unreasonably short and could contradict standards of 'reasonable time' implied in contract law, potentially hindering Integrity's ability to conduct a thorough review, especially given the complexity of artwork approvals. A one-day turnaround could be seen as commercially unreasonable, especially if Integrity requires external legal or technical consultation, contradicting general contract law principles related to fair dealing and adequate opportunity for review.",

                "explanation": "Changing the accounting period from quarterly to annually and extending the payment deadline to 180 days (approximately six months) after the year's end introduces a perturbation. Many jurisdictions have laws and regulations that require more frequent accounting and royalty payments, especially in the music industry, to protect artists' and rights holders' interests. This change significantly delays royalty payments, conflicting with standard industry practices and potentially violating implied duties of timely payment.",

Such auditing party must make specific written objection within such two (2) year period. Thereafter, it will be deemed to have consented to any such statements or accountings which will then be considered an account stated as between the parties, not subject to any objection for any reason whatsoever.

Such auditing party must make specific written objection within such six (6) month period. Thereafter, it will be deemed to have consented to any such statements or accountings which will then be considered an account stated as between the parties, not subject to any objection for any reason whatsoever. Provided the objecting party has made timely written objection, as aforesaid, such party may file an action regarding same within one (1) year after the applicable statement is rendered, after which time any such action will be deemed barred.",
                "explanation": "This modification alters the audit rights and limitations period. It increases the notice period for audits from 30 to 90 days but reduces the audit window from 2 years to 6 months, and reduces the time to file an action from 2 years and 6 months to 1 year. These changes may conflict with statutes of limitations for breach of contract claims in Tennessee, which could be longer than the one-year period specified in the contract. Shortening the time to bring an action could be deemed unconscionable or against public policy if it unreasonably restricts a party's ability to seek legal recourse for legitimate claims.",

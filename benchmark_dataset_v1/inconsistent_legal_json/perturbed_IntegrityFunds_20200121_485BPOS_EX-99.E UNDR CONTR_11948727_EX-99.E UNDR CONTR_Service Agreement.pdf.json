The Fund’s agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers and governors, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon the Fund’s being notified of any action brought against Integrity, its officers or governors, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or by telegram addressed to the Fund at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to the Fund by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires the Fund to be notified within ten days of any action brought against Integrity. Shortening the notification period to two days is unreasonable and potentially contradicts legal standards of reasonable notice, which often mandate a longer period, depending on the jurisdiction and the specifics of the case. This alteration could prejudice Integrity's ability to prepare a defense.",

Additionally, Kansas has specific laws related to investment companies, and forcing California law could negate some protective measures, harming Kansas investors.",

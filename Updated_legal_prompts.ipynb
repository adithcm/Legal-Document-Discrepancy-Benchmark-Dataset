    "f\"\"\"You are a senior compliance officer reviewing a legal contract. Your task is to modify a section of the contract by introducing an ambiguous legal obligation while ensuring that the ambiguity contradicts a state or national law.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Before modifying the text:\n",
    "    - **Read the file** to determine what city, state, or country the contract applies to.\n",
    "    - If the jurisdiction is unclear, default to **United States law**.\n",
    "    - Make sure that when taking the original texts, there should be no jumps between sentences. Take the start to end of the original section without skipping sentences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Ambiguities occur when a legal statement is vague, leading to multiple interpretations. A **legal contradiction** under this category happens when an obligation is introduced ambiguously, making it difficult to enforce under state or national law. This can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements, leaving legal obligations open to dispute.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a clear legal obligation in the contract.\n",
    "    2. Modify the wording to make it **vague or open to multiple interpretations**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure that this ambiguity creates **non-compliance with a specific law** in the identified jurisdiction.\n",
    "    4. Use online legal databases or verified government resources to **find a real law that is contradicted**.\n",
    "    5. For that contradiction, extract:\n",
    "   - **The citation/title of the law** (e.g., \"29 CFR § 516.2\" or \"CA Labor Code § 201\")\n",
    "   - **Two direct links (URLs)** to official or government sources for the law (**these links must be accessible. The relevant citation should be inside this URL. The page should be found - we should not get a Page Not Found or similar error.**)\n",
    "   - **The first URL must come from an official government or legislature domain (ends in .gov, .mil, .state.<XX>.us, or one of uscode.house.gov, ecfr.gov, govinfo.gov, law.cornell.edu). Use the most recent version of the statute/regulation.**\n",
    "   - **The second URL should be a secondary link to serve as a backup in case the first link falters, but we wish for that to not happen.**\n",
    "   - **A brief explanation** of how the modified text contradicts the law (**law_explanation**)\n",
    "    6. Make 2–3 such perturbations for the file.\n",

    "    ### **Examples of Ambiguous Legal Obligations:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The company shall provide necessary accommodations for disabled employees.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The company shall provide accommodations for disabled employees as deemed appropriate.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The term \"as deemed appropriate\" introduces ambiguity, conflicting with **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)**, which mandates **clear, non-discretionary accommodations**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"All contractors must comply with local zoning laws.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"All contractors must make reasonable efforts to comply with zoning laws.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Reasonable efforts\" is vague—some zoning laws require strict adherence.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The landlord shall ensure habitable living conditions in compliance with state law.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The landlord shall make efforts to maintain habitable conditions.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Make efforts\" does not guarantee habitability, which violates **tenant protection laws**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The company shall maintain data security measures that meet industry standards.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The company shall maintain data security measures that it deems sufficient.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Deems sufficient\" is subjective and contradicts **GDPR and CCPA** requirements for **specific security standards**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Employees shall be provided meal breaks as required by law.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Employees shall be encouraged to take meal breaks.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Some states require **mandatory** meal breaks (e.g., California).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The Contractor shall comply with all federal and state regulations governing workplace safety, ensuring all necessary precautions are taken to protect employees from occupational hazards. The Contractor must conduct quarterly safety inspections and submit reports to regulatory authorities. Any violations of safety standards shall result in corrective actions and potential penalties. The company’s leadership is responsible for ensuring full compliance at all levels.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The Contractor should make reasonable efforts to comply with applicable federal and state regulations governing workplace safety. The Contractor may conduct periodic safety inspections and submit reports when deemed necessary. Violations of safety standards will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, and corrective actions may be recommended where appropriate.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall comply' with 'should make reasonable efforts,' making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. The removal of 'quarterly safety inspections' eliminates a clear legal requirement, and replacing 'shall result in corrective actions' with 'may be recommended' creates uncertainty. This contradicts **OSHA regulations**, which mandate strict compliance and routine reporting on workplace safety violations.\n",

    "    - **Original:** \"The employee shall be considered an independent contractor.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The worker shall be considered an independent contractor.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Some states define **“worker” differently from “independent contractor”** under employment laws, leading to misclassification.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Bank deposits are federally insured up to $250,000.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Bank deposits may be insured at the institution’s discretion.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** This contradicts **FDIC insurance laws**, which guarantee deposit protection.\n",

    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"A tenant has the right to a habitable living environment.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"A tenant has the right to request habitability improvements.\"\n",

    "    - **Original:** \"Employees are entitled to paid overtime after 40 hours per week.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Overtime pay shall be determined based on business needs.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The **Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)** mandates **fixed overtime rules**—this modification makes it discretionary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"All sales agreements must disclose total finance charges.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Finance charge disclosure is encouraged but not required.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The **Truth in Lending Act (TILA)** requires **clear disclosure** of finance charges.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The lessee shall be responsible for all maintenance and repair costs associated with the leased property, except those classified as structural repairs, which shall be the responsibility of the lessor.

    "    - **Modified:** \"The lessee shall be responsible for all upkeep and general property repairs, except for major repairs, which shall be handled by the lessor.\"\n",

    "You are a regulatory compliance officer ensuring that legal disclosures are properly placed within contracts. Your task is to relocate a legally required disclosure to an irrelevant section, making it difficult to enforce.\n",

    "    4. Use **online legal databases or verified government resources** to **find a real law** that is contradicted by this relocation.\n",
    "    5. For that contradiction, extract:\n",

    "### **Examples of Misplaced Legal Disclosures:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "- **Original (Under 'Dispute Resolution'):** \"In case of disputes, arbitration shall be required.\"\n",
    "- **Modified (Moved to 'Optional Clauses'):** \"In case of disputes, arbitration shall be required.\"\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Some jurisdictions require **arbitration clauses to be in dispute resolution sections**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "- **Original (Under 'Employee Rights'):** \"All employees are entitled to whistleblower protections.\"\n",
    "- **Modified (Moved to 'Company Policies (Optional)'):** \n",
    "- **Explanation:** **Federal whistleblower laws** require **clear disclosure in a dedicated section**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "- **Original (Under 'Finance Terms'):** \"Loan agreements must include an APR disclosure.\"\n",
    "- **Modified (Moved to 'Supplementary Information'):** \n",
    "- **Explanation:** The **Truth in Lending Act (TILA)** mandates **explicit placement of APR disclosures**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 4:**\n",
    "- **Original (Under 'Cancellation Policy'):** \"Customers have the right to cancel subscriptions within 14 days.\"\n",
    "- **Modified (Moved to 'Marketing and Promotions'):** \n",
    "- **Explanation:** Some consumer protection laws **require cancellation rights to be explicitly stated**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 5:**\n",
    "- **Original (Under 'Privacy and Security'):** \"Data privacy rights are outlined in the Privacy Policy.\"\n",
    "- **Modified (Moved to 'Miscellaneous Terms'):** \n",
    "- **Explanation:** **GDPR and CCPA** require privacy rights to be **easily accessible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 6:**\n",
    "- **Original:** \"In the event of a dispute, arbitration shall be the exclusive method of resolution, and no party shall have the right to seek litigation in any jurisdiction. The arbitration process shall follow the American Arbitration Association’s rules and be binding upon both parties.\"\n",
    "- **Modified:** \"Arbitration shall be the method of resolution in the event of a dispute, and no party shall have the right to seek litigation, but the method of resolution shall be determined by mutual agreement.\"\n",
    "- **Explanation:** The restructuring of the sentence **introduces contradiction**—the first part states arbitration is **mandatory**, but the latter part allows for 'mutual agreement' on dispute resolution. This contradicts the original clause's **strict arbitration requirement**, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.\n",

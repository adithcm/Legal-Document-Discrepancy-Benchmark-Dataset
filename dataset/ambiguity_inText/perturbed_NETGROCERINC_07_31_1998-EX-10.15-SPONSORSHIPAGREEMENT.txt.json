                "original_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, an \"Impression\" is defined as any link to the NetGrocer Site, whether graphic, text or any combination of graphic and text, served by Excite to a user as part of an HTML page, part of the Excite's Internet chat service or part of search results displayed in \"Excite Shopping Service powered by Jango\".",
                "changed_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, an \"Impression\" is defined as any link to the NetGrocer Site, whether graphic or text, served by Excite to a user as part of an HTML page. It does *not* include links served within Excite's Internet chat service or search results.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Impression' is narrowed in the changed text, excluding links served within the Excite chat service and search results, which contradicts the original broader definition. This ambiguity could lead to disputes about which links qualify as billable impressions.",

Within three (3) business days of Excite's receipt of any revised advertising banners, Excite shall replace the former advertising banners with the updated advertising banners. Text and/or graphics in the \"Exciting Stuff' and \"Such A Deal\" promotions may be replaced with new text and/or graphics twice per month. All other text links may be replaced with new text links once per month.",
                "changed_text": "NetGrocer may revise, update and/or replace the Impression Material at any time in its sole discretion. Excite will use commercially reasonable efforts to replace the former advertising banners with the updated advertising banners within a reasonable timeframe. There are no specific constraints on how frequently content can be updated or replaced.",
                "explanation": "The changed text removes the specific obligation on Excite to replace banners within three business days, replacing it with a 'commercially reasonable efforts' clause. It also eliminates limitations on content updates, opening the door to further disagreement between both parties.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement if, in its sole and subjective determination, the other party fails to meet performance expectations. Termination is effective immediately upon written notice, with no requirement for a cure period.",
                "explanation": "The modified version allows for termination based on 'subjective determination' of unmet 'performance expectations', which contradicts the objective 'material breach' requirement and 60-day cure period in the original. This creates uncertainty about what constitutes grounds for termination.",

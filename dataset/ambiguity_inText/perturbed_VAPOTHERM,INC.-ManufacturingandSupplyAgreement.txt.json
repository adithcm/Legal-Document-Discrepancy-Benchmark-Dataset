                "changed_text": "2.2 Inventory. During the Term, Medica shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain a safety stock of Cartridges. The target safety stock level is one (1) times the monthly average number of Cartridges ordered by Vapotherm during the immediately preceding [* * *] months, but this is not a strict requirement.",
                "explanation": "Original version mandates a specific safety stock level. The revised version introduces 'commercially reasonable efforts' and clarifies the target level is not a strict requirement, weakening the obligation and creating ambiguity, contrasting with sections requiring strict adherence to supply volumes.",

Vapotherm may reject any Cartridge that does not meet the Specifications or otherwise comply with this Agreement (any such Cartridge, a \"Nonconforming Cartridge\"). If Medica accepts that Vapotherm was entitled to reject the Nonconforming Cartridge(s) and Vapotherm has already paid the purchase price for the Nonconforming Cartridge(s), then, within [* * *] Calendar Days after receiving notice from Vapotherm under Section 4.2, Medica shall, at Vapotherm's election, either replace the Nonconforming Cartridge(s) at no additional cost to Vapotherm or reimburse Vapotherm for the purchase price of the Nonconforming Cartridge(s) via wire transfer. Further, if Medica accepts that Vapotherm was entitled to reject the Nonconforming Cartridge(s) and Vapotherm has not already paid the purchase price for the Nonconforming Cartridge(s), then, within [* * *] Calendar Days after receiving notice from Vapotherm under Section 4.2, Medical shall, at Vapotherm's election, either replace the Nonconforming Cartridge(s) at no additional to Vapotherm beyond the original purchase price charged to Vapotherm for the Nonconforming Cartridge(s) or cancel that purchase order or the portion thereof relating to the Nonconforming Cartridge(s), s applicable.",
                "changed_text": "4.3 Rejection. Vapotherm may consider rejecting a Cartridge that arguably does not fully meet the Specifications or debatably comply with this Agreement (any such Cartridge, a \"Potentially Nonconforming Cartridge\"). If Medica acknowledges Vapotherm's claim that a Cartridge might be rejected and Vapotherm has possibly paid the purchase price for the Potentially Nonconforming Cartridge(s), then, within a reasonable timeframe after receiving loose notice from Vapotherm under vague Section 4.2, Medica should perhaps, if feasible and at Vapotherm's whim, either vaguely replace the Potentially Nonconforming Cartridge(s) at no additional explicit cost to Vapotherm or loosely reimburse Vapotherm for some purchase price of the Potentially Nonconforming Cartridge(s) via some transfer medium. Further, if Medica concedes Vapotherm's belief that a Cartridge could be rejected and Vapotherm has not necessarily paid the purchase price for the Potentially Nonconforming Cartridge(s), then, within an indefinite period after receiving uncertain notification from Vapotherm under amorphous Section 4.2, Medical might, if possible and at Vapotherm's suggestion, perhaps loosely substitute the Potentially Nonconforming Cartridge(s) at no additional implicit cost to Vapotherm beyond the approximate original purchase price possibly charged to Vapotherm for the Potentially Nonconforming Cartridge(s) or incompletely cancel that purchase order or some portion thereof relating to the Potentially Nonconforming Cartridge(s), s applicable.",
                "explanation": "This edit introduces significant ambiguity through the use of qualifiers like 'consider', 'arguably', 'debatably', 'Potentially', 'might', 'perhaps', 'reasonable timeframe', 'loose notice', 'vague Section', 'some', 'transfer medium', 'indefinite period', 'uncertain notification', 'amorphous Section', 'possibly', 'explicit cost', 'implicit cost', 'approximate original purchase price', 'incompletely', and 'some portion thereof'. These soften the obligations and create uncertainty around the rejection process, conflicting with the original version's more definitive terms. The use of terms like 'loose notice', 'vague Section', and 'amorphous Section' also introduce a high degree of subjectivity, contrasting with clauses emphasizing objective compliance with specifications.",

                "original_text": "14.1 Definitions. When used in this Agreement, the following terms have the - following meanings: \"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any given Person, any other Person at the time directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with that Person, or (2) any director, officer or employee of that Person. For purposes of this Agreement, \"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "14.1 Definitions. When used in this Agreement, the following terms may have the following meanings: \"Affiliate\" might mean, with respect to any given Person, any other Person at the time loosely associated, controlled by, or under some common influence with that Person, or possibly any director, officer, or employee vaguely connected with that Person. For purposes of this Agreement, \"control\" could mean the perception, tangentially or indirectly, of an ability to somewhat influence or sway the administrative decisions of a Person, perhaps through owning certain voting shares, in accordance with agreements, or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' and 'Control' provides clear and specific criteria. The modified definition introduces ambiguity through the use of 'might mean', 'loosely associated', 'some common influence', 'possibly', 'vaguely connected', 'could mean', 'perception', 'tangentially or indirectly', 'somewhat influence', 'sway', and 'perhaps'. These terms soften the original definitions, making it difficult to determine which entities qualify as affiliates, and what constitutes control, creating uncertainty in obligations tied to affiliate relationships, particularly regarding indemnification and confidentiality.",

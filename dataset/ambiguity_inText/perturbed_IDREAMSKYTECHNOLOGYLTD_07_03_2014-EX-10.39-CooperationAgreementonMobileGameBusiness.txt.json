                "changed_text": "3.2 Party B guarantees to have the legal permits and qualifications necessary for the performance of the matters hereunder, including, without limitation, business license with legitimate business scope, qualification for providing contents/application services; Party B shall provide Party A with documentation that it deems sufficient to demonstrate its qualifications. The determination of whether documentation is adequate is solely at Party B's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Original text requires Party B to provide 'true and legitimate business permits' and other documentation. The modified version allows Party B to provide whatever documentation it deems sufficient, giving Party B the power to determine compliance and contradicting the original intent of verification and compliance.",

Party B shall endeavor to provide party A with the list of relevant persons and their respective details of contact and guarantee smooth communications when it is feasible.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a hard deadline of 72 hours for complaint resolution. The modified version introduces 'unless unforeseen circumstances prevent it' and 'when it is feasible', creating a loophole that undermines the enforceability of the 72-hour deadline. It is unclear what constitutes 'unforeseen circumstances' or 'feasible', giving Party B leeway to delay resolution.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates Party B to pay a performance bond. The modified version makes the payment optional and the amount discretionary, creating ambiguity on the obligation and contradicts the original intent by granting Party B the unilateral right to decide whether the performance bond is paid at all.",

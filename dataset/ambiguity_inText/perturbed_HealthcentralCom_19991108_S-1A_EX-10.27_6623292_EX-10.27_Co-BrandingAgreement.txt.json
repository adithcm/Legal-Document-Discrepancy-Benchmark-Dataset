                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for a period of two (2) years (the \"Term\"). The effective date of the start of the Term will be from the Launch Date.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for a period of two (2) years (the \"Term\"). The effective date of the start of the Term will be from the Launch Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term shall automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 90 days prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term.",
                "explanation": "Introduces contradiction by initially defining a two-year term, but then adding an automatic renewal clause. This creates ambiguity as to the actual duration of the agreement. This can affect future planning of both MLX and HCI and can also influence investment and partnership decisions.",

During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of six (6) months thereafter, MediaLinx shall not use or publicly disclose the data collected from users of the Co-Branded Site if such use is for the purpose of providing health information, advertisements, or products that compete with those that reside on the Co-Branded Site. In other instances, MediaLinx shall be entitled to use or publicly disclose the data collected subject to privacy guidelines noted above.",

MediaLinx shall be entitled to use or publicly disclose the data collected subject to privacy guidelines noted above. Any and all customer data that is collected from the Co-Branded Site shall be collected and used in accordance with Canadian federal and provincial laws and U.S. Federal and State laws and both MediaLinx and HCI privacy guidelines and MediaLinx and HCI shall each own an undivided interest in such data.",
                "explanation": "Introduces contradiction regarding the use of user data. The original text restricts MediaLinx from using user data for competitive purposes for six months after the agreement's end. The modified text, however, states that MediaLinx is generally entitled to use data collected subject to privacy guidelines. This creates conflict in the agreement about MediaLinx's limitations on data use. This could lead to legal issues related to breach of contract or privacy violations.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that all electronic communications be mutually agreed upon. The changed text grants HCI the final say on communication content, undermining the requirement for mutual agreement. This creates an in-text contradiction regarding control over communications. The legal dispute could concern who has the right to communicate with users and what content they can send. Also, this has the potential to negatively impact MediaLinx's brand.",

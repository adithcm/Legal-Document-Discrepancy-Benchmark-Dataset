                "original_text": "1.2. Territory. The Territory is defined as that geographical area in which said Agent is represented by a full time field sales representative, and of which assigned Distributor agrees to be responsible for mutually agreed upon quarterly and annual sales objectives as described in the \"Business Plan\". Compensation by the Company to the Agent will be limited to the area stated as follows: The 48 Continental United States (including DC) plus Alaska 3 -2- No compensation will be earned by the Agent for sales generated from customers in geographical areas not indicated in this section 1.2.",
                "changed_text": "1.2. Territory. The Territory is defined as the entire world, encompassing all countries and regions where the Company's products are legally permitted to be sold, irrespective of whether the Agent has a physical presence or sales representatives in those specific areas. Compensation by the Company to the Agent will be limited to the area stated as follows: The 48 Continental United States (including DC) plus Alaska 3 -2- No compensation will be earned by the Agent for sales generated from customers in geographical areas not indicated in this section 1.2.",
                "explanation": "The first definition restricts the territory to areas with full-time field sales representatives and the continental US plus Alaska. The second definition defines the territory as the entire world. This creates a contradiction because the agent is only compensated for sales in the US and Alaska, but the agreement could be interpreted to give them responsibilities outside that area.",

Orders received on Fridays or the day before holidays will not be shipped until the next business day unless special arrangements have been made at the customers expense. The Company will supply a list confirming such order shipments to the Agent by the end of the next business day. If orders exceed the available inventory levels, the Company will use reasonable efforts to inform the Agent and ship the remaining inventory in a manner that the Company deems as being fair and equitable. If product becomes available during a backorder, the Company will ship orders on a first-come, first-serve basis, but can, at its 6 -5- own discretion, give partial shipments to large orders. In no event will the Company be obligated to provide Products to the Agent in excess of one hundred and twenty percent (120%) of any maximum quantity specified in the applicable Business Plan;",

                "explanation": "The original section states the company 'will use its reasonable best efforts' to ship orders, creating an expectation of fulfillment. The modified section states that the company 'has no obligation' to fill or ship orders, directly contradicting the original obligation. This creates an inconsistency in the contract, and allows one party to not be obligated to fill the orders for the other.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Section 1.1. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non- transferable, and (subject to Section 1.2 hereof) non-sublicensable license for the use of the Brand solely for the Permitted Activity.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.1. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non- transferable, and (subject to Section 1.2 hereof) non-sublicensable license for the use of the Brand primarily for the Permitted Activity.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'solely' to 'primarily', the scope of permitted use of the Brand becomes ambiguous. It's unclear whether the Licensee can use the Brand for activities outside of the 'Permitted Activity' and under what conditions. This creates a contradiction if other clauses strictly limit the Brand usage.",

                "changed_text": "Section 4.2. Termination for Convenience. Licensor reserves the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice for any material reason, including if the usage of the Brand is significantly not in compliance with the standards and policies.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'material' to the reason of termination makes it ambiguous of which reasons are considered to be 'material' and who decides it, especially because the original section states that the termination can be done 'for any reason'. Adding also 'significantly' alters the interpretation of the action. This introduces ambiguity as the original termination clause was for 'any reason' including non-compliance, now requires a higher threshold (significantly not in compliance), creating a contradiction.",

EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY ACTION RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT.",
                "changed_text": "Section 9.4. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, except for matters related to intellectual property, which shall be governed by Delaware law. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY ACTION RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, except for intellectual property disputes, where jurisdiction shall be in Delaware.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding which law governs the agreement. The first sentence specifies New York law for all matters, while the added exception dictates Delaware law for intellectual property. This introduces ambiguity and jurisdictional conflicts if a dispute involves both contractual and intellectual property elements.",

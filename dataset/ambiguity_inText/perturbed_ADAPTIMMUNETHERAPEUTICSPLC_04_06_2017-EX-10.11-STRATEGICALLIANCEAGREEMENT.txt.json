                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the responsibility for IND monitoring. The original text assigns it to Adaptimmune unless the JSC decides otherwise. The modified version definitively assigns monitoring to MD Anderson, creating a conflict if the JSC makes a different decision later, or if other sections assume Adaptimmune's monitoring role.",

Adaptimmune is solely responsible for notifying MD Anderson of data results discovered from Adaptimmune's monitoring visits only.",
                "explanation": "This edit creates conflicting requirements for reporting adverse findings. Previously, both parties were responsible for mutual notification. Now, Adaptimmune's notification to MD Anderson is limited to data results from *Adaptimmune's* monitoring. If MD Anderson discovers issues through their own oversight, it's unclear if Adaptimmune should be notified, creating uncertainty in communication and potential safety oversight.",

Termination of service for non-payment will only occur after a 60-day grace period and a formal written notice.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the termination policy for unpaid amounts. Initially, it states immediate termination is possible after 30 days of non-payment. The modified text provides a 60-day grace period and a formal written notice before termination, conflicting with the original immediate termination clause. This creates uncertainty about when the service can actually be terminated for non-payment.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the length of the 'Initial Term'. Initially, it's tied to the duration of the Company's Offering, which is undefined, potentially short, and variable. The modified text defines the Initial Term as a fixed one-year period. This creates ambiguity as to the actual duration of the agreement, impacting contract enforcement.",

The changed text states that the *Company* is ultimately responsible for Reversals stemming from verifiable fraud by users.

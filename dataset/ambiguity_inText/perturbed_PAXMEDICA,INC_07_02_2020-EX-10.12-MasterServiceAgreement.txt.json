                "original_text": "4.1. Either party may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days written notice if the other materially breaches this Agreement; provided, however that the party in breach shall have the right to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of the other party's intention to terminate.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days written notice if the other materially breaches this Agreement; provided, however that the party in breach shall have the right to cure such breach within sixty (60) days after receipt of written notice of the other party's intention to terminate.",
                "explanation": "The cure period for a material breach is extended from 30 to 60 days, creating an inconsistency with other sections that might rely on the original 30-day period, impacting timelines and obligations.",

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each party's total liability in respect of damages under this Agreement, any regulation or common law shall be limited to the sum of all amounts received from Client in terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply with respect to any claims arising out of or relating to clause 6 (Inventions and Proprietary Information), indemnification obligations or damages arising from a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.",

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each party's total liability in respect of damages under this Agreement, any regulation or common law shall be limited to the sum of all amounts received from Client in terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply with respect to any claims arising out of or relating to clause 6 (Inventions and Proprietary Information).",
                "explanation": "By removing 'indemnification obligations or damages arising from a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct' from the exceptions to the liability limitation, a conflict is created. The removal of the exception relating to damages arising from a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct directly contradicts Section 5.6 and 5.7, which establish indemnification obligations for negligent or willful acts. This contradiction introduces uncertainty regarding the extent of liability and indemnification responsibilities in cases involving negligence or misconduct.",

                "explanation": "The governing law is changed from Connecticut to South Africa. This creates an internal contradiction because the agreement is between a South African company and a US company and other clauses within it might be implicitly relying on US laws. The change can impact the interpretation and enforcement of various clauses.",

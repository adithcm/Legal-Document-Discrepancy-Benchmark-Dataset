Monthly, the performance level shall be measured as set          out above. Failure to provide services as set out herein constitutes a          Monthly Service Failure.",

Monthly, the performance level shall be measured based on mutually agreed upon metrics to be defined and adjusted quarterly by both parties. Failure to provide services as set out herein *may* constitute a Monthly Service Failure, subject to review and negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear, quantitative definition of 'on time performance.' The modified version introduces ambiguity by removing the mention of 'Force Majeure' and stating that the measurement will be based on mutually agreed upon metrics, to be adjusted quarterly, that were not in the original agreement, and by making a service failure 'may' instead of definitively being one, making contract enforcement difficult and creating dispute over what actually constitutes a Monthly Service Failure.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates written communication. The modified version introduces an exception for 'urgent operational matters,' allowing verbal communication under certain circumstances. This introduces ambiguity, as there are no guidelines for what constitutes 'urgent' and 'electronic confirmation' is undefined and could be disputed. This contradicts the original strict requirement for written notices, leading to potential legal disputes over notification validity.",

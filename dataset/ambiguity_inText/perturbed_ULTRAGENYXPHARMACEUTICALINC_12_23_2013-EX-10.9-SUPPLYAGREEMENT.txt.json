                "explanation": "The original text mandates a defect-free product that meets specifications. The revised text changes 'shall supply' to 'shall use its best efforts to supply,' and states that they are 'aiming to meet the product specifications', making the obligation less strict and introducing uncertainty regarding the required level of conformity.",

                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that prices 'shall be agreed' annually, but the modified text softens this to prices are 'intended to be agreed'. This makes the yearly price agreement non-binding. Also, the original states Cremer may refuse delivery if a price isn't agreed upon, however the new text states they must continue at the old price. This directly conflicts with Article 3, 1) about price adjustments.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by using indefinite language such as 'at least a portion', 'may not be fully reflected', and 'some' where definitive statements were present. This creates uncertainty about the extent of Marathon Parties' ownership and interests and whether they are adhering to restrictions, potentially impacting the agreement's enforceability.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that Marathon Parties 'shall' vote in a prescribed manner. The modified version introduces 'may' and other weakening language. This creates a contradiction because it introduces uncertainty in the commitment of the Marathon Parties to support the Board's recommendations. This introduces an internal contradiction if the purpose of the Support Period is to provide guaranteed support.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall' to 'may find it reasonably necessary to breach this section', and 'may not fully be committed to abstain' and incorporating words like 'possibly', the original obligation of mutual non-disparagement becomes ambiguous. It is unclear if the parties are actually committed to avoiding disparagement. This ambiguity is worsened if another clause in the agreement relies on strict non-disparagement, thus creating an internal contradiction.",

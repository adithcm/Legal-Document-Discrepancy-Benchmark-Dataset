                "original_text": "1.11  \"Complete\" or \"Completion\" or \"Completing\" means a single operation intended to complete a well as a producer of oil and/or gas in one or more Zone(s), including, but not limited to, the setting of pipe/production lining and casing tie-back, installing tubing, wellhead and tree, perforating, plugging back, well stimulation, and testing.",
                "changed_text": "1.11  \"Complete\" or \"Completion\" or \"Completing\" means a single operation intended to prepare a well for potential production, which may or may not result in actual production of oil and/or gas. This includes, but is not limited to, the setting of pipe/production lining and casing tie-back, installing tubing, wellhead and tree, perforating, plugging back, well stimulation, and testing. Completion is considered finished when the operation is done with the requirements.",
                "explanation": "The original definition implies a successful outcome (producer of oil/gas). The modified definition broadens this to include unsuccessful attempts, creating ambiguity around obligations tied to 'Completion' of a well, such as payment structures or earning rights. If something is done with the requirements, it is considered completed in changed text, which is very ambiguos.",

                "original_text": "5.3   The Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Well shall be under the exclusive control of BP and the operation thereof shall be conducted in a prudent and workmanlike manner. BP shall conduct all its activities under this Agreement as a reasonable prudent operator, in a good and workmanlike manner, with due diligence and dispatch, in accordance with good oilfield practice, and in compliance with applicable law and regulation, but in no event shall BP have any liability to Company for losses sustained or liabilities or obligations incurred except such as may result from BP's gross negligence or willful misconduct.",
                "changed_text": "5.3   The Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Well shall be under the general oversight of BP, with operational details determined based on prevailing industry standards. BP shall generally aim to conduct its activities under this Agreement in alignment with reasonable industry practices, considering cost-effectiveness and logistical feasibility, and in general compliance with applicable law and regulation. BP's liability to the Company for losses or obligations is limited to situations of gross negligence or willful misconduct directly attributable to senior management's explicit instructions.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'exclusive control' and 'prudent and workmanlike manner,' setting a high standard of care. The modified version introduces uncertainty by using terms like 'general oversight,' 'aim to conduct,' 'considering cost-effectiveness,' and limiting liability to senior management instructions. This contradiction creates ambiguity regarding BP's operational responsibilities and liability standards.",

                "changed_text": "1.36  \"Unit\" means any area designated for oil and gas operations, including but not limited to compulsory units established by the Commissioner of the Office of Conservation within the State of Louisiana Department of Natural Resources pursuant to Chapter 39 of Part XIX of Title 43 of the Louisiana Administrative Code, as same may be amended from time to time. A Unit may also refer to voluntary agreements between operators for cooperative development.",
                "explanation": "The original definition strictly defines 'Unit' as a compulsory unit established by the state. The modified definition broadens it to include 'any area designated for oil and gas operations' and mentions voluntary agreements. This introduces ambiguity because the contract relies on the term 'Unit' for determining geographic boundaries, rights, and obligations, and the broadened definition could lead to disputes over which type of 'Unit' the contract refers to in various clauses.",

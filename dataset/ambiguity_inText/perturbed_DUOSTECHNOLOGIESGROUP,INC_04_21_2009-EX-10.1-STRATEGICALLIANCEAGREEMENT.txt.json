                "explanation": "The original definition includes entities ISA has consulted with, while the new definition includes the entities that has entered into a legally binding agreement with ISA. This conflict introduces uncertainty as to whether mere consultation is sufficient to classify an entity as an ISA Client, or if a contract is necessary, which affects the obligations and commission structures tied to ISA Clients.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement stated a retention period of six years for financial records, while the modified version reduces this period to two years. This introduces a contradiction regarding the required retention period, potentially leading to disputes over compliance and access to financial data for audits and legal purposes.",

The confidentiality  obligations contained in this Section 8 shall survive termination of this Agreement indefinitely.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement specified a three-year survival period for confidentiality obligations post-termination. The modified version states that these obligations survive indefinitely. This creates a contradiction regarding the duration of confidentiality, affecting the scope and enforceability of these obligations after the agreement ends.",

COOL TECH shall, in a professional manner, take all steps necessary to market and produce its Mobile Generation Program and its other services (collectively the \"COOL TECH Services\") for clients referred to COOL TECH by VET TECH. Any engagement to perform COOL TECH Services shall be on such terms and conditions as COOL TECH may approve at its sole discretion.",
                "changed_text": "A. COOL TECH shall, in a professional manner, use commercially reasonable efforts to market and produce its Mobile Generation Program and its other services (collectively the \"COOL TECH Services\") for clients referred to COOL TECH by VET TECH. Any engagement to perform COOL TECH Services shall be on such terms and conditions as VET TECH may approve at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text states 'shall take all steps necessary', creating a strong obligation. The modified text weakens this to 'commercially reasonable efforts', which is open to interpretation and less binding. Furthermore, it changes approval authority from COOL TECH to VET TECH, creating a contradiction regarding who has the final say on engagement terms.",

This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive one year periods unless either party gives written notice of termination to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of expiration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall be earlier terminated (x) by mutual agreement of the parties, or (y) at any time upon sixty (60) days advance written notice to the other party. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be effective as of the date first set forth above and, shall expire five (5) years from the date hereof. This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive one year periods unless either party gives written notice of termination to the other party at least ninety (90) days prior to the date of expiration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be earlier terminated (x) by mutual agreement of the parties, or (y) at any time upon thirty (30) days advance written notice to the other party. Time is NOT of the essence in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text has a complex expiration clause based on either a fixed term or project completion, creating a potential for longer duration. The change simplifies it to a fixed five-year term. The notice period for non-renewal is also changed from 30 to 90 days. Furthermore, the agreement stating that 'time is of the essence' is directly contradicted by the modified version stating that 'time is NOT of the essence.",

All underlying methodology utilized by COOL TECH and VET TECH respectively which was created and/or developed by either prior to the date of this Agreement and utilized in the course of performing engagements pursuant to this Agreement shall not become the property of the other.

All underlying methodology utilized by COOL TECH and VET TECH respectively which was created and/or developed by either prior to the date of this Agreement and utilized in the course of performing engagements pursuant to this Agreement shall become the property of both parties. Each party's rights, titles and interests are NOT described in the Non-Disclosure Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement states that the work belongs to the party that developed it, while the changed version states it is jointly owned by both. This creates a significant contradiction regarding intellectual property rights. Also, pre-existing methodology changes to be owned by both and reference to the NDA is removed, creating more confusion.",

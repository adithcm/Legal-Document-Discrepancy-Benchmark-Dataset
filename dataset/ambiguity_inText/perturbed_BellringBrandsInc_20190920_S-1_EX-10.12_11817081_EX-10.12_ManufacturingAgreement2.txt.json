                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") of [***] (\"Units\") for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall endeavor to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") of [***] (\"Units\") for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV may be [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and discretionary approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier is expected to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'shall be required' imposing a strict obligation on Premier to purchase the MAOV. The modified text changes this to 'shall endeavor', making the purchase volume a goal rather than a strict requirement. Further, it changes 'approval of that facility by Premier' to 'discretionary approval of that facility by Premier', giving Premier subjective discretion. Additionally, 'Premier will be required to purchase' is changed to 'Premier is expected to purchase'. This introduces contradiction and uncertainty as other sections of the agreement might rely on the assumption that Premier is obligated to purchase a fixed MAOV, which this amendment now renders ambiguous.",

                "changed_text": "Except as otherwise specified above in this Amendment, all other terms, conditions and covenants of the Agreement shall remain in general force and effect, unless superseded by subsequent mutual agreement or operational necessity.",
                "explanation": "The original text reaffirms the original agreement, ensuring it remains fully effective except for the specified changes. The modified version adds 'in general force and effect' and allows for exceptions based on 'subsequent mutual agreement or operational necessity'. This creates a loophole that can potentially override the original agreement's terms based on vaguely defined criteria, leading to conflicting interpretations. It contradicts the initial statement by allowing unspecified changes, thus blurring the lines of contractual obligation.",

                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, the Parties wish to generally amend the Agreement, while maintaining the spirit of the original agreement to the extent feasible given changing market conditions.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the precise statement about amending the agreement in accordance with specific terms with a more ambiguous desire to 'generally amend' while maintaining the 'spirit' of the original. This introduces uncertainty because 'spirit of the original agreement' and 'changing market conditions' are open to interpretation. This weakens the enforceability by allowing deviations from the initial intent, conflicting with the precise and binding nature typically required in legal contracts.",

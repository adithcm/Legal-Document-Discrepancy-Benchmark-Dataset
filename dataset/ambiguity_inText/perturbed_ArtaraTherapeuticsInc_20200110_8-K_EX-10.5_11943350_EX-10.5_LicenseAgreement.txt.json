                "original_text": "1.22 \"Royalty\" means the royalty on Net Sales of Product in the Indication, as set forth in Article Three below.",
                "changed_text": "1.22 \"Royalty\" means an optional gratuity on Net Sales of Product in the Indication, the specifics of which may be determined at ArTara's discretion. As a demonstration of good faith, ArTara anticipates discussing royalty payments with University, though such payments are not legally mandated.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original intent of 'Royalty' as a set obligation. By making it an 'optional gratuity,' enforcement becomes uncertain. Article Three will define royalty rates, but this definition undermines that.",

                "original_text": "5.1 Confidentiality. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of seven (7) years after its termination or expiration each Party (the \"Receiving Party\") shall maintain in confidence and, except as authorized by this Agreement, not use any know-how, data, processes, techniques, formulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") and which for any of the foregoing, if written, is marked \"Confidential\" by the Disclosing Party or, if verbal or visual, is identified in writing as \"Confidential\" at the time of disclosure and reduced to writing by the Disclosing Party within thirty (30) days of the verbal or visual disclosure (\"Confidential Information\").",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Confidentiality. While each Party (the \"Receiving Party\") will generally strive to maintain the confidentiality of know-how, data, processes, techniques, formulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the \"Disclosing Party\"), there is no legally binding obligation to do so. The Receiving Party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to protect information marked \"Confidential\" by the Disclosing Party, but cannot guarantee absolute secrecy or non-use.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the confidentiality clause. The original text clearly mandates confidentiality for seven years. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating there is no legally binding obligation, contradicting the intention of the original clause and creating ambiguity regarding the actual enforceability of confidentiality.",

To the extent permitted by law, ArTara agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the University of Iowa Research Foundation, the University, the State of Iowa, the University's Board of Regents, their respective affiliates, trustees, officers, directors, faculty, staff, students, successors, assigns, independent contractors, agents and employees including but not limited to Principal Investigator (\"University Indemnitees\"), harmless from and against any and all liability, loss, expense, reasonable adjudicated attorneys' fees, or claims for injury or damages arising out of the use of the Program Data by ArTara and its Affiliates and subcontractors including but not limited to the CRO involved in the Project, but only in proportion to and to the extent such liability, loss, expense, attorneys' fees, or claims for injury or damages are caused by or result from the negligent or acts or omissions of ArTara, its officers, agents, employees, subcontractors, the CRO or Affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "6.3 Indemnification by ArTara. ArTara intends to reasonably consider defending, indemnifying, and holding harmless the University of Iowa Research Foundation, the University, the State of Iowa, the University's Board of Regents, their respective affiliates, trustees, officers, directors, faculty, staff, students, successors, assigns, independent contractors, agents and employees including but not limited to Principal Investigator (\"University Indemnitees\"), from and against liability, loss, expense, reasonable adjudicated attorneys' fees, or claims for injury or damages arising out of the use of the Program Data by ArTara and its Affiliates and subcontractors including but not limited to the CRO involved in the Project. However, ArTara's responsibility shall not extend beyond good-faith efforts to resolve disputes, and any actual indemnification will be subject to a separate written agreement and ArTara's sole discretion. The availability of funds for indemnification is contingent upon ArTara's financial condition and board approval at the time of any claim.",
                "explanation": "This modifies the indemnification clause to make ArTara's obligation discretionary and subject to future agreements and financial constraints. The original text committed ArTara to defend and indemnify, while the new text introduces uncertainty by limiting the obligation to 'good-faith efforts' and requiring separate agreements, effectively contradicting the original indemnification commitment.",

                "original_text": "The White Hat Parties represent and warrant to the Company as of the date hereof as follows: (a) The White Hat Parties are the beneficial owners of 319,708 shares of Common Stock, such shares of Common Stock constitute all of the Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties and the White Hat Parties have no agreements, understandings or undertakings with any third party to share or delegate disposition or voting control over such shares of Common Stock, or to transfer, hypothecate or lend such shares Common Stock.",
                "changed_text": "The White Hat Parties represent and warrant to the Company as of the date hereof as follows: (a) The White Hat Parties are the beneficial owners of 319,708 shares of Common Stock. The White Hat Parties may enter into agreements with third parties to share or delegate disposition or voting control over a portion, but not all, of such shares of Common Stock, provided that they maintain beneficial ownership of at least 160,000 shares. They are permitted to transfer, hypothecate, or lend up to 50% of such shares of Common Stock.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the White Hat Parties' ability to enter into agreements with third parties and transfer shares. Initially, they warranted they had no such agreements. The modification allows for agreements and transfers, creating uncertainty about the extent of their control and potentially impacting voting commitments outlined elsewhere in the agreement. Now, the amount of shares that they need to keep beneficial ownership is contradictable.",

The White Hat Parties shall appear in person or by proxy for quorum purposes at the 2020 Annual Meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, to vote all of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties on the record date (if the 2020 Annual Meeting is within thirty (30) days of the anniversary of the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, such number of shares shall be no less than 90% of the Current Position) for such meeting (i) in favor of all persons nominated by the Board to serve as directors of the Company and against any stockholder nominated candidate not endorsed by the Board, (ii) against the stockholder proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act as disclosed to the White Hat Parties prior to the execution of this Agreement, (iii) to ratify the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and (iv) in accordance with the Board's recommendation with respect to the Company's \"say-on-pay\" proposal and new equity compensation plan (collectively, the \"2020 Proposals\"), provided, that with respect to the proposals described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of this Section 4, the White Hat Parties may vote in accordance with the recommendation of Institutional Shareholders Services to the extent such recommendation differs from the voting commitments set forth herein and provided that the White Hat Parties do not publicly disclose their vote on such proposals if it differs from the Board's recommendation; and provided, further, that White Hat Parties shall have the right to vote the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties in their sole discretion with respect to all other proposals brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting. The White Hat Parties shall provide written evidence of the votes made in accordance with the foregoing sentence to the Company no later than ten business days before the 2020 Annual Meeting.",
                "changed_text": "4. Voting Commitments. The White Hat Parties shall appear in person or by proxy for quorum purposes at the 2020 Annual Meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, to vote a significant portion of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties on the record date for such meeting in a manner they deem appropriate. The White Hat Parties are encouraged to vote in favor of all persons nominated by the Board to serve as directors of the Company but retain ultimate discretion. The White Hat Parties are encouraged to vote against the stockholder proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act as disclosed to the White Hat Parties prior to the execution of this Agreement. The White Hat Parties shall provide verbal confirmation of their voting intentions to the Company no later than one business day before the 2020 Annual Meeting.",
                "explanation": "This introduces ambiguity in the voting commitments. Originally, the White Hat Parties were obligated to vote all shares in a specific manner. The modification replaces \"all of the shares\" with \"a significant portion,\" removes the requirement to vote against non-endorsed candidates, and changes “shall” to “are encouraged” which makes the voting commitments non-binding. The deadline to provide the voting information has also changed from \"ten business days\" to \"one business day\" and a change of providing \"written evidence\" to \"verbal confirmation\" and the change allows the parties to not send the evidence until before the meeting, which could allow them to change it last minute.",

Whether or not the agreement terminates is at the discretion of the Board. The responsibilities can be extended.",
                "explanation": "The change makes the termination conditional and dependent on the Board's discretion, creating a contradiction with the original automatic termination clause. The original clause stated that the agreement \"shall immediately and automatically terminate,\" while the modified version states it \"may terminate,\" introducing ambiguity about the enforceability of the termination. It can be extended by the Board.",

                "original_text": "1.10 \"New Customer\" means a User who (a) registers for Client's service using a unique credit card number, electronic mail address or name not previously received by Client, and (b) purchases U.S. postage from Client's service.",
                "changed_text": "1.10 \"New Customer\" means a User who registers for Client's service and purchases U.S. postage from Client's service. A New Customer must also actively maintain a paid subscription for at least 90 days to be considered a \"New Customer\" for the purposes of calculating transaction fees under Section 10.2.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"New Customer\" focuses solely on initial registration and purchase. The modified definition adds a requirement of a 90-day paid subscription for transaction fee calculation, creating a conflict. A user can be a \"New Customer\" under the initial definition but not qualify for transaction fee purposes under the revised definition, leading to disputes regarding the applicability of Section 10.2.",

Intuit or its Authorized Advertisement Server will provide Client ------- with monthly reports (\"Usage Reports\") substantiating the number of Impressions of Client's Banner Advertisements, Client Graphics, Sponsor Client Graphics and Links displayed on the Intuit Sites, the total number of click-throughs generated by each such advertisement or graphic, and such other information as the parties shall mutually agree.",
                "changed_text": "8.4 Reports. Intuit or its Authorized Advertisement Server will provide Client with reports (\"Usage Reports\") detailing whether Impressions of Client's Banner Advertisements, Client Graphics, Sponsor Client Graphics and Links were displayed on the Intuit Sites. While Intuit will endeavor to provide information regarding click-throughs, the specific metrics included in the Usage Reports are at Intuit's sole discretion and may vary from month to month.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Usage Reports will substantiate 'the number of Impressions' and 'the total number of click-throughs'. The modified text weakens this by stating Intuit will only provide information 'detailing whether' impressions were made, and makes click-through metrics discretionary. This contradicts the original obligation to provide specific, substantiating numbers, potentially leading to disputes over Intuit's reporting responsibilities and Client's ability to verify performance.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party ----------- materially breaches a material obligation hereunder and such breach remains uncured for thirty (30) days following the notice to the breaching party of the breach and the notifying party's intention to terminate.",
                "changed_text": "12.2 Termination. Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party breaches any obligation hereunder. However, Intuit may only terminate if the breach is deemed 'significant' at Intuit's sole discretion, whereas Client may terminate for any breach regardless of significance.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows termination for any 'material breach'. The modification introduces asymmetry: Client can terminate for *any* breach, while Intuit can only terminate for a 'significant' breach, as determined by Intuit. This creates a contradiction because the same breach could be grounds for termination by Client but not by Intuit, depending on Intuit's assessment, leading to legal uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text dictates that NCM 'shall pay' an access fee per screen. The modified text states that NCM 'may pay' and changes the revenue sharing to 25% creating an obligation that may not be there and altering the financial arrangement. This introduces a contradiction regarding the mandatory nature of the access fee and reduces the revenue percentage, affecting the guaranteed minimum revenue stream of the other party and increasing disputes.",

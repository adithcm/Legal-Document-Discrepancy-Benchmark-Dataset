Part 210 et seq., as amended from time to time, applicable guidance documents issued by the FDA, applicable documents developed by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) to the extent that they are applicable to Product and the Parties hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "1.11 \"GMPs\" shall mean current good manufacturing practices, including the regulations promulgated by the FDA under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 C.F.R. Part 210 et seq., as amended from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, GMPs as applicable to Bachem's activities under this Agreement, shall not include the applicable guidance documents issued by the FDA, nor the applicable documents developed by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH).",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by defining GMPs in Section 1.11 to exclude guidance documents issued by the FDA and ICH even though the original definition included those items. This creates ambiguity as to which GMP standards Bachem is obligated to adhere to. This may also affect the cost of the services being provided by Bachem.",

Bachem will perform all Services in accordance with this Agreement and the agreed upon Specifications. All Products shall be packaged, labeled and shipped in accordance with this Agreement, the applicable Project Plan and all Applicable Laws. Bachem and its employees and agents have, and will continue to have, the knowledge, experience, facilities, equipment and skill to provide, and will provide, the Services in a professional and timely manner. Services will conform to consistently high standards of workmanship and the specifications applicable to each Project Plan.",
                "changed_text": "5.2 Services. Bachem shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Services in accordance with each Project Plan. Bachem will endeavor to perform Services in substantial compliance with this Agreement and the Specifications. All Products shall be packaged, labeled and shipped in a manner generally consistent with this Agreement, the applicable Project Plan and Applicable Laws. Bachem and its employees and agents will make good faith efforts to provide the Services in a professional and timely manner, but shall not be responsible for delays outside of their reasonable control. Services will aim to conform to high standards of workmanship and the specifications applicable to each Project Plan.",
                "explanation": "The modified text weakens the obligations on Bachem. Replacing 'shall provide' with 'use commercially reasonable efforts to provide' and 'shall be packaged' with 'in a manner generally consistent with' introduces uncertainty. This creates a contradiction because other sections of the contract assume strict adherence to project plans and specifications.",

                "original_text": "6.2 Acceptance and Rejection of Products.\n\n(a) Promptly following receipt of Product, Magenta shall have the right but not the obligation to test such Product to determine compliance with the Specifications. Magenta shall have [***] after receipt of the Product to notify Bachem in writing of any rejection of Product based on a sufficiently documented claim that the Product fails to meet the Specifications. In the event that Magenta does not inform Bachem within the [***] period that the Product does not meet the Specifications, Magenta shall be deemed to have accepted the Product. If there is no dispute between the Parties over a claim that the Product fails to meet the Specifications, Bachem shall (i) replace or (ii) with Magenta's prior written consent, reprocess or rework the rejected Product within an agreed upon time frame, after the notice of such rejection, and in any case as soon as reasonably possible after receiving such notice, provided that Magenta shall, at Bachem's expense, provide to Bachem sufficient quantities of supplies required to be supplied by Magenta under the relevant Project Plan, at no additional cost to Magenta (including transportation costs), and Bachem shall make arrangements with Magenta for the return or disposal of any rejected Product, such return shipping or disposal charges to be paid by Bachem. In the event of a discrepancy between Magenta's and Bachem's test results such that one Party's test results fall within relevant Specifications and the other Party's test results fall outside the relevant Specifications, or there exists a dispute between the Parties over the extent to which such failure is due to acts or omissions of Bachem, the Parties shall cause an independent GMP laboratory or appropriate experts promptly to review records, test data and perform comparative tests and/or analyses on samples of the alleged defective Product. Such independent laboratory shall be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The independent laboratory's results shall be in writing and shall be final and binding save for manifest error. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing, the costs associated with such testing and review shall be borne by the Party against whom the independent laboratory rules.",
                "changed_text": "6.2 Acceptance and Rejection of Products.\n\n(a) Following receipt of Product, Magenta shall have the right but not the obligation to test such Product to determine compliance with the Specifications. The parties agree that Magenta's notification of rejection of product will be subject to mutual agreement between the Parties. In the event that Magenta does not inform Bachem, or Bachem does not agree with Magenta's notification, the Product shall be deemed to have been conditionally accepted by Magenta for continued testing. In the event that the product does not meet the specification, Bachem shall use its best efforts to address the issue and work with Magenta to determine the best course of action. Such actions may include (i) replace or (ii) with Magenta's prior written consent, reprocess or rework the rejected Product within an agreed upon time frame, after the notice of such rejection, and in any case as soon as reasonably possible after receiving such notice. The Parties agree that the Parties may negotiate costs associated with either resolution.",
                "explanation": "Changing the notification window and adding conditional acceptance with 'mutually agreed upon claims' significantly impacts Magenta's ability to reject products that do not meet specification because such agreement is necessary for notification to be valid. It further clouds the enforcement process as it is not clearly laid out in the modified text.",

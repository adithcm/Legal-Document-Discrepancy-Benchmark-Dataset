                "original_text": "1.28 \"Field Force Personnel\" shall mean collectively, the Sales Representatives, the members of the institutional account management team described in Section 4.1.5, if any, that are engaged in Detailing the Product and any other employees of Valeant engaged in the Valeant Activities.",
                "changed_text": "1.28 \"Field Force Personnel\" shall mean exclusively, the Sales Representatives, that are engaged in Detailing the Product. The institutional account management team described in Section 4.1.5 and any other employees of Valeant engaged in the Valeant Activities are explicitly excluded from this definition.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding who constitutes 'Field Force Personnel.' Initially, it included Sales Representatives, institutional account managers, and other Valeant employees in Valeant Activities. The modified definition limits 'Field Force Personnel' to only Sales Representatives, excluding institutional account managers. This could affect obligations and liabilities tied to 'Field Force Personnel' throughout the agreement.",

                "original_text": "1.54 \"Sales Representative\" shall mean an individual employed and compensated by Valeant as a full-time employee as part of its sales forces and who engages in Detailing of the Designated Product (or the Alternate Product, as the case may be) in the Territory, and who is also trained with respect to the Product in accordance with this Agreement (including the Product Labeling and the use of the Promotional Materials) to deliver Details for the Product in the Field in the Territory.",
                "changed_text": "1.54 \"Sales Representative\" shall mean any individual, regardless of employment status (including part-time or contracted), who engages in Detailing of the Designated Product (or the Alternate Product, as the case may be) in the Territory, regardless of training status. It also includes any individuals Detailing the product in social media.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict with the original definition of \"Sales Representative\", which specified full-time employees trained according to the agreement. The modified definition broadens this to include part-time, contracted, or untrained individuals and those who detail the product in social media, creating uncertainty about who qualifies as a \"Sales Representative\" under the contract and their obligations regarding training and compliance.",

                "original_text": "4.1.2 Number of Sales Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, [***]) and continuing throughout the remainder of the Term, Valeant shall maintain at least one hundred (100) Sales Representatives with responsibility to Detail the Product in the Specialty in the Territory. Notwithstanding the above, the sole remedy of Dova for breach of this Section 4.1.2 shall be (i) the adjustment to the promotion fee as set forth in Section 6.1.2 and (ii) the termination right set out in Section 12.2.2.",
                "changed_text": "4.1.2 Number of Sales Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, [***]) and continuing throughout the remainder of the Term, Valeant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain Sales Representatives to Detail the Product in the Specialty in the Territory. The determination of the number of Sales Representatives is at the sole discretion of Valeant and Dova has no remedy for any deficiency of such. Valeant's sales should also include digital means of promotion.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original requirement for Valeant to maintain at least 100 Sales Representatives. The modified version replaces this with a 'commercially reasonable efforts' standard and asserts Valeant's sole discretion in determining the number of Sales Representatives and removes Dova's remedies for any deficiency. This creates an internal contradiction as it weakens Valeant's obligation and limits Dova's recourse, potentially impacting promotional efforts.",

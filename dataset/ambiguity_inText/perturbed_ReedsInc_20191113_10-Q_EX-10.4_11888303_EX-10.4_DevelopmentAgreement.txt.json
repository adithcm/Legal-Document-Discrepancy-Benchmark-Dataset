                "original_text": "Company shall perform the work in connection with this Agreement in a timely, professional and workmanlike manner consistent with industry standards. Each party shall ensure that all persons performing work under this Agreement on its behalf shall have the requisite experience, training, skill and other qualifications needed to develop the Recipes, Deliverables and Specifications. Company shall keep the Development Committee informed of the progress of the development of the Recipes and Deliverables and such other matters as any member of the Development Committee may reasonably request from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall endeavor to perform the work in connection with this Agreement in a manner generally consistent with industry practices. Each party shall attempt to ensure that persons performing work under this Agreement on its behalf have sufficient experience to develop the Recipes, Deliverables and Specifications. Company will, as it deems practical, keep the Development Committee generally informed of the development of the Recipes and Deliverables and only on matters specifically requested in writing by a majority vote of the Development Committee from time to time.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by weakening the standard of performance expected of the Company. 'Timely, professional and workmanlike manner consistent with industry standards' is replaced with a more subjective 'manner generally consistent with industry practices.' The obligation to ensure personnel have 'requisite experience' is reduced to 'attempt to ensure sufficient experience.' Furthermore, informing the Development Committee shifts from a proactive requirement to a reactive one triggered by a majority vote. This creates uncertainty about the required level of effort and communication.",

Company will execute and deliver documents reasonably requested by Reed's to register its Intellectual Property in the Deliverables.",
                "changed_text": "Company will assign to Reed's all worldwide right, title or interest that Company may now or hereafter possess in or to the Deliverables, subject to a separate agreement outlining specific usage rights retained by Company. Reed's accepts such assignment, provided that Company reasonably cooperates in executing and delivering documents to register Intellectual Property, recognizing that Company may have pre-existing obligations.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding ownership of the Deliverables. The original clause is a complete and irrevocable assignment. The modified clause introduces a 'separate agreement' that allows Company to retain usage rights, creating ambiguity about the extent of Reed's ownership and the limitations of their rights. The addition of 'provided that Company reasonably cooperates' and 'recognizing that Company may have pre-existing obligations' further blurs the lines of ownership and the Company's responsibilities.",

Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Receiving Party shall return to Disclosing Party all of Disclosing Party's Confidential Information or shall destroy the same at the option of Disclosing Party.",
                "changed_text": "\"Confidential Information\" means information designated as such in writing by the Disclosing Party at the time of disclosure. Information shall only be considered confidential if the Disclosing Party has taken active measures to prevent its unauthorized distribution. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Receiving Party shall return only designated confidential document originals to Disclosing Party. Copies may be retained for archival purposes.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly narrows the scope of 'Confidential Information,' creating conflict with the original broad definition. The original definition includes information disclosed orally or in circumstances of confidence. The modified version requires a written designation and active measures for preventing unauthorized distribution. Also, the modified definition allows retention of confidential information copies for archival purposes after termination, while the original mandated the return or destruction of all confidential information.",

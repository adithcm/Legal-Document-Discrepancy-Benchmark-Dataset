                "explanation": "The modified text introduces contradictions by:\n1.  Limiting \"Applicable Securities Laws\" to only Canadian jurisdictions, conflicting with later sections that reference US securities laws.\n2.  Redefining \"Closing\" to mean commencement rather than completion of the offering which affects the interpretation of when obligations are fulfilled.\n3.  Excluding prior auditors from \"Corporation's Auditors\", which may have ramifications if the company refers to 'Corporation's Auditors' in the future and create ambiguity. \n4. Narrowing Debt Instrument definition. ",

                "original_text": "In consideration for the Agents' services hereunder, the Corporation will pay to the Agents the Agents' Fee and the Corporation shall issue to the Agents that number of Compensation Options equal to 3.5% of the number of Offered Shares sold pursuant to the Offering. Unless otherwise stated herein, the Offered Shares shall also refer to the Compensation Options. The Agents' Fee shall be apportioned among the Agents as follows: Dundee Securities Ltd. 40% Kes 7 Capital Inc. 30% Bloom Burton & Co. Ltd. 30% 100%",
                "changed_text": "In consideration for the Agents' services hereunder, the Corporation may pay to the Agents the Agents' Fee, contingent on the Corporation's sole discretion, and the Corporation shall issue to the Agents that number of Compensation Options equal to 1% of the number of Offered Shares sold pursuant to the Offering. Unless otherwise stated herein, the Offered Shares shall only refer to common shares, and specifically exclude the Compensation Options. The Agents' Fee shall be apportioned among the Agents equally.",
                "explanation": "The modified text contradicts the original agreement by:\n\n1.  Making the Agent's Fee payment discretionary rather than obligatory.\n2.  Changing the percentage of Compensation Options issued.\n3.  Altering what \"Offered Shares\" refers to, excluding Compensation Options.\n4.  Changing the fee apportionment to equal parts instead of percentages. This creates ambiguity in the contract's commitment and Agent compensation.",

                "explanation": "The modified text transforms a strict requirement into an attempt to get the approval. 'Shall' indicates a firm obligation, whereas 'attempt' creates a non-binding situation that could be difficult to enforce. Creates uncertainty as to the regulatory pre-conditions for closing.",

The Customizations shall fulfill all of the functional specifications described in the Program Materials and the documents prepared either by Bank of America or Supplier pursuant to this Agreement. While Supplier will strive to exceed performance and other specifications, it is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that customizations 'shall fulfill or exceed' all specifications. The modified text makes fulfilling functional specifications mandatory but weakens the obligation to exceed performance and other specifications, creating ambiguity as to the required standard for those latter specifications.",

However, price increases at any other time will be subject to negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows Bank of America to terminate the schedule and receive a refund if the price increases at any time. The modified version restricts this right to only apply when the price increase occurs 'upon delivery of detailed specifications', thus introducing ambiguity and contradiction about Bank of America's rights to cancel upon price increases at other points in time.",

                "explanation": "The original text implies a fixed schedule with specified delivery and installation dates. The modified version states 'To be determined' and explicitly makes the dates 'estimates and not binding'. This creates a contradiction because the original schedule suggests a firm commitment, whereas the modified text introduces flexibility and uncertainty, making it unclear if the schedule is enforceable.",

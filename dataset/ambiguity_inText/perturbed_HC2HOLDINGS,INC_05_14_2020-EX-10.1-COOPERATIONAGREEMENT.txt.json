                "original_text": "8. Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement: (a) the terms \"Affiliate\" and \"Associate\" shall have the respective meanings set forth in Rule 12b-2 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act and shall include all persons or entities that at any time during the term of this Agreement become Affiliates or Associates of any person or entity referred to in this Agreement; (b) the term \"Exchange Act\" shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and (c) the terms \"person\" or \"persons\" mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability or unlimited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization or other entity of any kind or nature.",

For purposes of this Agreement: (a) the terms \"Affiliate\" and \"Associate\" shall have the respective meanings set forth in Rule 12b-2 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act and shall include only those persons or entities that are explicitly named as affiliates in Exhibit A; (b) the term \"Exchange Act\" shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and (c) the terms \"person\" or \"persons\" mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability or unlimited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization or other entity of any kind or nature.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' and 'Associate' uses the standard SEC Rule 12b-2. The modified definition restricts the meaning to only those named in Exhibit A. This creates a contradiction because Rule 12b-2 has a much broader scope, potentially including entities not listed in Exhibit A, thus limiting and contradicting the scope of affiliates and/or associates.",

Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Board and its committees shall take actions deemed appropriate, if and when considered reasonable, (i) to assess the possibility of increasing the size of the Board from six (6) to ten (10) Directors, and (ii) to consider the appointment of Kenneth S. Courtis and Michael Gorzynski (the \"MG Capital Designees\") and (iii) to potentially appoint Avram A. Glazer and Shelly Lombard (together with the MG Capital Designees, the \"New Directors\") to the Board.",
                "explanation": "The original section mandates that the Board *shall* take specific actions to increase board size and appoint directors. The modified version changes this to a discretionary assessment of *the possibility* of increasing the size of the Board, which it may or may not do. This creates uncertainty if later sections rely on the board size increasing to ten and the appointment of the named individuals. It also changes the required appointment to 'consider' and 'potentially appoint', removing the obligation and creating contradiction if other sections assume the appointments are guaranteed.",

                "explanation": "The original section provides a detailed non-disparagement clause covering a wide range of parties, including 'stockholders (solely in their capacity as stockholders of the applicable Party)'. The modification removes the specific protection for stockholders, creating a contradiction. Under the modified clause, disparaging remarks made against stockholders (even in their capacity as such) might be permissible, whereas the original clause explicitly prohibited it. This can lead to disputes regarding the scope of the non-disparagement obligation and protection.",

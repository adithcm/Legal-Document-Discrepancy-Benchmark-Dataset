                "changed_text": "1.18 Control\n\nThe term \"Control\" shall mean (as an adjective or as a verb including conjugations and variations such as \"Controls\" \"Controlled\" or \"Controlling\") (a) with respect to Patent Rights and/or Know-How, the exclusive possession by a Party of the ability to grant a license or sublicense of such Patent Rights and/or Know-How as provided herein without violating the terms of any agreement or arrangement between such Party and any other party, where such ability derives from rights other than an assignment or license granted herein and (b) with respect to proprietary materials, the non-exclusive possession by a Party of the ability to supply such proprietary materials to the other Party as provided herein without violating the terms of any agreement or arrangement between such Party and any other party.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Control\" is changed to create a contradiction. Initially, control is described as the possession by a party. The modified version specifies that in the context of the Patent rights or know-how the control is 'exclusive', while in terms of proprietary materials, it is 'non-exclusive'. This distinction, not present in the original definition, may cause confusion. For instance, it could lead to disputes about the extent of rights licensed or sublicensed, particularly if the contract relies on a consistent interpretation of control across different clauses.",

In no circumstance can the work of any given person exceed one (1) FTE.",

The work of any given person can exceed one (1) FTE depending on the project's requirements.",
                "explanation": "Here, the term FTE is defined differently in two parts of the contract. Originally, FTE is explicitly defined as not exceeding 1 per person. The updated text allows FTE to exceed 1 depending on the projects requirements, which is a contradiction that may lead to disputes of how employees or contractors are billed",

                "explanation": "The original text states \"best efforts\" will be used. This has been replaced with \"commercially reasonable efforts\". This introduces a conflicting definition in text, because the definition of 'Best Efforts' is provided later in the text, but there is no definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts', creating ambiguity and uncertainty on the consultant's required performance.",

                "explanation": "The conflicting definition of 'best efforts' introduced creates confusion. The initial definition states 'Best efforts' means that degree of effort which would be reasonable for a person under similar circumstances. The modified definition says 'Best efforts' means exerting maximum effort to achieve a goal, regardless of cost or inconvenience. If performance is assessed using the \"reasonable\" definition, the consultant's responsibilities are much more lenient than the \"maximum effort, regardless of cost\" definition.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"material breach\" to \"substantial breach,\" we've created a contradiction. The contract implies that only a 'material breach' allows for termination, but later switches to 'substantial breach.' Since 'material' and 'substantial' are not defined and are often interpreted differently in legal contexts, this ambiguity creates uncertainty as to what level of non-performance constitutes grounds for termination. This is an in-text contradiction because the text now uses these terms interchangeably without defining them, and the standard interpretation of these terms may differ.",

Other than as specifically allowed herein, the Company shall not borrow from, hypothecate, withdraw cash value from, surrender in whole or in part, cancel, or in any other manner encumber the Policy without the prior written consent of the Trustees of the Trust.",

The Company retains the right to borrow from, hypothecate, withdraw cash value from, surrender in whole or in part, cancel, or in any other manner encumber the Policy at its sole discretion. No consent from the Trustees of the Trust is required for these actions.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the Company's ability to encumber the policy. Section 3 originally states the Company needs Trustee consent, but the modified text removes this requirement, potentially conflicting with other sections that might imply Trustee oversight or rights.",

Upon the death of the survivor of the Insureds, the death benefit under the Policy (including any interest payable under the Policy in respect of such death benefit for the period from the date of death of such survivor until the payment of the death benefit) shall be divided as follows: (a) The Company shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the aggregate premiums paid under the Policy since inception less the amount of the then outstanding principal balance of the Demand Note (the \"Company Death Benefit\"). (If the Policy provides for a death benefit equal to the sum of the face amount of the Policy and any cash account or accumulation value, the Company Death Benefit shall first be paid from the cash account or accumulation value portion of the death benefit.) 3 (b) The Trust shall be entitled to receive the excess, if any, of the Policy's death benefit over the Company Death Benefit.",

(b) The Trust shall be entitled to receive the entire Policy's death benefit.",
                "explanation": "The original Section 6 outlines how death benefits are divided, with the Company receiving aggregate premiums paid less the Demand Note balance, and the Trust receiving the excess. The revised section gives the Company only the Demand Note balance and the Trust the entire policy death benefit, directly contradicting the initial distribution plan.",

Entrust shall be entitled to the benefit of the NTL intellectual property licenses specified in Exhibit A (the \"NTL Technology\") for as long as NTL maintains a business relationship with ETI, regardless of ownership percentage. NTL, however, reserves the right to reassess the NTL Technology benefits annually.",
                "explanation": "The original text ties Entrust's benefit to NTL's ownership percentage. The modified text suggests that the business relationship is sufficient, creating ambiguity as to what criteria determine the continuation of these benefits. The phrase 'NTL, however, reserves the right to reassess the NTL Technology benefits annually' adds further uncertainty.",

Subject to the terms and               -----------------------------------                           conditions of this Agreement, Entrust, to the extent of its legal right to do so, hereby grants to Nortel, under the Entrust Patents, an irrevocable, non- transferable, non-assignable, indivisible, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license for Licensed Products and Licensed Services.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the license is 'irrevocable,' but the modified version changes this to 'revocable.' This directly contradicts the original, making it unclear whether Nortel can rely on the cross-license in the long term. This creates significant uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'the later of' two dates, providing a clear termination condition. The modified text changes this to 'either' date, whichever occurs sooner. This directly contradicts the original provision and introduces an element of uncertainty. The phrase 'unless otherwise agreed by both parties in writing' provides a loophole that further diminishes the certainty of the termination conditions.",

Neither shall Dr. Murray have any rights or interest whatsoever in any intellectual property, trademarks, trade names, service marks, or other names or marks owned or used by EHS.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a geographical limitation to EHS and EHN's intellectual property rights, contradicting the initial statement that they 'shall have the exclusive rights' without any geographical restrictions. This creates uncertainty about intellectual property ownership for products sold outside North America.",

                "explanation": "The added clause 'unless EHN determines that market conditions warrant a reduction in royalty payments' introduces a condition that contradicts the initially stated obligation to pay royalties for as long as the products are sold.

                "explanation": "While the original clause allows EHS/EHN to terminate the *Services Term* immediately for breach of agreement, the modification allows immediate termination of the *entire agreement* for a specific act (promoting competing products), and removes the original condition of 'breach of this Agreement'. This creates a contradiction, since the original termination clause related only to the 'Services Term', but the altered version allows terminating the whole agreement, even aspects beyond the service term such as royalty payments.",

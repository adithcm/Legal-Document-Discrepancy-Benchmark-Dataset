Subject to payment by the Sponsor of the sponsorship fee provided for herein, during the term of this  Agreement Racing shall cause the Racing Team to provide for the Sponsor's benefit all of the benefits customarily associated with the  sponsorship of a Daytona Prototype Series racing team and consistent with the benefits provided to the Sponsor in 2005 - 2009 (individually, a  \"Benefit,\" and collectively, the \"Benefits\"), including but not limited to the following:   (i) displaying prominent identification of the Sponsor's name and/or logo in signage on the race car and racing suits and, where  appropriate, on other team equipment (subject to approval by the Sponsor);",

Subject to payment by the Sponsor of the sponsorship fee provided for herein, during the term of this  Agreement Racing shall endeavor to cause the Racing Team to provide for the Sponsor's benefit some of the benefits customarily associated with the  sponsorship of a Daytona Prototype Series racing team and consistent with the benefits provided to the Sponsor in 2005 - 2009 (individually, a  \"Benefit,\" and collectively, the \"Benefits\"), including but not limited to the following:   (i) displaying some identification of the Sponsor's name and/or logo in signage on the race car and racing suits and, where  appropriate, on other team equipment (subject to approval by Racing);",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall cause' to 'shall endeavor to cause' weakens Racing's obligation to provide benefits. Replacing 'all of the benefits' to 'some of the benefits' introduces ambiguity about which benefits are guaranteed. Then, switching 'prominent identification' to 'some identification' and Sponsor approval to Racing approval introduces conflicting criteria for benefit delivery. This contradicts the original intent of ensuring Sponsor receives consistent and prominent benefits.",

The Sponsor shall pay to Racing a sponsorship fee in the amount of $750,000.00 for the term of this Agreement, payable  in an initial installment payable on or before February 1, 2010 in the amount of $350,000.00 and ten installments of $40,000.00 on or before the first  day of each month commencing March 1, 2010 and ending with the installment due on December 1, 2010 (unless this Agreement is sooner  terminated pursuant to Section 14 hereof, in which case Sponsor shall have no obligation to make any payments after the date of termination).",

The Sponsor may pay to Racing a sponsorship fee up to the amount of $750,000.00 for the term of this Agreement, payable in installments as mutually agreed upon by both parties, unless this Agreement is sooner terminated pursuant to Section 14 hereof, in which case Sponsor shall have no obligation to make any payments after the date of termination.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall pay' to 'may pay up to' introduces uncertainty about the Sponsor's payment obligation. Removing the specific installment schedule and replacing it with 'as mutually agreed upon' creates a conflict with the original, fixed payment terms. This contradicts the initial financial agreement and makes enforcement unclear.",

Racing and all Racing members, including but not limited to all drivers, agree to use best efforts to conduct themselves in such a  manner so as not to reflect unfavorably upon the Sponsor or its products. The Sponsor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on written  notice to Racing if any driver, the general manager or any other member of Racing (i) fails to conduct himself/herself in accordance with generally  accepted standards of morality, (ii) engages in any activity which reflects adversely on the image, reputation or goodwill of the Sponsor or (iii)  disparages the products or services of the Sponsor; provided, however, the Sponsor shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement if Racing,  within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice by the Sponsor terminates the employment of, or otherwise dismisses from the racing team,  the driver(s), general manager(s) or other member(s) of Racing engaging in the offensive conduct. Upon termination, the Sponsor shall be entitled  to a pro rata refund of monies paid for services not yet performed by Racing based upon the number of races for the applicable racing season. The  Sponsor's decision with respect to all matters arising under this Section shall be conclusive.",
                "changed_text": "9. Conduct. Racing and all Racing members, including but not limited to all drivers, are encouraged to conduct themselves in a manner that generally aligns with the Sponsor's values. The Sponsor shall have the right to suggest modifications to this Agreement if, in their opinion, any driver, the general manager or any other member of Racing (i) acts in a way that may be perceived as inconsistent with community standards, (ii) participates in activities that the Sponsor does not endorse, or (iii) provides feedback on the products or services of the Sponsor; provided, however, the Sponsor shall consider Racing's response to such concerns. Upon termination, refunds will be negotiated in good faith. Racing's interpretation of this Section shall be considered.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agree to use best efforts' with 'are encouraged' weakens the commitment to positive conduct. Instead of immediate termination rights for misconduct, the Sponsor now only has the right to 'suggest modifications,' which Racing may or may not accept. Replacing 'generally accepted standards of morality' with 'acts in a way that may be perceived as inconsistent with community standards' significantly changes the standard. Removing Sponsor's conclusive decision power and replacing it with 'Racing's interpretation of this Section shall be considered' introduces contradictory authority. Also, switching 'pro rata refund' with 'refunds will be negotiated in good faith' changes the financial agreement upon termination.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction because Section 4.D later mentions new co-branded Products. If 'Products' is strictly defined in Section 1.D as only pizza and bread sides, then the later reference to developing co-branded 'Products' becomes ambiguous. Does it include only pizzas and bread sides, or can it be expanded upon to include other food items that the co-branded Products develop?",

It is understood that PAPA JOHN'S shall not use the Celebrity Endorsement for any other purpose or in connection with any other items unless specifically permitted herein. Subject to the terms contained herein, PAPA JOHN'S and ABG agree and acknowledge that during the Term of this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter, ABG shall be prohibited from granting any rights for CELEBRITY identical or similar to the rights granted to PAPA JOHN'S hereunder to any entity other than PAPA JOHN'S for the purpose of directly promoting, advertising, making an appearance on behalf of, or endorsing Competitive Products; provided, however, that in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.B. of this Agreement, the prohibition referenced above shall be for a period of six (6) months, except that the prohibition shall referenced above shall not apply (or shall immediately cease to apply, as applicable) in the event of any one or more of the following: (i) the Agreement is terminated due to PAPA JOHN'S failure to pay to ABG any monies under this Agreement, as set forth herein, (ii) the Agreement is terminated due to PAPA JOHN'S failure to grant, issue, or cause to vest any of the RSUs (as hereinafter defined) under this Agreement, as set forth herein, (iii) PAPA JOHN'S failure to pay to ABG any monies under Section 7.D.a. or Section 7.D.b. of this Agreement, as set forth herein, or (iv) PAPA JOHN'S failure to grant, issue, or cause to vest any of the RSUs under Section 7.E.a. or Section 7.E.b. of this Agreement, as set forth herein.",

                "explanation": "This edit creates a contradiction because initially, it notes, \"PAPA JOHN'S shall not use the Celebrity Endorsement for any other purpose or in connection with any other items unless specifically permitted herein\", now it says that \"PAPA JOHN'S may use the Celebrity Endorsement for any purpose as deemed fit by PAPA JOHN'S\". This contradicts the approval rights that ABG holds. Now it is unclear whether or not PAPA JOHN'S has the right to use CELEBRITY's image as they please, or if they are required to have ABG's approval for each instance.",

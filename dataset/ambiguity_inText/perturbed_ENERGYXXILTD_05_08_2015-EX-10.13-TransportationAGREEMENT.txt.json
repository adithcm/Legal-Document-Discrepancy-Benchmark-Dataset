                "original_text": "Force Majeure includes, to the extent such event satisfies the requirements of the preceding sentence: acts of God; wars (declared or undeclared); insurrections; hostilities; strikes; lockouts; riots; floods; fires; storms; storm warnings; named or numbered tropical disturbances and evacuations associated with the threat of the same; industrial disturbances; acts of the public enemy; sabotage; blockades; epidemics; landslides; lightning; earthquakes; washouts; arrests and restraints of rulers and peoples; civil disturbances; explosions; breakage or accidents to machinery or lines of pipe; hydrate obstruction or blockages of any kind of lines of pipe; adverse operating conditions on Shipper's facilities, Transporter's facilities, or the facilities of Downstream Pipelines; repairs, improvements, replacements or alterations to plants, lines of pipe or related facilities; inability of either Party to obtain necessary machinery, drilling or workover rigs, materials, permits, easements or rights-of-way on reasonable terms; freezing of delivery facility; and other events beyond the reasonable control of Shipper that affect production levels; action or restraint by court order or public or governmental authority (so long as the Claiming Party has not applied for or assisted in the application for, and has opposed where and to the extent reasonable, such government action); provided, however, that none of the loss of Shipper's or its Affiliates' markets, Shipper's or its Affiliates' inability to obtain adequate capacity (other than for reasons of force majeure affecting a Downstream Pipeline), nor Shipper's or its Affiliates' inability economically to use or resell Crude Petroleum transported hereunder shall constitute an event of Force Majeure. A force majeure event that occurs respecting one or more Downstream Pipelines for which there are no reasonable alternatives for a Claiming Party to utilize in order to meet its duties and obligations under this Agreement, regardless of whether such Downstream Pipeline declared such force majeure event, shall constitute Force Majeure for purposes of this Agreement, subject to the requirement of the first sentence of this definition. The failure of a Claiming Party to settle or prevent a strike or other labor dispute with employees shall not be considered to be a matter within such Claiming Party's control.",

                "explanation": "The modification creates a contradiction regarding downstream pipeline force majeure events. Initially, these events constitute Force Majeure if no reasonable alternatives exist. The modified version states they 'shall not constitute Force Majeure,' even under the same conditions, creating ambiguity and potential disputes over obligations.",

                "explanation": "The modification alters the termination clause, changing the required notice period from 30 days to 90 days. This directly contradicts the original agreement, creating uncertainty about the actual termination terms and legal implications.",

                "explanation": "The change modifies the payment terms, extending the standard payment window from '10 days' to '30 days'. This creates a direct conflict within the document as it now presents two different payment timelines, raising concerns about which payment schedule is enforceable.",

                "original_text": "The Developer hereby warrants and represents that following delivery of the Application System to the Client (which shall be deeded to occur only on the date the Web Application is uploaded to the AWS for distribution) pursuant to Exhibit A (the \"Support Period\"), the Application will be free from programming errors and defects in workmanship and materials, and will conform to the specifications of Exhibit A. If programming errors or other defects are discovered during the Support Period, the Developer shall promptly remedy those errors or defects at its own expense. The developer will fix any bugs that may come up from the original contract after the 90 days warranty has passed.",
                "changed_text": "The Developer hereby warrants and represents that following delivery of the Application System to the Client (which shall be deeded to occur only on the date the Web Application is uploaded to the AWS for distribution) pursuant to Exhibit A (the \"Support Period\"), the Application will be free from programming errors and defects in workmanship and materials, and will conform to the specifications of Exhibit A. If programming errors or other defects are discovered during the Support Period, the Developer shall promptly remedy those errors or defects at a reasonable cost to the client. The developer will not fix any bugs that may come up from the original contract after the 90 days warranty has passed unless specifically agreed to in writing by both parties.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting responsibilities. The original text states the developer will fix bugs at its own expense during the Support Period and also fix any bugs after the 90 days warranty has passed from the original contract. The modified text requires the client to pay for bug fixes during the 'Support Period' and also states the developer will not fix any bugs that may come up after the 90 days warranty has passed without written agreement. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty about the financial responsibilities for bug fixes.",

                "original_text": "The Developer shall inform the Client immediately of any anticipated delays in the delivery schedule and of any remedial actions being taken to ensure completion of the Application System according to such schedule. If a delivery date is missed, the Client may, in its sole discretion, declare such delay a material breach of the Agreement under subsection 4(a) and pursue all of its legal and equitable remedies. The Client may not declare a breach, and the Developer cannot be held in breach of this Agreement, of this section if such delay is caused by an action or failure of action of the Client. In such case, the Developer will provide the Client with written notice of the delay and work on the Application System will work until the reason for the delay has been resolved by the Client and written notice of that resolution has been provided to the Developer.",
                "changed_text": "The Developer shall inform the Client within five business days of any anticipated delays in the delivery schedule. If a delivery date is missed, the Client may declare such delay a material breach of the Agreement under subsection 4(a) and pursue all of its legal and equitable remedies unless Developer provides a reasonable excuse in writing. The Client may declare a breach, and the Developer will be held in breach of this Agreement, even if such delay is caused by an action or failure of action of the Client if Developer fails to meet deadlines. In such a situation, the Developer will continue to work on the Application System.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the Developer shall inform the Client immediately of delays and the Client may not declare a breach for client-caused delays. The modified text allows the developer five business days to inform the client and states the client may declare a breach even if the delay is caused by the client under certain circumstances and states the developer must continue to work on the Application System. This contradicts the conditions under which the Client can declare a breach and the Developer's liability for delays.",

The Developer will deliver to the Client all the source code, licenses and other assets used during the process as soon as the work described in this proposal is finished under client acceptation and after receiving the last payment.",

The Developer will retain a non-exclusive license to the source code, licenses and other assets used during the process, and will deliver to the Client a compiled version of the application after client acceptation and after receiving the last payment.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states all intellectual property belongs to the Client. The modified clause states the developer retains a non-exclusive license and it conflicts with the original statement that the complete Intellectual Property belongs to the client, which introduces ambiguity and could lead to disputes over ownership and usage rights of the intellectual property.",

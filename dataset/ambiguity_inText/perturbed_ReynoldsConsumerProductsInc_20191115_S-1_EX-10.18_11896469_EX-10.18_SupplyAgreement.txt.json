                "original_text": "The phrase \"Purchase Schedule\" will mean a written supplement to this Agreement signed by an officer of each Party which references this Agreement and which identities, among other terms and conditions, the specific types and quantities of products that will be purchased and sold by the Parties on terms and conditions in the schedule, the specifications for the identified products, the duration of the commitment period during which the Parties will be obligated to purchase and sell the identified products on the terms and conditions in the schedule, the prices of the identified products, any mechanisms for adjusting the prices of the identified products over the commitment period, and the facilities at which the identified products will be manufactured, stored and delivered by Seller. The Parties may add terms and conditions to, and amend the terms and conditions of, this Agreement in a Purchase Schedule, but any additional and amended terms and conditions in a Purchase Schedule supplementing and modifying this Agreement will only apply the specific products identified in that Purchase Schedule for its duration.",
                "changed_text": "The phrase \"Purchase Schedule\" will mean a written supplement to this Agreement signed by an officer of each Party which references this Agreement and which identifies, among other terms and conditions, the specific types and quantities of products that will be purchased and sold by the Parties on terms and conditions in the schedule, the specifications for the identified products, the duration of the commitment period during which the Parties will be obligated to purchase and sell the identified products on the terms and conditions in the schedule, the prices of the identified products, any mechanisms for adjusting the prices of the identified products over the commitment period, and the facilities at which the identified products will be manufactured, stored and delivered by Seller. The Parties may add terms and conditions to this Agreement in a Purchase Schedule, and any additional and amended terms and conditions in a Purchase Schedule supplementing and modifying this Agreement will apply to all products regardless of if they are listed in the specific product identified in that Purchase Schedule for its duration.",
                "explanation": "By stating that modifications apply to all products, regardless of listing within the schedule, this contradicts the initial definition limiting application to specific products. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over which terms govern.",

                "changed_text": "A Party will not suspend performance under or terminate this Agreement or any accepted purchase order for a product being purchased and sold under this Agreement unless: (1) the other Party is in material breach of this Agreement; and (2) the Parties have attempted to resolve the Dispute related to the material breach through negotiation or mediation, as provided in this Section. The thirty (30) day notice and cure period is optional and can be waived by the non-breaching party's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Removing the cure period requirement, and stating that cure is optional, contradicts the original section which provides a 30-day period to cure the material breach. This creates ambiguity about when termination is permissible.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by contradicting the requirement for a Purchase Schedule or written agreement for IP development. Allowing email correspondence to suffice undermines the formal agreement requirement.",

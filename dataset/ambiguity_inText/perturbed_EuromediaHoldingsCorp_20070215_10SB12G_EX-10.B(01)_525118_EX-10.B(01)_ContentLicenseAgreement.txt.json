For clarity, the VOD service that Rogers provides to such subscribers shall hereinafter be referred to as the \"ROD Service\".",

For clarity, the VOD service that Rogers provides to such subscribers shall hereinafter be referred to as the \"ROD Service\", but only for subscribers with active Rogers accounts for at least 6 months.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by adding a qualification to the definition of \"ROD Service\". The original definition simply refers to the VOD service provided to subscribers, but the modified definition restricts it to subscribers with accounts active for at least six months. This creates uncertainty as to which subscribers are actually eligible for the ROD service under this agreement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflicting definition of the License Period. Originally, it was a fixed 90-day period or a period agreed upon by both parties. Now, it could also be determined by Licensor based on market conditions, creating ambiguity and potentially allowing the Licensor to unilaterally alter the License Period. This could lead to disputes over the length of time Rogers is allowed to exhibit the Licensed Programs.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict regarding when a notice is considered 'received'. The original text specifies conditions based on delivery method and Business Days. The modified text introduces a new, contradictory rule: immediate receipt upon sending with proof, unless it's a critical legal notice, which requires written acknowledgment within 7 days. This makes it unclear when notice is effective, especially for routine communication versus critical legal matters, potentially impacting timelines and obligations under the contract.",

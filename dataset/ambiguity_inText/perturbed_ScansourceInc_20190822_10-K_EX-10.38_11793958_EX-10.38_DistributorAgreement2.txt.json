                "original_text": "Customer's license to use the Software shall be limited to, and Customer shall not use the Software in excess of, a single hardware chassis or card or that number of agent(s), concurrent users, sessions, IP addresses, port(s), seat(s), server(s) or site(s), as set forth in the applicable Purchase Order which has been accepted by Cisco and for which Customer has paid to Cisco the required license fee.",
                "changed_text": "Customer's license to use the Software shall be limited to a single hardware chassis. Customer may use the Software on multiple hardware chassis or cards, provided that the total usage does not exceed the equivalent of what one could reasonably expect from the single hardware chassis. The exact number of agent(s), concurrent users, sessions, IP addresses, port(s), seat(s), server(s) or site(s) permitted is subject to mutual agreement between Customer and Cisco, even if specified in the applicable Purchase Order accepted by Cisco.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the license limitations. The original text clearly ties the license to the Purchase Order. The modified version makes the specific limitations open to interpretation and negotiation, contradicting the initial statement that ties the license to a 'single hardware chassis' while simultaneously allowing 'multiple'. This creates uncertainty regarding the actual limits of the license and introduces a clause requiring further 'mutual agreement' that could conflict with the purchase order.",

For purposes of this Agreement, \"Software\" shall include (and the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to) computer programs, including firmware, as provided to Customer by Cisco or an authorized Cisco reseller, and any upgrades, updates, bug fixes or modified versions thereto (collectively, \"Upgrades\") or backup copies of the Software licensed or provided to Customer by Cisco or an authorized Cisco reseller. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT: (1) CUSTOMER HAS NO LICENSE OR RIGHT TO USE ANY ADDITIONAL COPIES OR UPGRADES UNLESS CUSTOMER, AT THE TIME OF ACQUIRING SUCH COPY OR UPGRADE, ALREADY HOLDS A VALID LICENSE TO THE ORIGINAL SOFTWARE AND HAS PAID THE APPLICABLE FEE FOR THE UPGRADE; (2) USE OF UPGRADES IS LIMITED TO CISCO EQUIPMENT FOR WHICH CUSTOMER IS THE ORIGINAL END USER PURCHASER OR LESSEE OR WHO OTHERWISE HOLDS A VALID LICENSE TO USE THE SOFTWARE WHICH IS BEING UPGRADED; AND (3) THE MAKING AND USE OF ADDITIONAL COPIES IS LIMITED TO NECESSARY BACKUP PURPOSES ONLY.",

(1) CUSTOMER MAY USE ADDITIONAL COPIES OR UPGRADES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CUSTOMER HOLDS A VALID LICENSE TO THE ORIGINAL SOFTWARE, PROVIDED CUSTOMER PAYS THE APPLICABLE FEE FOR THE UPGRADE WITHIN 60 DAYS OF INSTALLATION; (2) USE OF UPGRADES MAY BE EXTENDED TO NON-CISCO EQUIPMENT AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE CUSTOMER; AND (3) THE MAKING AND USE OF ADDITIONAL COPIES IS PERMITTED FOR ANY PURPOSE, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING, SUBJECT ONLY TO CISCO'S REASONABLE SECURITY PROTOCOLS.",
                "explanation": "The original text has specific restrictions on using upgrades and additional copies. This change directly contradicts those restrictions. It now allows usage of upgrades without a prior license, extends usage to non-Cisco equipment, and permits additional copies for any purpose. This creates significant conflict and uncertainty, because it is reversing what was originally established.",

Customer may terminate this Agreement and the license at any time by destroying all copies of Software including any Documentation.

Upon termination, Customer shall destroy all copies of Software and Documentation in its possession or control.",

Customer may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing 90 days written notice to Cisco. Cisco may terminate this Agreement only in the event of Customer's material breach, provided that Cisco provides Customer with 30 days notice to cure such breach. Upon termination by Cisco, the Customer is permitted to retain one archival copy of the Software and Documentation for regulatory compliance purposes.",
                "explanation": "The original text allowed the customer to terminate the agreement at any time by destroying the software and also stated that Customer's rights terminate immediately if they fail to comply. The modification introduces conflicting terms: a fixed term of five years, a 90-day notice period for customer termination, and a requirement for Cisco to provide a 30-day cure period before termination. The permission to retain an archival copy after Cisco terminates directly contradicts the original requirement to destroy all copies. This creates ambiguity and contradictions related to the term and reasons for termination.",

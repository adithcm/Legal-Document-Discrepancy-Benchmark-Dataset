                "explanation": "The change from 'exclusive' to 'non-exclusive' regarding the usage rights of the Wade Image introduces a contradiction. Later sections of the agreement may assume exclusivity, particularly concerning competitive endorsements. This conflicting definition creates uncertainty in enforcement concerning Naked's rights to the Wade Image, as the term 'Wade Image' is fundamental to the agreement's purpose and scope.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Wade' to 'Naked' as the responsible party for withholding taxes creates a direct contradiction. This confusion directly impacts the financial obligations and liabilities of both parties, and could result in legal disputes over who is ultimately liable for these taxes. In this scenario, 'responsible' definition is self-contradictory.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'eighteen (18) months' to 'entire term of this agreement' regarding the eligibility period for Athlete joining the Board of Directors introduces a contradiction. The agreement mentions 'term of agreement' that could be longer than 18 months. This creates ambiguity regarding the duration of Athlete's option to join the Board and causes an internal contradiction regarding the time in which the athlete has the option to be a board member.",

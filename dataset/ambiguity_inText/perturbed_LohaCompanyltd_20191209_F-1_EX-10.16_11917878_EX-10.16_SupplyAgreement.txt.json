                "original_text": "2.2 The seller shall be confirmed within three working days after receipt of order. If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or modifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party shall not unilaterally cancel the order before the two sides agreed .",
                "changed_text": "2.2 The seller shall endeavor to confirm within three working days after receipt of order. If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or modifications, the seller is not deemed to have been automatically accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party may unilaterally cancel the order with a 30-day written notice before the two sides agreed .",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'shall be confirmed' is changed to 'shall endeavor to confirm,' weakening the obligation on the seller. Also, the original text states that if the seller does not respond, they are 'deemed to have accepted' the order. The modified version states that the seller is 'not deemed' to have automatically accepted, which introduces ambiguity. The original says any party shall not unilaterally cancel, in the modified version, any party may unilaterally cancel with a 30-day written notice.",

CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers. The Certificate so issued shall be accepted as the base of a claim. The Sellers, in accordance with the Buyers' claim, shall be responsible for the immediate elimination of the defect(s), complete or partial replacement of the commodity or shall devaluate the commodity according to the state of defect(s). Where necessary, the Buyers shall be at liberty to eliminate the defect(s) themselves at the Sellers' expenses. If the Sellers fail to answer the Buyers within one weeks after receipt of the aforesaid claim, the claim shall be reckoned as having been accepted by the Sellers.",
                "changed_text": "16. CLAIMS: Within 30 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract, the Buyers may, at their discretion, notify the Sellers of any discrepancies. The Buyers and Sellers will then negotiate in good faith to determine an appropriate resolution, which may include replacement with new goods, compensation, or other remedies. The Sellers shall be responsible for addressing any defects, but the specific course of action will be determined based on mutual agreement between the Buyers and Sellers. The Sellers are obligated to respond to the Buyers' claim within 3 weeks, failing which the claim will only be evaluated and considered based on the available data.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives a clear 7-day window for claims and mandates specific actions from the seller. The modified version extends the claim window to 30 days and replaces the mandate with a negotiation process, creating uncertainty. In addition, there is a change of period for the seller to respond, from 1 week to 3 weeks. Finally, after the 3 weeks, there is no acceptance from the seller by default, but only be evaluated and considered. This contradicts the original text, which enforces default acceptances.",

LATE DELIVERY AND PENALTY: Should the Sellers fail to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, with exception of Force Majeure causes specified in Clause 17 of this Contract, the Buyers shall agree to postpone the delivery on condition that the Sellers agree to pay a penalty which shall be deducted by the paying bank from the payment. The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. The rate of penalty is charged at 0.5% for every seven days, odd days less than seven days should be counted as seven days. In case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the contract and the Sellers, in spite of the cancellation, shall still pay the aforesaid penalty to the Buyers without delay, the seller should refund the money received and pay the 30% of the total goods price of the penalty",
                "changed_text": "18. LATE DELIVERY AND PENALTY: While the Sellers are expected to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, delays may occur. If such delays arise, the Buyers may consider granting an extension for the delivery, but this is not guaranteed. In such cases, the Buyers and Sellers will discuss the possibility of a mutually agreed-upon penalty. The penalty, however, may exceed 10% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. The rate of penalty will be discussed for every fifteen days, odd days less than fifteen days should be counted as fifteen days. In case the Sellers fail to make delivery twelve weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the option to cancel the contract and the Sellers, in spite of the cancellation, shall not pay any penalty to the Buyers .",
                "explanation": "The modified version weakens the obligation for on-time delivery by stating 'delays may occur'. The 'shall agree to postpone' changes to 'may consider', making the extension discretionary. The fixed penalty is now open to discussion and the upper limit has been doubled. The penalty calculation is on fifteen days instead of seven. The right of cancel is an option now. There is no penalty for the cancel of the contract.",

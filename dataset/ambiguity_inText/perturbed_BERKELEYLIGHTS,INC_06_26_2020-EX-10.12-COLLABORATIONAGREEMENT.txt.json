                "explanation": "The original text clearly states 'In no event shall the work of one (1) employee exceed 1 full FTE.' The modified text contradicts this by introducing a condition where 'In some events, the work of more than one (1) employee can exceed 1 full FTE if approved by both parties.', creating ambiguity and uncertainty about the definition of FTE.",

Any Party seeking indemnification under this Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance) will promptly notify the indemnifying Party in writing after the Party seeking indemnification has received notice of any Claim. The Party seeking indemnification will reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying Party in the defense of any such Claim at the cost of the indemnifying Party. An indemnifying Party will not be obligated to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Party seeking indemnification if, and only to the extent, the Party seeking indemnification delays providing notice of a Claim to the indemnifying Party and the delay in notice substantively prejudices the ability of the indemnifying Party to successfully defend the Claim. The indemnifying Party may not make any admission on behalf of the Party seeking indemnification [***]. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Party seeking indemnification may at any time choose to be represented by its own counsel at its expense (or at the indemnifying Party's expense if the indemnifying Party's defense is inadequate as determined by a reasonableness standard).",

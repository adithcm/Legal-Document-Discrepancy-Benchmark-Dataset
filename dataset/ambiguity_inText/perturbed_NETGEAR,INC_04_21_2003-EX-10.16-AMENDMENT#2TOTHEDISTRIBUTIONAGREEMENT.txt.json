For the purposes of          this provision, distributor shall mean a company acquiring products          directly from NETGEAR for resale or license to dealers or other second          tier resellers which in turn resell or license the products to end use          customers. The foregoing notwithstanding, during the [*] and any          subsequent period, NETGEAR reserves the right to sell or license          Products in [*] to customers other than distributors such as, but not          limited to resellers who procure Products at centralized locations for          resale to end-use customers solely through their wholly or majority          owned retail outlets, both store-front and catalog.

                "explanation": "The original text states that after the initial period, the Distributor's appointment is non-exclusive. The modified text contradicts this by stating the appointment is exclusive in any extension or renewal, and that NETGEAR needs written consent to appoint other distributors. This creates uncertainty about the distribution rights during renewal terms.",

The modified text introduces an exception, stating payment terms will default to the original agreement.

However, for purposes of order placement and payment, the 'Ingram' refers solely to Ingram Micro Inc.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of Ingram is straightforward. The modified text introduces a condition that Ingram is acting through a subsidiary but limits the definition for order placement and payment to the parent company. This creates ambiguity over which entity is legally responsible in different contractual contexts.",

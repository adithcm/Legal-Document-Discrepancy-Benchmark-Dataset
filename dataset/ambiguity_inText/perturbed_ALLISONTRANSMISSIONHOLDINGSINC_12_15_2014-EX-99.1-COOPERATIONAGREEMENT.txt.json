                "original_text": "(a) Subject to the satisfactory completion of the Company's customary background check, the Board shall appoint the ValueAct Designee to serve as a director beginning within ten (10) calendar days following receipt of the ValueAct Group's written request to the Company to have the ValueAct Designee appointed to the Board; provided that, at such time, the Board does not conclude in good faith and based on the written opinion of outside legal counsel that such appointment would constitute a breach of the directors' fiduciary duties. If the ValueAct Designee is appointed to the Board pursuant to this Section 1(a), the Company shall include the ValueAct Designee as a Class I Director, which term expires at the Company's 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Subject to the satisfactory completion of the Company's customary background check, the Board may consider appointing the ValueAct Designee to serve as a director beginning within a reasonable time following receipt of the ValueAct Group's written request to the Company to have the ValueAct Designee appointed to the Board; provided that, at such time, the Board does not conclude that such appointment would be detrimental to the company. If the ValueAct Designee is appointed to the Board pursuant to this Section 1(a), the Company shall include the ValueAct Designee as a director, with the term decided by the Board.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the Board 'shall appoint' within 'ten calendar days', creating a binding obligation. The modified text changes 'shall appoint' to 'may consider appointing' and replaces 'ten calendar days' with 'reasonable time', changing the obligation to discretionary consideration with no specific timeframe. Additionally, the original text dictates 'Class I Director', while the updated text indicates that the term will be determined by the Board, creating uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "(b) Each member of the ValueAct Group shall use reasonable efforts to cause all shares of Common Stock beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by it, or by any ValueAct Affiliate, to be present for quorum purposes and to be voted, at the Company's annual and special stockholder meetings and at any adjournments or postponements thereof, and further agrees that at the 2015 annual stockholder meeting they may consider voting in favor of (i) all directors nominated by the Board for election at such meeting and (ii) in accordance with the Board's recommendation with respect to any proposals for the election of directors that may be the subject of stockholder action at such meeting.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates ValueAct Group 'shall cause' shares to be present and voted and 'shall vote in favor'. The modified version changes 'shall cause' to 'use reasonable efforts' and 'shall vote in favor' to 'may consider voting in favor'. This introduces ambiguity as the extent of effort and commitment to vote in favor is now weakened, creating potential conflict and making the obligation less binding.",

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that such damage would not be adequately compensable in monetary damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement, to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Court of Chancery or other federal or state courts of the State of Delaware and to   5\n\nrequire the resignation of the ValueAct Designee from the Board commencing on the date that is 10 days following the date that the ValueAct Designee and/or the ValueAct Group materially breaches its obligations under this Agreement, provided, that, such breach has not been cured prior to the expiration of such 10-day period, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity, and each party agrees it will not take any action, directly or indirectly, in opposition to another party seeking relief. Each of the parties hereto agrees to waive any bonding requirement under any applicable law, in the case any other party seeks to enforce the terms by way of equitable relief. Furthermore, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery or other federal or state courts of the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery or other federal or state courts of the State of Delaware, and each of the parties irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury, and (d) each of the parties irrevocably consents to service of process by a reputable overnight mail delivery service, signature requested, to the address set forth in Section 11 of this Agreement or as otherwise provided by applicable law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND EFFECT, BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS EXECUTED AND TO BE PERFORMED WHOLLY WITHIN SUCH STATE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE.",
                "changed_text": "9. Miscellaneous. While the parties acknowledge that breaches of this agreement may cause damage, the parties agree that monetary damages will be adequate. Accordingly, in the event of a breach of this agreement, the parties agree to first attempt mediation for 30 days. In the event that mediation fails, the parties consent to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any court with jurisdiction over the parties. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND EFFECT, BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE WHERE THE ALLISON TRANSMISSION HOLDINGS, INC. HAS ITS HEADQUARTERS AT THE TIME OF THE BREACH.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that irreparable damage would occur and specifies remedies, including injunctions and resignation of the ValueAct Designee. The modification states that monetary damages will be adequate and proposes mediation before legal action. The original text specifies Delaware courts and law, while the modification indicates any court with jurisdiction and potentially changes the governing law based on where Allison Transmission's headquarters are located. This directly contradicts the dispute resolution process and applicable law, making enforcement unpredictable.",

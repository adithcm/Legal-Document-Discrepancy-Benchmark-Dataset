During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2018 (the \"Development Term\"), each Party (the \"Offering Party\") agrees to provide to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") a right of first offer with respect to any proposed offer or arrangement, which the Offering Party (or its affiliate) desires to accept, under which the Offering Party or one of its affiliates would acquire the ownership of real property in the Market Area (the \"Development Property\") on which a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort would operate (a \"Development Opportunity\").\n\nIf the Offering Party is required to offer the Receiving Party a Development Opportunity pursuant to this Section 1, the Offering Party must deliver written notice to the Receiving Party, together with reasonable due diligence information in the Offering Party's possession to enable the Receiving Party to evaluate the Development Opportunity (collectively, the \"Offer Notice\"). The Receiving Party will have ten (10) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity.",

The Receiving Party will have fifteen (15) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'ten (10) business days' to 'fifteen (15) business days' creates a contradiction if elsewhere in the contract (or related agreements) the period for exercising the right of first offer is explicitly stated as ten business days. This inconsistency makes the deadline uncertain, potentially leading to disputes.",

Any required notice shall be effective two business days after it is sent by a recognized international courier service to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and any receipt issued by the courier service shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice.",
                "changed_text": "3. Notices. Any notice required under this Agreement to be given by either Party to the other Party shall be in writing or electronically. Any required notice shall be effective five business days after it is sent by a recognized international courier service or via email with confirmation of receipt to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and confirmation of receipt by the courier service or email will be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending and reciept of any such notice.",
                "explanation": "The modification to allow electronic notices with a 5-day effectiveness conflicts with the original requirement for written notice via courier, which takes effect in two business days. This raises uncertainty about whether both notice methods are valid and if one should take precedence. It's uncertain if email is valid for legal notice here and adds time needed to take effect.",

Dispute Resolution.\n\n(a) All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall to the extent possible be settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties within fifteen (15) days from the date of written notice by either Party of the existence of such dispute, and, failing such amicable settlement, shall be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (\"Rules\"). To the extent there is any conflict between the Rules and the Federal Arbitration Act as it pertains to such arbitration, the Rules shall prevail.",

Dispute Resolution.\n\n(a) All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall to the extent possible be settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties within thirty (30) days from the date of written notice by either Party of the existence of such dispute, failing which, either party may directly proceed to litigation. To the extent there is any conflict between the Rules and the Federal Arbitration Act as it pertains to such arbitration, the Federal Arbitration Act shall prevail.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several contradictions. Firstly, the negotiation period is extended from 15 to 30 days. Secondly, it now permits either party to proceed directly to litigation instead of mandatory arbitration under ICC Rules. This conflicts with the original section mandating arbitration, and switches the order of precedence for the Rules to Federal Arbitration Act.",

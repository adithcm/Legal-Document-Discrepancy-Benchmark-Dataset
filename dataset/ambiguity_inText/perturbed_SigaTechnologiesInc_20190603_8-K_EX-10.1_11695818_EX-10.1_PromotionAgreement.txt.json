                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity in the definition of 'Customer'. In the original definition, there needs to be a Customer Contract. The change allows for a broader definition where the term applies to any third party that MMT approaches. This creates uncertainty about who is actually considered a 'Customer' under the agreement, especially in sections related to Customer Contracts and related obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that MMT will provide appropriate training of the MMT Promotion Personnel including training on applicable laws but determined at MMT's sole discretion. The modified text removes the shall from the original statement and now states that MMT may provide training excluding compliance with applicable laws. This creates a contradiction and ambiguity, as another part of the contract enforces strict adherence to Laws. This creates an **internal contradiction** that creates uncertainty about the extent to which MMT promotion personnel are required to be compliant with laws.",

Both are subject to the special authorized disclosure provisions but the **internal contradiction** creates uncertainty about whether the agreement is confidential or not.",

Confidential Information may include, but is not limited to, the following types of information and other information of a similar nature, in any form or medium, in any way perceived: trade secrets, software licensed on an evaluation basis hereunder (whether source code, executable code or otherwise), source code, inventions, art, drawings, schematics, files, file data, documentation, diagrams, specifications, know how, processes, formulas, flow charts, product criteria, research and development records, procedures, test results and samples, marketing techniques and materials, marketing and development plans, pricing data, price lists, business plans, information relating to customer identities, supplier or other source identities, and financial information.\n\nConfidential Information of a Disclosing Party may also include any information described above, whether or not owned or developed by it, and any such information Disclosing Party is obligated to keep confidential by way of a written agreement with a third party.

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' is broad, encompassing 'any and all information.' The modified definition narrows it to 'technical information directly related to the source code of the Flix Software' and removes several examples like 'marketing techniques and materials'. This creates a contradiction, as it's unclear whether non-technical information is still considered confidential, potentially leading to disputes over its protection and use.",

The modified version only requires 'reasonable effort,' negating the implied guarantee of industry standards. This contradiction creates ambiguity about Wildform's required level of performance and could result in disagreements over whether Wildform adequately fulfilled its obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states Wildform 'shall deliver' creating an obligation. The modified language weakens this to 'will attempt to deliver'. Furthermore, the original provides On2 must use 'commercially reasonable efforts' to cooperate, whereas the modification requires 'best efforts'. The original requires Nonconformance Notice to provide sufficient details, while the modified version just an 'explanation'. This change introduces a contradiction, as it's unclear to which level Wildform is required to deliver the product. Also, it goes from 'On2 shall not unreasonably withhold acceptance of any Deliverable' to 'On2 shall have the right to withhold acceptance of any Deliverable', which are conflicting requirements of the deliverable acceptance. This creates uncertainty and potential for disputes.",

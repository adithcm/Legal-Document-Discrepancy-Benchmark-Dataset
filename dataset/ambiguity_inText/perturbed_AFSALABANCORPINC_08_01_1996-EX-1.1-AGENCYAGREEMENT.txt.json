                "explanation": "The original text clearly appoints Capital Resources as an agent with defined responsibilities. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating Capital Resources is considered as one of their potential agents (non-binding) and required to purchase shares (contradicts acknowledgment that Capital Resources  shall not be required to purchase any Shares). This creates an in-text contradiction regarding the nature and extent of Capital Resources' role and obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original section provides strong representations and warranties from the Company and the Association to Capital Resources.

The modified version weakens the obligations by only separately covenanting and use of \"perhaps\" and \"might\" instead of \"has\" and \"will\", this alters their commitment and introduces uncertainty. It also contradicts the other parts of the document which still have the other wording for the covenants which make these covenants in this section contradictory to the original covenants of the contract.",

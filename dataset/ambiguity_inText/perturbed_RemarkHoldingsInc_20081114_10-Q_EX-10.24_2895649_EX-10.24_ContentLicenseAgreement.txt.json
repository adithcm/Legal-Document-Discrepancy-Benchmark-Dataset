                "original_text": "1.3 \"Affiliate\" means any distributor or franchisee of HSWI or any company or other entity worldwide, including without limitation corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, and limited liability companies in which HSWI directly or indirectly holds at least a 19% ownership, equity, control or financial interest and which HSWI intends to enjoy any of HSWI's rights hereunder. A list of Affiliates as of the Effective Date is attached hereto as Attachment A. Attachment A may be modified from time to time upon notice by HSWI to reflect a revised list of Affiliates and each modified Attachment A shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Affiliate' now contradicts itself if Attachment A includes entities where HSWI holds between 19% and 49% ownership. This creates ambiguity regarding which entities qualify as Affiliates under the agreement, affecting rights and obligations.",

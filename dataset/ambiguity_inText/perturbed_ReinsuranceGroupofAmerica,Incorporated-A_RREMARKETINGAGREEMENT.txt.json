                "original_text": "(a) If there has been a successful Remarketing, the Company shall pay to the Remarketing Agent for the performance of its services as Remarketing Agent hereunder on the Remarketing Settlement Date, by wire transfer to an account designated by the Remarketing Agent, a fee in an amount equal to 25 basis points (0.25%) of the Accreted Value of the Remarketed Securities.",
                "changed_text": "(a) If there has been a successful Remarketing, the Company may, at its sole discretion, pay to the Remarketing Agent for the performance of its services as Remarketing Agent hereunder on the Remarketing Settlement Date, by wire transfer to an account designated by the Remarketing Agent, a fee in an amount equal to 10 basis points (0.10%) of the Accreted Value of the Remarketed Securities.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates the Company to pay 25 basis points. The modified text changes this to discretionary payment (may pay), with a reduced fee of 10 basis points. This creates a contradiction if another section assumes a mandatory payment of 25 basis points, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

The Company will pay the expenses of printing and distributing to the Remarketing Agent all such documents.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will attempt to use its reasonable efforts:\n(a) To furnish to the Remarketing Agent and to counsel to the Remarketing Agent, copies of the Prospectus (and all amendments and supplements thereto) in each case as soon as they become conveniently available and in such quantities as the Remarketing Agent deems appropriate for internal use. The Remarketing Agent will be responsible for the costs of printing and distributing all such documents.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'reasonable best efforts' to promptly furnish the prospectus, with the Company bearing the costs. The modified text weakens the obligation to 'attempt to use its reasonable efforts' and changes who is responsible for the document costs, shifting them to the Remarketing Agent. This contradicts the original commitment and can cause disputes.",

No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement, the Trust Agreement or the Indenture. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, which purports to conform to the requirements of this Agreement, the Trust Agreement or the Indenture as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketing Securities in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part. The Remarketing Agent will be entitled to rely conclusively on any determination by the Calculation Agent under the Calculation Agency Agreement, dated as of December 18, 2001 between the Company and Reinsel & Company LLP, as Calculation Agent, of the Accreted Value or Discount relating to the Preferred Securities and Debentures, as applicable, and will incur no liability to the Company or any holder of Remarketing Securities relating to inaccuracies in calculating such Accreted Value or Discount.",
                "changed_text": "The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be interpreted broadly, in alignment with industry standards for similar services, and with a commitment to the Issuers' best interests. Any obligations implied by common business practice will also be considered part of the Remarketing Agent's duties. The Remarketing Agent will conduct independent verification of the truth of the statements expressed in any documents, and may not rely solely on documentation furnished to it. The Remarketing Agent will take all appropriate steps to ensure document authenticity. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketing Securities in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from negligence or any degree of misconduct on its part. The Remarketing Agent is solely responsible for any determination by the Calculation Agent under the Calculation Agency Agreement, dated as of December 18, 2001 between the Company and Reinsel & Company LLP, as Calculation Agent, of the Accreted Value or Discount relating to the Preferred Securities and Debentures, as applicable, and will incur full liability to the Company or any holder of Remarketing Securities relating to inaccuracies in calculating such Accreted Value or Discount.",
                "explanation": "The original text limits the Remarketing Agent's obligations to express provisions, allowing reliance on furnished documents and restricting liability to gross negligence/willful misconduct. The modified version broadens obligations via implied covenants and industry standards, demanding independent verification and expanding liability to mere negligence or any degree of misconduct. This conflicts with the original narrow interpretation, creating uncertainty and disputes.",

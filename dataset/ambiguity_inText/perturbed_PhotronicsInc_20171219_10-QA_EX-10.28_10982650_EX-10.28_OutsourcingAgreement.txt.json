This change explicitly distinguishes between customer purchase orders and internal orders, calling the latter 'Internal Requisitions.' This creates confusion because other sections of the agreement refer to 'Purchase Orders' related to obligations between the company and suppliers; thus the obligations could potentially be ignored, deeming them as not purchase orders but internal requisitions.",

This warranty does not apply to any Product failures resulting from misuse, storage in or exposure to environmental conditions inconsistent with those specified in the applicable specifications or documentation, modification of the Product by anyone other than the relevant Supplier. If a Product fails to comply with the foregoing warranty, the relevant Supplier shall, at its option, either [***]such Product, or, in the event the foregoing options are not commercially practicable, [***]to the Company any amounts paid for the applicable Product. Without limiting the remedies specified in Article 8 and Section 9.2, this Section 6.1 states the exclusive remedy of the Company for failure of a Product to conform to the warranty provisions set forth in this Section 6.1.",

If a Product fails to comply with the foregoing warranty, the relevant Supplier shall, at its option, either [***]such Product, or, in the event the foregoing options are not commercially practicable, [***]to the Company any amounts paid for the applicable Product.

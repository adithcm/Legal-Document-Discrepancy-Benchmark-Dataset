                "explanation": "The original definition is very broad, including many elements. The modified text sharply restricts it, specifically excluding items that the original included. This creates conflict over what constitutes Online BVI Intellectual Property, crucial for licensing and ownership clauses later in the document. This could lead to disputes over ownership of content and technology used in the co-branded web site and application.",

                "explanation": "The change is on how revenue will be shared between the parties. In one section is 50/50. And in this part is saying is 75/25 between Skype and the Company. This will create a lot of issues, since the initial idea on how it's shared it is not clear anymore, and will be open to discussions. There's a confusion with the percentages that each of the parties should receive.",

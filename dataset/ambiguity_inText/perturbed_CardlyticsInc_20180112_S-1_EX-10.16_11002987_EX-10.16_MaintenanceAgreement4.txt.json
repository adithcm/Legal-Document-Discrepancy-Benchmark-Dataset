                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the maintenance fees. Initially, maintenance is stated to be at no charge. The modification suggests that after the first year, fees will apply based on a separate document, creating uncertainty about the duration and applicability of the 'no charge' maintenance.",

                "explanation": "This introduces ambiguity regarding maintenance during Bank of America holidays. The original text clearly includes holidays, while the modified text excludes them 'unless explicitly agreed upon'.

The terms of maintaining the Source Code are subject to a separate Source Code Escrow Agreement, which will supersede any conflicting terms in this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction about the location and governing terms for the Source Code. Initially, the agreement specifies that the source code should be maintained at a 'to be determined' (TBD) address per the terms of this agreement. The modified text provides flexibility on the location (either on premises or at a third-party location) but subjects those terms to a different agreement. If there's a conflict between the main agreement and the 'Source Code Escrow Agreement' it's unclear which term will apply.",

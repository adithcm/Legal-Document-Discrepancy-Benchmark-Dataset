                "original_text": "Section 3. Expenses. VNUE shall reimburse Promoter for expenses incurred by Promoter while performing the duties herein. Promoter shall deliver to VNUE an itemized accounting of expenses incurred on a weekly basis, and VNUE shall reimburse Promoter within Thirty (30) Days of receipt of such accounting.",
                "changed_text": "Section 3. Expenses. VNUE shall reimburse Promoter for expenses incurred by Promoter while performing the duties herein. Promoter shall deliver to VNUE an itemized accounting of expenses incurred on a monthly basis, and VNUE shall reimburse Promoter within Sixty (60) Days of receipt of such accounting.",
                "explanation": "Changing the frequency of expense reporting from weekly to monthly and the reimbursement period from 30 to 60 days creates a contradiction regarding the expense reimbursement terms. This introduces uncertainty as to when the promoter should submit expenses and when they can expect reimbursement.",

At any time prior to the end of the Term, the Parties may agree in writing to extend the Agreement for successive One (1) Year periods (the \"Renewal Terms\") under the same conditions set forth herein.",

The agreement will automatically renew for successive One (1) Year periods (the \"Renewal Terms\") under the same conditions set forth herein, unless either party provides written notice of termination 30 days prior to the end of the current term.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a written agreement by both parties to extend the term. The modified text introduces automatic renewal unless either party provides a notice of termination. This creates a contradiction about the renewal process, making it unclear whether an explicit agreement is needed or if the contract auto-renews.",

It is understood that VNUE does not agree to use BookingEntertainment.com exclusively as its Promoter, and that Promoter shall not be held liable for the actions of third parties which may also be providing the same or similar services during the term of this Agreement. Likewise, Promoter is free to contract for services to be performed for other public and private companies while under contract with VNUE, subject to the terms of this Agreement.",

It is understood that VNUE does not agree to use BookingEntertainment.com exclusively as its Promoter, and that Promoter shall not be held liable for the actions of third parties which may also be providing the same or similar services during the term of this Agreement. Promoter is only permitted to contract for services to be performed for other public and private companies while under contract with VNUE with explicit written approval of VNUE.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the Promoter is free to contract services with other companies. The changed text says the Promoter is only allowed to contract services with other companies with written approval from VNUE. This creates ambiguity on the promoters ability to do outside work and if they require permission.",

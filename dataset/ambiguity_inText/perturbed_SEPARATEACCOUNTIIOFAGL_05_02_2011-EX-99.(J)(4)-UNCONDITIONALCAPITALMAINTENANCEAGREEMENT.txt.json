                "explanation": "Changing 'AIG shall' to 'AIG may, at its discretion' creates ambiguity. The original text mandates AIG to provide capital if certain conditions are met. The modified version makes it optional, leading to uncertainty about AIG's obligations and potential disputes over whether AIG must provide support.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be equal' to 'may be equal,' changing the review from 'every year' to 'every five years' and stating that they don't need to review against capital adequacy standards creates a contradiction with the initial intention of the agreement to maintain and enhance the company's financial condition. This introduces doubt about the stability and relevance of the 'Specified Minimum Percentage'.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original requirement for written amendments. Introducing the possibility of oral agreements followed by delayed written confirmation creates uncertainty and enforcement issues. It opens the door for disputes regarding the terms of oral amendments and whether they were properly documented.",

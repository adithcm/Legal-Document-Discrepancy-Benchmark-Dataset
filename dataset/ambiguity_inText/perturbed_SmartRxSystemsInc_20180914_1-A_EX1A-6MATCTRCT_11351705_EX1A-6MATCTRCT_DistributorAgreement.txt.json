Company hereby appoints Distributor as Company's exclusive Distributor for the State of Texas, and Distributor accepts the appointment and agrees to represent the Products within the Territory.

APPOINTMENT AND ACCEPTANCE: 2.1 Exclusive Appointment. Company hereby appoints Distributor as Company's exclusive Distributor for the State of Texas. Company retains the right to appoint other distributors in the Territory as it sees fit, and Distributor's appointment shall be non-exclusive in such cases, or in any other states. Company agrees that no other Distributor will be appointed in any other state as a Distributor unless it is either the Company or Distributor, save and except for the state of Florida.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Exclusive Appointment' is contradicted by adding the statement that the Company retains the right to appoint other distributors within the 'Territory'. This introduces ambiguity as to whether the Distributor's appointment in Texas is actually exclusive, or not.",

Payment to the Distributor for the sale of the Products to Customers shall be as follows: (i) Company will pay Distributor (or its Assignee) Ten Percent (10%) of the Master Distributor Override generated by each Customer Kiosk Location. (Master Distributor Override (\"MDO\") shall mean Total Revenue per Customer Kiosk Location collected by SRXS from third party payors and patient cash payments). This 10% of the total revenue generated is payable only if the EBITDA is a positive EBITDA and exceeds the 10% of the revenue. In cases of a positive EBITDA but shortage of funds compared to the 10% of the revenue, Distributor will take less than 10%. If the EBITDA is negative, no payments will be made to Distributor.",

                "explanation": "The term regarding the payment of the 10% of Master Distributor Override is conflicted. One sentence says 'This 10% of the total revenue generated is payable only if the EBITDA is a positive EBITDA', while the very next sentence says 'Distributor will receive 10% of the revenue regardless of EBITDA'.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by making the affiliate status uncertain. The original text clearly states that the undersigned 'will be' an affiliate, while the modified version states that they 'may or may not be' an affiliate. This creates uncertainty regarding the application of subsequent clauses that depend on affiliate status.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'will' to 'may' and 'were' to 'might', the obligation to place restrictive legends on the stock certificates becomes discretionary. If Section 2 stipulates that such restrictions are mandatory to maintain compliance with SEC regulations, this creates a direct contradiction about the transferability of the shares.",

                "explanation": "This changes the defined period of report filing from three years to one, and it adds a clause giving PSS sole discretion over the type and timeliness of the reports. If Section 7 requires compliance with Rule 145(d) which depends on specific timely filings for a three-year period, this presents a direct conflict. The undefined nature of the filings throws into question if there is enough information for share transfer.",

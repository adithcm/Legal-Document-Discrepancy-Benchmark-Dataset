In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the Investment Company Act, the Blockchain Administrator agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund shall at all times remain the property of the Fund, shall be readily accessible during normal business hours, and shall be promptly surrendered upon the termination of the Agreement or otherwise on written request. The Blockchain Administrator further agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the Investment Company Act will be preserved for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the Investment Company Act unless any such records are earlier surrendered as provided above. Records shall be surrendered in usable machine-readable form.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the surrender of records. The original text states records shall be surrendered 'upon the termination of the Agreement or otherwise on written request', while the modified text adds a condition of '90-day written notice' for surrendering the records. This creates uncertainty about when and how the records should be surrendered.",

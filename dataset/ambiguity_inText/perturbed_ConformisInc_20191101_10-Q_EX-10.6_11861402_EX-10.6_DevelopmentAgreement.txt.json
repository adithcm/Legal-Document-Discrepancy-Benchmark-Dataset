                "explanation": "The original definition states that terms have the meanings defined in the section or other agreements. The modified text adds a clause stating that definitions within a specific article only apply to that article. This could create confusion if a term is defined in Article 1 but used in Article 5 without being redefined.",

The modified version now states the contract can be terminated 'as unilaterally decided by Conformis'.

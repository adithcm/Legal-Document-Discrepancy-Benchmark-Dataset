                "original_text": "1.1. \"AFFILIATE\" means, with respect to any Party, any other entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with, such Party. The term \"control\" shall mean direct or indirect ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate entity or voting interest in a non-corporate entity and shall also mean the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity.",
                "changed_text": "1.1. \"AFFILIATE\" means, with respect to any Party, any other entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with, such Party. The term \"control\" shall mean direct or indirect ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate entity or voting interest in a non-corporate entity. However, for the purposes of Article 7, the term 'control' shall mean direct ownership of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate entity.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflicting definition of 'control' within the definition of 'AFFILIATE'. The general definition uses 50%, but Article 7 now requires 75% ownership for an entity to be considered an affiliate. This could lead to disputes over the applicability of Article 7 to certain entities.",

In the event either T&L or Igene wishes to market Astaxanthin for uses other than in the Field of Agreement, including but not limited to the use of Astaxanthin as a neutraceutical or otherwise for direct human consumption, either T&L or Igene, as the case may be, shall be permitted to purchase reasonable quantities of Astaxanthin from the Operating Company for use in the manufacture of such products at the Average Market Price.",

In the event either T&L or Igene wishes to market Astaxanthin for uses other than in the Field of Agreement, including but not limited to the use of Astaxanthin as a neutraceutical or otherwise for direct human consumption, either T&L or Igene, as the case may be, shall be permitted to purchase reasonable quantities of Astaxanthin from the Operating Company for use in the manufacture of such products. The price for such purchases will be determined by the Board, considering production costs and market conditions, and may not always align with the Average Market Price.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding the pricing of Astaxanthin purchases. The original text mandates the Average Market Price, while the modified text allows the Board to determine the price, which may differ from the Average Market Price. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes over the cost of Astaxanthin for non-Field of Agreement uses.",

                "original_text": "11.2. In the event that either Party conveys its interest in the Operating Company to the other or a third party during the five year period commencing on the Effective Date and the Joint Venture continues to operate as a going concern thereafter, each Party shall provide the services described in Article 11.1 to the Joint Venture at a price (that shall reasonably be consistent with the methodology used for determining prices prior to such conveyance) to be agreed upon by the Parties for a transition period to allow the owner or owners of the Operating Company to obtain such services for the Joint Venture independently. Such transition period shall not exceed 24 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.1 and Article 11.1.2 and shall not exceed 36 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.4; provided, however, if T&L shall give notice to Igene that it intends to close the Selby, England facility adjacent to the Site, T&L shall be required to provide the services set forth in Article 11.1.4 for a period not to exceed 24 months from the date Igene receives such notice.",
                "changed_text": "11.2. In the event that either Party conveys its interest in the Operating Company to the other or a third party during the five year period commencing on the Effective Date and the Joint Venture continues to operate as a going concern thereafter, each Party will *endeavor* to provide the services described in Article 11.1 to the Joint Venture at a mutually agreeable price. The duration of service provisions will be determined on a case by case basis. The aim will be a transition period of not more than 12 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.1 and 11.1.2 and not more than 18 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.4; provided, however, if T&L shall give notice to Igene that it intends to close the Selby, England facility adjacent to the Site, T&L will try to provide the services set forth in Article 11.1.4. This is for a period *around* 12 months from when Igene gets such notice.",
                "explanation": "This change makes the provision of services and their duration after a conveyance of interest less definite. Replacing 'shall' with 'endeavor' reduces the obligation to provide services. Replacing a price that is 'reasonably consistent with the methodology used for determining prices prior to such conveyance' to 'mutually agreeable' makes the process more open to negotiation. Also the timing is reduced and made more ambiguous. This contradicts the original intent of ensuring a smooth transition and introduces uncertainty about the availability and pricing of services post-conveyance.",

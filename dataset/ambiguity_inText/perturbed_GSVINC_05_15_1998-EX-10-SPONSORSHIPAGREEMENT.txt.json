For the             purposes of this Agreement, a \"competitive retailer\" means an             on-line department store comparable to Bloomingdale's, Macy's,             Burdine's, Shopping.com, Chef's Catalog or iQVC.",

For the purposes of this Agreement, a \"competitive retailer\" means any online retailer, irrespective of their business model or product offerings.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'competitive retailer' is specific to online department stores. The modified definition broadens it to include any online retailer. This creates ambiguity because it's unclear whether Excite's obligation extends to all online retailers or just those similar to department stores. This contradiction introduces uncertainty in enforcement, as it's now subject to interpretation, making it unclear who Excite considers a 'competitive retailer'.",

Regardless of Excite's actual delivery of impressions and clickthroughs, the term of this Agreement will not be shorter than two (2) years after the display of the first of Client's advertising banners and promotional placements, subject to the termination rights set forth below.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines the term based on impressions, clicks and the minimum term length. The modified version says it is purely based on the term length. This is a contradiction.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction in the definition of 'Territory.' Initially, it refers to Schedule VII. However, it then introduces an exclusion of South American countries after a specific date. This raises questions about which geographical areas are included and when, especially in relation to ongoing obligations or rights linked to the Territory.",

EKR shall, as determined in its sole discretion to be commercially reasonable, prepare studies of the markets and sales potential of the Products for countries in the Territory other than the United States and present such studies to the Committee. EKR  shall at its own cost and expense use commercially reasonable efforts to take those steps reasonably necessary in order to obtain and  thereafter maintain Marketing Authorizations (including pricing and reimbursement approvals) for the Product in those countries of the  Territory other than the United States which the Committee determines to present commercially viable opportunities for the Product. EKR  shall provide PPI with a copy of any original certificates of approval/registration in each country in the Territory other than the United  States. EKR shall provide PPI with a copy of any other registration matters received from the appropriate Regulatory Authorities  concerning maintenance, renewal or variations to the original certificates of approval/registration in each country in the Territory. Except as  provided in Section 3.17, EKR shall be solely responsible for, and shall bear all costs associated with, all regulatory activities related to the  development and approval of the Product in the countries of the Territory (including, after the Agreement Date, the United States) and shall  own the Marketing Authorizations for the Product in each other country of the Territory.

EKR shall, as determined in its sole discretion to be commercially reasonable, prepare studies of the markets and sales potential of the Products for countries in the Territory other than the United States and present such studies to the Committee.

The modified section then states that EKR has 'no obligation' and that PPI holds ultimate responsibility for compliance, contradicting the previous requirement and creating confusion about which party is ultimately responsible for securing and maintaining these authorizations.",

The modified definition directly contrasts this by stating EKR has full rights, title and interests to the same, making the contract ambiguous in how it deals with the IP and Trademarks.",

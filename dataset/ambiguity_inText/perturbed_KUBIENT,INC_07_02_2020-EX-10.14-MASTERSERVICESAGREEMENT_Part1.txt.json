Neither Party may terminate this Agreement during the Initial Term except as set forth in paragraph 4(b) or any Exhibit. Either Party may terminate this Agreement for any reason following the Initial Term upon ninety (90) days written notice to the other Party. Except for termination for material breach as detailed in paragraph 4(b), Kubient shall be entitled to all fees generated during the termination period regardless of which Party terminates the Agreement, (b) Either Party may terminate this Agreement if the other Party commits a material breach of the Agreement and upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other Party, such other Party hasn't cured the breach within such thirty (30) days. Either Party may terminate the Agreement immediately if the other party (i) becomes insolvent or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (ii) suffers or permits the appointment of a conservator or receiver for its business or assets or any similar action by a governmental entity for the purpose of assuming operation or control of the Party due to the financial condition of the Party; (iii) becomes subject to any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law whether domestic or foreign and such proceeding or action has not been dismissed within a sixty (60) period; or (iv) has wound up or liquidated its business, voluntarily or otherwise.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'thirty (30) days' to 'sixty (60) days' notice to cure a material breach creates a contradiction. Subsection (b) now states two different cure periods within the same paragraph, leading to uncertainty about the actual required notice period for curing a breach.",

                "explanation": "The payment term from 'seven (7) days' to 'thirty (30) days' contradicts with the phrase 'as set forth and detailed in each applicable Exhibit.' Thus, if an exhibit states something different than 30 days, there exists a contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'one (1) year' to 'five (5) years' for the confidentiality period contradicts with the definition of confidential information. This creates ambiguity regarding how long each party must protect confidential information received from the other party.",

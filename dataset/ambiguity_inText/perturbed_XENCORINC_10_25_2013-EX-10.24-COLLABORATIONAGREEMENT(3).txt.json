                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity to the definition of FTE by stating that the effort level is to be determined at BII's discretion. This contradicts the original definition, which implies a consistent effort level based on 'normal business and scientific practice,' leading to potential disputes over the amount of effort BII is required to contribute.",

                "explanation": "This change alters the ‘Due Date’ by extending the timeframe for accruing interest on unpaid project fees from five to ten years after the Effective Date. This directly conflicts with the initial definition of the ‘Due Date,’ creating a financial ambiguity regarding when interest payments begin, potentially causing legal disputes over the amount owed.",

                "explanation": "The term in 8.2.5.a,  ‘irrevocable’ is perturbed and changed to ‘revocable.’ This now means XENCOR can revoke BII's license under XENCOR Intellectual Property, which creates ambiguity and potential disputes about the certainty of BII's freedom to operate. The original text made the license perpetual and sublicensable, but now XENCOR's rights to revoke create an in-text contradiction about BII's certainty to operate.",

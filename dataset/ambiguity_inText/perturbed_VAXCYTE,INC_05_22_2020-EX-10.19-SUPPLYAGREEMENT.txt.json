Fully Burdened Manufacturing Costs shall not include any [***] and shall be calculated in accordance with the foregoing, GAAP and Sutro's policies and procedures for its other products, in each case consistently applied (and such plant operations and support services costs shall be allocated consistent with GAAP and other products of Sutro in that facility).",

                "explanation": "The original definition refers to costs defined in [***], implying specific, agreed-upon cost categories. The modified definition replaces these with broad categories like 'direct material costs' and 'direct labor costs.' If [***] contains different cost inclusions or exclusions, the two definitions conflict, leading to pricing disputes.",

If SutroVax determines that the Product(s) do not conform to the Required Standards, it hall notify Sutro within the Acceptance Period, and, if requested by Sutro, SutroVax shall ship a sample of such non-conforming Product(s) to Sutro at Sutro's expense. SutroVax's failure to notify Sutro of the non-conformity within the Acceptance Period will be deemed for purposes of this Supply Agreement to constitute SutroVax's acceptance of such shipment, provided, however, that such acceptance shall be subject to SutroVax's right to reject Product(s) until [***] days from the delivery date of the applicable Product, in each case, due to discovery by SutroVax or SutroVax's Affiliates or designees that the applicable Product does not conform to the Required Standards and such non-conformance could not reasonably be discovered within the Acceptance Period (\"Latent Defects\") provided that SutroVax gives Sutro with written notice of such Latent Defect within [***] days of SutroVax or any SutroVax Affiliate or designee becoming aware of such defect.",

                "explanation": "The original text creates conflicting timelines for rejection. Initially, failure to notify within the 'Acceptance Period' constitutes acceptance, limiting rejection to [***] days for latent defects. The modified text removes this time limit and states that such acceptance shall not be subject to SutroVaxâ€™s right to reject at any time, introducing ambiguity in defining acceptance and allowing for indefinite rejection claims due to latent defects. This inconsistency creates legal uncertainty on acceptance duration and rejection conditions.",

The changed text includes those same items, meaning they now must adhere to cGMP.

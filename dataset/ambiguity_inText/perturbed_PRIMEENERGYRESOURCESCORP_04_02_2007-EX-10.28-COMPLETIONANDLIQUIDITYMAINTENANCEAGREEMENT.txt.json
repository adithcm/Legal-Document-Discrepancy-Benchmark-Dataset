For the purposes of this agreement, the North Padre Island Area OCS Block 998 shall be considered an \"Exploratory Block\" and is subject to different completion requirements as outlined in Section 1B.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity because Section 1 initially defines all listed blocks as \"Project Fields.\" However, the modified text reclassifies North Padre Island Area OCS Block 998 as an \"Exploratory Block,\" subjecting it to potentially different requirements under Section 1B. This creates a contradiction as to whether Block 998 should adhere to the completion requirements of a \"Project Field\" or an \"Exploratory Block.\"",

                "changed_text": "Prime will, during the term of the Credit Agreement, maintain liquidity consisting of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $25,000,000.  However, for the first six months of this agreement, the required liquidity can be satisfied by providing a letter of credit of equivalent value. This required liquidity will reduce dollar-for-dollar with any additional shareholder advances, but will not increase with any repayment of shareholder advances.",
                "explanation": "This modification presents two conflicting definitions. Firstly, it states liquidity must consist of unrestricted cash but then allows a letter of credit as an alternative for the first six months. Secondly, it eliminates the increase in required liquidity with any repayment of shareholder advances, contradicting the original agreement which allowed the liquidity requirement to increase with shareholder repayments. This creates ambiguity regarding how liquidity should be maintained throughout the term of the agreement.",

Prime's obligation to fund any cost for Project Completion under any circumstances lasts for one year. After the one-year anniversary, the obligation applies only if project milestones are met.",
                "explanation": "This alteration introduces a conflicting definition for the agreement's duration and Prime's funding obligation. The original text ties the agreement's duration to the satisfaction of project completion, whereas the modified version introduces a fixed five-year term. Also, the original has the obligation related to when a component of the project is complete. The modified version limits it to 1 year. This creates uncertainty about when the agreement terminates and when Prime's financial obligations cease.",

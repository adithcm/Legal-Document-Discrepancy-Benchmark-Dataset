                "original_text": "1. DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION 1.1 In this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires the following words shall have the following meaning: \"AFFILIATES\" means any company, corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with XFN;",

DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION 1.1 In this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires the following words shall have the following meaning: \"AFFILIATES\" means any company, corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity that directly controls XFN;",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Affiliates' is narrowed in Section 1.1 to only include entities that *directly* control XFN, creating a contradiction with other sections where 'Affiliates' might be interpreted more broadly (indirect control). This can impact the scope of rights granted to affiliates throughout the agreement.",

TERMINATION 8.1 XFN may terminate this Agreement by giving thirty (30) days written notice to the CEIS. 8.2 Either Party may terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other Party commits a material breach of this Agreement which is not capable of being remedied; (b) if the other Party commits a material breach of this Agreement which is capable of being remedied but not remedied within thirty (30) days upon receiving written notice from the non-breaching party requiring remedy; and (c) if the other Party becomes insolvent or bankrupt.",

TERMINATION 8.1 XFN may terminate this Agreement by giving thirty (30) days written notice to the CEIS. 8.2 Either Party may terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other Party commits a material breach of this Agreement; (b) if the other Party commits a breach of this Agreement but not remedied within thirty (30) days upon receiving written notice from the non-breaching party requiring remedy; and (c) if the other Party becomes insolvent or bankrupt.",
                "explanation": "The modification in Section 8.2 (a) removes the clause: 'which is not capable of being remedied' and in (b) the word material is removed. By removing the word 'material', this introduces a contradiction to Section 8.2(a).  This creates ambiguity around what breaches allow termination. Now, there is a contradiction between remediable and irremediable breaches.",

CONSIDERATION 4.1 In consideration of the rights and obligations of the Parties, XFN shall pay to CEIS US$1.1 million (United States Dollars One Million and One Source: XINHUA SPORTS & ENTERTAINMENT LTD, F-1, 2/21/2007 Hundred Thousand) for a term of twenty (20) years, in cash or such other consideration as the Parties may agree. The payment schedule shall be by five (5) instalments of US$220,000 each. The first instalment will be effect on condition that XFN can raise at least US$1.1 million additional funding in 2002.",

The payment schedule shall be by five (5) instalments of US$220,000 each. The first instalment will be effect immediately.",
                "explanation": "By modifying Section 4.1 to state 'in cash' and removing 'or such other consideration as the Parties may agree', while removing the condition of raising the first installment, it now contradicts any potential agreement made later that might specify a different form of payment. This creates an ambiguity if another section refers to payment methods.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting responsibilities regarding the accuracy of information. Originally, each party was only responsible for their own information, but now they are responsible for everyone else's as well. This contradicts the original statement and creates uncertainty about the scope of each party's liability.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradiction regarding the effect of revocation. The original agreement states that revocation only affects the revoking party, while the modified agreement states that revocation by one party terminates the entire agreement. This introduces ambiguity about the consequences of a party choosing to revoke.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, however each counterpart is considered a separate agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the unified nature of the agreement. The original states all counterparts form a single agreement, while the modified version suggests each counterpart is its own, independent agreement. This introduces potential issues if the counterparts are not identical or if different legal interpretations apply to different parties.",

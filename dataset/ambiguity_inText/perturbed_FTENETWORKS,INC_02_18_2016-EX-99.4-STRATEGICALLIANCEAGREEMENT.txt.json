                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Subcontractor shall be permitted to subcontract any part of the Work without the prior written notification and consent of EDGE. However, Subcontractor will follow subcontracting requirements and processes of EDGE and provide joint access to subcontractor database and information concerning quality control. All Work performed by a Lower-tier Subcontractor shall be deemed Work performed by Subcontractor. Subcontractor agrees not to hire any Lower-tier Subcontractor to whose employment EDGE reasonably objects.",
                "changed_text": "Subcontractor shall be permitted to subcontract any part of the Work without the prior written notification and consent of EDGE. However, Subcontractor must obtain EDGE's prior written consent before subcontracting any Work exceeding $10,000. All Work performed by a Lower-tier Subcontractor shall be deemed Work performed by Subcontractor. Subcontractor agrees not to hire any Lower-tier Subcontractor to whose employment EDGE reasonably objects.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflicting condition for subcontracting. The original text allows subcontracting without prior consent, but the modified text imposes a requirement for prior written consent for subcontracts exceeding $10,000. This creates uncertainty about when consent is needed, leading to potential disputes.",

                "changed_text": "Subcontractor warrants to EDGE that the Work will be performed with promptness and diligence and shall be executed in a quality manner consistent with workmanship standards in the particular trades involved. However, Subcontractor's liability for workmanship defects is limited to the cost of materials, not including labor or consequential damages.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a limitation to the warranty, creating a contradiction. The original warranty implies full liability for defective workmanship, but the added clause restricts this liability. This could lead to disputes over the extent of Subcontractor's warranty obligations.",
                "location": "Section 17.A"

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "EDGE may, upon reasonable request, require Subcontractor to replace any personnel, including a project manager, deployed by Subcontractor under the terms of this Agreement. Subcontractor will replace any personnel promptly after request from EDGE with an employee of Subcontractor reasonably acceptable to EDGE.",
                "changed_text": "EDGE may, upon reasonable request, require Subcontractor to replace any personnel, including a project manager, deployed by Subcontractor under the terms of this Agreement. Subcontractor will use commercially reasonable efforts to replace any personnel after request from EDGE with an employee of Subcontractor reasonably acceptable to EDGE, provided that such replacement is subject to availability of qualified personnel and EDGE pays Subcontractor a recruiting fee of $5,000 per replacement.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original clause's mandatory replacement obligation by adding 'commercially reasonable efforts' and a recruiting fee contingency. Now, EDGE's ability to require replacements is no longer guaranteed and depends on Subcontractor's resource constraints and EDGE's willingness to pay. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes about the conditions under which personnel replacements are truly required.",

For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (a) ownership of fifty percent (50%) (or such lesser percentage which is the maximum allowed to be owned by a foreign entity or investor in a particular jurisdiction) or more of the outstanding voting stock or other ownership interest of an entity, or (b) possession of the power to (i) elect, appoint, direct or remove fifty percent (50%) or more of the members of the board of directors or other governing body of an entity or (ii) otherwise direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of an entity by contract or otherwise.",

For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (a) ownership of fifty percent (50%) (or such lesser percentage which is the maximum allowed to be owned by a foreign entity or investor in a particular jurisdiction) or more of the outstanding voting stock or other ownership interest of an entity, or (b) significant influence over the management and policies of an entity, irrespective of the percentage of voting stock or ownership interest held.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies control as requiring 50% ownership or the power to direct 50% of the board. The modified definition broadens control to include 'significant influence,' regardless of ownership percentage. This creates ambiguity as to what constitutes 'control' and therefore who is an 'Affiliate,' affecting obligations and rights throughout the agreement.",

Within one year following completion of all activities under the Research Plan (the \"Selection Deadline\"), Anixa, in good faith consultation with OntoChem, will have the right to select up to two hundred (200) Hit Compounds (each, a \"Selected Hit Compound\"), by providing OntoChem with written notice of such Selected Hit Compound(s) (the \"Selection Notice\"), and each Selected Hit Compound, along with all Variants of such Selected Hit Compound referenced in the Selection Notice, is hereby designated as a \"Lead Scaffold\" under this Agreement. Commencing upon selection of a Selected Hit Compound, Anixa (itself and through its Affiliates and designees) will have sole authority over and control of the further development, manufacture, and commercialization of the corresponding Lead Scaffold and any product candidate or product incorporating a compound from such Lead Scaffold. Following the Selection Deadline, Anixa will have no further rights with respect to any Hit Compound that is not a Selected Hit Compound or included within a Lead Scaffold (each, a \"Rejected Hit Compound\"), provided that, during the period of two (2) years following the Selection Deadline, neither OntoChem nor any of its Affiliates will use or disclose to any third party any Rejected Hit Compound or any Variant thereof, including the identity, structure or SAR information of any such compound, for application as anti-viral agents or protease inhibitors, for purposes of modulating any Target or for treatment of virus-related conditions. In case OntoChem finds a novel and unexpected antiviral use of those Rejected Hit Compounds during this 2-years period, it will notify Anixa about these findings and Anixa has the right of first negotiation during a period of 6 months after this notification. If Anixa decides to not license those uses or compounds for this novel antiviral use, OntoChem is free to develop those molecules further as its own intellectual property without any further restrictions.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'good faith consultation', 'is hereby designated', and restricts the use of rejected compounds by OntoChem for two years. The modified version changes 'good faith consultation' to 'after consultation', 'is hereby designated' to 'may be designated', and removes the restriction, allowing OntoChem to use Rejected Hit Compounds without any restriction.

Also it mandates a specific timeframe for inspection, and if Anixa has overpaid Ontochem will reimburse Anixa for the overpayment. The modified version limits access to require a court order, a shorter inspection timeframe, and gives OntoChem discretion over reimbursement. This undermines Anixa's ability to verify expenses and ensure financial accountability.",

Reseller must ensure that Sub-Reseller complies with the terms of the Agreement applicable to Reseller as if Sub- Reseller were an original party to the Agreement and any breach by Sub-Reseller of the Agreement will be deemed a breach by Reseller. Sub-Reseller is not be a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement.",

Reseller must ensure that Sub-Reseller complies with some of the terms of the Agreement applicable to Reseller, but it is not required to adhere to all sections as if Sub- Reseller were an original party to the Agreement and any breach by Sub-Reseller of the Agreement will be deemed a breach by the Sub-Reseller itself. Sub-Reseller is a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text restricts Sub-Reseller's resale to 'Customer' only. The modified version allows resale to 'Customer or any other reseller,' creating a contradiction. Also, the initial agreement holds the Reseller responsible for breaches of contract by the Sub-Reseller, and the changed agreement makes the Sub-Reseller responsible for its own breaches of contract. Initially, Sub-Reseller is not a third-party beneficiary, and the changed agreement, says that it is a third-party beneficiary.",

The modified version states it is a 'partial agreement' and does not supersede prior agreements, introducing a direct contradiction. If there are disputes, it is unclear which agreement is the source of truth.",

Affiliate shall mean, when used with reference to a party, any individual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means the direct or indirect ownership of at least 50% of the outstanding voting securities of a party, or the right to control the policy decisions of such party.",

Affiliate shall mean, when used with reference to a party, any individual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means the direct or indirect ownership of at least 25% of the outstanding voting securities of a party, or the right to control the policy decisions of such party.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'control' within the definition of 'Affiliate' is changed from 50% to 25%. This creates a contradiction, as one section of the contract may rely on the 50% threshold while another relies on the 25% threshold, leading to disputes over which entities qualify as affiliates and are therefore subject to certain contractual obligations.",

                "explanation": "The 'assignment' clause initially states that consent is not required for transfer to an affiliate but now it states that a concent is required. This directly contradicts the original exception, causing confusion about whether internal restructuring or M&A activities trigger the consent requirement and significantly impacts the parties' operational flexibility.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party in the event any material breach of a material term of this Agreement by such other party that remains uncured 15 days in the case of a breach of a payment obligation, or 60 days for all other breaches, after notice of such breach was received by such other party; provided, however that if such breach is not reasonably capable of cure within the applicable cure period, the breaching party shall have an additional 90 days to cure such breach so long as the cure is commenced within the applicable cure period and thereafter is diligently prosecuted to completion as soon as possible.",
                "explanation": "The cure periods for 'Termination for Cause' has now been changed from 30 to 15 days in case of payment and 45 to 60 days in other cases. The additional cure periods for breaches not reasonably capable of cure has also been changed from 180 to 90 days. This contradiction in cure periods can give rise to dispute for what the valid cure period is. This would potentially give rise to many disputes between the parties.",

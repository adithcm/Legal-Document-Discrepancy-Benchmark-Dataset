The Reseller shall have a right of first refusal to include within this Agreement any additional products developed, manufactured, or sold by the Company following the Effective Date that are not currently included in Exhibit A, and upon the exercise of such right, the term \"Products\" shall be expanded to mean such additional products as well. For purposes of clarity, the parties agree that upon Todos's development of a blood screening test for colon cancer, such product shall be added to this Agreement and included within the definition of \"Products\", subject to the Reseller and Todos agreeing on the commercial terms for such product, including the price.",

For purposes of clarity, the parties agree that upon Todos's development of a blood screening test for colon cancer, such product shall be added to this Agreement only upon mutual written consent and agreement on commercial terms, and will not automatically be included within the definition of \"Products.\"",
                "explanation": "The original text grants an 'exclusive' right, whereas the modified text omits this, suggesting a non-exclusive arrangement. Additionally, the original text states that the colon cancer screening test 'shall be added' to the definition of product, the changed text makes it conditional on 'mutual written consent' This creates a contradiction if later sections rely on the reseller having exclusive rights or that the colon cancer screening test is included as product.",

Todos shall ship ordered Products to the Reseller within ninety (90) days of Todos's acceptance of the applicable purchase order DAP Reseller's warehouse (Incoterms 2010), provided that Reseller's order for the Products does not deviate from the applicable Forecast by more than ten percent (10%).",
                "changed_text": "5.5 Delivery. Todos shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ship ordered Products to the Reseller within one hundred and twenty (120) days of Todos's acceptance of the applicable purchase order DAP Reseller's warehouse (Incoterms 2010), provided that Reseller's order for the Products does not deviate from the applicable Forecast by more than twenty percent (20%). In extenuating circumstances, delivery may be delayed by up to an additional thirty (30) days with notification to the Reseller.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates shipping within 90 days, while the modified text introduces 'commercially reasonable efforts' and extends the timeframe to 120 days. Deviation percentage is also increased to 20% from 10%. An additional 30-day delay with notification is also added. The contradiction arises because other sections may assume a firm 90-day delivery, creating uncertainty about contractual obligations if Todos delays delivery.",

Such report is optional and for informational purposes only.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Reseller 'shall provide' a report within 15 days, while the modified text changes this to 'may provide' within 30 days. Also, 'estimated quantities' and 'average prices' are used. Making report optional creates contradiction if other sections depend on the information within quarterly reports (ie. milestones).",

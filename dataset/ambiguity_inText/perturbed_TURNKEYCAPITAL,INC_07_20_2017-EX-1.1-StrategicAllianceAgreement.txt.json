                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement is twenty-four (24) months. The Agreement may be renewed, subject to mutual written approval.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is twenty-four (24) months. The Agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement 'may be renewed' with mutual approval, suggesting renewal is not automatic. The changed text introduces an automatic renewal clause unless actively terminated, contradicting the initial implication that renewal requires explicit agreement. This creates ambiguity as to the actual term length and renewal process.",

The utilization of this subsidiary will provide for separate record keeping, reporting and tracking of all business related to this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "TKCI shall establish a subsidiary (the \"Holding Company\") for conducting and developing business related to this alliance. While TKCI intends to maintain control of the Holding Company, the ownership structure and operational control are subject to further negotiation and may involve external investors. The utilization of this subsidiary will provide for separate record keeping, reporting and tracking of all business related to this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the subsidiary is 'wholly-owned' with the 'sole purpose' of the alliance. The modified text removes the 'wholly-owned' aspect and indicates potential external investors and further negotiation of operational control, contradicting the original clear statement of complete TKCI ownership and dedicated purpose. This creates uncertainty about TKCI's actual control and the long-term structure of the Holding Company.",

                "changed_text": "Net revenue from business operations created by Holding Company for the alliance will be distributed by Holding Company according to a revenue sharing agreement to be determined based on contributions to the alliance, with the intent of a roughly equal distribution between TKCI and SIC:",
                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates a fixed 50/50 revenue split. The altered version introduces a 'revenue sharing agreement to be determined,' dependent on contributions, while only maintaining an 'intent' of roughly equal distribution. This directly contradicts the initial fixed allocation and creates ambiguity about how revenue will be divided, potentially leading to disputes over perceived contributions and fair shares.",

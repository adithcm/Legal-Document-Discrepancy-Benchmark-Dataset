(a) Member specifically acknowledges that, pursuant to the Franchise Agreement, and by virtue of its position with Franchisee, Member will receive valuable specialized training and Confidential Information, including, without limitation, information regarding the operational, sales, promotional, and marketing methods and techniques of Franchisor and the System. (b) Member covenants and agrees that during the term of the Franchise Agreement, except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor, Member shall not, either directly or indirectly, for itself, or through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, persons, partnership, corporation, or entity: (i) Own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, rent or lease to, or have any other interest in business that (directly or indirectly) operates, or grants franchises or licenses to operate, a restaurant featuring pizza and related food specialties or that offers products or services substantially similar to those then offered by Pizza Fusions Restaurants (\"Competitive Business\");",

(a) Member acknowledges that, pursuant to the Franchise Agreement, and by virtue of its position with Franchisee, Member *might* receive training and Confidential Information, possibly including information regarding the operational, sales, promotional, and marketing methods and techniques of Franchisor and the System. (b) Member covenants and agrees that during the term of the Franchise Agreement, except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor, Member shall not, either directly or indirectly, for itself *if such actions are deemed deliberately harmful to the Franchise*, or through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, persons, partnership, corporation, or entity: (i) Own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, rent or lease to, or have any other interest in business that (directly or indirectly) operates, or grants franchises or licenses to operate, a restaurant featuring pizza and related food specialties or that offers products or services substantially similar to those then offered by Pizza Fusions Restaurants (\"Competitive Business\");",
                "explanation": "The original text states the Member *will* receive training and confidential information. The modified text changes this to 'might' receive, creating uncertainty about the basis for the non-compete clause. Further, it limits the non-compete to instances of 'deliberately harmful' actions, contrasting with the strict prohibition in the original text. This introduces ambiguity regarding the scope and enforceability of the non-compete agreement, creating potential for dispute.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces exceptions to the definition of 'Post-Term Period,' creating uncertainty about its duration and applicability. The original text defines it as a fixed two-year period, whereas the modified text allows for variations based on Franchisor's written agreement or in cases of franchisee misconduct. This creates a contradiction by making the Post-Term Period conditional rather than absolute, affecting the enforceability of non-compete obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Franchisor is a third-party beneficiary. The modified text weakens this by stating that the Franchisor 'may be considered' a third-party beneficiary 'under certain circumstances.' The added sentence regarding 'further clarification' and 'mutual agreement' introduces further ambiguity and contradicts the original firm statement of beneficiary status, thus undermining the Franchisor's explicit enforcement rights.",

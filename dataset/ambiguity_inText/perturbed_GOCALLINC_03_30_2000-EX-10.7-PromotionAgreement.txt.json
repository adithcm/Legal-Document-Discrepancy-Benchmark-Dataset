The modified text removes this condition and grants PageMaster Corporation complete and unconditional discretion over the extension, which potentially contradicts the originally agreed-upon conditions for the term extension, creating uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text makes PageMaster Corporation solely responsible for fulfillment despite the airtime provider's involvement.

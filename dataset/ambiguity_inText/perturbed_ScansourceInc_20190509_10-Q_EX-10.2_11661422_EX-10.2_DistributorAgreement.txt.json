                "original_text": "3. Product Allocation. If for any reason, Xplore's production is not on schedule, Xplore may, at its sole and absolute discretion, allocate available inventory to Distributor and make shipments in accordance with Zebra's then current processes.",
                "changed_text": "3. Product Allocation. If for any reason, Xplore's production is not on schedule, Xplore shall allocate available inventory fairly among all distributors, including ScanSource, considering historical sales data and market demand. Specific allocation percentages will be determined quarterly and communicated to ScanSource in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives Xplore 'sole and absolute discretion' in product allocation, implying no specific obligation to ScanSource. The changed text mandates a 'fair' allocation based on defined criteria, creating a contradiction regarding Xplore's freedom in allocation decisions. It is unclear what happens when these two definitions come into conflict.",

                "original_text": "4. Stock on Hand. Distributor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain thirty (30) days of stock in Distributor's inventory to support sales. Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor's inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties.",
                "changed_text": "4. Stock on Hand. Distributor is expected to maintain thirty (30) days of stock in Distributor's inventory to support sales. Under no circumstances should the Distributor's stock fall below the thirty (30) day goal. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for any amount of time, Xplore will, without notice, replenish the stock to an amount sufficient to meet the thirty (30) day goal, with the Distributor responsible for all costs associated with the immediate replenishment.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires 'commercially reasonable efforts' and allows for deviations, with a replenishment process after 60 days of being below target. The modified version eliminates the 'commercially reasonable efforts' clause, stating 'under no circumstances' and stipulates that the distributor is responsible for all costs if the inventory falls below the 30-day goal, which is a contradiction.",

                "original_text": "Each purchase order placed by Distributor, as well as each invoice sent by Xplore, shall be governed by the terms of this Addendum and the Distribution Agreement and any additional or different terms within the purchase order or invoice shall have no effect.",
                "changed_text": "Each purchase order placed by Distributor, as well as each invoice sent by Xplore, may include additional terms and conditions that shall be binding upon both parties unless explicitly rejected in writing within five (5) business days of receipt. The Distribution Agreement serves as the primary reference but will be superseded by newly agreed terms.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that additional terms in purchase orders or invoices have no effect, ensuring the Addendum and Distribution Agreement govern. The modified text allows additional terms to become binding unless rejected, contradicting the original and creating uncertainty about which terms prevail.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an inconsistency in the definition of 'Business Day'. The original text specifies opening at 8:00 a.m. and closing at 5:00 p.m., while the modified text specifies opening at 9:00 a.m. and closing at 4:00 p.m. This could lead to disputes regarding deadlines or obligations that depend on the definition of a Business Day.",

VERTEX and Bunker One will act cooperatively in a commercially reasonable manner, to maximize profits and minimize losses and comply with all terms and conditions pursuant to the JSMA.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding profit/loss distribution. The original text implies a predetermined distribution mechanism. The modified text gives Bunker One discretion over the distribution, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over fair allocation. There is no clear way to enforce an agreement if one side decides how the revenue stream is dispersed",

                "changed_text": "The parties agree to have any Dispute that is not resolved pursuant to the procedures established in Section 13.3(a) - (c) initially mediated and, failing resolution, litigated in the court as stipulated in Section 13.1. The parties retain their rights to seek remedies through court proceedings, including the right to a jury trial where applicable.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction regarding dispute resolution. The original text mandates arbitration, explicitly waiving the right to a jury trial. The modified text asserts that the parties retain their rights to court proceedings and jury trial, making the method of dispute resolution ambiguous and unenforceable.",

Gregor,  chairman and chief executive officer of United National.  \"During the past year we completed an assessment of our  information  processing  needs going forward into the next  century.  After evaluating a number of different options, we determined that the flexibility and quality of BISYS'  TOTALPLUS (R) system would best serve our needs today and for years to come.\"",

Gregor,  chairman and chief executive officer of United National.  \"During the past year we initiated a preliminary assessment of our  information  processing  needs going forward. While several options were considered, the perceived flexibility of BISYS'  TOTALPLUS (R) system appeared promising for our immediate needs.\"",
                "explanation": "The original text states a completed assessment and a firm determination that BISYS best serves their needs. The modified text changes this to a preliminary assessment and a promising appearance, making the commitment level to BISYS ambiguous. This could lead to disputes if the bank later attempts to exit the agreement early, claiming they hadn't fully committed.",

As a result of its planned move to BISYS,  United  National will be  liquidating  its interest  in United  Financial  Services  during the first half of 1999 after it goes live with BISYS.",
                "changed_text": "United Financial  Services, a third party services provider that United National Bancorp owns with another joint venture  partner,  currently handles the Bank's information  processing  services,  item processing and deposit  services.  As a result of its potential move to BISYS,  United  National intends to explore the possibility of liquidating  its interest  in United  Financial  Services, potentially during the first half of 1999, depending on the successful integration with BISYS.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the liquidation of United Financial Services. The modified text introduces uncertainty using phrases like 'potential move', 'intends to explore the possibility', and 'potentially during', making the liquidation non-committal and contingent. This contradicts the original certainty and creates potential for disagreement regarding the timing and execution of the liquidation.",

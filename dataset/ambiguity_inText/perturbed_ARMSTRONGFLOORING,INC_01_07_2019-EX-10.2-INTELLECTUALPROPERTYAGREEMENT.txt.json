                "original_text": "Arizona hereby grants to the Company a limited, non- exclusive, royalty-free, non-sublicensable (except as set forth in Section 7.1), non-assignable license in, to and under the Arizona Licensed Trademarks for the Arizona Trademark License Term for use in the Company Field throughout the world only in the form and manner that such Arizona Licensed Trademarks are used in the Business as of the Closing, provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to present the Arizona Licensed Trademarks in the form set forth on Schedule 6.1.",
                "changed_text": "Arizona hereby grants to the Company a limited, non- exclusive, royalty-free, non-sublicensable (except as set forth in Section 7.1), non-assignable license in, to and under the Arizona Licensed Trademarks for the Arizona Trademark License Term for use in the Company Field throughout the world, irrespective of the form and manner that such Arizona Licensed Trademarks are used in the Business as of the Closing, the Company holds absolute discretion on how to display the Arizona Licensed Trademarks.",
                "explanation": "In Section 6.1, the definition of the Arizona Licensed Trademark license is changed. The original requires use in the form and manner as of the closing date and references Schedule 6.1. The modified version grants the company full discretion on display and waives those limitations. This introduces a contradiction on what usages are allowed. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement.",

This license shall automatically terminate five (5) years from the effective date.",
                "explanation": "In Section 3.1, the term 'perpetual' is removed and replaced by specifying that the license will automatically terminate five years from the effective date, contradicting the original grant of a perpetual license. This leads to ambiguity about the actual duration of the license, affecting long-term planning and use of the copyrights and introduces uncertainty in enforcement.",

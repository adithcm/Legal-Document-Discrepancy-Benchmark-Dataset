                "original_text": "Section 2.2 of the Development Agreement is hereby amended to allow Cargill at its sole discretion to apply [***] during the period of July 5,  2011, through September 30, 2011, to perform the Work Plan in addition to the [***] specified in the unamended Section 2.2. The terms for  compensation and expenses for these additional FTEs will be as provided for the original FTEs in Section 2.2.",
                "changed_text": "Section 2.2 of the Development Agreement is hereby amended to allow Cargill at its sole discretion to apply [***] during the period of July 5, 2011, through September 30, 2011, to perform the Work Plan in addition to the [***] specified in the unamended Section 2.2. The terms for compensation and expenses for these additional FTEs will be determined by mutual agreement between Cargill and BioAmber.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the compensation and expenses for additional FTEs will be as provided for the original FTEs, implying a pre-defined rate. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating the terms will be determined by mutual agreement, creating a contradiction if the original Section 2.2 specifies a fixed rate.",

Additionally, Bioamber shall use  best efforts to scale up the CB1 Strain and fermentation protocols utilizing the CB1 Strain.",
                "changed_text": "Bioamber shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for the use of the CB1 Strain in select countries where Bioamber and/or a Bioamber  licensee are using any strain other than the CB1 strain for the production of succinic acid and/or salts thereof. Additionally, Bioamber shall use reasonable efforts to scale up the CB1 Strain and fermentation protocols utilizing the CB1 Strain.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'best efforts' to 'commercially reasonable efforts' and 'reasonable efforts' introduces conflicting standards of performance. If another section of the agreement defines 'best efforts' as requiring all possible actions, the new wording allows for more lenient interpretations, creating ambiguity.",

                "changed_text": "Nothing in these amendments will reduce Bioamber's obligations to consider replacing MCC-17 and Bioamber's current E. coli strain with CB1 in some of the  existing and future succinic acid production facilities of Bioamber and Bioamber licensees, according to the general intentions of Section 5.9 of the  Commercial License.",
                "explanation": "The original text firmly states that nothing reduces Bioamber's obligations to replace specific strains. The modified text introduces a contradiction by stating that they only need to consider replacing them in *some* facilities and only according to the *general intentions* of a cited section, potentially conflicting with a section that mandated total conversion.",

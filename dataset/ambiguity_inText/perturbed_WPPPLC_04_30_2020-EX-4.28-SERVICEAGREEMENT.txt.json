The Executive is entitled to 25 days' paid holiday in addition to the usual public or bank holidays in England) in every Holiday Year, to be taken at times convenient to the Company. However, the executive is only entitled to use them if the company approved it beforehand.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by restricting when the Executive can take the paid holiday, which goes against the text saying that 'the Executive is entitled to 25 days'.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces an internal contradiction, where the 'appointment may be terminated by either party giving the other at least 12 months' notice' is contradicted by the Company's ability to terminate the contract with immediate effect.

The added clause makes it unclear whether the company truly has ownership. This adds uncertainty regarding the actual ownership and the company's rights.",

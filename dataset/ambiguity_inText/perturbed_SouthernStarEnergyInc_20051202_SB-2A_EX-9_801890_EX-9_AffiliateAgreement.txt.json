                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by weakening the binding nature of the affiliate's obligations. Replacing 'shall' with 'may' and changing responsibility assignments creates uncertainty and contradicts the original intention of a clear, enforceable agreement. The previous version clearly stated that proper link integration was the affiliate's responsibility, and failure resulted in no compensation. The modified version introduces shared responsibility and potential compensation even with non-functional links.",

Affiliate is only eligible to earn the Advertising Cost Compensation on sales occurring during the term of this Agreement and fees earned up to the date termination will remain payable only if the related orders are not cancelled or returned.

(3) element 5 shall record and compute on a monthly basis the amount of said Advertising Cost Compensation for the Affiliate. (4) The computation basis for determining the value of the Advertising Cost Compensation is calculated by the gross sales price (including taxes, shipping and handling, etc.) actually invoiced to the referred end user.

(5) The Advertising Cost Compensation shall not be paid if and insofar as it is determined that the end user will not meet its payment obligations or will meet them only partially, or if for any other reason the invoice to the end user was cancelled (e.g. in cases where a charge back of a credit card charge, a debit advice or other return or refund of the software product occurs). If the Advertising Cost Compensation was previously paid by element 5, it can be offset or invoiced to Affiliate at element 5's own discretion. (6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly insofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not the case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100 EUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the Affiliate's participation in the Program. (7) The payment can be made by wire transfer, Direct Deposit (US only) or check, as chosen by the Affiliate. (8) The invoicing is deemed to be approved if the Affiliate does not object in writing, including a statement of reasons, within four weeks.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'will' to 'may', and other similar changes using words that reduce obligation (might, potentially), the previously definite compensation terms become discretionary. Introducing the possibility of sales 'potentially' attributed and compensation 'potentially' paid creates a direct contradiction with the original intent of a clear, performance-based payment system. Especially contradicting the original text using *cannot* regarding offsetting or invoicing Affiliate.",

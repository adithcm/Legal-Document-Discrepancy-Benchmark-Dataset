Subject to the provisions of subparagraph 2.6(b) below, and if you have substantially complied with all provisions of this Agreement and all other agreements between us, on expiration of the Initial Term, if you refurbish and decorate the Premises, replace fixtures, furnishings, wall decor, furniture, equipment, and signs and otherwise modify the Franchise in compliance with specifications and standards then applicable under new or renewal franchises for The Joint Corp. Location franchises, you will have the right to renew the Franchise for one (1) additional term of ten (10) years (the \"Renewal Term\").",

Subject to the provisions of subparagraph 2.6(b) below, and even if you have not substantially complied with all provisions of this Agreement and all other agreements between us, on expiration of the Initial Term, and if you refurbish and decorate the Premises, replace fixtures, furnishings, wall decor, furniture, equipment, and signs and otherwise modify the Franchise in compliance with specifications and standards then applicable under new or renewal franchises for The Joint Corp. Location franchises, you will have the right to renew the Franchise for one (1) additional term of ten (10) years (the \"Renewal Term\").",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction because section 2.6(a) initially requires substantial compliance for renewal, but the modification eliminates this requirement, potentially conflicting with other clauses requiring adherence to the agreement for continued operation. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, as it's unclear whether compliance is truly needed for renewal.",

You are encouraged, but not required, to follow any suggestions we may provide regarding optimal operating hours.",
                "explanation": "This introduces ambiguity regarding the control over operating hours. The original text gives the franchisor the right to dictate hours, while the modified text gives the franchisee discretion. This directly conflicts with the franchisor's operational control, creating uncertainty about which party decides hours.",

If we establish such prices for any services or products, you agree not to exceed or reduce that price, but will charge the price for the service or product that we establish.",
                "changed_text": "10.10 Pricing.\n\nYou retain full discretion to determine the prices for services and products offered at the Franchise location, taking into consideration your local market and cost structure. While we may provide pricing recommendations from time to time, these are purely advisory and do not constitute mandatory pricing guidelines. Your success depends on your ability to adapt to your local market conditions, and this flexibility extends to pricing decisions.",
                "explanation": "This creates a direct conflict about price control. Initially, the franchisor sets price ranges. The changed text gives complete control to the franchisee, explicitly stating pricing recommendations are advisory only. If another part of the agreement relies on standardized pricing for national promotions, this contradicts that section.",

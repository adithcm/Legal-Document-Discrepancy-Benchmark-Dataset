STAAR may from time to time modify or change the Products on Exhibit A-1 in its sole discretion, and if so, will notify Distributor promptly thereof. In the event that STAAR discontinues a Product, it will provide at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Distributor. Distributor shall not modify, disassemble or reverse engineer any Product, in whole or in part.",

In the event that STAAR discontinues a Product, it is not required to provide any prior written notice to Distributor.

                "explanation": "The original text requires STAAR to notify Distributor promptly if products on Exhibit A-1 are modified, and to give 30 days notice for discontinued products. The modified text removes the notification requirement, creating a contradiction. The Distributor does not know with certainty about current products.",

The Minimum Purchase Quantities for the Contract Year are as set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto. Within ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of each Contract Year, the parties will discuss in good faith and agree on the Minimum Product Quantities for the successive Contract Year; provided, however, that, if the parties fail to reach agreement on or otherwise specify the Minimum Purchase Quantities for the successive Contract Year, the Minimum Product Quantities for such successive Contract Year shall be __________ percent (___%) of the Minimum Purchase Quantities for the existing Contract Year. \"Contract Year\" means for the first Contract Year of the Agreement, the period commencing on the Effective Date hereof and ending one year thereafter and for subsequent Contract Years, the successive twelve (12) month period thereafter. Failure of Distributor to purchase the Minimum Purchase Quantities for any Contract Year, shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text has a clause where if there is a failure to reach agreement, then it shall be based on the prior year. The modified text removes the anchor of the prior year, and the parties negotiate in good faith. This removes an easy metric of the prior year to be the floor, and it gives no other floor.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the term continues 'in perpetuity', while the modified text limits it to 'five years'. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the agreement's duration and enforceability.",

In the mediation process, the Parties will try to resolve their differences voluntarily with the aid of a single, impartial mediator, who shall attempt to facilitate negotiations. The mediator shall be selected by agreement of the Parties. If the Parties cannot otherwise agree on a mediator within five (5) Business Days, a single mediator shall be designated by the ADR Institute of Canada, Inc. or any successor organization (\"ADR\") at the request of a Party. Any mediator so designated must not have a conflict of interest with respect to any Party. The mediation shall be conducted as specified by the mediator and agreed upon by the Parties. The Parties agree to discuss their differences in good faith and to attempt, with the assistance of the mediator, to reach an amicable resolution of the dispute. The mediation shall be treated as a settlement discussion and therefore shall be confidential. The mediator may not testify for either Party in any later proceeding relating to the dispute. No recording or transcript shall be made of the mediation proceedings. Each Party shall bear its own costs and legal fees in the mediation. The Parties shall share the fees and expenses of the mediator equally.",

In the mediation process, the Parties will try to resolve their differences voluntarily with the aid of a single, impartial mediator, who shall attempt to facilitate negotiations. The mediator shall be selected solely by Ehave. The mediation shall be conducted as specified by the mediator and agreed upon by the Parties. The Parties agree to discuss their differences, however, Ehave is not required to make an amicable resolution of the dispute. The mediation shall not be treated as a settlement discussion and therefore shall not be confidential. The mediator may testify for either Party in any later proceeding relating to the dispute. Recordings and transcripts shall be made of the mediation proceedings. Each Party shall bear its own costs and legal fees in the mediation. The Parties shall share the fees and expenses of the mediator equally.",
                "explanation": "The original text ensures both parties have equal say in the mediator selection and emphasizes amicable resolutions and confidentiality. The modified text gives Ehave sole control over the mediator selection, removes the requirement for amicable resolution, and eliminates confidentiality, creating a contradiction in the dispute resolution process.",

For purposes hereof, \"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person or entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' includes entities under indirect control and defines 'control' broadly to include influence via contracts. The modified version restricts the definition to only entities under direct control and defines 'control' as solely ownership of voting securities, creating conflicting interpretations.",

The modified text changes this to 'will endeavor to dedicate,' which introduces ambiguity and makes the dedication of personnel non-binding, creating a conflict if other sections rely on dedicated personnel.",

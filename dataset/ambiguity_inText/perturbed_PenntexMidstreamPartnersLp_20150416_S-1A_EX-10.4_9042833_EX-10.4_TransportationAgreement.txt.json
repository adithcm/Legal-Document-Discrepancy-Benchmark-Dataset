                "original_text": "\"Customer's Firm Service Gas\" shall mean, an amount of Customer Gas equal to 400,000 MMBtu per Day; provided, however, (y) Customer's Firm Service Gas shall be increased by the additional amount of Transportation System capacity provided pursuant to a New Facility, and (z) if any Plant described in clause (iii) of the definition of \"Plants\" exists, Customer's Firm Service Gas shall be increased by the amount of Gas Customer is committed to deliver to such Plant.",
                "changed_text": "\"Customer's Firm Service Gas\" shall mean, an amount of Customer Gas equal to 400,000 MMBtu per Day. Any increase to this amount requires a formal amendment to this agreement, signed by both Transporter and Customer. Under no circumstances shall the Customer's Firm Service Gas exceed 400,000 MMBtu per Day without such a signed amendment.",
                "explanation": "The original definition allows for automatic increases to the Customer's Firm Service Gas based on new facilities. The modified definition strictly limits it to 400,000 MMBtu per Day unless a formal amendment is made. This creates a conflict because other sections may rely on the original definition for determining transportation obligations.",

                "changed_text": "\"Interruptible Service\" shall mean service that Transporter will only interrupt in the event of Force Majeure as defined in Article X. Interruptions due to any other reason will require 30 days notice.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides broad discretion for the Transporter to interrupt service for any reason. The modified definition limits interruptions to Force Majeure events, and requires 30-day notice for all other interruptions. This creates a conflict regarding the Transporter's ability to curtail services.",

This Agreement may not be assigned, disposed of, alienated or otherwise transferred by either Party, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may be withheld for any reason at the sole discretion of the other Party, except as provided below.",
                "explanation": "The original text states consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The modified text allows consent to be withheld for any reason, giving one party much greater power to block assignments. This contradiction could lead to legal disputes regarding permissible assignments.",

If the Agreement expired prior to the Amendment Effective Date, any orders received and Products and Services purchased between the date of expiration and the Amendment Effective Date shall be in all respects deemed made under the Agreement as in effect prior to this Amendment. The parties further agree that if Distributor places Purchase Orders after the expiration of the Agreement, and Cisco accepts such Purchase Orders, then any such Purchase Orders shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Agreement; provided, however that acceptance by Cisco of any Purchase Order placed after the Agreement has expired will not be considered as an extension of the term of the Agreement nor a renewal thereof. Notwithstanding Cisco's right to extend the term of the Agreement, each party acknowledges that the Agreement shall always be interpreted as being limited in duration to a definite term and that the other party has made no commitments whatsoever regarding the renewal of the Agreement beyond those expressly agreed in writing.",

The above-referenced cap shall be determined based on all Product purchases made under this Agreement. The responsibility to manage the Balancing Cap shall rest solely upon Distributor. Distributor shall be entitled to return Product once per quarter, provided such returns do not exceed the Balancing Cap. \"Dead on Arrival\" and Obsolete Products returned pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement shall be excluded from calculation of the Balancing Cap.

                "explanation": "The original text states the Balancing Cap is based on all product purchases, while the new text excludes purchases with promotional discounts.  It also changes responsibility for managing the cap to Cisco, removes the limit of the balancing cap for returns, includes DOA products for calculation of Balancing Cap, and changes the credited amount to current market price, leading to a contradiction with later sections that might depend on the original definition.",

                "explanation": "Originally, compliance with all laws was a strict requirement. Now, it's an effort-based clause ('will endeavor to comply'). Furthermore, distributor is now only responsible for violations if it benefits Cisco, conflicting with the intent of the original strict adherence and potentially creating loopholes in legal compliance if another part of the agreement enforces strict adherance.",

On a monthly basis, Consultant shall submit to Aduro an invoice for the hours worked along with itemized documentation and receipts and other information for pre-approved travel and/or out-of- pocket expenses as Aduro reasonably requests at the time reimbursement is requested. Consultant will not incur any travel and/or other out-of-pocket expenses of more than €5,000 individually or €20,000 in the aggregate without the prior written consent of Aduro.

Aduro shall pay Consultant for the Services at the rate of €500 per hour, unless the project exceeds 40 hours in a given month, in which case the rate is adjusted to €400 per hour for all hours worked that month.

                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting compensation terms. The base rate is defined as €500/hour but introduces a conditional rate of €400/hour for months exceeding 40 hours. Furthermore, the payment timeframe is changed from 30 to 60 days. This contradicts the original definition of payment terms and introduces an ambiguity on the payment schedule and amount.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding intellectual property rights. While the first sentence grants Aduro sole and exclusive ownership, a subsequent sentence states the Consultant retains a non-exclusive license for non-commercial research. This creates an internal contradiction because sole ownership should preclude the Consultant from retaining any rights to the Work Product, leading to disputes about the scope of Aduro's ownership and the Consultant's permitted uses.",

                "explanation": "This introduces exceptions to the nonsolicitation clause. It allows the consultant to respond to job postings and hire former employees who initiate contact after 6 months, directly contradicting the initial prohibition on solicitation. Furthermore, it restricts the conditions under which injunctive relief can be sought (malicious and targeted solicitation), making the enforceability of the original clause ambiguous. This creates conflicting interpretations of the nonsolicitation agreement, creating uncertainty about whether actions are allowed or prohibited.",

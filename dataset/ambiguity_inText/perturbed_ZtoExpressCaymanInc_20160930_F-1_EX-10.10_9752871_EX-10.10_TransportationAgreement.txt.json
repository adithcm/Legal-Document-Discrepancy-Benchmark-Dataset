Unless otherwise approved by Party A, in the event of parcel transfer due to Party B's vehicle delay, Party B shall pay liquidated damages to Party A at the standard rate of RMB500 per trip on the first working day, RMB1,000 per trip on the second working day and RMB2,000 per trip on the third working day (based on the time records on the parcel transfer documents) and such liquidated damages will be deducted from the current month's freight. In the special event of changes to route and time and severe weather (or other force majeure events), Party B shall be in touch with Party A in time and record such special event on the parcel transfer documents with Party A's approval.",

Unless otherwise approved by Party A, in the event of parcel transfer due to Party B's vehicle delay, Party B may be required to pay liquidated damages to Party A at a rate to be determined by Party A based on the severity of the delay. In the special event of changes to route and time and severe weather (or other force majeure events), Party B shall be in touch with Party A in time and shall record such event on the parcel transfer documents.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict compliance and sets fixed liquidated damages for delays. The modified text uses weaker language ('endeavor to comply', 'may be required') and replaces fixed damages with a subjective assessment, creating conflict and uncertainty.",

In addition to vehicle personnel insurance, Party B shall at least purchase injury insurance for two persons with coverage not lower than RMB500,000 per person. Party B shall bear any consequence arising out of the non-compliance of insurance purchase, and Party A shall have no liability.",

Vehicle personnel insurance is recommended. Party B shall bear consequences deemed reasonable by Party A arising out of the non-compliance of insurance purchase, and Party A shall have no liability.",
                "explanation": "The original section mandates specific insurance coverage with clear consequences for non-compliance. The modified version softens the language, making the requirements recommendations rather than obligations, and replaces clear consequences with subjective ones deemed reasonable by Party A. This contradiction creates uncertainty regarding insurance requirements.",

The termination of this Agreement shall not prejudice Party A's right to hold Party B responsible for breach of contract, provided Party A can prove significant damages due to the breach.",
                "explanation": "The original clause gives Party A the right to terminate for *any* breach. The modified clause limits this to *material* breaches. Furthermore, it adds a requirement for Party A to prove significant damages to hold Party B responsible, contradicting the original clause where any breach allows Party A to hold Party B liable. This introduces conflicting interpretations of the termination conditions and liability requirements.",

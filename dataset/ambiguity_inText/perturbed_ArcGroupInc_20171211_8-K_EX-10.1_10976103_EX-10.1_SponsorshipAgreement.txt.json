                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be binding on the parties hereto as of the Execution Date. The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") shall commence as of April 1, 2018 (the \"Effective Date\") and shall expire upon the later of: (a) the conclusion of the 2022/23 NFL season and (b) the last day in February, 2023 (such expiration date, the \"Scheduled Expiration Date\"), unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be binding on the parties hereto as of the Execution Date. The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") shall commence as of April 1, 2018 (the \"Effective Date\") and shall expire upon the conclusion of the 2022/23 NFL season, unless extended by mutual written agreement or sooner terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the Term's expiration based on the *later* of two dates, setting a clear deadline. The modified text removes the 'later of' clause and the specific date in February, implying the term ends strictly with the NFL season *unless* explicitly extended. However, Section 5 later references the original Expiration Date as defined. This creates a contradiction: does the agreement end definitively after the 2022/23 season (as potentially implied by the revised Section 1), or can it extend to February 2023 (as referred to in Section 5 which is unedited)? This makes the actual end date of the contract uncertain and potentially leads to disputes.",

                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) installments, with the amount and due date of each installment to be determined by Club and communicated to Sponsor at least 30 days prior to the start of each Contract Year. Installment amounts may vary based on Club's assessment of marketing performance.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement specifies fixed payment amounts and due dates. The modified version introduces variability and uncertainty. It states the installments will be determined each year by the Club, and the Club can set the amount. Since Section 3(a) previously stated the exact Annual Fee amount, this presents a direct contradiction: Is the amount fixed, or subject to the Club's discretion based on 'marketing performance'? This ambiguity will create disputes regarding Sponsor's payment obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies the ticket location, lending a degree of certainty to the benefit. The modified text eliminates the guaranteed location and instead makes the tickets' location and number entirely subject to the Club's discretion. This directly contradicts the earlier specification and significantly weakens Sponsor's guaranteed benefits. Sponsor may have relied upon those specific tickets for clients, etc. Now, the tickets are not guaranteed in any shape or form.",

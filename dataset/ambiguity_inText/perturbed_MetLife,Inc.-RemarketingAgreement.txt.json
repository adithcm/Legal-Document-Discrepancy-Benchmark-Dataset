                "changed_text": "The Remarketing Agents agree (i) to use commercially reasonable efforts to remarket the Remarketed Securities tendered or deemed tendered to the Remarketing Agents in the Remarketing, but are not obligated to sell any securities if market conditions are unfavorable. (ii) to establish the Reset Rates in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures and to notify the Company, the Trustee and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent promptly of the Reset Rates and (iii) to carry out such other duties as are assigned to the Remarketing Agents in the Remarketing Procedures, all in accordance with the provisions of the Remarketing Procedures.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by shifting the discretion to enable the remarketing of the securities from the 'sole reasonable discretion of the Remarketing Agents' to the 'reasonable discretion of the Company.'

                "explanation": "This change weakens the notification obligation related to potential downgradings. The first sentence requires prompt notification of *any* downgrading notice. The second sentence, however, only requires commercially reasonable efforts for *intended or potential* downgradings or reviews, creating a loophole and contradiction regarding the notification requirements.",

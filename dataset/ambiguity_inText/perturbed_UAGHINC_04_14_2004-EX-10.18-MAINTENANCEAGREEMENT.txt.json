                "changed_text": "1.3 Termination of Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may terminate this Agreement with cause and upon material breach, effective immediately, or without cause by providing one hundred eighty (180) days written notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "This introduces two conflicting methods for termination: immediate termination 'with cause' vs. 180 days' notice 'without cause'. The 'with cause' provision creates uncertainty regarding what constitutes 'cause' and what process must be followed, contrasting with the clear 180-day notice period. This also conflicts with section 5.1 which excuses non-performance due to reasons outside the Provider's control. Does that constitute cause?",

The Provider guarantees the Services and Repairs will be performed to the highest industry standards and in a professional and workmanlike manner.",
                "explanation": "The original states 'commercially reasonable efforts,' which is a subjective standard. The changed text also states the Provider 'guarantees' the services will be performed to 'the highest industry standards.' This creates a contradiction; 'commercially reasonable efforts' suggests some flexibility, while 'guarantees' implies a strict obligation to meet a high standard, making it unclear what the Provider's actual obligation is. If standards can't be achieved, are they in breach?",

                "explanation": "The original clause 5.3(d) limits liability to the *lessor* of direct damages proven or the amount paid under the agreement. The modified clause removes the 'lessor of' clause and states that the party's liability will be limited to the *direct damages proven*, regardless of the amount paid by the Company. This is a contradiction because the original clause could potentially limit liability to zero if the payments under the agreement were lower than the direct damages. Now, there is no monetary cap other than the amount of direct damages proven.",

                "changed_text": "         \"Customer\" means any entity that purchases the TouchStar Software and Support Services, regardless of their location or whether they are an end-user. This includes, but is not limited to, third-party end-users with headquarter offices in the Territory to whom or to which Reseller resells or causes the resale of the TouchStar Software and Support Services.",
                "explanation": "The original definition restricts 'Customer' to end-users with headquarters in the defined 'Territory'. The modified definition broadens 'Customer' to any entity that purchases the software, irrespective of location or end-user status, thus contradicting the territorial limitation of the original definition. This could create disputes over reseller's obligations to provide services outside the territory.",

Each Annual Marketing Plan developed by Reseller\n           during the term of this Agreement and any extension thereof shall\n           contain quotas mutually agreed between TouchStar and Reseller for the\n           sale by Reseller of TouchStar Software and Support Services in the\n           Territory for the year to which such Annual Marketing Plan relates\n           (the \"Quotas\"). Reseller acknowledges that meeting the Quotas is an\n           essential element of this Agreement and that this Agreement may be\n           terminated by TouchStar if, in TouchStar's reasonable opinion,\n           Reseller will not meet the Quotas during the Term or any extension\n           thereof.",

Each Annual Marketing Plan developed by Reseller\n           during the term of this Agreement and any extension thereof shall\n           contain quotas for the sale by Reseller of TouchStar Software and Support Services (the \"Quotas\"). While Reseller will strive to achieve these Quotas, failure to meet them will not be considered a breach of this Agreement or grounds for termination, but will be subject to good-faith renegotiation of the Annual Marketing Plan. Quotas are to be considered aspirational targets, not strict contractual obligations.",
                "explanation": "The original section establishes that meeting the sales quotas is an 'essential element' and grounds for termination. The modified section refutes this by stating that failure to meet quotas is not a breach and is subject to renegotiation, effectively rendering the original quota requirements non-binding. This creates a direct contradiction concerning the legal weight and enforceability of the performance quotas.",

Prior to the end of the Term, each\n           of TouchStar and Reseller may notify the other if it desires to\n           negotiate a further agreement by written request received at least\n           ninety (90) days in advance of the termination of this Agreement. If\n           both parties desire to negotiate a further agreement, they may\n           consider the terms of this Agreement in coming to an understanding.\n           Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to obligate either party\n           to renew or extend the term of this Agreement.

Renewals for additional terms, if any, shall not cause this Agreement to be construed as an agreement of indefinite duration.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states the agreement continues for a 12 month term, unless terminated earlier, and does not obligate either party to renew. The modification introduces an automatic renewal clause unless notice is given, directly conflicting with the original term and creating ambiguity. The phrase 'Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to obligate either party to renew or extend the term of this Agreement' is kept to amplify the contradiction.",

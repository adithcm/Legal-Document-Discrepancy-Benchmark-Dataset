                "original_text": "Party B promises that land nature will not be changed for building large-scale PV grid-connected power generation project in the plot; comprehensive development will be carried out according to relevant national stipulations, such commercial crops will be interplanted as agriculture and forestry as well as medicinal materials; local employees will enjoy the priority to be employed; local building materials will be adopted and relevant expenses will be paid on schedule.",
                "changed_text": "Party B promises that land nature will not be changed for building large-scale PV grid-connected power generation project in the plot. While comprehensive development may be considered, it is subject to feasibility studies and mutual agreement with Party A. Local employees will be considered for employment opportunities; however, Party B reserves the right to prioritize specialized skillsets regardless of location. The adoption of local building materials will be explored where economically viable, but is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "The original text makes definitive promises regarding land use, comprehensive development, employment, and material sourcing. The modified version introduces conditional language ('may be considered,' 'subject to feasibility studies,' 'will be considered,' 'will be explored') that weakens these commitments, creating uncertainty about Party B's obligations. This introduces a contradiction if the rest of the contract assumes these items are guaranteed. For example, any clauses dealing with penalties for not doing comprehensive development or prioritizing local employees are now ambiguous.",

                "changed_text": "Party A supports the project construction and development of Party B and will endeavor to provide favorable policies and general assistance in the aspects of preliminary work, construction, and grid-connection of the project, and will attempt to coordinate with relevant departments and units to assist Party B in project construction progress. However, Party A's support is subject to budgetary constraints and evolving local regulations.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses strong, definite language ('supports and guarantees,' 'most preferential policies,' 'all-round service,' 'actively coordinate'). The modified version weakens these commitments with softer language ('supports,' 'endeavor to provide,' 'general assistance,' 'attempt to coordinate') and introduces limiting conditions ('subject to budgetary constraints and evolving local regulations'). This creates an inconsistency, as later sections might rely on Party A providing guaranteed support, which is no longer assured, leading to ambiguity in enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Party B will register a foreign-funded company in Fenyi County prior to the substantial completion of the project; Party A will endeavor to offer preferential policies to the company as per current local investment promotion policies for foreign investment introduction. These policies are subject to change without prior notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Party B will register a foreign-funded company 'before implementing the project' and that Party A 'will offer all the preferential policies'. The modified text changes the timing of company registration to 'prior to the substantial completion of the project', and instead of committing to 'all' preferential policies, Party A commits to 'endeavor to offer' them, while also stating that these policies are 'subject to change without prior notice'. This introduces uncertainty, as the change in timing can affect Party A's commitment and the ambiguity of Party A's commitment could create a conflict if other parts of the contract relied on a defined set of policies to be applied before the project began.",

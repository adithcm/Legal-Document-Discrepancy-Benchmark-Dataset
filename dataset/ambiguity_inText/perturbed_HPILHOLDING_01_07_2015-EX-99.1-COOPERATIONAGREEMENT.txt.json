                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be one (1) year unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the \"Term\"). However, for projects initiated within the first six months, the Term shall automatically extend until the completion of the said project, regardless of the initial one-year period.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the Term as one year. The modified text introduces an exception for projects initiated in the first six months, potentially extending the Term beyond one year, creating a contradiction in the definition of 'Term'. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement since the duration of the agreement now depends on project initiation, a factor not initially considered.",

However, GINARES shall be reimbursed by HPIL ET for all reasonable travel expenses incurred while visiting HPIL ET's offices for meetings related to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that each party pays its own expenses. The modified text introduces an exception where HPIL ET reimburses GINARES's travel expenses. This creates a contradiction, as it is now unclear which expenses are to be paid individually and which are reimbursable, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original contract mandated localization into multiple languages, whereas the modified version restricts it to English only, with an added clause suggesting other localizations are unnecessary.

                "explanation": "The original contract stipulated a sell-off period after termination, prohibiting further development or distribution, and mandating the destruction of remaining inventory with royalties still applicable. The modified version allows continued development and distribution, makes inventory destruction optional, and removes the royalty obligation during this period.

                "explanation": "The original contract grants Licensee a 'right of first negotiation,' which mandates Fox to request a bid from Licensee before granting rights to a third party. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating Fox 'may or may not grant' this right, and changes the 'must submit' to 'may submit a bid whenever it feels like it', giving Fox absolute discretion on whether to engage with Licensee. This creates conflict regarding Licensee's right of first negotiation, making it unclear if Fox is bound to offer these opportunities.

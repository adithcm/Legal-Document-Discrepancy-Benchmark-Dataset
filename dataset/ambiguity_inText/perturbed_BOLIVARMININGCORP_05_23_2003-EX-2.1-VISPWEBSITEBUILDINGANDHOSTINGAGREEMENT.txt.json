                "original_text": "This agreement shall be for a term of five years from the date of this document. This agreement shall renew automatically each year thereafter, unless either party serves written notice of its intention not to renew, on the other at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the then current term of this agreement.",

This agreement shall renew automatically each year thereafter, unless either party serves written notice of its intention not to renew, on the other at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the then current term of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a 90-day notice period for non-renewal. The modified text changes this to a 30-day notice period, creating an ambiguity about the actual notice period required, leading to uncertainty during enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This introduces several contradictions. First, the cost for private-labeled service is changed from $25.00 per month to Free. Second, the free period for generic service is changed from 90 to 30 days. Finally, the condition for charging the monthly fee has been modified by extending the period to 180 days, and the charged amount decreased to $15.00. These changes create uncertainty in the actual charges for customer support and their effective dates.",

                "changed_text": "KCI's Customers will receive an initial VISP web site setup including 2Mbs of storage space, limited maintenance of the site, basic technical support, and only essential services necessary for use of the site for no charge for the first year.",
                "explanation": "The original text guarantees 5Mbs of storage space, full maintenance, and all necessary services at no charge. The modified text reduces the storage space to 2Mbs, limits the maintenance and technical support, restricts services to 'essential' ones, and adds the condition that it is only free for the first year. This creates an ambiguity about the level of service and associated costs after the initial period and what 'essential services' exactly mean.",

                "original_text": "Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due [*] days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex. Payment information, including Tax Identification Number will be included on each invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due [*] days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex. Payment information, including Tax Identification Number will be included on each invoice. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Cerus may, at its sole discretion, delay payment for up to 90 days if it deems the invoice to contain errors or require further investigation.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment terms. The first sentence states that payment is due within a specific timeframe, while the added sentence allows Cerus to delay payment, creating uncertainty about the actual due date and potentially leading to disputes.",

Upon acceptance of a work order by Porex (in writing), such work order shall become a \"Statement of Work.\" If Porex begins to perform services under a work order that has not been formally agreed in writing, then Porex shall bear the costs of any expenses incurred prior to formal written agreement of the Statement of Work. Cerus hereby consents to Porex's use of the Cerus Dedicated Space and Equipment, as specified in a Statement of Work, solely as necessary to perform the Services under that Statement of Work. Such consent shall automatically terminate upon the completion of the applicable Statement of Work and is limited by the terms of the Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the Agreement and a Statement of Work, the Agreement shall control unless the Statement of Work expressly refers to the Parties' intent to alter the terms of the Agreement with respect to that Statement of Work and shall not be construed as an amendment to the terms of the Agreement.",

In the event of any conflict between the Agreement and a Statement of Work, the Statement of Work shall control, regardless of whether the Statement of Work expressly refers to the Parties' intent to alter the terms of the Agreement. The intention is for the Statement of Work to always supersede the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause stating that the Agreement controls in case of conflict. The modified text states that the Statement of Work always controls, regardless of any explicit reference to altering the Agreement. This creates a fundamental conflict in governing documents, making it unclear which set of terms prevail, and creating significant uncertainty in interpreting contractual obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original clause suggests a clear and predefined compensation structure for satisfactory performance. However, the added text introduces a subjective element, allowing Cerus to alter the compensation based on its assessment, regardless of objective metrics or prior agreement. This creates conflict with the expectation of predefined compensation and allows for arbitrary changes, leading to potential disputes.",

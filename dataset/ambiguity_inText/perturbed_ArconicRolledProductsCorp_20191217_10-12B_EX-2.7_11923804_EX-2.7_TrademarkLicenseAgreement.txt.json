Licensor on behalf of itself and its Affliates hereby grants to Licensee the limited licenses to use and have used the Licensed Mark: (i) for the Licensed Products as set forth on Schedule 2; and (ii) as set forth on Schedule 1, concerning agreements entered into by Licensee prior to the Effective Date (\"Existing Agreements\"). For the avoidance of doubt, Licensor also grants to Licensee and its subsidiaries and affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide royalty-free license for continued use of the Licensed Mark for the production and sale of inventory containing the Licensed Mark applied to such products during the Transition Period as set forth in section 8.2 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and in Schedule 2 of this Agreement. Licensee will not, however, use the Licensed Mark except for the production and sale of inventory as provided in this Section 1.1 and in Section 8.2 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Schedule 2 of this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any of the licenses granted by the terms of this Agreement include any right to sublicense, such right to sublicense shall extend to Licensee's subsidiaries and joint venturers.",

                "explanation": "This removes the explicit inclusion of 'its subsidiaries and affiliates' in the grant of the worldwide royalty-free license, creating a contradiction with the later statement that sublicensing extends to these entities. This raises uncertainty about whether the royalty-free license automatically applies to subsidiaries and affiliates.",

Licensor shall have the right in its sole discretion to bring a legal action for infringement against the third party, together with the right to enforce and collect any judgment thereon.

Removing 'at Licensor's request, provide reasonable assistance to Licensor, at the sole expense of Licensor' and replacing with 'may provide assistance to Licensor' implies that assistance is optional, in contradiction with the original mandatory support.",

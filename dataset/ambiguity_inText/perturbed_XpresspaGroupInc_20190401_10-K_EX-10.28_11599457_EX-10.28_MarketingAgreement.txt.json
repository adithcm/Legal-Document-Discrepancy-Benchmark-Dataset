XSPA shall pay to Calm on a monthly basis an amount equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Retail Price for all Products sold in the Stores in the Territory during the applicable month minus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of any commission actually paid or payable to XSPA employee(s) or contractor(s) attributable to sales of such Products during such month; provided that in no event shall such commission be greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the Retail Price for the applicable Product.",

XSPA shall pay to Calm on a monthly basis an amount equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Retail Price for all Products sold in the Stores in the Territory during the applicable month minus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of any commission actually paid or payable to XSPA employee(s) or contractor(s) attributable to sales of such Products during such month; provided that such commission may be negotiated on a case-by-case basis and can exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the Retail Price for the applicable Product with Calm's prior approval.",
                "explanation": "The original clause sets a clear commission cap of 15%. The modified clause introduces a loophole, allowing for commissions exceeding this cap with Calm's approval. This creates a contradiction because one reading enforces a strict limit, while the other allows for exceptions, leading to uncertainty in payment obligations.",

Calm or its authorized designees shall be the sole suppliers to XSPA of XSPA's requirements for Products, Gifts, Shopping Bags, Uniforms and Inserts (collectively, \"Product Collateral\") for each Store throughout the Territory. Calm shall use reasonable efforts to fulfill all of XSPA's requirements for Product Collateral in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event that inventory of any Product Collateral in any Store falls below fifty percent (50%) of the initial amount of such Product Collateral provided to such Store, XSPA shall use best efforts to advise Calm in sufficient detail to enable Calm to ship additional inventory of such Product Collateral to such Store. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, as between the Parties, Calm shall retain legal title to any and all Product Collateral (other than Uniforms) until sold in a Store in the Territory or otherwise disbursed in a Store in the Territory (in the case of Gifts, Inserts and Shopping Bags) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event Calm identifies any issue with any Product Collateral making it unsuitable for use as contemplated by this Agreement or issues a recall with respect to any Product, XSPA shall promptly return any and all affected Product Collateral to Calm or its authorized designees upon receiving notice of such issue or recall.",
                "changed_text": "5.05. Calm or its authorized designees shall be the preferred suppliers to XSPA of XSPA's requirements for Products, Gifts, Shopping Bags, Uniforms and Inserts (collectively, \"Product Collateral\") for each Store throughout the Territory. Calm shall use reasonable efforts to fulfill all of XSPA's requirements for Product Collateral in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event that Calm is unable to supply the required Product Collateral within a reasonable timeframe, XSPA may, at its discretion, source such Product Collateral from alternative suppliers. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, as between the Parties, Calm shall retain legal title to any and all Product Collateral (other than Uniforms) until sold in a Store in the Territory or otherwise disbursed in a Store in the Territory (in the case of Gifts, Inserts and Shopping Bags) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event Calm identifies any issue with any Product Collateral making it unsuitable for use as contemplated by this Agreement or issues a recall with respect to any Product, XSPA shall promptly return any and all affected Product Collateral to Calm or its authorized designees upon receiving notice of such issue or recall.",
                "explanation": "The original clause designates Calm as the 'sole supplier,' implying exclusivity. The modified clause changes this to 'preferred suppliers' and allows XSPA to source elsewhere if Calm can't deliver promptly. This introduces conflict: does XSPA have an obligation to *only* use Calm (as the original suggests) or can they freely seek alternatives, creating uncertainty about supply chain control and potential breach of contract.",

With respect to each Store in the Territory, XSPA shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) promptly after the Effective Date, (i) prepare notices and consents and take all other actions reasonably necessary to attempt to obtain approval for bulkhead signage from airport regulatory authorities or other entities whose approval is required for such Store and attempt to install such bulkhead signage as soon as practicable thereafter, and (ii) once installed, maintain such bulkhead signage throughout the Term; however, XSPA's obligation to maintain such signage is contingent on continued approval from relevant authorities and the cost-effectiveness of maintenance, as determined by XSPA in its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text states XSPA 'shall maintain' bulkhead signage throughout the term, implying a continuous obligation. The added clause makes this contingent on XSPA's discretion based on cost-effectiveness and continued approval. This creates a contradiction: Does XSPA *have* to maintain the signage, or can they discontinue it if they deem it too expensive or if approval is withdrawn, even if 'commercially reasonable efforts' were initially used. This introduces uncertainty about long-term marketing commitments.",

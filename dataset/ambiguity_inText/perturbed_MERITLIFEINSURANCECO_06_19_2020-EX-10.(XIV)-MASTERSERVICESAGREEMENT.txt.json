                "original_text": "Statements of Work that are from time to time agreed upon shall reference this Agreement, and shall be executed by the parties and attached hereto and shall form a part hereof. In all instances of a conflict, between the provisions of this Agreement and the specific provisions set forth in a Statement of Work, the provisions of this Agreement shall control.",

In all instances of a conflict, between the provisions of this Agreement and the specific provisions set forth in a Statement of Work, the provisions of the Statement of Work shall control.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by stating that the Statement of Work controls in case of conflict with the Master Service Agreement, which contradicts the original text stating the opposite. This can lead to disputes about which document's terms are applicable.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity in the termination clause. The original text specifies a 15-day notice period for termination when no Statements of Work are outstanding. This has been changed to 30 days. This contradicts the original 15 days, leading to confusion and potential disputes over the correct notice period.",

                "original_text": "In the event of termination under either section 6(a) or 6(b) of this agreement, Contractor shall be paid all fees and expenses that have been incurred or earned in connection with the performance of the Services through the effective date of such termination. Upon receipt of final payment Contractor shall provide to Company, and will assigns to Company, all right, title and interest to any Works in progress.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of termination under either section 6(a) or 6(b) of this agreement, Contractor shall be paid for only 50% of the fees and expenses that have been incurred or earned in connection with the performance of the Services through the effective date of such termination. Upon receipt of final payment Contractor may or may not provide to Company, and may or may not assign to Company, all right, title and interest to any Works in progress.",
                "explanation": "This changes the conditions upon termination by reducing payments for Contractor and providing uncertainty around transferring the rights, title, and interest in 'Works in progress'. It contradicts with the clear language stated in original agreement that Contractor shall be paid and shall provide all right, title and interest. This would lead to uncertainty of enforcement and disputes over these terms.",

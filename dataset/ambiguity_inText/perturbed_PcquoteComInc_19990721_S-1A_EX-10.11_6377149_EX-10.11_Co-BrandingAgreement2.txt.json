(hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement.",

(hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"). Throughout this amendment, PCQ and ABW may also be referred to as 'Partners'.",
                "explanation": "Introducing 'Partners' as an alternative term for PCQ and ABW. While seemingly innocuous, a later section might redefine 'Partners' with additional criteria, creating ambiguity about which definition is applicable.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly includes subsidiaries and related companies, but the modified version introduces uncertainty by stating their inclusion depends on a separate agreement. This contradicts the initial statement and creates potential disputes about which entities are actually bound by the amendment.",

Watley, Inc. and PC Quote, Inc.",
                "explanation": "By adding the requirement for Board ratification after the signature section, the amendment introduces a contradictory condition for enforceability. The signatures suggest immediate agreement, but the added clause implies the agreement is only preliminary until formally ratified. This creates ambiguity about when the agreement becomes legally binding.",

                "explanation": "The change in the lead-finder fee range (5%-25% vs 10%-20%) and the payment terms (NET 60 vs NET 30) introduces conflicting terms regarding compensation, leading to potential disputes over the correct payment amount and timeline.",

                "explanation": "The modification of COMPANY's indemnification obligations to exclude attorney's fees and court costs and include only gross negligence and material obligations creates a conflict with Bravatek's indemnification obligations, which still include these items and any negligence or breach. This discrepancy creates ambiguity about the scope of indemnification for each party.",

Such notice must be given thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the original term. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice.",
                "explanation": "Changing the non-renewal notice period from ninety (90) days to thirty (30) days introduces an inconsistency regarding how the agreement is to be renewed. One sentence requires 90 days notice and another requires 30 days notice. It is unclear which of those are correct creating a contradiction.",

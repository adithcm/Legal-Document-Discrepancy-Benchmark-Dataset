Termination.\n\n(a) Client may terminate this Agreement if (i) Agent defaults on any of its material obligations hereunder and such default remains uncured thirty (30) days after Agent's receipt of notice of such default from Client; or (ii) any proceeding in bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership or insolvency is commenced by or against Agent, Agent shall become insolvent or shall cease paying its obligations as they become due or makes any assignment for the benefit of its creditors.",
                "changed_text": "11. Termination.\n\n(a) Client may terminate this Agreement if (i) Agent defaults on any of its material obligations hereunder and such default remains uncured thirty (30) days after Agent's receipt of notice of such default from Client. However, such termination will be subject to a penalty of 10% of all unrealized gains by the client, as determined by the Agent; or (ii) any proceeding in bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership or insolvency is commenced by or against Agent, Agent shall become insolvent or shall cease paying its obligations as they become due or makes any assignment for the benefit of its creditors.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradictory condition to the client's termination right. The original clause allows termination for Agent's default after a 30-day cure period. The modified version adds a penalty of 10% of unrealized gains, which conflicts with the unqualified right to terminate for default, thus creating ambiguity about when and under what conditions the client can truly terminate the agreement without penalty.",

However, for invoices under $10,000, payments are due within 60 days of the invoice date. Delinquent payments are subject to a late payment charge of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month commencing sixty (60) days from the invoice date for amounts exceeding $10,000; for invoices under $10,000 late payment charges will only apply after 90 days from the invoice date. Client agrees to reimburse Agent for any attorney's fees and any other costs associated with collecting delinquent payments.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces conflicting payment terms. The original clause states that 'All amounts owed...are due within thirty (30) days'. The changed text creates an exception for invoices under $10,000, which have a 60 day payment term. This creates an in-text contradiction regarding when payments are actually due and when late payment charges apply.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that notices are 'deemed effective on the date of receipt'. The modified version introduces email as an acceptable form of notification, but states that notices are effective 'upon the date of sending by electronic mail.' This contradicts the original 'date of receipt' condition and creates confusion about when notices sent via email are actually considered effective for legal purposes.",

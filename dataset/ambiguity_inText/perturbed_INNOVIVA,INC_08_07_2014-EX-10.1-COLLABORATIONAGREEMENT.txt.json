                "changed_text": "1.3 \"Affiliate\" of a Party means any Person, whether de jure or de facto, which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Person for so long as such control exists, where \"control\" means the decision-making authority as to such Person. For the purposes of Article 6, control shall be presumed to exist where a Person owns more than fifty percent (50%) of the equity (or such lesser percentage which is the maximum allowed to be owned by a foreign corporation in a particular jurisdiction) having the power to vote on or direct the affairs of the entity. However, for all other sections of this agreement, control means owning more than 75% of the entity.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting definitions of 'Affiliate'. One section defines control as owning more than 50% equity (or the allowed local equivalent), while another states that for all other sections, it means owning 75% of the entity. This could lead to disputes in determining milestone payments or other obligations that depend on affiliate status.",

Diligent Efforts requires that: (i) each Party promptly assign responsibility for such obligations to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) each Party set and consistently seek to achieve specific and meaningful objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) each Party consistently make and implement decisions and allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",

However, in the event that internal and external constraints result, such diligent efforts could be considered as making an effort that is reasonable as determined by the party making that effort.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity into the definition of 'Diligent Efforts.' The original definition specifies clear requirements. The modified definition introduces an exception for \"internal and external constraints\", essentially giving the acting party the option to be compliant based on subjective determination.",

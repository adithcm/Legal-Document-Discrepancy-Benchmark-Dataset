                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Supplier agrees that no production or manufacture of any merchandise covered by this Contract will commence until this Contract has been signed, dated and returned by Supplier to Purchaser. Supplier further agrees that it will not produce, cause to be produced or assist in the production of more units than are specified by Purchaser nor will Supplier produce, cause to be produced or assist in the production of any product or item not specifically requested by Purchaser using any or all of the Playboy Properties or any trademark, copyright, designations, names, phrases, designs or symbols similar to any or all of the Playboy Properties during or at any time after the completion of merchandise requested by this Contract.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier agrees that production or manufacture of any merchandise covered by this Contract may commence before this Contract has been fully executed, provided that the Supplier and Purchaser have a preliminary agreement, verbal or written. Supplier further agrees that it might produce more units than are specified by Purchaser if there is a change in consumer demand and they are able to provide justification. Supplier might produce, cause to be produced or assist in the production of a similar product not specifically requested by the Purchaser.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces contradictions regarding the commencement of production and quantity of goods. The original text strictly prohibits production before contract execution and limits the quantity. The modified text allows production with a preliminary agreement and flexibility in quantity, contradicting the initial constraints.",

                "changed_text": "This Contract, when attached to a purchase order, represents a primary agreement between the parties, however, prior agreements between the parties, either written or verbal, may supersede parts of this agreement. Terms and conditions on purchase orders supplied by the Purchaser may complement or alter the terms within this Contract.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes that the Contract is the entire agreement, overriding other documents. The modified text weakens this, suggesting that prior agreements and purchase order terms can modify or supersede the Contract. This introduces uncertainty about which terms govern the relationship.",

                "changed_text": "This Contract may be modified through electronic communication such as email exchanges between the parties, and verbal modifications or waivers, if documented through meeting minutes, shall be considered binding even if not signed by an authorized representative of Playboy, as long as there is mutual consent among the parties.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original requirement for written modification signed by Playboy. The modified text allows for modifications via email and verbal agreements documented in meeting minutes, thus undermining the enforceability and integrity of the originally agreed-upon terms, which leads to uncertainties in contract execution.",

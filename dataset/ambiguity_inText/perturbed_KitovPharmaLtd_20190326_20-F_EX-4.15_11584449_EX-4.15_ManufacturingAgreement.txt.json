A “Controlled” entity can also be defined as one where one party has influence over the other's key business decisions, regardless of ownership percentage.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Control' is strictly based on share capital or power to direct management. The added sentence introduces a conflicting definition based on 'influence' without specifying the degree or means, creating ambiguity in determining control.",

However, for the purposes of Section 3 concerning purchase and supply, 'Product' may also refer to individual API components if supplied separately due to manufacturing constraints.",
                "explanation": "The original definition limits 'Product' to the final combined dosage form. The added sentence broadens the definition to include individual API components under certain conditions, creating a contradiction in the scope of 'Product' especially when concerning purchase, supply and pricing.",

Notwithstanding the above, Dexcel can modify the manufacturing process specifications without prior approval of the Health Authorities. Dexcel only needs to inform Kitov of those changes.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Specifications' ties them to the Marketing Authorization and requirements of health authorities. The added sentence allows Dexcel to modify the manufacturing specifications without approval, creating a contradiction. If the specifications aren't aligned, the contract will be hard to execute.",

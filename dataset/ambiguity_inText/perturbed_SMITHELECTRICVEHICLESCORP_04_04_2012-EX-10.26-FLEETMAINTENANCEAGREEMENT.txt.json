In the event of SEV failing to attend at the Place of Use within two hours then a senior representative of SEV will meet DCL to explain the reason for the failure. SEV shall undertake necessary repairs or where a repair cannot be completed, recover the vehicle back to the Site or Place of Repair and record the action taken in the defect reporting book;",

The timeframe is considered reasonable if SEV informs DCL of action to be taken if located at the Site within 4 hours. In the event of SEV failing to attend at the Place of Use within a reasonable time then a junior representative of SEV will meet DCL to explain the reason for the failure. SEV may undertake necessary repairs or where a repair cannot be completed, attempt to recover the vehicle back to the Site or Place of Repair and record the action taken in the defect reporting book;",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a two-hour response time to breakdowns, whereas the modified version changes this to a 'reasonable timeframe', which is ambiguous. Additionally, the text changes the meeting representative from senior to junior, which indicates there are no stakes if time is missed. This creates uncertainty and the phrase 'may undertake necessary repairs' also softens the obligation to repair/recover the vehicle.",

The definition of Operational Vehicles for this clause may include vehicles undergoing maintenance, and any Spare Vehicles are included in this Agreement in respect of Fleet Size calculations.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a 1:10 ratio of spare to operational vehicles, creating a firm commitment. The modified text changes the ratio to 1:20 with a 'may be held' clause making the obligation discretionary and indicates that even if the spare vehicles are undergoing maintenance, they are still considered as spares which doesn't give any benefit to DCL. This is also an internal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires daily checks in accordance with the Code of Practice. The modified version changes this to internal practices (which may not meet the Code of Practice requirements) and removes the daily written record requirement and simplifies the list of parameters to be checked. This creates an ambiguity as to what constitutes a 'sufficient' record and whether the checks are as thorough as before.",

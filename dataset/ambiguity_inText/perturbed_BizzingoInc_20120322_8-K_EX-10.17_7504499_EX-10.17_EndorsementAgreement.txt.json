It being understood and agreed that Bizzingo shall have the right to exhibit commercials, infomercials, advertisements and  otherwise make use of all Property on a worldwide basis and that Bizzingo and its affiliates shall be the sole owner of all commercials, promotional materials and  other items produced or created hereunder and all related rights worldwide, including, without limitation, copyright, trademark and intellectual property rights,  subject however to the terms and conditions herein. Theismann agrees to cooperate with Bizzzingo's promotional efforts in this regard. In addition, as  reasonably requested by Bizzingo, Theismann agrees to provide Bizzingo with such signatures, photographs and the like in order to fulfill his obligations  hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and further subject to Theismann's prior written approval for each specific use, Theismann hereby grants to Bizzingo and its affiliates the right and privilege during the Term (as defined herein) and within the Territory to use the Property (as defined herein) in connection with the  advertisement, promotion, and sale of the Network in the Territory whether through film, television, radio, print and Internet media, including the right to use  the Property in or on the Network.

                "explanation": "The original text grants Bizzingo an 'unlimited right' to use Theismann's property, while the modified text introduces a conflicting requirement of 'Theismann's prior written approval for each specific use'. This creates ambiguity regarding the extent of Bizzingo's rights and Theismann's control over his property's usage. This contradicts the initial grant of an unlimited right.",

It being the intent of the parties that no more than one (1) common stock purchase warrant shall be issued per Activated  User, and by way of example, if on the last day of the first and second Royalty Periods, the Network has 500,000 and 1,500,000 Activated Users,  respectively, Theismann shall receive 500,000 common stock purchase warrants for the first Royalty Period and an additional 1,000,000 common  stock purchase warrants for the second Royalty Period.",
                "changed_text": "The Royalty payable under the Agreement shall be in the form of one (1) common stock purchase warrant of Bizzingo (as further  described herein) for each Activated User (as defined above) that occurs during a Royalty Period determined on the last day of each Royalty  Period during the Term, provided, however, that the total number of warrants issued in any given Royalty Period shall not exceed 750,000 regardless of the number of Activated Users. It being the intent of the parties that no more than one (1) common stock purchase warrant shall be issued per Activated  User, and by way of example, if on the last day of the first and second Royalty Periods, the Network has 500,000 and 1,500,000 Activated Users,  respectively, Theismann shall receive 500,000 common stock purchase warrants for the first Royalty Period and an additional 1,000,000 common  stock purchase warrants for the second Royalty Period.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Theismann receives one warrant for *each* activated user. The modified text introduces a cap of 750,000 warrants per royalty period, creating a contradiction. If there are more than 750,000 activated users, it's unclear whether Theismann receives a warrant for each user as initially stated or is limited by the cap.",

However, electronic records will be purged 90 days after the agreement ends.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that records are to be maintained for one year post-termination. The modified text introduces conflicting information by stating that electronic records will be purged after 90 days, thus creating uncertainty about the accessibility and availability of certain records for inspection after termination.",

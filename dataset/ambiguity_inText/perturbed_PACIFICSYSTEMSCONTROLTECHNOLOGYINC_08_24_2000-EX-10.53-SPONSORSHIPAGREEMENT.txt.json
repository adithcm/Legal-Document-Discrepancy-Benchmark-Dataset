                "explanation": "The original text requires third-party display materials to be submitted five days before the event for ACM's approval, but the modified text changes this to one day. This creates a contradiction regarding the required submission deadline for approval of display materials, which could lead to disputes over whether the deadline was met and if ACM had adequate time for review.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the sponsorship amount is payable 180 days from the date of the Event, while the modified text changes this to 30 days from the date of the agreement. This introduces a clear contradiction regarding the payment deadline, potentially leading to legal disputes over when the payment is due. The original deadline is linked to the event, but the new deadline to the signing of the agreement which occur at different times.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement is governed by the laws of California and Hong Kong, and that mediation should occur in a mutually agreed-upon third country. The modified text contradicts this by stating that the agreement is governed by the laws of Delaware and that mediation should occur in Beijing. This introduces conflict regarding governing law and the location of dispute resolution, leading to legal ambiguity.",

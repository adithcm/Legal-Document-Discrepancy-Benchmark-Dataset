                "original_text": "In addition to the other rights provided to Manager hereunder to disconnect the Projects of the Partners (or their Partner Affiliates), Manager shall disconnect the Projects of Alpha Willow, SP11, SP12, SP13, SP14 and SP21 (together with their Partner Affiliates, the \"LIFO Partners\") in the following circumstances.",
                "changed_text": "In addition to the other rights provided to Manager hereunder to disconnect the Projects of the Partners (or their Partner Affiliates), Manager may disconnect the Projects of Alpha Willow, SP11, SP12, SP13, SP14 and SP21 (together with their Partner Affiliates, the \"LIFO Partners\") in the following circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall' to 'may' regarding the disconnection of LIFO Partners introduces ambiguity. Originally, the manager had a mandatory obligation to disconnect under specific conditions. Now, the disconnection is discretionary, creating conflict and uncertainty about the manager's responsibilities.",

                "original_text": "Any curtailment under this provision shall be in an amount sufficient to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or to reduce the Transmission Line line losses, as applicable, up to and including the Projects of all of the LIFO Partners. Such curtailment shall continue until the Manager shall determine that reconnecting the Projects of the LIFO Partners shall not result in the recurrence of the event giving rise to the curtailment.",
                "changed_text": "Any curtailment under this provision should generally be in an amount sufficient to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or to reduce the Transmission Line line losses, as applicable. The extent of the curtailment is up to the Manager's discretion, considering grid stability. Such curtailment should continue until the Manager reasonably believes that reconnecting the Projects of the LIFO Partners is unlikely to result in a severe recurrence of the event giving rise to the curtailment.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'shall be in an amount sufficient' is replaced with 'should generally be' and removes the upper limit by adding discretion to the manager in determining the extent of curtailment. In addition, this perturbation makes the criteria for ending the curtailment more vague by replacing 'shall determine that reconnecting the Projects of the LIFO Partners shall not result in the recurrence of the event giving rise to the curtailment' with 'reasonably believes that reconnecting the Projects of the LIFO Partners is unlikely to result in a severe recurrence of the event giving rise to the curtailment.', creating ambiguity and allowing for varying interpretations.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If the LIFO Partners fail to so inform the Manager, the Manager shall in its discretion determine which of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to curtail. The Manager shall cooperate with the LIFO Partners to attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment under this provision, provided that any expenses in connection with such cooperation shall be paid by the LIFO Partners. In connection with any attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment, no change to the Transmission Line shall be made without the prior unanimous consent of the Partners (excluding the LIFO Partners), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "changed_text": "If the LIFO Partners fail to so inform the Manager, the Manager may consider their input when determining which of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to curtail. The Manager may cooperate with the LIFO Partners at its own discretion to eliminate the cause of any curtailment under this provision, and any decision to cooperate shall be based on a reasonable assessment of the costs and benefits. Any expenses in connection with such cooperation will be shared amongst all partners. In connection with any attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment, no change to the Transmission Line shall be made without the prior consent of the majority of the Partners (excluding the LIFO Partners), which consent shall be granted within 15 business days.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' in both instances removes obligations from the manager, introducing discretion where previously there was a requirement. Furthermore, it changes 'will be paid by the LIFO partners' to 'will be shared amongst all partners' for any expenses in connection with such cooperation. Furthermore, changing 'prior unanimous consent' to 'prior consent of the majority of the Partners (excluding the LIFO Partners)' regarding changes to the Transmission Line can be interpreted in different ways",

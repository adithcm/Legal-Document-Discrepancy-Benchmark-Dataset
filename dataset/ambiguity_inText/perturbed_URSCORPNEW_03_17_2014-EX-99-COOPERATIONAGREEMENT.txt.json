While the Company intends for this Agreement to be a valid obligation, its enforceability against the Company is subject to ongoing review and may be limited by unforeseen circumstances.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the enforceability of the agreement. The original text clearly states it's a 'valid and binding obligation,' while the modified text introduces doubt, creating uncertainty and potential legal disputes over the commitment's strength.",

                "changed_text": "During the Cooperation Period, JANA shall use its best efforts to cause all shares of the Company's capital stock (\"Shares\") beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by it, or by any of its Affiliates or Associates (including without limitation all Shares beneficially owned as of the respective record dates for the 2014 Annual Meeting and as of the record dates for any special meeting of shareholders) over which it exercises or has voting authority, to be present for quorum purposes and to be voted, at such meetings or at any adjournments or postponements thereof, in favor of the current members of the Board (including the JANA Nominees) that will be up for election at such meetings, and will consider not submitting any proposal for consideration at, or bringing any other business before, the 2014 Annual Meeting or initiating, encouraging or participating in any \"withhold\" or similar campaign with respect to the election of directors at the 2014 Annual Meeting and shall consider not permitting any of its Affiliates or Associates to do any of the foregoing or publicly or privately encouraging or supporting any other stockholder to take any such actions.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall cause' to 'shall use its best efforts' weakens JANA's obligation to ensure shares are voted in favor. The language change from 'not to submit' to 'will consider not submitting' weakens the commitment of JANA to abstain from submitting any proposal. This introduces ambiguity and the standard of 'best efforts' is also highly open to interpretation, creating a weaker standard of action and a conflicting standard with a 'shall' statement in another part of the contract.",

The Board reserves the right to deem the replacement director acceptable or not in its sole discretion and the Board is not obligated to accept a replacement that has a comparable amount of business experience, although such experience need not be in the same industry or industries, and may not be in equally good standing in all material respects, as the JANA Nominee being replaced.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall be entitled to designate' to 'may suggest' weakens JANA's right to name a replacement director. The change from 'would be considered' to 'could potentially be considered' introduces uncertainty about the independence of the replacement. By adding the Board reserves the right to accept or reject in its sole discretion creates ambiguity about whether the 'suggestion' from JANA must be a valid director according to all criteria or not. It conflicts by weakening the standard in this section compared to other more strictly defined terms in the agreement.",

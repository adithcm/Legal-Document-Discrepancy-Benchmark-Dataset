                "changed_text": "1.41 \"Shareholder\" means each Person that holds Shares. However, for the purposes of Article IV, a 'Shareholder' is defined as a person who holds at least 10% of the total outstanding Shares.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting definitions of 'Shareholder'. In the general definition, any person holding shares is a shareholder. However, in Article IV related to Management of the Company, the definition is restricted to those holding at least 10% of the shares. This creates ambiguity in determining who qualifies as a 'Shareholder' for management-related decision-making.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in how the Put Option Price is calculated. Originally, it was the greater of a formula based on Net Book Value or one Japanese Yen. Now, it is the greater of the formula based on Net Book Value or the fair market value as determined by a third-party appraiser. This creates uncertainty in how the price is determined and could lead to disputes.",

However, if all directors agree, a meeting can be scheduled with only 24 hours notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the notice period for board meetings. Initially, it specifies a 10-day notice period. Now, it allows for a meeting with only 24 hours' notice if all directors agree. This creates ambiguity about the required notice period and could lead to challenges regarding the validity of decisions made at meetings with shorter notice.",

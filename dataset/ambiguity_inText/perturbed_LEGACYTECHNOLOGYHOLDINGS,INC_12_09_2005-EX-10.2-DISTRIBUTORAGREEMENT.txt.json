                "explanation": "The original text states that price changes are not applicable to previously accepted orders and require 90 days' notice, while the modified text makes price changes applicable and reduces the notice period to 30 days. This creates a contradiction in the pricing terms, making it unclear when a price change is valid and leading to potential disputes.",

Does ENVISION still have exclusive distribution rights?",

TERM OF AGREEMENT 1.1 The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and terminate upon the conclusion of the week following the conclusion of the Dolphins 2000 regular season or post season, if applicable (the \"Term\" or \"Initial Term\"). However, this Agreement may be earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof.",

TERM OF AGREEMENT 1.1 The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and terminate upon the conclusion of the week following the conclusion of the Dolphins 2000 regular season. For post season, if applicable (the \"Term\" or \"Initial Term\"), the agreement shall automatically extend for two additional weeks following their last post-season game. However, this Agreement may be earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof.",
                "explanation": "The 'Term' of the agreement is now ambiguously defined. Initially, it ends a week after the 2000 regular or post-season. However, the modified text adds an automatic extension of two weeks after any post-season play, creating a contradiction regarding the definitive end date of the agreement.",

CONSIDERATION 3.1 In consideration of the Sponsorship Rights granted to Hydron hereunder: (a) Hydron shall pay to the Dolphins an aggregate amount of $96,000 (plus any applicable sales and other taxes) as follows: Hydron shall pay Dolphins the sum of $24,000 (plus any applicable sales and other taxes) on July 1, 1997, July 1, 1998, July 1, 1999 and July 1, 2000.",

CONSIDERATION 3.1 In consideration of the Sponsorship Rights granted to Hydron hereunder: (a) Hydron shall pay to the Dolphins an aggregate amount of $96,000 (plus any applicable sales and other taxes) as follows: Hydron shall pay Dolphins the sum of $24,000 (plus any applicable sales and other taxes) on July 1, 1997, July 1, 1998, July 1, 1999 and July 1, 2000. However, should Hydron's product sales increase by 15% year-over-year, Hydron is entitled to a 10% reduction in the subsequent year's payment.",
                "explanation": "A conflicting clause is introduced. It first states the fixed payment schedule and then introduces a condition for a reduction in payments based on Hydron's sales performance. This makes the 'consideration' amount uncertain and dependent on sales metrics, contradicting the initial fixed payment schedule.",

TERMINATION 8.1(a) Without prejudice to any other rights, the Dolphins shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Hydron if Hydron fails to perform or comply with any term or condition of this Agreement within five (5) business days following delivery of written notice for a payment default or within thirty (30) days following written notice of any other breach of this Agreement sent to Hydron stating such failure or failures; provided that any such failure remains uncured at the end of such period.",

TERMINATION 8.1(a) Without prejudice to any other rights, the Dolphins shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Hydron if Hydron fails to perform or comply with any term or condition of this Agreement; provided that any such failure remains uncured at the end of such period. For payment defaults, Hydron will have five (5) business days following delivery of written notice. However, for any other breach, the cure period will be at the sole discretion of the Dolphins.",
                "explanation": "The original text specified cure periods for both payment defaults (5 days) and other breaches (30 days). The modified version removes the definite 30-day cure period for other breaches, stating it will be at the Dolphins' sole discretion. This contradicts the original clause and introduces ambiguity as to the cure period for non-payment related breaches, potentially leading to disputes.",

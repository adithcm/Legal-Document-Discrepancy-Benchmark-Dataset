                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Customers' is broad, encompassing all users of the Co-Branded Site. The modified definition adds a requirement of completing at least one transaction per month, creating a narrower and conflicting definition. This ambiguity could lead to disputes regarding who qualifies as a 'Customer' for purposes of marketing reports, promotional discounts, or other benefits.",

                "changed_text": "1.10 \"Confidential Information\" refers to any oral or written materials and information exchanged between the Parties in respect of this Agreement. However, Confidential Information *excludes* information that is publicly available or independently developed by either party. 1.10.1 The content of this Agreement and its supplemental agreement(s); 1.10.2 The business (including, but not limited to, business decisions, management methods, operating strategies, incentive strategies, promotional information), operating, financial, technical, product, service information of any party obtained or received by the other party during the performance of this Agreement or during the term of this Agreement; 1.10.3 The other party's user profiles, information, etc.; 1.10.4 The processes and results of settlement of any dispute arising from this Agreement",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by first defining 'Confidential Information' broadly, then narrowing it down by excluding publicly available information or independently developed information. This introduces ambiguity because the specifics listed in 1.10.1-1.10.4 might arguably fall under 'publicly available' or 'independently developed', leading to disputes over what is truly confidential.",

The amount of the deposit shall be determined solely by Party B and announced on the Platform, provided that the collected deposit shall not exceed RMB30,000 (RMB THIRTY THOUSAND).",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct conflict regarding the deposit amount. Originally, it had to be less than or the same as the amount announced on the platform *and* less than RMB 20,000. The modified version removes the link between the deposit and what is announced and changes the upper limit, allowing the deposit to be up to RMB 30,000. This creates a conflict.",

However, Party B has the right to extend the term of agreement to 3 years by giving written notice to Party A three months before the expiry date of the original agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a new condition that contradicts the originally stated one-year term of the agreement. It allows Party B to unilaterally extend the agreement, creating a conflict in determining the actual valid term of the agreement, whether it is 1 year, or 3 years upon Party B's decision, which needs to be enforced.",

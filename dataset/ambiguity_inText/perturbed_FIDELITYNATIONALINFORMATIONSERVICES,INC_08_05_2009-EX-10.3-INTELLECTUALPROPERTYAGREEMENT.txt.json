                "explanation": "The definition of 'Company Information' is modified in Section 9.2(b) to contradict its initial stringent confidentiality requirements. The original text requires the 'strictest confidence' and a 'minimum the same care it would exercise to protect its own highly confidential information.' The modification alters this to a 'reasonable confidence' and a 'reasonable level of care.' This creates an ambiguity because the term 'Company Information' is now subject to varying levels of protection depending on which part of the contract is emphasized. Enforceability becomes uncertain due to these conflicting requirements within the same definition.",

                "explanation": "The original Section 4.1(a) initially restricts Certegy from sublicensing except according to 4.1(b).

And also there is a contradictory point on enforcement of all sublicenses from Certegy to members of the Certegy Group. The term enforce is negated with 'may not'. The conflicting nature of these sections creates an ambiguity. Enforceability becomes uncertain due to these conflicting requirements within the same section.",

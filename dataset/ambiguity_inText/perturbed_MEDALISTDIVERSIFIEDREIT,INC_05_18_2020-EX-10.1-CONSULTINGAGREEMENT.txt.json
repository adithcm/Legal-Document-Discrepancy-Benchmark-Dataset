                "original_text": "Completeness of work product shall be determined by REIT in its sole discretion, and CONSULTANT agrees to make all revisions, additions, deletions or alterations as requested by the Company.",
                "changed_text": "Completeness of work product shall be initially determined by REIT, but CONSULTANT can appeal the determination to an arbitrator agreed by both parties if CONSULTANT reasonably believes that the requests are beyond the scope of this agreement. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding. CONSULTANT agrees to make revisions as per the arbitrator's direction.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the final determination of work product completeness. Initially, REIT has sole discretion, but the clause adds an arbitration process. This contradicts the initial 'sole discretion' clause, creating uncertainty and potentially leading to disputes over what constitutes acceptable work.",

As used in this Section 7.2, \"Customer\" means any person or entity to which the Company provided products or services, including any tenants of the Company's properties, (or was invested in real estate owned by the Company), and with which CONSULTANT had contact on behalf of the Company, within the last twelve (12) months of its consultancy with the Company.",

As used in this Section 7.2, \"Customer\" means any person or entity to which the Company provided products or services, including any tenants of the Company's properties and with which CONSULTANT had contact on behalf of the Company. However, for the purposes of Section 7.2(a), Customer only refers to those entities with active contracts during the last six months of the consultancy.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradictory definition of \"Customer\" within the same section. While initially \"Customer\" is defined broadly as any entity the Company provided services to, the added sentence limits the definition for the purpose of non-solicitation of competitive services to only those entities with active contracts during the last six months of the consultancy. This creates uncertainty about which definition applies when determining if a violation of the non-solicitation clause has occurred.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the termination clause. It initially states the Consultant can terminate with 90 days' notice, but the modification changes this to 30 days' notice. This creates a contradiction regarding the notice period required for the Consultant to terminate the agreement, potentially leading to disputes over the validity of a termination notice.",

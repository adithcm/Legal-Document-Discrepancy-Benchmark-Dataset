                "original_text": "Section 2.2 Relationship of Parties. With respect to any Project, regardless of which Party identified such Project, the Parties agree that Lloyds shall act as prime contractor on any Project and that Lightbridge shall have a right of first refusal to participate in such Project as a sub- contractor to Lloyds, and shall be entitled to perform such work which would generate up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the total fees payable to Lloyds as general contractor under the Project.",
                "changed_text": "Section 2.2 Relationship of Parties. With respect to any Project, regardless of which Party identified such Project, the Parties agree that Lloyds shall act as prime contractor on any Project. Lightbridge may participate in such Project as a subcontractor to Lloyds, subject to Lloyds' sole discretion and project requirements. Lightbridge's participation will be mutually agreed upon on a project-by-project basis, and compensation will be determined based on prevailing market rates and Lightbridge's contribution to the specific project.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants Lightbridge a 'right of first refusal' and specifies a fixed percentage of fees. The modified version makes Lightbridge's participation and compensation discretionary and subject to market rates, contradicting the original guaranteed right and percentage. This creates uncertainty regarding Lightbridge's involvement and compensation.",

This Agreement is effective on the Effective Date and shah continue in effect until the earlier of (a) the fifth (5t h) anniversary of the Effective Date, and (b) termination by either Party for any reason upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that no Party shall be able to terminate this Agreement so long as such Party is a Defaulting Party under this Agreement. The occurrence of the Termination Date shall not relieve either Party of any unfulfilled obligation or undischarged liability of such Party relating to the period prior to the Termination Date.",
                "changed_text": "Section 5.3 Term and Termination. This Agreement is effective on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date. Either Party may terminate this agreement with thirty (30) days written notice. Termination will not affect any outstanding obligations or liabilities incurred prior to the termination date. This agreement may not be terminated if either party has ongoing contractual obligations.",
                "explanation": "The original clause prevents a Defaulting Party from terminating the agreement. The modified version removes this restriction, allowing a defaulting party to terminate with 30 days' notice. The new contradictory clause states 'This agreement may not be terminated if either party has ongoing contractual obligations' is there to further obfuscate the termination condition.",

Any Notice delivered personally shall be deemed to have been given on the date it is so delivered, or upon attempted delivery if acceptance of delivery is refused, and any notice delivered by facsimile transmission shall be deemed to have been given on the first Business Day it is received (or on the first Business Day after it is received, if received on other than a Business Day). Notice given in any other manner shall be deemed to have been given on the first Business Day it is received (or on the first Business Day after it is received, if received on other than a Business Day).",

Notice delivered by facsimile transmission shall be deemed to have been given on the first Business Day it is received. However, if a party acknowledges receipt of a notice via email, the effective date of the notice will be the date of the email acknowledgement, regardless of the delivery method.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies clear rules for when a notice is considered 'given' based on delivery method. The modified version introduces an exception where an email acknowledgement overrides these rules, creating ambiguity about when a notice is officially effective. It is not clear if attempted delivery counts as an acknowledgement.",

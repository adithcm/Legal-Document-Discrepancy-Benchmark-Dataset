                "original_text": "1.1 \"Affiliates\" means, with respect to a Party or any Third Party, any corporation, firm, partnership or other entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such entity. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" means the ownership of at least 50% of the voting share capital of an entity or any other comparable equity or ownership interest.",

For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" means the ownership of at least 25% of the voting share capital of an entity or any other comparable equity or ownership interest.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Affiliates' is changed by altering the percentage of ownership required for 'control' from 50% to 25%. This creates a contradiction and potential ambiguity as the agreement might be interpreted differently depending on which definition of 'control' is applied.  It is unclear whether a company with 30% ownership is an affiliate.",

L. No. 111-148) as amended or replaced, but not including taxes assessed against the income derived from such sale); (ii) trade, quantity and cash discounts, allowances, retroactive price adjustments, credit incentive payments, chargebacks, patient support programs, and rebates (including governmental rebates or other price reductions provided, based on sales by ETON to any Governmental Entity or regulatory authority in respect of state or federal Medicare, Medicaid, government pricing or similar programs;); and (iii) any costs incurred in connection with or arising out of compliance with any Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies approved by the FDA and (iv) any expenses associated with serialization of the Products. Distribution of Licensed Products for clinical trials or as samples will not be deemed a \"Net Sale\" under this definition.",

Distribution of Licensed Products for clinical trials or as samples will not be deemed a \"Net Sale\" under this definition.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly changes the definition of 'Net Sales' by removing the detailed list of deductions. This creates a conflict as the original text specified numerous deductible expenses, while the revised text limits deductions solely to refunds/credits for defective goods and bad debts. Royalty and milestone payments calculated based on Net Sales would be significantly different depending on which definition is used, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding ownership of the Dossiers upon termination under Section 11.3. Originally, ownership was to be transferred to an 'Aucta shareholder-controlled entity', meaning Aucta still has control.  Now, the Dossiers transfer to 'ETON's' ownership, which mean that Aucta loses the ownership and control. It creates an internal contradiction since Aucta still has control in another part of the contract.",

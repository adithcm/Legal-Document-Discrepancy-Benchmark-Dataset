If another section relies on these amounts for calculations or termination clauses, the different figures create a contradiction.",

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent KI, Inc. from granting any other licenses for the use of KI's name or likeness, or from utilizing KI's name and likeness in any manner whatsoever, except that KI, Inc. agrees that except as provided herein it will grant no other licenses for the territory to which this license extends for the use of KI's name and likeness in connection with the sale of the products described in subparagraphs 2.(a)(1) and (2) of this Agreement effective during the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The license hereby granted shall be exclusive as to the products described in subparagraphs 2.(a)(1) and (2) of this Agreement, but nonexclusive as to all other products covered by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the exclusivity for products 2(a)(1) and (2), KI, Inc. retains the right to grant licenses to third parties for similar eyewear products, provided that the marketing campaigns do not directly compete with Diplomat's established KI Eyewear lines. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent KI, Inc. from granting any other licenses for the use of KI's name or likeness, or from utilizing KI's name and likeness in any manner whatsoever, except that KI, Inc. agrees that except as provided herein it will grant no other licenses for the territory to which this license extends for the use of KI's name and likeness in connection with the sale of the products described in subparagraphs 2.(a)(1) and (2) of this Agreement effective during the term of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This introduces ambiguity. The original text states exclusivity for products in 2(a)(1) and (2). The added text allows KI, Inc. to grant licenses for 'similar' eyewear as long as the marketing is not directly competitive. This contradicts the exclusivity, as 'similar' could easily be argued to fall under the exclusive product descriptions, creating uncertainty and potential for disputes about the scope of exclusivity.",

To this end, Diplomat shall, before selling or distributing any of the products, furnish to KI, Inc. for its approval, free of cost, a reasonable number of samples of each product and the cartons, containers, packing and wrapping material for such products. The quality and style of such products, as well as of any carton, container or packing or wrapping material, shall be subject to the approval of KI, Inc., which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Failure to reject any product, carton, container, or packing or wrapping within 15 days of receipt of such item or items by KI, Inc. shall be deemed an acceptance of the quality and style of such item or items. After samples have been approved pursuant to this paragraph, Diplomat shall not depart therefrom in any material respect without KI, Inc.'s prior written consent. From time to time after Diplomat has commenced selling the products, and upon KI, Inc.'s written request, Diplomat shall furnish without cost to KI, Inc. not more than ten (10) additional random samples of each product being manufactured and sold by Diplomat under this Agreement, together with any containers and packing and wrapping material used in connection with such products.",

                "explanation": "Originally, a 15-day non-response by KI, Inc. constituted acceptance. The added text allows Diplomat to proceed after 15 days of non-response, but reserves KI, Inc.'s right to terminate the agreement if the product isn't 'suitable'. This creates a direct contradiction: tacit approval by non-response versus a retained right to reject and terminate, making it unclear whether Diplomat is protected by the 15-day rule or constantly at risk of termination.",

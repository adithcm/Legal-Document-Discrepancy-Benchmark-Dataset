                "explanation": "This creates conflicting definitions for 'ICC Customer'. The original requires the establishment of an ICC Account, whereas the modified definition includes potential customers without an account, leading to uncertainty about who qualifies for specific services or obligations.",

This duration is referred to as the “Term.”",
                "explanation": "This introduces conflicting definitions for 'Term'. The original defines it as ending per Section 15, which outlines several termination scenarios. The modified definition sets a fixed initial term with automatic renewals unless explicit action is taken to terminate, contradicting the original's reliance on Section 15 for termination events.",

A Party may also provide notice by electronic means  (such as email or facsimile) or telephone in cases when immediate notice is required so long as the Party giving notice delivers  separate written notice to be with 24 hours pursuant to Sections 16.03(1) or 16.03 (3).",

A Party may also provide notice by electronic means  (such as email or facsimile) or telephone in cases when immediate notice is required. In this case, a notice is considered 'given' at the time the electronic communication is sent.",
                "explanation": "This introduces conflicting definitions for when a notice is effective. The original defines notices as effective upon delivery, whereas the modification describes them as effective five business days after dispatch except for electronic communications that are considered given at the time they are sent. This contradiction generates uncertainty over when actions dependent on those notices can be initiated or considered valid.",

DEFINITIONS:   In addition to any other defined terms in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings when used in this Agreement:   \"Acquired Station\" means any Broadcast Television station that is acquired by Affiliate after the Effective Date.   \"Affiliate Advertising Share\" has the meaning set forth in Exhibit D.   \"Affiliate Launch Date\" means the date on which the Service is initially transmitted by the first of Affiliate's Stations.   \"Affiliate Transactional Share\" has the meaning set forth in Exhibit D.   \"Broadcast Television\" means traditional, free, FCC-licensed, over-the-air broadcast television.",

DEFINITIONS:   In addition to any other defined terms in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings when used in this Agreement:   \"Acquired Station\" means any Broadcast Television station that is acquired by Affiliate within the first year after the Effective Date.   \"Affiliate Advertising Share\" has the meaning set forth in Exhibit D.   \"Affiliate Launch Date\" means the date on which the Service is initially transmitted by the first of Affiliate's Stations.   \"Affiliate Transactional Share\" has the meaning set forth in Exhibit D.   \"Broadcast Television\" means traditional, free, FCC-licensed, over-the-air broadcast television.",

This contradicts the possibility of acquiring stations beyond the first year, creating ambiguity in the agreement as other clauses might refer to 'Acquired Stations' without clarifying this time limitation.",

This creates a conflict because other sections calculate revenue share based on DMA, leading to confusion in determining revenue attribution.",

Otherwise, Affiliate is not obligated to run the Promotional Spots. These will be aired on the Station's Primary Feed, including the Station's analog signal for so long as the Station broadcasts an analog signal, on a run-of- station basis, commencing no later than the first air date of the Service on the applicable Station.",

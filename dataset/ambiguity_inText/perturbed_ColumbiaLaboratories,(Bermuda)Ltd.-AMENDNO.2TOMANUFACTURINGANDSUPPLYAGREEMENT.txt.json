                "explanation": "The original text mandates that Fleet 'will at all times ensure' compliance, implying a strict obligation. The modified text weakens this to 'will use reasonable efforts,' creating ambiguity about the extent of Fleet's responsibility and potentially conflicting with other sections requiring strict adherence to regulations.",

                "explanation": "The original text gives Columbia unrestricted access to books and records to verify purchase price changes. By adding 'subject to Fleet's internal confidentiality policies,' access could be limited, potentially conflicting with the original intent of full transparency in financial matters and creating uncertainty about the extent of Columbia's audit rights.",

Each party will treat as confidential the Confidential Information of the other party and will take all necessary precautions to assure the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. Each party agrees to return to the other party upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement all Confidential Information acquired from such other party, except as to such information it may be required to retain under Applicable Law, and except for one copy of such information to be retained by such party's legal counsel. Neither party shall, during the period of this Agreement nor for five (5) years thereafter, without the other party's express prior written consent, other than as provided under this Agreement, use or disclose any such Confidential Information for any purpose other than to carry out its obligations hereunder. Each Party shall guard such Confidential Information using the same degree of care as it normally uses to guard its own confidential, proprietary information of like importance, but in any event no less than reasonable care.",

Each party will treat as confidential the Confidential Information of the other party and will take all commercially reasonable precautions to assure the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. Each party agrees to return to the other party upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement all Confidential Information acquired from such other party, except as to such information it may be required to retain under Applicable Law, and except for one copy of such information to be retained by such party's legal counsel.

                "explanation": "The original text says \"will take all necessary precautions to assure the confidentiality\" and \"no less than reasonable care\". By introducing the wording \"commercially reasonable precaution\" and removing \"no less than reasonable care\", it becomes more subjective and weaken the obligations. This ambiguity can create confusion with the standard to take for protecting confidentiality.",

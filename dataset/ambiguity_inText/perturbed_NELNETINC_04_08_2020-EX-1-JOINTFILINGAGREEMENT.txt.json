                "changed_text": "The undersigned may choose to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, but do not affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'hereby agree' to 'may choose' introduces ambiguity as to the obligation to jointly file. Removing the affirmation regarding Rule 13d-1(k) further weakens the commitment. This contradicts the later statements about responsibility for filing amendments.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be responsible' to 'should endeavor to be responsible' weakens the obligation for timely and accurate filing. Stating parties are not liable for inaccuracies from others 'regardless of awareness' conflicts with the original clause that held them accountable if they knew or had reason to believe the other's information was wrong.",

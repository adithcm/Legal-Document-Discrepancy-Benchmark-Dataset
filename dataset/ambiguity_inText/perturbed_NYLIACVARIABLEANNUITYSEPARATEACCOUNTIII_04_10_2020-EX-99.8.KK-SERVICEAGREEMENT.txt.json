                "original_text": "FIIOC agrees to provide to Company, on a periodic basis, directly or through a designee, information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc. The content and format of such information shall be as FIIOC, in its sole discretion, shall choose. FIIOC may change the format and/or content of such informational reports, and the frequency with which such information is provided. For purposes of Section 4.2 of each of the Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, FIIOC represents that it is the designee of the Funds, and Company may therefore use the information provided by FIIOC without seeking additional permission from the Funds.",
                "changed_text": "FIIOC agrees to provide to Company, on a periodic basis, directly or through a designee, information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc. The content and format of such information shall adhere to the standards set by the Investment Company Act of 1940. FIIOC agrees that it will provide such information at a quarterly cadence in a PDF format. For purposes of Section 4.2 of each of the Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, FIIOC represents that it is the designee of the Funds, and Company may therefore use the information provided by FIIOC without seeking additional permission from the Funds.",
                "explanation": "In Section 1, the original text states that FIIOC has sole discretion over the content, format, and frequency of information provided. The modified text now mandates adherence to the Investment Company Act of 1940, a specific quarterly schedule, and a fixed PDF format. This contradicts the earlier discretionary clause, creating uncertainty about which provision governs the information's specifics. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes about compliance.",

FIIOC may terminate this Agreement at any time upon ninety (90) days' written notice to Company. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Company (1) if required by any applicable law or regulation, (2) if so required by action of the Fund(s) Board of Trustees, or (3) if Company engages in any material breach of this Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate immediately and automatically upon the termination of Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, and in such event no notice need be given hereunder.",

FIIOC may terminate this Agreement at any time upon ninety (90) days' written notice to Company. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Company if Company engages in any material breach of this Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate immediately and automatically upon the termination of Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, provided that FIIOC provide a 30 days' notice, and in such event no notice need be given hereunder.",
                "explanation": "In Section 4, the original text allows FIIOC to terminate the agreement immediately if required by law, regulation, or the Fund's Board of Trustees. The modified text removes these clauses, restricting immediate termination to cases of material breach by the Company. However, it introduces a 30 day notice for automatic termination due to the end of a participation agreement. This creates an inconsistency. The original allows immediate termination if the Participation Agreement is terminated without notice whereas the modified version requires a 30 days' notice. It's unclear which provision prevails if regulations necessitate immediate termination, potentially leading to legal disputes.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement may not be assigned without the written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that it shall be assigned automatically to any successor to FIIOC as the Funds' transfer agent, and any such successor shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may not be assigned without the written consent of the other party, which consent may be withheld at the sole discretion of the party. Assignment to a successor to FIIOC requires written notification, but acceptance of the terms of this agreement by said successor is not mandatory, nor will such terms be automatically applied.",
                "explanation": "The original text, in Section 6, says consent cannot be unreasonably withheld and that assignment is automatic to a successor FIIOC, bound by the agreement. The modified text directly contradicts this, saying consent can be withheld for any reason and successors are not automatically bound. This creates a direct conflict on the assignability and obligations involved in such assignments, making enforcement unpredictable.",

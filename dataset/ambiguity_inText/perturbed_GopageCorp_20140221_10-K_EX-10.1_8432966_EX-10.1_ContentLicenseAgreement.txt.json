Other terms defined in the body of the Agreement shall have the meanings so given.   \"Affiliate\" of a Person means any other Person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person. The term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty percent (50 %) of the voting securities of a Person.",

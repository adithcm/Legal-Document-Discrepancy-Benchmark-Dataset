                "explanation": "This change adds an exception to the condition where actions are pending. The original text indicates a strict prohibition against pending actions of certain types. The modified text introduces an exception if the Franchisor's legal counsel deems the action without merit. This creates a contradiction because, in another section, any pending action may trigger certain liabilities, but this clause gives the Franchisor discretion to ignore them, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a proviso to the bankruptcy clause. The original text establishes a strict ten-year look-back period for bankruptcy events. The modified text introduces an exception if the Franchisor can prove the circumstances were beyond their control. This creates ambiguity because in other sections, the occurrence of a bankruptcy event automatically triggers certain penalties or termination rights, but this modification potentially allows the Franchisor to avoid those consequences by demonstrating circumstances beyond their control. What constitutes 'beyond the control' is not defined, creating room for interpretation and disputes.",

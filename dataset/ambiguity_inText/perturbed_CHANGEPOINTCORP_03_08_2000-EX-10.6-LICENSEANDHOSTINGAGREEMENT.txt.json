                "explanation": "The original text states the license is 'irrevocable', the number of copies of software to be installed is 'multiple', limits access for customer's internal business purposes, and sublicenses an 'unlimited number of customers' for access to the Software. The modified version contradicts the 'irrevocable' nature by changing it to 'revocable', the number of copies of software to be installed to 'a limited number', permits 'broad access to and unrestricted use of the Software by Customers for any Customer purposes', and sublicenses a 'limited number of customers' for access to the Software. This creates uncertainty about license rights.",

Such books and records shall be kept for at least three (3) years following the end of the calendar month to which they pertain, and shall be open for inspection by an independent certified public accountant reasonably acceptable to Corio, and made subject to Corio's standard non-disclosure agreement, for the sole purpose of verifying the amounts payable to Changepoint under this Agreement. Such inspections may be made no more than once each calendar year, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice. Changepoint shall bear all costs and expenses of such inspection. If any such inspection discloses a shortfall or an overpayment, the appropriate party shall promptly pay the amount of such shortfall or refund such overpayment. In addition, if any such inspection reveals an underpayment of more than five percent (5%) for the period under audit, Corio shall reimburse Changepoint for the reasonable cost of the examination.",
                "changed_text": "4.4 AUDIT RIGHTS. Corio shall keep true and accurate books of accounts and records for determining the amounts payable to Changepoint under this Agreement. Such books and records shall be kept for at least one (1) year following the end of the calendar month to which they pertain, and shall be open for inspection by an internal auditor appointed by Changepoint, and without any non-disclosure agreement, for any purpose Changepoint deems necessary. Such inspections may be made up to three times each calendar year, at any time and without any prior notice. Corio shall bear all costs and expenses of such inspection. If any such inspection discloses a shortfall or an overpayment, Changepoint may choose whether or not to address the discrepancy. In addition, if any such inspection reveals any underpayment, Corio shall immediately terminate the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Original text stipulates records must be kept for three years and audits by an independent accountant reasonably acceptable to Corio, limited to once per year. The modified text requires record retention for only one year, audits by an internal auditor without a non-disclosure agreement, allows for three audits per year without notice, and shifts audit cost responsibility to Corio. It also gives Changepoint the option to ignore any discrepancies that may arise during the audit, and gives them the power to immediately terminate the Agreement with any underpayment. These changes create a contradiction in audit procedures and obligations.",

ELEPHANT TALK Customers might include the mobile end-users of ELEPHANT TALK Customers, subject to the interpretation of the specific provision.",

ELEPHANT TALK Customers specifically exclude the mobile end-users of ELEPHANT TALK Customers.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'ELEPHANT TALK Customer'. The original text allows for the interpretation that end-users *might* be included, while the modified text explicitly excludes them. This could lead to disputes over whether certain provisions apply to end-users.",

In the event of planned suspension or termination of all or any of the Hosting Services, T-Mobile shall inform ELEPHANT TALK accordingly by sending a written notification, as soon as reasonably and business wise possible.",

T-Mobile is not required to provide advanced notice of such suspension or termination. The decision to suspend or terminate is solely at T-Mobile's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original clause which specified circumstances for suspension/termination and required notification. The modified text gives T-Mobile unfettered discretion without a requirement for prior notification, potentially conflicting with other sections regarding service level agreements or dispute resolution.",

If no termination notice is provided, the Agreement will be automatically extended for consecutive *** periods until such time as *** termination notice is provided. At the end of *** Parties will negotiate in good faith regarding a possible extension of the Initial Term.\n\nParties can mutually agree in writing to deviate from an automatic extension of *** by extending this Agreement for a longer period than ***.",

If no termination notice is provided by either party, the Agreement will automatically renew for one year.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding termination rights. The original text implied equal termination rights with a specified notification period. The modified version gives T-Mobile broad termination rights (at any time, with or without cause) while restricting Elephant Talk's termination rights, which creates uncertainty and unequal footing for each party.",

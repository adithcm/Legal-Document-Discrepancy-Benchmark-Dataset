                "original_text": "THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO CO-BRANDING AGREEMENT (this \"Amendment\") is made and entered into, effective for all purposes and in all respects as of the 23rd day of February, 1998, by and between PC QUOTE, INC., with its principal place of business at 300 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60605 (\"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc., with its principal place of business at 33 West 17th Street, New York, New York 10011 (\"ABW\").",
                "changed_text": "THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO CO-BRANDING AGREEMENT (this \"Amendment\") is made and entered into, effective for all purposes and in all respects as of the 23rd day of February, 1998, by and between PC QUOTE, INC., with its principal place of business at 300 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60605 (\"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc., with its principal place of business at 123 Main Street, New York, New York 10011 (\"ABW\").",
                "explanation": "The definition of ABW's principal place of business is altered from '33 West 17th Street' to '123 Main Street'. This introduces ambiguity because it's unclear which address is the correct, legally binding address for official communication and legal notices. This could create disputes regarding where to serve legal documents or send official correspondence.",

                "changed_text": "3. To the extent, if any, that provision of this Agreement conflicts with or differs from any provision of the Agreement, such provision of this Second Amendment shall prevail and govern unless mutually agreed upon otherwise in writing.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'unless mutually agreed upon otherwise in writing,' the absolute precedence of the Second Amendment is weakened. It's now unclear whether a conflicting clause in the original agreement, even if superseded by this amendment, can be revived through a separate written agreement. This creates uncertainty about which terms govern, and opens the door to arguments that contradict the intended effect of the amendment.",

                "changed_text": "4. Except as modified hereby, the Agreement and its terms and provisions are hereby ratified and confirmed for all purposes and in all respects, provided that such terms and provisions are consistent with current industry standards.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'provided that such terms and provisions are consistent with current industry standards' introduces subjectivity and potential contradiction. What constitutes 'current industry standards' is not defined, and it's possible that terms within the original agreement, now ratified, conflict with these undefined standards. This creates a loophole, allowing a party to argue that a ratified term is unenforceable because it doesn't align with perceived industry standards.",

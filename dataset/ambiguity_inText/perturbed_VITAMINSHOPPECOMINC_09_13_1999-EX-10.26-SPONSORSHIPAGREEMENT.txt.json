                "original_text": "Client will be promoted as the preferred and dominant reseller of Vitamins in the Health Channel on the WebCrawler Site during the term of this Agreement. As such, Excite may not display banner advertising and/or promotional placements for any of Client's Competitors that are, in the aggregate, of equal or greater prominence and exposure than the aggregate of Client's links, advertising banners and promotional placements on the pages of the Health Channel on the WebCrawler Site during the term of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, Client's Competitors means those merchants identified in Exhibit D attached hereto. Client may update",
                "changed_text": "Client will be promoted as the preferred and dominant reseller of Vitamins in the Health Channel on the WebCrawler Site during the term of this Agreement. Excite retains full discretion in determining what constitutes a 'Competitor' for promotional purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, Excite may display banner advertising and/or promotional placements for entities that resell Vitamins, irrespective of whether they are listed in Exhibit D. For purposes of this Agreement, Client's Competitors means those merchants identified in Exhibit D attached hereto. Client may update",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity in the definition of 'Client's Competitors'. Initially, the contract explicitly restricts Excite from promoting competitors listed in Exhibit D. The modified text grants Excite discretion to define competitors and promote other vitamin resellers, effectively contradicting the original, clearer definition.",

                "original_text": "The parties agree that any breach of either of the parties' obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names, confidentiality and/or User Data would result in irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of a party's obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names or confidentiality, the aggrieved party will be entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to its other available legal remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "The parties agree that any breach of either of the parties' obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names, confidentiality and/or User Data may, in certain circumstances, result in irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of a party's obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names or confidentiality, the aggrieved party may be entitled to seek equitable relief only if such breach causes significant financial harm, as proven through audited financial statements. Any claims for equitable relief must be submitted within 30 days of the alleged breach.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by making the right to equitable relief conditional and requiring proof of significant financial harm, despite the initial assertion that any breach regarding trademarks, service marks, trade names, confidentiality, and/or User Data 'would result in irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law'. The original text implied an automatic right to equitable relief, which is now restricted.",

                "explanation": "This changes the scope of the indemnification clause. Originally, the Client indemnified Excite for 'any and all' third-party claims arising from specific events. Now, indemnification only applies to claims 'proven to be the direct result of gross negligence on behalf of the client'. This significantly reduces the Client's indemnification obligations and introduces an ambiguity/contradiction, because under the initial section 13a there is no scope of gross negligence, however that scope is introduced here",

                "original_text": "d.Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the termination of the JV Agreement with respect to VNBJ, VNBZ or the Veoneer Parties shall not release any Veoneer Party or any Nissin Party from liability for the breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the JV Agreement that arise prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable.",
                "changed_text": "d. Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the termination of the JV Agreement with respect to VNBJ, VNBZ or the Veoneer Parties shall release any Veoneer Party from liability for any breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the JV Agreement, except for intentional misconduct or gross negligence that arise prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable. For all other breaches, the Veoneer Parties shall not be held liable.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting definitions regarding liability after the termination of the JV Agreement. The original clause stated that the termination would not release any party from liability for breaches prior to closing. The modified clause, however, states that the termination releases the Veoneer Party from liabilities except for intentional misconduct or gross negligence. This creates an ambiguity regarding the extent of liability and enforceability of pre-existing warranties, covenants, and agreements, since one states they will remain liable, while the other states they will not, except for specific egregious conduct.",

                "changed_text": "Article 4.Effectiveness\n\nThis Amendment shall become provisionally effective immediately upon signing, but full effectiveness for Article 1.1 depends on the VNBJ Closing and for Article 1.2 on the VNBZ Closing. The Amendment shall terminate without any force or effect if the VNBJ SPA and the VNBZ SPA are terminated; however, obligations already accrued under the provisional effectiveness period remain in effect regardless of termination of the SPAs.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting definitions of 'effectiveness.' Originally, the amendment was effective only upon the closings of the share purchase agreements. Now, it is 'provisionally effective' immediately upon signing, but full effectiveness is still tied to the closings. This creates uncertainty about what 'provisionally effective' means and what obligations, if any, are triggered prior to the VNBJ and VNBZ Closings. The added statement of 'obligations already accrued remain in effect' further muddies the waters since, under the original text, no obligations existed before closing.",

However, the Nissin Parties' obligation to indemnify Directors and Officers shall be capped at a total of $100,000 USD.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the scope of the Nissin Parties' obligation for D&O Indemnity. The original clause stated that the Nissin Parties agree to *cause* VNBJ and VNBZ to comply with indemnification obligations. The modified clause changes 'agree to cause' to 'agree to use their best efforts to cause,' which significantly weakens the obligation. Additionally, the introduction of a $100,000 cap directly contradicts the original implied unlimited indemnification obligation based on Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of the JV Agreement, which are not limited in amount.",

                "original_text": "The Servicer shall have full power and authority, acting alone or through any party properly designated by it hereunder, including any Sub-Servicer, to do any and all things in connection with such servicing and administration which it may deem necessary or desirable, consistent with the terms of this Servicing Agreement and the Servicing Standard. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless such power is revoked by the Owner on account of the occurrence of a Servicer Default, the Servicer shall have full power and authority (i) to make withdrawals from the applicable servicer collection account permitted by the terms of this Servicing Agreement, the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document and (ii) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Owner, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Receivables and, after the delinquency of any Receivable and to the extent permitted under and in compliance with applicable Servicing Standard and the Loan Agreement, to commence collection proceedings with respect to such Receivables. The Owner shall furnish the Servicer with any documents reasonably requested by the Servicer, including powers of attorney, as necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer (or any Sub-Servicer on its behalf) to carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "The Servicer shall have the power and authority, acting alone or through any party properly designated by it hereunder, including any Sub-Servicer, to do only those things explicitly listed in this agreement in connection with such servicing and administration. The Servicer's power and authority is limited to (i) making withdrawals from the applicable servicer collection account as explicitly permitted by the terms of this Servicing Agreement, and (ii) executing and delivering, on behalf of the Owner, instruments of satisfaction or cancellation only upon receiving express written consent from the Owner for each individual instrument. The Owner shall furnish the Servicer with any documents only when it determines those documents are necessary to enable the Servicer (or any Sub-Servicer on its behalf) to carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder.",
                "explanation": "This change severely restricts the Servicer's power, directly contradicting the original broad authority granted. It introduces ambiguity and requires express consent for actions previously under the Servicer's discretion.",

                "original_text": "For all purposes of this Agreement, the Servicer shall be an independent contractor and shall not be subject to the supervision of the Owner with respect to the manner in which it accomplishes the performance of its obligations hereunder; provided, however, Servicer shall be subject to the Owner's third-party vendor management program. Unless expressly authorized by the Owner in this Agreement or otherwise, the Servicer shall have no authority to act for or represent the Owner in any way and shall not otherwise be deemed an agent of the Owner.",
                "changed_text": "For all purposes of this Agreement, the Servicer shall be an independent contractor but shall be subject to the close supervision of the Owner with respect to the manner in which it accomplishes the performance of its obligations hereunder. The Servicer shall be considered an agent of the Owner and is fully authorized to act for or represent the Owner in any way deemed necessary by the Servicer to perform its obligations.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the independent contractor status by imposing close supervision and granting the Servicer broad authority to act on behalf of the Owner, creating a principal-agent relationship. This creates uncertainty regarding liability and control.",

                "changed_text": "Subject to Section 13(a), the Servicer shall indemnify and hold harmless only the Owner from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, action, suit, cost, expense, damage or injury, of any kind and nature whatsoever, including any judgment, award, settlement, fines, reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the defense of any action, Proceeding, investigation or claim (any of the foregoing, \"Losses\") suffered or sustained by the Owner by reason of any acts or omissions of the Servicer, regardless of the Servicer's adherence to this Agreement or whether the acts or omissions of the Servicer arise by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the Servicer's performance of its duties hereunder; the Servicer shall be obligated to indemnify the Owner even for any Losses that arise from the negligence or willful misconduct of the Owner or its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, partners, members, managers or agents.",
                "explanation": "This change drastically alters the indemnification obligations of the Servicer. It removes the Agent and Lenders as Indemnified Persons and removes the requirement for the Servicer's acts or omissions to be in breach of the Agreement. It even requires the Servicer to indemnify the Owner for the Owner's own misconduct, creating a contradiction with the original intent of limiting liability and indemnifying only for Servicer's faults.",

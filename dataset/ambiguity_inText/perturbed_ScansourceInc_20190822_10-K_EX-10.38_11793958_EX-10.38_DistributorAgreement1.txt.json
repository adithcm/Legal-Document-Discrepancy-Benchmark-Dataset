Initially, it only includes items on the Global Price List, but the modified definition includes Hardware and licensed Software regardless of listing, which means other definitions relying on this definition become unclear. This also leads to the interpretation of how certain clauses are enforced, and if they are even enforceable.",

In the event Cisco enters into authorization agreements whereby Cisco authorizes particular resellers to purchase Products or Services from Distributor and to resell Products or Services to End User, then \"Reseller\" shall mean a reseller that is a party to such an authorization agreement.",

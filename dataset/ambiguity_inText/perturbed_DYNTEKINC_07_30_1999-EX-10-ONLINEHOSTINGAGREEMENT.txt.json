                "original_text": "Diplomat will pay to Tadeo when due a fee for each of the Services equal to the amount described in EXHIBIT A hereto relating to each such Service; PROVIDED, that in the event Diplomat terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 3 hereof, the fee for the provision of each\n\n- 2 -\n\nterminated Service shall cease to accrue on and after the effective date of such termination. In the event that Diplomat terminates this Agreement other than in accordance with Section 3, Diplomat shall be obligated to pay for the Services in accordance with the fee schedule contained on EXHIBIT A throughout the balance of the Period (as hereinafter defined) as though Tadeo continued to provide the terminated Services through the balance of the Period. Late payments shall accrue interest at a rate equal to fifteen (15%) percent per annum.",

In the event that Diplomat terminates this Agreement other than in accordance with Section 3, Diplomat shall be obligated to pay for the Services at a reduced rate, to be determined by mutual agreement between Diplomat and Tadeo, throughout the balance of the Period (as hereinafter defined). Late payments shall accrue interest at a rate equal to fifteen (15%) percent per annum.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding payment obligations upon termination outside Section 3. The original text mandates full payment, while the modified version introduces a 'reduced rate' to be 'determined by mutual agreement,' creating uncertainty and potential for dispute about the financial consequences of such termination. It contradicts the original fixed-fee obligation.",

If either party elects to extend the Agreement for the Additional Period, all other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall continue during the Additional Period. Such extension shall be effective unless the other party objects in writing within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the extension.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement continues for 12 months 'in full force and effect until it is terminated in accordance with this Section 3'. The modified version removes the 'not in default' condition for extension and introduces a 30-day objection period, creating a contradiction. One section suggests the agreement continues unless terminated under specific conditions in Section 3 while the other grants an extension right that can be nullified by objection, regardless of default status. This introduces uncertainty about the conditions under which the agreement can be extended.",

The fees, costs and expenses of such arbitration, as submitted by the AAA, shall be borne equally by both Tadeo and Diplomat; PROVIDED, that each of Tadeo and Diplomat shall pay the fees, costs and expenses of its own counsel, accountants and other representatives in connection with such arbitration. The parameters of the AAA proceedings undertaken in accordance with this Section 8 shall be prescribed such that a decision shall be rendered within sixty (60) days following the initial written reference of the related dispute to AAA arbitration.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that any party to this Agreement has any claim, right or cause of action against any other party to this Agreement, which the parties shall be unable to settle by agreement between themselves, such claim, right or cause of action shall be submitted to mediation. If mediation fails, then, to the extent that the relief sought by such party is for monetary damages or awards exceeding $50,000, it shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"),\n\nthrough the adjudication by a single arbitrator, in New York, New York, with the decision of such arbitrator to be non-binding. The fees, costs and expenses of such arbitration, as submitted by the AAA, shall be borne by the losing party. The parameters of the AAA proceedings undertaken in accordance with this Section 8 shall be prescribed such that a decision shall be rendered within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the initial written reference of the related dispute to AAA arbitration.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates several contradictions with the original dispute resolution process. First, it introduces mandatory mediation before arbitration. Second, it limits mandatory arbitration to claims exceeding $50,000, implying smaller claims have a different process. Third, it makes the arbitration decision non-binding, which clashes with the original's 'final and binding' clause. Finally, it shifts cost allocation to the losing party and extends the arbitration timeframe. These changes introduce substantial ambiguities regarding how disputes are resolved, undermining the enforceability of the original arbitration agreement. This creates an internal contradiction regarding the dispute resolution process.",

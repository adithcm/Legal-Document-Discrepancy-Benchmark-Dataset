                "changed_text": "Business Secrets mean any technical, financial, commercial or any other information owned and treated as business secrets by one Party and/or its subsidiaries or affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, information is considered a Business Secret under this agreement irrespective of whether it is publicly known or generates economic benefit. All that is required is that the Party deems it to be confidential.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Business Secrets' required it to be 'unknown to the public' and 'generate economic benefit.' The modified definition explicitly states that information can be a business secret even if publicly known or without generating economical benefit. This contradicts the original definition, creating ambiguity and making enforcement uncertain.",

Party A grants all-round exclusive rights to Party B to construct, maintain and operate the Cooperation channel. As the owner of www.baidu.com, Party A has ownership and control over second tier domain names. Party A has the right to deprive Party B of the operating rights of the website without any liability if Party B is found in violation of any law. Party A is required to receive written consent from Party B prior to its adjustment of any second tier domain names which is under independent operation of Party B.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Party B will use the Baidu's Real Estate and Home Furnishing Channel as the jointly formed channel of Party A and Party B. While Party A intends to grant Party B operational control, Party A reserves the right to unilaterally modify or terminate Party B's operating rights at any time, with or without cause. As the owner of www.baidu.com, Party A maintains full ownership and control over all domain names and website content. Party A may adjust any second tier domain names at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants 'all-round exclusive rights' to Party B to operate the Cooperation Channel. The modified text significantly weakens this right by stating Party A 'intends' to grant operational control but reserves the right to unilaterally modify or terminate Party B's operating rights at any time, undermining the initial grant and creating uncertainty about Party B's actual rights and responsibilities. This creates a contradiction if another section relies on the exclusive rights.",

                "original_text": "The cooperation fee under this Agreement will be RMB200 million, of which RMB160 million will be channel cooperation fee and RMB40 million will be promotion fee for the Cooperation Channel. The cooperation fee will be payable in four installments as follows\n\n(a) Within 15 business days after the date hereof, Party B will pay RMB50 million to Party A.\n\n(b) Within 15 business days after the end of the first cooperation period, Party B will pay another RMB50 million to Party A.\n\n(c) Within 15 business days after the end of the second cooperation period, Party B will pay another RMB50 million to Party A.\n\n(d) Within 15 business days after the end of the third cooperation period, Party B will pay the remaining RMB50 million to Party A.",
                "changed_text": "The cooperation fee under this Agreement is estimated to be RMB200 million, but may be adjusted based on performance metrics to be mutually agreed upon by both parties at a later date. The parties acknowledge that such performance metrics have not been fully defined as of the Effective Date. The payment schedule will depend on the mutually agreed performance metrics.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a fixed cooperation fee of RMB 200 million with a clear payment schedule. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating the fee is 'estimated' and subject to adjustment based on undefined 'performance metrics'. It removes the payment schedule as well, rendering the payment obligations vague and potentially unenforceable. This contradicts the original clear payment terms.",

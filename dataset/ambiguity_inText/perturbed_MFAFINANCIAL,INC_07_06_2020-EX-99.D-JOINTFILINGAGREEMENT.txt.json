                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm their intent to consider a future agreement regarding the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer. The inclusion of this Agreement as an Exhibit to such filing is subject to further review and mutual consent.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a firm agreement for joint filing, while the modified text introduces uncertainty by stating an 'intent to consider' and making the inclusion of the agreement as an exhibit conditional. This creates a contradiction regarding the binding nature of the joint filing commitment.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that all counterparts are deemed originals, ensuring equal validity. The modified text contradicts this by specifying that only the first signed counterpart is considered the original for legal enforceability, potentially invalidating other signed counterparts. This creates uncertainty in determining which document takes precedence in case of discrepancies or disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original text shows Matthew S. O'Mara signing as the authorized signatory for both ATHENE ANNUITY AND LIFE COMPANY and ATHENE ANNUITY & LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY. The modified text shows Matthew S. O'Mara signing for the first company but Jane Doe signing for the second company. This creates an ambiguity in who has the power to sign for each company. If Matthew S. O'Mara does not have power to sign for both, the contract validity is questionable.",

The term is applicable to one or more persons, a corporation or a partnership,  as the case may be. If two or more persons are at any time the Franchisee hereunder,  their obligations and liabilities to Pretzel Time shall be joint and several.

                "explanation": "The original definition specifies joint and several liability for multiple franchisees, implying each is fully responsible. The modified definition imposes several liability only, meaning each franchisee is only liable for their portion, thus conflicting with the original stringent requirement and creating ambiguity in enforcement should a franchisee default.",

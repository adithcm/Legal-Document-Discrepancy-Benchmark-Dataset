                "changed_text": "8. MAXIMUM DAILY QUANTITY (Dth/Day): 101,300\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the Maximum Daily Quantity is subject to operational adjustments, and the Transporter reserves the right to reduce this quantity based on system capacity. Shipper should refer to Appendix A for typically expected daily quantities.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a clear maximum daily quantity. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that this quantity is subject to adjustments and may be reduced, creating a contradiction in the certainty of the specified quantity. This introduces uncertainty as to what constitutes the real maximum daily quantity.",

                "explanation": "The original clause strictly requires all communications to be in writing. The change introduces an exception for urgent operational communications, which can be verbal initially. This creates a conflict because a party could argue that a critical notice was properly given verbally despite the earlier general requirement for written notices, leading to disputes regarding compliance and evidence of notification.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that the Agreement is subject to the General Terms and Conditions of the FERC Gas Tariff. The modification introduces a condition that in case of conflict, the terms of *this* agreement prevail, *unless* the Tariff mandates otherwise. This makes it unclear which document takes precedence, and on what grounds a conflicting provision in the Tariff would 'expressly mandate otherwise,' creating a significant ambiguity.",

                "original_text": "Schoolpop shall have the exclusive right to resell Cards in                   the NPO Marketplace. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Schoolpop                   shall fund from AEIS a minimum of $52,000,000 of Cards (the                   \"Guaranteed Minimum\") in each Contract Year in order to                   maintain the exclusive right to sell Cards in the NPO                   Marketplace. A Contract Year shall be the period of August 1                   through July 31 of the succeeding year. In any Contract Year                   in which Schoolpop fails to fund the Guaranteed Minimum, AEIS                   shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to (a) terminate                   the Agreement or (b) revoke the exclusivity.",
                "changed_text": "Schoolpop shall have the exclusive right to resell Cards in the NPO Marketplace. To maintain this exclusivity, Schoolpop should aim to fund from AEIS a minimum of $52,000,000 of Cards (the \"Guaranteed Minimum\") in each Contract Year. A Contract Year shall be the period of August 1 through July 31 of the succeeding year. If Schoolpop fails to meet the Guaranteed Minimum, AEIS may consider adjustments to the agreement to determine a new course of action.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a clear requirement for Schoolpop to maintain exclusivity. Failure to meet the Guaranteed Minimum results in AEIS having the right to terminate the agreement or revoke exclusivity. The revised text introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall fund' to 'should aim to fund', effectively making the funding requirement a goal rather than a strict obligation. Additionally, instead of explicitly stating AEIS's right to terminate or revoke exclusivity, it suggests that AEIS may consider adjustments, leaving the consequences uncertain. This creates a weaker, less enforceable obligation, which conflicts with the initial firm exclusivity statement.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states how Card Life is determined in each period. The modified version introduces ambiguity into Period Two by stating that Card Life will be determined at AEIS's discretion, considering the order date and market conditions. This contradicts the initial statement that card life shall be determined by the date Schoolpop places an Order and introduces uncertainty.",

Schoolpop warrants it shall take measures to                   track information about its Clients which shall meet                   compliance requirements related to the above stated laws,                   track all Card shipment(s) to each such Client, and maintain                   appropriate records for its Clients for a period of seven (7)                   years after termination of the Agreement and to provide such                   records and other information to AEIS upon reasonable request                   and subject to applicable law. Schoolpop shall further inform                   in writing all of its Clients of their requirement to comply                   with all applicable laws concerning the use of Cards,                   including those laws stated in the previous sentence. School                   shall inform its Clients of the requirement to maintain                   records with respect to the Cards and Cardholders, and to                   verify the identity of Cardholders as required by law, to                   maintain records of the information used to verify each                   Cardholder's identity, to retain such records for at least                   seven (7) years following the date of distribution, including    &sbsp;              name, home address, Card number, and other identifying                   information, and the name, title and phone number of the                   individual responsible for maintaining such records, and to                   provide such records and other information to AEIS upon                   reasonable request and subject to applicable law.",

While Schoolpop should strive to track information about its Clients to meet compliance requirements related to the above stated laws, specific measures and record-keeping duration may be adjusted based on mutual agreement with AEIS. Schoolpop shall also inform its Clients of their requirement to comply with all applicable laws concerning the use of Cards; however, the extent of client record-keeping responsibilities will be subject to periodic review and potential modification.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes strict requirements on Schoolpop and its Clients regarding compliance, tracking information, and record-keeping.

Additionally, it states that specific measures and record-keeping duration may be adjusted based on mutual agreement with AEIS and the extent of client record-keeping responsibilities will be subject to periodic review and potential modification, which can contradict the stringent compliance requirements initially specified, creating internal inconsistency.",

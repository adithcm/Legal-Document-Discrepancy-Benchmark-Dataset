                "explanation": "The original text states that sales should commence no earlier than six months after the effective date and be completed as soon as practicable. The modified text contradicts this by saying sales can commence at any time after the effective date and be completed within five years. This creates a contradiction regarding the timing and duration of the sales, making enforcement uncertain.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies the OMA expires on the first anniversary or when all shares are sold. The modified text contradicts this by changing the expiration date to the second anniversary and reducing the share sale threshold to 75%. This introduces ambiguity regarding the agreement's term and the required share sale percentage.",

The Principal appoints the Distributor as a non-exclusive distributor, to sell Principal's qPCR infectious disease kits, Logix Smart COVID-19 PCR diagnostic test and Co-Dx Box™ instrument (the \"Products\"). The Products are described on Exhibit A to this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Products' as the qPCR kits, COVID-19 test, and Co-Dx Box instrument and states they are described in Exhibit A. The modified text removes the reference to Exhibit A, creating uncertainty about what constitutes 'the Products' covered by the agreement if Exhibit A is not available or is amended separately. It also creates a contradiction if another section relies on the specific list in Exhibit A.",

                "explanation": "The original definition explicitly states that the territory can be amended through mutual agreement. By removing this clause, the definition of 'Territory' becomes static. This creates a contradiction if, for example, Section 5 allows the Principal to market the products elsewhere. A later addendum would be needed to resolve this.",

                "explanation": "The original text refers to a discount 'based on the Products and Prices' and suggests the discount may vary based on volume or promotions. The changed text omits 'Prices' as a basis for the discount, and replaces the possibility of varied discounts with the Principal having sole discretion. This creates a contradiction, as the original suggests some objective criteria influence the discount, while the modified version gives the Principal total control, potentially negating the 'Products' basis.",

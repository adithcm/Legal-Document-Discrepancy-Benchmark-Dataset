                "original_text": "2.1. Developer must submit one or more site(s) for approval, enter into binding leases or purchase agreements and open to the public the number of El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) on such approved sites each calendar year as required on the Development Schedule, all as set forth on Exhibit \"B\" attached hereto and made a part hereof.",
                "changed_text": "2.1. Developer must submit one or more site(s) for approval, attempt to enter into leases or purchase agreements, and make a reasonable effort to open the number of El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) on such approved sites each calendar year as generally described in the Development Schedule, all as set forth on Exhibit \"B\" attached hereto and made a part hereof.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to open restaurants by changing 'must submit' to 'attempt to enter', and 'open to the public' to 'make a reasonable effort', creating uncertainty in the enforcement of the development schedule. The original text created a hard deadline and obligation, this change introduces ambiguity in the requirements of exhibit B.",

                "original_text": "2.15. Developer acknowledges that time is of the essence in this Agreement. If Developer has not obtained approval and entered into a binding lease or purchase agreement for each site for El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) to be developed under this Agreement by the applicable Site Commitment Date, Developer shall be in default of its obligations under the Development Schedule and Franchisor shall be entitled to exercise its rights and remedies under this Agreement, up to and including termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "2.15. Developer acknowledges that meeting deadlines is generally important in this Agreement. If Developer has not obtained approval and shown a good faith effort to secure a lease or purchase agreement for each site for El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) to be developed under this Agreement by the applicable Site Commitment Date, Developer may be considered in potential non-compliance of its obligations under the Development Schedule and Franchisor may consider exercising its rights and remedies under this Agreement, perhaps including termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the 'time is of the essence' clause, turning a strict obligation into a suggestion and making the repercussions for missing deadlines uncertain.  Replaced \"shall be in default\" with \"may be considered in potential non-compliance\" removing the definitive outcome of missing the deadline and allowing for interpretations. The original clause created very clear consequences, and this revision completely undermines those enforcement abilities.",

                "original_text": "11.1. The following events shall constitute a default by Developer, which shall result in El Pollo Loco's right to declare the immediate termination of this Agreement.\n\na. Failure by Developer to meet the requirements of the Development Schedule within the time periods specified therein, including failure by Developer to meet the Site Commitment Date or Opening Date for each site for an El Pollo Loco® Restaurant in a timely manner as set forth in Exhibit \"B\" and Section 2 above.",
                "changed_text": "11.1. The following events may constitute a default by Developer, which may result in El Pollo Loco's potential right to consider termination of this Agreement.\n\na. Alleged Failure by Developer to somewhat adhere to the general goals of the Development Schedule, potentially including some level of failing to meet the Site Commitment Date or Opening Date for each site for an El Pollo Loco® Restaurant according to Exhibit \"B\" and Section 2 above.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces significant uncertainty into the default conditions. 'Shall constitute a default' becomes 'may constitute a default', 'shall result in El Pollo Loco's right to declare the immediate termination' becomes 'may result in El Pollo Loco's potential right to consider termination', and 'failure to meet requirements' becomes 'alleged failure to somewhat adhere to the general goals'. This makes it significantly more difficult to enforce the development schedule, as the conditions for default are no longer clear or automatic.",

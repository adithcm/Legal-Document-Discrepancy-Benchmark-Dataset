Constellation's standard warranty as stated in the applicable Second Level Agreement (the \"Warranty\") shall apply to all purchases of Products & Services made pursuant to this Agreement. Without limiting the Warranty, Constellation represents, warrants and covenants that all Products & Services delivered in connection with this Agreement or any Second Level Agreement will be and will have been produced and/or provided in compliance with all applicable laws.",

Constellation's standard warranty as stated in the applicable Second Level Agreement (the \"Warranty\") shall apply to all purchases of Products & Services made pursuant to this Agreement. Constellation makes no additional representations or warranties beyond those stated in the Second Level Agreement and does not guarantee compliance with all applicable laws, rules or regulations related to the Products and Services delivered under the agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting definitions by stating that no additional warranty will be guaranteed beyond the Second Level Agreement in the changed text while in the original text there are representations warrants and covenants that all Products & Services delivered in connection with this Agreement or any Second Level Agreement will be and will have been produced and/or provided in compliance with all applicable laws. This creates uncertainty regarding the extent of Constellation's liability and obligations.",

Provided that Constellation is not then in breach of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation Section 2.1 hereof, and provided that Constellation has available for purchase a product or service which meets the needs of the HOF Entities at competitive market pricing, (a) neither of the HOF Entities shall purchase, at any time during the Term, any commodity electricity or gas from any person or entity other than Constellation and its affiliates and (b) in the event and to the extent mutually agreed by the Parties, neither of the HOF Entities shall grant or award to any company designated by Constellation (and mutually agreeable to the HOF Entities) any project which the Parties mutually agree shall not be granted or awarded to such company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 2.2 shall not be deemed to apply to agreements executed prior to the date of this Agreement between the HOF Entities and Johnson Controls, Inc. or any of its affiliates.",

Provided that Constellation is making a good faith effort to fulfill its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, including Section 2.1 hereof, and provided that Constellation offers a product or service which the HOF Entities deem acceptable, (a) the HOF Entities will make a reasonable effort to prioritize Constellation for purchases of commodity electricity or gas and (b) the HOF Entities will consider, in good faith, companies designated by Constellation for projects, subject to their own independent evaluation and business needs. This Section 2.2 is subordinate to any existing agreements, including those with Johnson Controls, Inc., or any of its affiliates and any subsequent agreements.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a strict exclusivity clause where the HOF Entities 'shall not purchase' commodity electricity or gas from other entities. The modified text introduces a good faith effort and prioritization, effectively negating the original exclusivity and allowing the HOF Entities more flexibility. This creates ambiguity regarding the enforceability of Constellation's exclusive rights and may lead to disputes over competitive market pricing.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines default as a failure to perform material obligations. The modified text adds that the non-defaulting party has the right to reasonably determine if the default is of a material and ongoing nature and the cure period may be extended by the non-defaulting party. This creates conflicting interpretations of what constitutes a default and when the cure period can be extended, allowing for subjective judgement to influence the termination process.",

                "original_text": "(a) \"Affiliate\" means a person or entity that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, a Party. The term 'control' means the possession of the power to direct the management and policies of the person or entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "(a) \"Affiliate\" means a person or entity that directly controls a Party through one or more intermediaries. The term 'control' means the possession of over 50% ownership of voting securities.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' included entities under common control and defined 'control' broadly. The revised definition restricts 'Affiliate' to only those entities directly controlling a Party and narrows 'control' to majority ownership. This could lead to disputes if, for instance, an entity exerts control through contractual agreements but doesn't hold majority ownership.",

Sponsor's materials shall be of high standard and superior quality and shall in no manner reflect adversely on Team Companies or the Stadium. The Team Companies agree to use the Sponsor Marks only in accordance with Sponsor's specifications and guidelines as may be provided from time to time.",

                "explanation": "The change introduces contradiction in terms of how Sponsor Marks and Team Marks can be used. In original, they must both be used with their specifications and guidelines accordingly, but in the new change it states that Team Companies do not need to follow Sponsor’s specifications. This change introduces ambiguity in terms of what specifications and rules must be followed.",

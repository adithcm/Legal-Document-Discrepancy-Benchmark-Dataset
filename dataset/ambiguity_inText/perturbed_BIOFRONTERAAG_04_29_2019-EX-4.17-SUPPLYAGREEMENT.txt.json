These specifications may not necessarily conform to standards approved by Governmental and Regulatory Authorities or as provided in the NDA for the Products, but Supplier will use their best efforts to manufacture according to Governmental and Regulatory guidelines.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by stating that the specifications are those approved by Cutanea and may not necessarily conform to the standards approved by Governmental or Regulatory Authorities. This contradicts the intent of complying with regulatory standards, which is usually required. It is unclear whether the Supplier needs to adhere to all quality standards requested by Governmental and Regulatory authorities.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Supplier agrees that it will, on a non-exclusive basis (but exclusive for supply of the Product in the United States of America including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands), Manufacture (directly or through a designee) for and provide and supply to CUTANEA, and CUTANEA agrees that it will purchase exclusively from Supplier, all of its requirements of the Products as follows: Supplier shall supply Products in accordance with the Specifications and in sufficient quantity to meet CUTANEA's Forecasted Needs for the length of this Agreement. All deviations from the Specifications must be approved by CUTANEA, in writing, prior to Supplier Manufacturing the Product.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and contradiction to the terms of manufacture and supply. It changes the obligatory nature of 'Supplier shall supply Products in accordance with the Specifications' to 'Supplier shall supply Products to the best of their ability and in reasonable quantity'. It also introduces an internal contradiction because deviations do not have to be approved by CUTANEA. It is unclear if supplier has the right to refuse delivery.",

                "original_text": "2.6.1 All Products shall be submitted to inspection and evaluation by or on behalf of CUTANEA to determine whether or not said Products meet the Specifications. CUTANEA will provide in good faith written acceptance of a batch of Product or written notification of any deficiencies within two (2) Business Days after receipt of the Certificate of Analysis for the Product batch. Written acceptance of a batch of the applicable Product is required as a condition to the delivery of Product to Cutanea's designated shipping agent in accordance with Section 3. If for any reason Supplier does not receive any such notification within such two (2) Business Day period, Supplier will promptly notify CUTANEA of such fact and CUTANEA will as soon as practicable and, in any event within another two (2) Business Days thereafter provide such written notice to Supplier and be responsible for any storage or similar charges that Supplier may incur for not delivering such Product. The lack of reception of such written acceptance within the second two (2) Business Day period shall be deemed as the batch is accepted. If, once the Product is delivered, CUTANEA determines that there is any deficiency with respect to any Product, CUTANEA will notify Ferrer of such claim within fifteen (15) Business Days of delivery of the Products. Each such notice of rejection to Supplier shall specify in reasonable detail the ways in which the Product batch failed to meet Specifications. CUTANEA shall grant to Supplier (or its designee) the right to inspect or test said Product batch and dispute CUTANEA rejection according to the provisions provided in this Section 2.6. In the event that Supplier disagrees with CUTANEA's defective Product claim, the issue shall be submitted to a mutually agreed upon independent third party laboratory, whose decision shall be final and binding upon the Parties. The costs arising from the laboratory's intervention and the costs of the replaced Products (including return and destruction costs of the defective Products) shall be borne by the Party whose results were mistaken. As to any such Product batch which is determined to fail the Specifications (\"Rejected Product\"), CUTANEA shall have no obligation to pay for such Rejected Product and Supplier shall replace such Rejected Product as soon as possible and no later than ninety (90) days thereafter.",
                "changed_text": "2.6.1 All Products shall be submitted to inspection and evaluation by or on behalf of CUTANEA to determine whether or not said Products meet the Specifications. CUTANEA will provide what they deem as acceptance of a batch of Product or verbal notification of any perceived deficiencies at their discretion. A simple indication is all that's required as a condition to the delivery of Product to Cutanea's designated shipping agent in accordance with Section 3. If for any reason Supplier does receive any such notification, CUTANEA may follow up. The lack of notification shall not be deemed as the batch is accepted. If, once the Product is delivered, CUTANEA determines that there is any deficiency with respect to any Product, CUTANEA may notify Ferrer. Each notice of rejection to Supplier is not obliged to specify any failures. CUTANEA may or may not grant to Supplier (or its designee) the right to inspect or test said Product batch and potentially dispute CUTANEA rejection. In the event that Supplier disagrees with CUTANEA's defective Product claim, the issue shall not be submitted to an independent third party laboratory and whose decision may or may not be binding upon the Parties. The costs arising from the intervention and the costs of the replaced Products (including return and destruction costs of the defective Products) may not be borne by the party whose results were mistaken. As to any such Product batch which is determined to fail the Specifications (\"Rejected Product\"), CUTANEA shall have an obligation to pay for such Rejected Product and Supplier may not replace such Rejected Product as soon as possible and no later than ninety (90) days thereafter.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and contradiction to the acceptance and rejection of products. It changes from a requirement to give written acceptance within two days to Cutanea providing acceptance in their own vague manner at their own discretion. Notification of deficiencies are not required and are subject to 'perceived deficiencies'. It also removes the obligation to send to a third party for resolution and that costs will be borne by the mistaken party. It introduces that Cutanea must pay for rejected products and supplier has no obligation to send a replacement. It is now unclear if the original tests will be used or if a third party is involved.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Revenue' includes revenue from all content, while the modified definition restricts it to advertising sales only. The original definition of 'Net Revenue' includes a broader range of costs that are deducted. The modified 'Net Revenue' only includes direct advertising costs. This creates a contradiction in how revenue sharing is calculated, potentially leading to disputes.",

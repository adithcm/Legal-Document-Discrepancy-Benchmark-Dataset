                "original_text": "2.1. Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and shall continue thereafter for a period of twelve (12) months (the \"Initial Term\"). The Initial Term shall automatically renew for one-month periods thereafter unless either party provides 30- days advance notice of termination, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof. For purposes hereof, the Initial Term, together with any extension or renewal terms, shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the \"Term\".",

The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and shall continue thereafter for a period of twelve (12) months (the \"Initial Term\"). The Initial Term shall automatically renew for one-month periods thereafter unless either party provides 30- days advance notice of termination, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof. For purposes hereof, the Initial Term, together with any extension or renewal terms, shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the \"Term\". Notwithstanding the above, the Term shall be considered complete after Developer has delivered all items outlined in Schedule 1.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Term'. Initially, 'Term' is defined as a duration of time (12 months, potentially renewing). The added sentence suggests the 'Term' can end upon completion of deliverables in Schedule 1, regardless of the initial 12-month period. This creates ambiguity, as it's now unclear whether the agreement is time-bound or deliverable-bound.",

Developer shall be fully liable, without limitation, for money damages resulting from its improper or unauthorized use, modification, alteration, licensing or transfer of the Technology or Improvements, or resulting from its failure to provide functional and merchantable Improvements hereunder, which failure shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by Developer.",

Developer shall be liable for money damages resulting from its improper or unauthorized use, modification, alteration, licensing or transfer of the Technology or Improvements, or resulting from its failure to provide functional and merchantable Improvements hereunder, which failure may be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by Developer.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Developer shall be 'fully liable, without limitation,' and failure to provide functional improvements 'shall be deemed' a material breach. The modified text removes 'fully liable, without limitation,' suggesting there might be limitations. More importantly, it changes 'shall be deemed' to 'may be deemed,' introducing uncertainty regarding whether failure to provide functional improvements constitutes a material breach. This allows for subjective interpretation and disputes over liability.",

All notices sent under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified; (ii) when sent by e-mail PDF or confirmed facsimile, if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, if not, then on the next business day; (iii) three (3) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid; or (iv) two (2) days after deposit with an internationally recognized overnight courier, specifying two (2) day delivery, with written verification of receipt. Notices shall be sent to the Parties at the following addresses or fax numbers or such other addresses or fax numbers as the parties subsequently may provide in accordance with this Section 9.8:",

All notices sent under this Agreement must be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given only (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified. Other forms of communication, including but not limited to email or mail, will be accepted as a courtesy, but shall not be considered official notice under this agreement. Notices shall be sent to the Parties at the following addresses or fax numbers or such other addresses or fax numbers as the parties subsequently may provide in accordance with this Section 9.8:",
                "explanation": "The initial clause accepts four methods of delivery with clear terms for when notices are considered to have been served. The revision limits effective notification to only personal delivery, implying that while email and other mediums may be used, they bear no legal standing for notification. This clashes with implicit permission for email notification elsewhere in the agreement and other standard business practices.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'USER' is broad, encompassing anyone who accesses a Site. The changed definition adds the requirement of providing contact information. This creates a contradiction because the contract may refer to 'USERS' in contexts where contact information is not necessarily provided or collected, leading to ambiguity about who qualifies as a 'USER' in those situations.",

                "explanation": "The original definition excludes users who previously registered with Impresse. The modified definition includes them if they actively engage with the Co-Branded Site content. This creates a direct conflict as to which users are considered 'VerticalNet Impresse Users' for revenue-sharing purposes, creating uncertainty in calculating revenue sharing based on user activity.",

                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates specific methods for delivering official notices. The addition of email as an acceptable form of communication, coupled with the exception for 'urgent matters', creates a contradiction. The original clause requires a formal written notice, while the addition implies that for urgent matters, an email is sufficient. This is problematic because 'urgent' is not defined, leading to disputes about when an email is acceptable vs. when a formal written notice is required. This makes it unclear when a party is legally considered to have received a notice, especially in cases involving deadlines or time-sensitive actions.",

                "explanation": "The original definition refers to the preamble, while the modified text provides a direct definition. This creates a contradiction if the preamble has a different meaning or expands upon the definition, leading to uncertainty over what 'Acquiror' precisely refers to.",

                "changed_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, \"Superior Offer\" shall mean any offer made by a competitor to acquire any portion of the Target Securities. The Board of Directors retains absolute discretion in determining if the offer constitutes a Superior Offer and will be not required to consult legal counsel.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies multiple factors for determining a Superior Offer, including consultation with legal counsel and financial advisors. The modified text drastically simplifies this and grants the Board of Directors absolute discretion, creating conflict in determining what constitutes a Superior Offer.",

Subject to the goals, parameters and integration activities outlined in the integration plan, SPI shall (i) provide the employees of the Company with employee incentives under such terms and conditions as not less favorable (taking into account, among other things, tax implications) to the incentives made available by the Company to such its employees as of the date of this Agreement […***…], and thereafter under such terms and conditions as not less favorable (taking into account, among other things, tax implications, local laws, and SPI's practices with respect to the employees of Acquiror) to those of the incentives made available by SPI to its employees, and (ii) […***…] the […***…] of the […***… ] of the […***…] as of the […***…] of this [… ***…] at […***…] the […***…] of the […***…] of the […***…] on […***…].

Regardless of if a plan is created, all employment contracts of the Company will be terminated within one month of the Closing Date and re-evaluated for continued need. The determination of who will be re-hired will be based on SPI's criteria and no prior agreements with the Company will influence that decision.",
                "explanation": "The original section states that SPI shall develop an integration plan in consultation with Company management and ensures employee incentives are not less favorable. The changed text gives SPI sole discretion over integration plans and promises a complete re-evaluation of employment contracts, which will result in the termination of all employment contracts, directly contradicting the intent to maintain current employment levels.",

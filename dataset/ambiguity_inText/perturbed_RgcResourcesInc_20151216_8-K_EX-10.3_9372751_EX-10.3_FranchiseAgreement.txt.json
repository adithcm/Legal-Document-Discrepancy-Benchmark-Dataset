                "original_text": "Grantee shall during the term of this Franchise maintain at least one business office within the Territorial Limits of Grantor. Such office shall be open at least forty (40) hours per week for the conduct of business between Grantee and its customers.",
                "changed_text": "Grantee shall during the term of this Franchise endeavor to maintain a business presence within a reasonable distance of the Territorial Limits of Grantor. While Grantee anticipates maintaining an office, the hours of operation are subject to change based on business needs and may vary from week to week.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the physical location of the business office and the guaranteed hours of operation. Section 4 initially mandates a business office within the Territorial Limits of the Grantor open for at least 40 hours per week. The modification weakens this requirement, suggesting the office might only be 'within a reasonable distance' and that the hours are flexible. This creates uncertainty about the level of service the Grantee is obligated to provide within the Grantor's territory.",

However, for matters of significant legal consequence, written notice may also be sent via standard postal mail to the physical addresses listed. The parties acknowledge that email delivery cannot be guaranteed, and it is each party's responsibility to confirm receipt of important notices.\n\nGrantor Email: townmanager@vintonva.gov\nGrantee Email: president@roanokegas.com\n\nGrantor Mailing Address: Town of Vinton, Attention: Town Manager, 311 S.

                "explanation": "This section previously dictated that all notices must be provided through certified mail or overnight courier, to the specified addresses. The changed section introduces email as a primary method of notification, but creates ambiguity on when physical mail is sufficient, or if both are needed for 'matters of significant legal consequence', undermining the original requirement for verified delivery and creating uncertainty about legally effective communication under the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement states a clear term of 20 years starting January 1, 2016. The modification introduces the possibility of early termination or renegotiation based on 'unforeseen circumstances'. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty about the actual duration of the franchise, as it is no longer a fixed term and dependent on subjective interpretations of 'unforeseen circumstances' and mutual agreement. The condition significantly weakens the original 20-year commitment.",

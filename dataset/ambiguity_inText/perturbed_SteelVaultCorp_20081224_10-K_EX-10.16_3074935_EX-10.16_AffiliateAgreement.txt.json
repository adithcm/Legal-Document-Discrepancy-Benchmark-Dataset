                "original_text": "Marketing Affiliate shall be responsible for collecting all amounts due directly from the Consumer and  shall bear sole responsibility for non-payment of any fees charged to the Consumer. Marketing Affiliate shall pay to  Equidata, as compensation for its providing of Services under this agreement, such amounts as outlined and detailed in  Exhibit A attached hereto. Such amounts shall be billed on a bi-monthly basis by Equidata and are due and payable in  full by Marketing Affiliate 30 days from the invoice date.",
                "changed_text": "Marketing Affiliate shall be responsible for collecting all amounts due directly from the Consumer but Equidata may directly bill and collect from consumers at its discretion. Marketing Affiliate shall pay to Equidata, as compensation for its providing of Services under this agreement, such amounts as outlined and detailed in  Exhibit A attached hereto. Such amounts shall be billed on a bi-monthly basis by Equidata and are due and payable in  full by Marketing Affiliate 60 days from the invoice date, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Marketing Affiliate is solely responsible for collecting payment from consumers. The modified text introduces ambiguity by allowing Equidata to also directly bill consumers. The original text has a payment timeline of 30 days, the modification has 60 days, unless agreed otherwise which further introduces uncertainty regarding payment terms.",

Equidata reserves the right to site inspect Marketing Affiliate's  physical location of business at any time.",
                "changed_text": "Equidata may audit, at the Marketing Affiliate's expense if non-compliance is found, the Marketing Affiliate's marketing, practices and activities for the  purpose of assuring compliance with this Agreement. Equidata may site inspect Marketing Affiliate's physical location of business, but only during normal business hours and with 24 hours prior notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Equidata bears the expense of audits, while the modified text shifts the cost to the Marketing Affiliate if non-compliance is found. The original allows Equidata to inspect the location at any time, where as the new text limits this time.",

                "changed_text": "Equidata and Marketing Affiliate each hereby agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless each other and  each of its employees, agents, officers, directors and shareholders from and against any claims, suits, demand or actions  arising from breach of any warranties under this Agreement, however only if such breach is proven to be intentional or grossly negligent. Claims arising out of failure to provide Services under this Agreement are excluded from this indemnification.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a broad indemnification for breaches of warranties or failure to provide services. The modified text narrows the scope of indemnification by requiring proof of intentional or grossly negligent conduct and excluding claims related to service failures. This creates contradiction as the standard for claiming indemnification has been dramatically changed.",

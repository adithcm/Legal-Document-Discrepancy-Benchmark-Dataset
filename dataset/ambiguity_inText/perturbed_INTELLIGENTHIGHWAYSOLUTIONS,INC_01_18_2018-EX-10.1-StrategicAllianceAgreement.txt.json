                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "When custom Products are designed, developed and to be delivered to Bravatek-identified perspective clients, the parties shall agree to a proposed sales price for use during the project in writing prior to the commencement of each project.",
                "changed_text": "When Products are to be delivered to Bravatek-identified prospective clients, Fazync may provide an initial estimated sales price, which is subject to change based on market conditions after the commencement of each project.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a written agreement on sales price before each project starts, ensuring a fixed cost. The modified version introduces flexibility by allowing Fazync to change the price after the project has started, creating ambiguity and potential conflict if Bravatek already based decisions on the initial price.",

                "original_text": "For a period of five (5) years after termination of this Agreement, the parties shall treat as confidential all information and take every reasonable precaution and use all reasonable efforts to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of the same. The parties agree to take all steps reasonably necessary and appropriate to ensure that their employees, agents, and/or assistants treat all information as confidential and to ensure that such employees, agents, and/or assistants are familiar with and abide by the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "For a period of two (2) years after termination of this Agreement, the parties shall treat as confidential all information, unless such information is generally known within their respective industries. The parties agree to inform their employees of the confidential nature of the information, but are not liable for breaches by agents or assistants.",
                "explanation": "The original text enforces confidentiality for five years after termination with a strong emphasis on taking all steps to prevent disclosure. The modified version reduces the period to two years and adds an exception for generally known information, which is vague. It also removes liability for agents and assistants, contradicting the comprehensive efforts required in the original.",

Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof and can be extended upon mutual agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement with thirty (30) days written notice, unless a specific project is underway, in which case termination can only occur after the project's completion.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates automatic renewal unless notice is given 90 days prior to expiration and termination with 90 days notice. The modified version removes automatic renewal and replaces it with mutual agreement for extension and shortens the notice period to 30 days but introduces a condition about project completion which adds conflicts with original term that may cause disputes about the termination rights.",

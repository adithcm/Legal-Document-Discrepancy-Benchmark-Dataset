                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Contract Territory' is the 'world'. The modified version introduces an exclusion ('excluding countries with restrictions on endorsement deals'). This creates ambiguity as to which countries are excluded and who determines these restrictions. Similarly, the original definition of 'North's Likeness' is broad. The modified version adds a clause ('when used in materials directly approved by North'), creating uncertainty about materials not directly approved. The original definition of 'North's Endorsement' is his public statements about the Product. The modified version adds a pre-approval requirement, which conflicts with his freedom of speech, if not pre-approved, it is not included in definition of North's Endorsement.",

                "explanation": "The original version stipulates that North 'agrees to' use F2 branded wedges.

It shall be an event of default hereunder by North if i) North shall materially breach this Agreement and such breach remains uncured  for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Company to North, or ii) North shall be indicted for a felony involving  moral turpitude which brings disrepute to the Company.",

                "explanation": "The original definition requires an indictment for a felony to trigger default. The modified version introduces a much broader and subjective criterion: mere accusation of any activity that *could* harm the company's reputation, as determined solely by the Company. This creates a conflict because a later section could be based upon North being indicted, when the new definition has already set the bar for an event of default to be much lower.",

                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13G (including amendments thereto) with respect to the Common Stock of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and further agree that this agreement be included as an exhibit to such filing.",

                "explanation": "By removing '(including amendments thereto),' the agreement becomes ambiguous regarding whether future amendments must be jointly filed. One interpretation is that only the original filing must be joint, while amendments may be filed independently. This contradicts the later statement that 'Each party to the agreement expressly authorizes each other party to file on its behalf any and all amendments to such statement,' which implies a continuing obligation for joint filing or express authorization. The contradiction is that one part of the agreement says only the original should be under 13G, and another one says all the amendments should be as well.",

                "changed_text": "Each party to the agreement authorizes each other party to file on its behalf amendments to such statement, provided prior written consent is obtained. Each party to this agreement agrees that this joint filing agreement may be signed in counterparts.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that each party 'expressly authorizes' the other to file amendments on their behalf without specifying any conditions. The changed text adds the condition 'provided prior written consent is obtained.' This creates a contradiction because the agreement now simultaneously grants express authorization and requires prior written consent, making the authorization no longer 'express.' This introduces uncertainty and could lead to disputes about whether filing an amendment without prior written consent constitutes a breach of the agreement. It's unclear what action constitutes 'expressly authorizes', given the new condition.",

                "explanation": "The original text asserts that the agreement was executed, implying a binding commitment to the documented terms. The added phrase, 'with the intention that its terms shall be interpreted broadly and subject to change based on the mutual convenience of the parties,' introduces a contradiction. It suggests that the agreement's terms are not fixed but are instead fluid and open to interpretation, undermining the formal execution. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of specific clauses and introduces subjectivity into the agreement, conflicting with the traditional legal understanding of an executed contract.",

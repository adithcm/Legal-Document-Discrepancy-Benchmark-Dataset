                "original_text": "\"Lead-time\" is defined as the amount of time between Manufacturer receiving an order and EMV receipt of the goods ordered. The ordering processes are listed in Section 4.",
                "changed_text": "\"Lead-time\" is defined as the amount of time between Manufacturer receiving an order and EMV receipt of the goods ordered. For the purpose of clarity in emergency production needs, Lead-time also refers to the time from EMV sending the order to the Manufacturer to when the first unit of product ships for critical components.",
                "explanation": "This adds an additional definition of 'Lead-time' that is more narrow (critical components only), potentially conflicting with the broader, original definition. This can cause confusion regarding which lead time applies in specific situations.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by specifying a different warranty period for electronic components (one year) compared to the general warranty period of three years. This creates ambiguity regarding which warranty period applies to products with electronic components.",

The notice must set forth the basis of the claim in reasonable detail. EMV acknowledges that failure to notify Manufacturer of a claim within specified period in reasonable detail shall constitute acceptance of the goods.",
                "changed_text": "EMV has the right to examine the goods on arrival. For easily identifiable defects, EMV has Fifteen (15) business days to notify Manufacturer of any claim for damages on account of the condition, grade or quality of the goods, or non-conformity to the Specifications. However, for latent defects not discoverable upon initial inspection, EMV has ninety (90) days from the date of discovery to notify the Manufacturer. The notice must set forth the basis of the claim in reasonable detail. EMV acknowledges that failure to notify Manufacturer of a claim within specified period in reasonable detail shall constitute acceptance of the goods.",
                "explanation": "This adds a new timeframe for claims related to 'latent defects' (90 days from discovery). This conflicts with the original statement of fifteen business days, creating a contradiction as it's unclear which notification period should apply and what defines a 'latent' vs 'easily identifiable' defect.",

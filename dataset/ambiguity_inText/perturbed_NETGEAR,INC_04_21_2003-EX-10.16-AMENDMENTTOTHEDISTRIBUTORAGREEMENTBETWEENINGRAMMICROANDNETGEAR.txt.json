                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without prior written permission from the other party, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any attempt by either party to assign any right, or delegate any duty or obligation which arises under the Agreement without such permission will be voidable.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without prior written permission from the other party. Any attempt by either party to assign any right, or delegate any duty or obligation which arises under the Agreement without such permission will be voidable. Such permission can be withheld at any time, for any reason, at the sole discretion of the granting party.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that permission to assign should not be 'unreasonably withheld or delayed', implying a standard of reasonableness. The modified clause contradicts this by saying permission can be withheld for any reason at the grantor's sole discretion, removing the reasonableness requirement and creating uncertainty on the assignment terms.",

NETGEAR reserves the right to add Products to the Price List at its sole discretion and any such additional Products shall be offered to Distributor at discounts to be determined at that time.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor agrees that the foregoing Discount is only applicable to Products included on the NETGEAR Price List on the Effective Date of this Agreement. NETGEAR reserves the right to add Products to the Price List at its sole discretion. NETGEAR is under no obligation to offer Distributor discounts on these additional products.",
                "explanation": "The original states discounts on new products 'shall be offered' to the distributor, albeit at rates to be determined. The modified version says NETGEAR is 'under no obligation' to offer discounts, directly contradicting the original and creating confusion over the distributor's pricing on new products.",

                "original_text": "During the initial one year period beginning on the Amendment Date, Distributor shall be the only distributor appointed by NETGEAR in [*], subject to Distributor conducting mutually agreed to marketing activities as described in the Marketing Plan for [*] to be developed and agreed to by and between the parties and which shall be attached to and made a part of this Agreement as Exhibit 4a.",
                "changed_text": "During the initial one year period beginning on the Amendment Date, Distributor shall be the only distributor appointed by NETGEAR in [*]. However, NETGEAR reserves the right to appoint additional distributors at its discretion, even within the one year period if it deems necessary for market penetration.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants exclusivity to the distributor. The changed text immediately undermines this exclusivity by allowing NETGEAR to appoint other distributors if they deem it necessary for market penetration, which can be subjective and conflict with the initial statement of exclusivity.",

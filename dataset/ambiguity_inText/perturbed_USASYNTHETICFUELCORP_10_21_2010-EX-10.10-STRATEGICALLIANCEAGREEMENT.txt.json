                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by weakening the obligations regarding confidential information. Originally, the parties 'shall require' their employees, advisors, etc., to abide by the confidentiality terms and were 'responsible' for any breaches by them. Now, they only 'encourage' adherence, and the responsibility clause is removed, significantly reducing the enforceability of the confidentiality provisions. Also, there are changes in timeframe of returning, and certification, creating contradictions.",

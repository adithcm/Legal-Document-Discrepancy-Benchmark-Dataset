For the purposes of Section 9 only, ERB also includes the sale of used rental equipment.\n\n1.2 \"Interim Period\" means a period of four (4) years commencing from the Effective Date of this Agreement.\n\n1.3 \"Other Intellectual Property\" means any copyrights, trade dress, content, designs or other indicia and/or social media accounts and handles owned by THC and/or HSI that are already used or otherwise in the possession of HERC relating to the HERTZ and HERTZ-formative trademarks and logos in connection with the Equipment Rental Business.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Equipment Rental Business\" (ERB) is expanded in Section 1.1 to include the sale of used rental equipment, but only for the purpose of Section 9. This creates an ambiguity because, in all other sections of the contract, ERB retains its original, narrower definition. This could lead to disputes regarding the scope of the non-competition clause in Section 9, as itâ€™s unclear whether selling used equipment is prohibited under the original ERB definition.",

                "explanation": "Section 8.2 originally stipulates that THC or HSI can immediately terminate the agreement if HERC has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it and it is not dismissed within *thirty (30) days*. The edited version of Section 8.2 changes this period to *ninety (90) days*. This creates a contradiction that affects the termination rights. It creates ambiguity on the timeline, which HERC should be given to dismiss the petition in bancruptcy.",

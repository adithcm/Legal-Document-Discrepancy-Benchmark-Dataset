HSNS agrees to allow E.piphany, directly or indirectly, to audit HSNS's business records as kept by HSNS in its normal course of business to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the audit reveals that HSNS has failed to comply with the terms of this Agreement, in addition to all other remedies available to E.piphany at law or equity, HSNS shall immediately reimburse E.piphany for any unpaid amounts due and the cost of the audit.",

This creates a direct conflict, making it unclear for how long HSNS is obligated to maintain records, which could lead to disputes during audits or legal proceedings.",

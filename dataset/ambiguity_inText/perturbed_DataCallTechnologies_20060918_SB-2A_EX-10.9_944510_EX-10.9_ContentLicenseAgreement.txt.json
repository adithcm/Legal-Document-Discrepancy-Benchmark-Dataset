However, the modified text suggests that 'Content' is defined by plan_b's discretion, which could include materials not listed in Appendix 2. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes over what constitutes 'Content' under the agreement.",

The Initial Term shall automatically be           extended  for  an additional period of half a year unless either party           provides  the  other party with written notification of termination of           the  letter  Agreement  at  least 60 days prior to end of such period.",

                "explanation": "Section 7.1 originally stated the 'Initial Term' is automatically extended for half a year unless a party provides a termination notice. The modified version states that it 'may' be extended at the discretion of plan_b for up to one year. This introduces a contradiction because the original text specified an automatic renewal of half a year versus the potential for renewal of upto one year at the discretion of one party. This favors one party, leading to conflicting interpretations on term extensions and disputes.",

Such  report  shall  be  provided  to LICENSOR in electronic           format  within  6  weeks  of  the  end  of  a  quarter.",

Such  report shall be provided to LICENSOR when feasible.",
                "explanation": "Section 3.3 originally mandates plan_b to provide a detailed written record within 6 weeks of each quarter's end. The changed version introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall' to 'shall endeavor' and stating that reports 'may include' estimates depending on 'resource availability' and are submitted 'when feasible.' This creates a contradiction if other sections of the contract depend on accurate quarterly reports because this is not guranteed by the modified section.",

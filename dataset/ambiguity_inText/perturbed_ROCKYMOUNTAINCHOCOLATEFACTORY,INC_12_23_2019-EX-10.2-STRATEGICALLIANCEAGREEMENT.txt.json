                "original_text": "(y) \"Permitted Transfer\" means (i) any Transfer to one or more entities that are, directly or indirectly, wholly owned by Farids or any Family Member of TF, (ii) any Transfer to one or more entities that are members of the Farids Group and (iii) Transfer made following a Change in Control of Farids or EA or made pursuant to a Change in Control that constitutes a sale of the Company as a whole; provided, with respect to each of clause (i)-(iii), so long as the transferee (other than a transferee that already is party to this Agreement) agrees to be subject to the terms of this Agreement (subject to any limitation on the assignment of rights by such Person to the transferee in connection with such Transfer) by executing and delivering a joinder agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto.",

However, for clauses (ii) and (iii), no joinder agreement is required for the transfer to be considered a Permitted Transfer.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an inconsistency regarding the requirement of a joinder agreement for different types of Permitted Transfers. Originally, all three clauses required a joinder agreement. Now, only clause (i) requires it, while clauses (ii) and (iii) do not, creating confusion as to which transfers necessitate the agreement and potentially leading to disputes over the validity of transfers.",

The Farids Group shall have the right to make two (2) Demand Requests on or after the date that is the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement; provided, that the Farids Group shall not make more than one (1) Demand Request within any six-month period.",

                "explanation": "The modification swaps the timelines for filing an Eligible Resale Registration Statement and a Resale Shelf Registration Statement. Now the Eligible Resale Registration Statement must be filed in 30 days and the Resale Shelf Registration Statement must be filed in 90 days. This contradicts the original agreement, creating uncertainty about the agreed-upon deadlines and could lead to disputes if the company fails to meet the shorter deadline incorrectly stipulated for the Eligible Resale Registration Statement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by simultaneously stating that the lock-up period is limited to 90 days while still allowing the Company to impose stop transfer instructions for a period of 180 days. This creates ambiguity as to the actual duration of the lock-up restriction. Furthermore, the requirement for the ownership percentage has been raised to 5%, adding to the inconsistency. This situation would create uncertainty for Farids Group and is subjected to dispute.",

                "original_text": "1.0 DEFINITIONS The following capitalized terms will have the meanings set forth after each term: \"Affiliate\" means any natural person or firm, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, trust or other entity which, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common Control with, the subject entity.",
                "changed_text": "1.0 DEFINITIONS The following capitalized terms will have the meanings set forth after each term: \"Affiliate\" means any natural person or firm which, directly controls the subject entity. Control must be demonstrated through ownership of more than 50% of voting shares.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Affiliate.' The original text broadly defines an Affiliate based on any form of direct or indirect control, whereas the modified text restricts the definition to only those with direct control demonstrated through a majority ownership of voting shares. This could lead to disputes regarding the scope of contractual obligations towards entities with indirect control or those controlled through contractual agreements, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "5.1.15 not become a Competitor in the hotel market segment, irrespective of upscale or any other market segment considerations, as determined by the Franchisee in good faith; and shall only be determined after the end of 3 years of operations.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing a clear, objective standard (STR's determination of upscale hotel market segment) with a subjective one ('the Franchisee in good faith'). Also the period for evaluation changes from current to after '3 years of operations'. It now enables a definition of market segment as subject to good faith, meaning what market the hotel segment is not clearly defined creating an enforcement uncertainty.",

The original text provides a minimum retention period of four years, regardless of our stated record retention requirements. The modified text removes this minimum and creates a dependence only on our record retention requirements creating contradiction, allowing for potentially shorter retention periods and conflict in cases where our guidelines are less than four years.",

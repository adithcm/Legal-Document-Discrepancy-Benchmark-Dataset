Approved Merchants may also include Merchants converted to the Program as part of the initial BIN/ICA transfer and/or subsequently acquired Merchants that meet the established criteria for participation in the Program, including the Merchant Processing Policy, and whose sponsorship is assigned to Bank.",

Approved Merchants will only include Merchants directly solicited and approved under this agreement.",

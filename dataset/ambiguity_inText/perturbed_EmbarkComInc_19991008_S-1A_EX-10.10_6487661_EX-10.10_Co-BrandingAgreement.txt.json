                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' is broad and subjective, encompassing information that the receiving party 'reasonably should know' is confidential. The modified definition is narrower, requiring explicit marking and written format. This creates a contradiction because under the first definition, certain unlabelled information could be considered confidential, while under the second, it would not, leading to potential disputes over what constitutes 'Confidential Information'.",

                "explanation": "The original definition states persistent sponsorship placement, as judged by Sponsor at its discretion does not include run-of-site banner advertisements or other rotating promotional placements. The modified definition introduces ambiguity. The original text favors the sponsor while the modified version favors Snap's interpretation, leading to a potential dispute of what constitutes a sponsorship.",

The modified definition imposes an additional condition where the failure to do business in the normal course leads to negative financial impact on the other party. The change introduces a degree of uncertainty and could lead to disputes over what constitutes a material breach and negative financial impact.",

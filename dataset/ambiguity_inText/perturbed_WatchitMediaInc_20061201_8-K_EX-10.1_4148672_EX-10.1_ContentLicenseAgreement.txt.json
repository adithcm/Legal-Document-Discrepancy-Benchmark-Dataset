                "changed_text": "Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to not edit or modify the above content unless it deems such edits necessary for legal compliance.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states that Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to not edit or modify the content. The modified text introduces an exception for legal compliance. This creates a contradiction, because 'legal compliance' is vague. It is not clear what constitutes a valid legal compliance requirement, potentially leading to disputes over what changes are permissible. Without defining the scope of 'legal compliance,' Oceanic could make modifications that Watchit disagrees with, leading to enforcement difficulties.",

                "changed_text": "Watchit shall have the exclusive right to sell third party advertising as sponsors of their content, but Oceanic Time Warner Cable reserves the right to approve all advertisers before placement. Watchit will have the right to brand the content under the Watchit brand and place a \"bug\" on the screen identifying the content with a Watchit trademark, so long as it doesn't interfere with Oceanic Time Warner Cable's branding guidelines.",
                "explanation": "Originally, Watchit has the exclusive right to sell third party advertising and branding. The modified version gives Oceanic Time Warner Cable approval power over advertisers and imposes branding restrictions. If another section of the agreement explicitly guarantees Watchit's complete creative control over its content, this modification creates a contradiction, making enforcement unclear. For example, if Oceanic rejects an advertiser vital to Watchit's revenue stream, based on a subjective assessment of 'branding guidelines,' it could lead to disputes.",

                "changed_text": "Ocean Time Warner Cable will provide Watchit with data on viewership to both Channel 777. Oceanic Time Warner Cable may provide, at its discretion, data specifically to the content provided by Watchit, but is not obligated to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Oceanic Time Warner Cable *will* provide viewership data, specifically to the Watchit content. The modification makes providing the data for Watchit's content discretionary. This contradiction impacts enforcement if Watchit needs granular data to track ad performance and justify its rates. If a later section of the contract bases renewal or pricing on viewership numbers, the ambiguity over access to that data makes it unclear whether Watchit can actually fulfill its obligations or defend its pricing.",

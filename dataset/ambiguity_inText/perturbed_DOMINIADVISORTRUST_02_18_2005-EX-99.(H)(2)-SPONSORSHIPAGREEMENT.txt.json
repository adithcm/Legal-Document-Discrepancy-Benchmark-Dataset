                "original_text": "For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a fee accrued daily and payable monthly at an annual rate equal to 0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets for the Trust's then current fiscal year. If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be prorated. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be determined at the sole discretion of the Board of Trustees. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in a manner deemed appropriate by Domini.",

As used in this Section 4, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by limiting the Sponsor's liability and narrowing the definition of 'Sponsor', conflicting with the broader definition previously given.",

The Sponsor may only terminate this agreement if there is a material breach of the agreement by the trust, and after a 30 day cure period.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by giving different requirements for the two parties to terminate. Previously, both parties could terminate at any time with a 60 day notice. Now, the Sponsor can only terminate if the trust materially breaches the contract.",

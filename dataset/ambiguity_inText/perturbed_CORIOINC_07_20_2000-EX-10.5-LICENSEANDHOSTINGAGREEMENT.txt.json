                "explanation": "The original definition restricts 'CUSTOMER(S)' to those within the 'Corio Market Segment' and having principal executive offices in the Territory. The modified definition broadens this to include any entity showing interest, regardless of location or segment. This creates a contradiction as an entity outside the original defined segment could now be considered a 'Customer'. This could create uncertainty in enforcement.",

Commerce One warrants that the Software and         MarketSite.net Service will perform in substantial accordance with the         Documentation, and the media on which the Software is distributed will         be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use, for         a period of sixty (60) days from the Effective Date, but in no event not         later than December 31, 1999 (the \"Warranty Period\"). In addition,         Commerce One warrants that during the Warranty Period the Software and         MarketSite.net Service is free of any willfully introduced computer         virus, or any other similar harmful, malicious or hidden program or         data, which is designed to disable, erase, or alter the Software, or any         other files, data, or software. If during the Warranty Period the         Software and MarketSite.net Service does not perform in substantial         compliance with the Documentation, Commerce One shall take all         commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Software and         MarketSite.net Service, or if correction of the Software and         MarketSite.net Service is reasonably not possible, replace such Software         and MarketSite.net Service free of charge. Commerce One will replace any         defective media returned to Commerce One during the Warranty Period. In         the event any such breach of warranty can not be reasonably corrected at         Commerce One's sole expense, Corio has the right to terminate this         Agreement and receive a refund of all prepaid fees. The foregoing are         Corio's sole and exclusive remedies for breach of product warranty. The         warranty set forth above is made to and for the benefit of Corio only.         The warranty shall not apply only if:\n\n     (a)     the Software and MarketSite.net Service has been not properly                 installed and used at all times and in accordance with the                 Documentation; and\n\n     (b)     Corio has requested modifications, alterations or additions to                 the Software and MarketSite.net Service that cause it to deviate                 from the Documentation.",
                "changed_text": "7.3     Product Warranty. Commerce One offers no explicit warranties regarding the performance of the Software and MarketSite.net Service. The Software and MarketSite.net Service are provided 'as is,' and Commerce One assumes no responsibility for ensuring that it performs according to the Documentation or is free from defects. Any support or maintenance provided shall not be construed as a warranty. Commerce One may, at its discretion, offer assistance in troubleshooting or resolving issues, but is not obligated to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original warranty explicitly states a 60-day period where the software will perform as expected and be free of defects. The modified text completely removes this warranty, stating the product is 'as is' with no guarantee of performance. This contradiction significantly impacts risk allocation and creates uncertainty about Commerce One's obligations if the software malfunctions during the 60 day window.",

If either party materially breaches any term or condition         of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within-thirty (30) days         after receiving written notice of the breach, the nonbreaching party may         terminate this Agreement on written notice at any time following the end         of such-thirty (30) day period. This Agreement shall terminate         immediately upon notice if either party becomes insolvent (i.e., becomes         unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business as they come         due) or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Compliance by         the Software with the Software's specifications after expiration of the         Warranty Period shall be deemed a material condition of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "11.2    Termination. If either party wishes to terminate this Agreement, they may do so with ninety (90) days written notice to the other party, regardless of any breach or insolvency. Such termination will not result in penalties or liabilities for either party.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows termination for material breach after a 30-day cure period or immediately for insolvency. The modified text allows termination for any reason with 90-days notice, superseding the conditions for material breach or insolvency. This creates a contradiction because now there's no need to prove material breach or insolvency to terminate the agreement.",

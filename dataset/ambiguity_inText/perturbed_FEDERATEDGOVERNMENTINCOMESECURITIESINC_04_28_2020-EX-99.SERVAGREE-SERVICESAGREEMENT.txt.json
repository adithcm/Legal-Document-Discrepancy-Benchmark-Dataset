FASC shall create and maintain all necessary books and records in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to records required by Section 31(a) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, as the same may be amended from time to time, pertaining to the Services performed by it and not otherwise created and maintained by another party. Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by FASC for the periods and in the places required by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act. The books and records pertaining to any Account which are in the possession of FAS shall be the property of such Account. The Account, or its owners or authorized representatives, shall have access to such books and records at all times during FASC's normal business hours. Upon reasonable request, copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by FASC to the Account or the Account's owners or authorized representatives.",

FASC shall create and maintain all necessary books and records in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to records required by Section 31(a) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, as the same may be amended from time to time, pertaining to the Services performed by it and not otherwise created and maintained by another party. Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by FASC for a period of three years, unless otherwise dictated by specific regulatory requirements. The books and records pertaining to any Account which are in the possession of FAS shall be the property of such Account. The Account, or its owners or authorized representatives, shall have access to such books and records only during the first year following the end of the service agreement. Upon a request made within 30 days of the services agreement termination, copies of any such books and records shall be provided to the Account or the Account's owners or authorized representatives; after such time, any requests will incur a processing fee.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies record maintenance according to applicable laws, including Rule 31a-2. The modified text introduces a conflicting three-year retention period and limits access and provisions for copies. This creates ambiguity, as it's unclear whether FASC must adhere to Rule 31a-2, a potentially longer retention timeframe, or the three-year period. The change in access to records creates further uncertainty in the rights of the account owners.",

Limitation of Liability and Indemnification.\n\n(a) FASC shall not be responsible for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Advisor or any Account in connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates, except a loss resulting from willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by it of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "4. Limitation of Liability and Indemnification.\n\n(a) FASC's liability for any error of judgment or mistake of law is capped at $10,000, regardless of whether the error resulted from willful malfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence. This limitation does not apply to breaches of confidentiality.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a broad exception to the limitation of liability for acts of 'willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence'. The modified version introduces a monetary cap ($10,000) on FASC's liability, even for errors resulting from those very acts which were originally excluded from limitation, creating a contradiction. There is now ambiguity on whether the 'willful malfeasance' exception still applies or if it is superseded by the $10,000 cap.",

Duration and Termination.\n\n(a) Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the effective date first above written and shall continue until terminated by mutual agreement of the parties hereto or by either party on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party hereto.",
                "changed_text": "5. Duration and Termination.\n\n(a) Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the effective date first above written and shall continue for a period of five years, renewable automatically for successive one-year terms unless either party provides 30 days written notice prior to the renewal date. However, either party may terminate this agreement with 90 days written notice, subject to a termination fee of $50,000.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows termination by either party with 60 days' notice. The modified version introduces a fixed five-year term with automatic renewals, a shorter 30-day notice period for preventing renewal, a longer 90-day notice period to actually terminate the agreement and a $50,000 termination fee. This creates a conflict: Is the agreement terminable with 60 days' notice as before, or is it subject to the new conditions? There is uncertainty on whether either party can terminate at any time with 60 days' written notice or if the agreement has a fixed term with a termination fee.",

                "original_text": "Broker Dealer agrees to return promptly to Issuer all compensation received for any Annuity Contract returned within the \"free look\" period as specified in the Annuity Contract. Issuer expressly reserves the right to change the broker dealer of record or Registered Representative in the event an Annuity Contract owner so requests.",
                "changed_text": "Broker Dealer agrees to return all compensation received for any Annuity Contract returned within the \"free look\" period as specified in the Annuity Contract, provided such return is feasible and doesn't unduly burden the Broker Dealer. Issuer reserves the right to change the broker dealer of record or Registered Representative in the event an Annuity Contract owner so requests, subject to Broker Dealer's approval.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a clear obligation for the Broker Dealer to return compensation. The modified text introduces ambiguity by adding 'provided such return is feasible and doesn't unduly burden the Broker Dealer', creating a loophole. Similarly, the Issuer's right to change the broker dealer is made subject to Broker Dealer's approval, conflicting with the original apparent unilateral right of the Issuer, potentially leading to enforcement issues.",

                "original_text": "Broker Dealer will promptly forward to the appropriate office of Distributor, or its authorized designee, all Annuity Contract applications along with other documents, if any, and any payments received with such applications and will have no rights of set off for any reason. Any Annuity Contract application that is rejected, together with any payment made and other documents submitted, shall be returned to Broker Dealer or the source of the payments.",
                "changed_text": "Broker Dealer will endeavor to forward to the appropriate office of Distributor, or its authorized designee, all Annuity Contract applications along with other documents, if any, and any payments received with such applications and retains the right of set off for reasonable expenses incurred in processing the applications. Any Annuity Contract application that is rejected, together with any payment made and other documents submitted, may be returned to Broker Dealer or the source of the payments at Distributor's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Originally, the Broker Dealer had a strict obligation to forward applications promptly and had no right of set off. The modified text weakens the forwarding obligation by replacing 'will promptly forward' with 'will endeavor to forward', introducing wiggle room. Furthermore, it grants the Broker Dealer the right of set off, directly contradicting the original statement. The rejected application return now falls at the Distributor's discretion as opposed to a clear shall. These changes introduce ambiguity and potential conflict.",

                "original_text": "The activities of all Registered Representatives, employees and agents (\"producers\") will be under the direct supervision and control of Broker Dealer. The right of Registered Representatives to solicit applications for the purchase and service of Annuity Contracts is subject to their continued compliance with the rules and procedures that may be established by Broker Dealer, or Issuer, including, but not limited to, those set forth in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The activities of all Registered Representatives, employees and agents (\"producers\") will generally be guided by the supervision and control of Broker Dealer. The right of Registered Representatives to solicit applications for the purchase and service of Annuity Contracts is subject to their compliance with the rules and procedures recommended by Broker Dealer, and Issuer, including, but not limited to, those set forth in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Originally, the supervision and control of producers was 'direct,' creating a clear supervisory responsibility. Now it is 'generally guided by'. Similarly, the compliance with rules is now with 'recommended' rules. This introduces ambiguity as to the level of responsibility and control the Broker Dealer actually has, making it unclear how strict adherence to rules is enforced. This contradiction impacts liability and duty of care.",

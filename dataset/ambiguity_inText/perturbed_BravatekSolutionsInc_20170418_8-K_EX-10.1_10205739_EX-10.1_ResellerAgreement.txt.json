This creates a conflict because Section 10(e) mentions the right to payments accruing prior to termination survives termination, implying continued obligations, but the exclusivity is no longer explicitly enforced after termination.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'and fails to fully cure such breach within fifteen (15) business days of written notice from Reseller describing the breach' from Section 10b, it now contradicts Section 10c, which states that Company also has the right to cure breaches. The Reseller can now terminate for any breach, regardless of whether Company can cure it, while Company still has the right to cure. This creates an imbalance in termination rights and potential disputes over what constitutes grounds for immediate termination by Reseller.",

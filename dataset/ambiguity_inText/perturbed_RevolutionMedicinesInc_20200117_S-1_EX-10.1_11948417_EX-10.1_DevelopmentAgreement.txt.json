                "changed_text": "1.77 \"Phase 2 Clinical Trial\" means a Clinical Trial of a Product conducted on a small number of subjects for initially assessing the safety profile of a pharmaceutical product and determining the appropriate dosage range, in a manner that is generally consistent with 21 C.F.R. § 312.21(a), as amended (or its successor regulation), or a similar clinical study prescribed by the Regulatory Authorities in a country or jurisdiction outside the United States, excluding, for clarity, any investigator-initiated Clinical Trials unless agreed to by the JRDC.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the definition of a 'Phase 2 Clinical Trial'. The original text defines it as evaluating effectiveness, while the modified version defines it as primarily assessing the safety profile. This contradiction can lead to disputes over the scope and purpose of Phase 2 trials under the agreement.",

In the changed text, RevMed retains no rights. There is a clear contradiction to see how the agreement will be enforced.",

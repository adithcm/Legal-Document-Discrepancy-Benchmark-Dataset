                "changed_text": "An \"Impression\" is defined as the display of the Tickets Portal to a user. MP3.com only counts impressions to users who are logged in and have provided their email address.",
                "explanation": "Section 2 defines an 'Impression' as simply displaying the Tickets Portal. The modification introduces a conflicting definition by specifying that only impressions to logged-in users with provided email addresses count. This creates uncertainty because the initial definition is broad, while the modified one is restrictive. This affects how MP3.com fulfills the guaranteed minimum of 3,000,000 impressions, creating ambiguity that could lead to a legal dispute. One party may argue based on the initial definition, while the other party may rely on the criteria of the second, conflicting definition.",

                "changed_text": "Tickets agrees to initially accept MP3.com's measurement of Impressions (the \"Count\") but retains the right to challenge the data within 72 hours of receiving the data, using any commercially reasonable method. However, the audit described below is the *only* method of recourse to challenge the count *after* 72 hours have passed.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a conflict regarding the auditing process. The original section allows Tickets to audit MP3.com's records, implying an ongoing right. The modified section introduces a tight 72-hour window to challenge impressions with unspecified methods, then restricts further challenges exclusively to the audit. The contradiction arises because the original clause implies a standing right to audit, while the modification creates a limited window for alternate challenges, creating potential conflict over which challenges are valid, particularly if a reasonable method is not explicitly accepted by MP3.com.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement may not be assigned by Tickets without MP3.com's written consent, which shall be promptly granted or denied and not unreasonably withheld, except that Tickets may assign this Agreement without MP3.com's consent if another entity acquires substantially all the assets of Tickets.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may not be assigned by Tickets without MP3.com's written consent. MP3.com's decision is final and at its sole discretion. In the event of acquisition, the determination of whether substantially all assets have been transferred is made solely by MP3.com.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows assignment in case of acquisition of substantially all assets and states MP3.com cannot 'unreasonably' withhold consent. The modified version removes both conditions. It states that MP3.com's consent for assignment is at its sole discretion, and the decision of whether 'substantially all assets' were transferred is solely up to MP3.com. This creates a conflict: the initial clause suggests there are objective criteria and a duty to be reasonable, whereas the modification grants MP3.com unilateral control, undermining the protection the original clause afforded to Tickets. This is impactful as the objective criteria, for the assignment of the contract, becomes a subjective and unilateral power.",

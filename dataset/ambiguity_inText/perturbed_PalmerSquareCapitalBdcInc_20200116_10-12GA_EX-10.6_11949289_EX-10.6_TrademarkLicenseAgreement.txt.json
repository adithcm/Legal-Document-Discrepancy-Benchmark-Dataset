Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark solely and exclusively as a component of Licensee's own corporate name and in connection with marketing the investment management, investment consultation and investment advisory services that Investment Advisor may provide to Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this License, and except as provided above, neither Licensee nor any affiliate, owner, director, officer, employee or agent thereof shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivative thereof in the Territory without the prior express written consent of Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion and shall not use the Licensed Mark for any purpose outside the Territory. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark as a component of Licensee's own corporate name and generally in connection with the operation of its business. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this License, and except as provided above, Licensee may also use the Licensed Mark in other contexts as reasonably determined by Licensee, provided that such use does not, in Licensor's reasonable opinion, materially damage the reputation of the Licensed Mark. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the scope of the license. Originally, the license was explicitly tied to marketing investment-related services provided by Investment Advisor. The modified version broadens the scope to 'generally in connection with the operation of its business' and allows for 'other contexts as reasonably determined by Licensee,' potentially conflicting with the original, narrower definition and creating uncertainty about the permissible use of the Licensed Mark.",

This Agreement shall be terminable by Licensor at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that Licensor or Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of Licensee's use of the Licensed Mark; by Licensor or Licensee upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the other party; or by Licensee at any time in the event Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of Licensee's rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of Licensor.",

The altered version removes the condition of needing Licensor's consent for assignment or sublicensing as a reason for termination and adds 'without any restrictions or conditions'. This creates a conflict, as the original text limits Licensee's termination rights, while the modified text provides unrestricted termination rights, leading to ambiguity about when Licensee can terminate the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the Licensee needs permission for sublicensing and assigning, the consent can be granted or withheld by Licensor in its sole discretion. The modified text suggests a condition of reasonableness. This change introduces a direct contradiction: the original suggests unconditional discretion, the modified text suggests the need for 'reasonable cause.' This conflict creates uncertainty regarding the conditions for assignment, opening the door to disputes about the interpretation of what constitutes 'reasonable cause' and the extent of Licensor's discretion.",

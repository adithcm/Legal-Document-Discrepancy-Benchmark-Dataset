In order to maintain the exclusive rights to sell, lease, distribute and service Products in the Market, the Distributor must use all commercially reasonably efforts to purchase for sale to subdistributors the following minimum quantities of the Products from the Company: On the commencement of the Term Distributor will issue to the Company an irrevocable letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference. The LC shall have a two (2) month term, and shall be renewed for five (5) consecutive bimonthly periods. A minimum of a $250,000.00 purchase order must be received by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month period. The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for Distributor's purchases, which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7.",

In order to maintain the exclusive rights to sell, lease, distribute and service Products in the Market, the Distributor *should endeavor* to purchase for sale to subdistributors the following minimum quantities of the Products from the Company: On the commencement of the Term Distributor will issue to the Company an irrevocable letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference. The LC shall have a two (2) month term, and *may be* renewed for five (5) consecutive bimonthly periods. A minimum of a $250,000.00 purchase order *should be encouraged* to be received by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month period. The Company *is expected* to draw funds from the LC to pay for Distributor's purchases, which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'must use all commercially reasonably efforts' to '*should endeavor*', 'shall be renewed' to '*may be*', 'must be received' to '*should be encouraged* to be received' and 'may draw' to '*is expected* to draw' significantly weakens the obligation on the distributor, creating ambiguity about the level of commitment required. This conflicts with the original intent of setting minimum purchase requirements to maintain exclusivity.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'warranties set forth herein' with '*industry standards*' weakens the specific warranty, and changing 'warrants' to '*endeavors*' and '*aims*' further reduces the guarantee of quality, creating uncertainty as to what standards the products must actually meet and the level of commitment for quality.",

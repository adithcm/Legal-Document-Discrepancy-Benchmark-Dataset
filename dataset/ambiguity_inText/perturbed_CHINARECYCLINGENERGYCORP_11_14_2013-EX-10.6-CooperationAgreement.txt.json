                "original_text": "The date when Party A completes the construction and installation of CDQ system and CDQ waste heat power generation system and the power generating system has been in operation and meets the requirements of the design standard for 72 hours. The Parties agree that date after the recycling project meets the evaluation requirement as the starting date for the recycling project. From that date, Party B shall pay the service fees monthly according to the power generated and Party B shall also pay for the power generated during the 72 hours testing run period.",
                "changed_text": "The date when Party A completes the construction and installation of CDQ system and CDQ waste heat power generation system and the power generating system has been in operation and meets the requirements of the design standard for 72 hours. The Parties agree that the starting date for the recycling project will be the date Party A notifies Party B in writing of the system's readiness. From that date, Party B shall pay the service fees monthly according to the power generated; the payment for the 72 hours testing run will be subject to a separate negotiation.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by changing the definition of the 'starting date'. Originally, it was tied to objective criteria (completion, meeting standards, and evaluation). The modified version shifts it to a subjective notification by Party A, potentially leading to disputes about when payment obligations begin and how the 72-hour test period is compensated.",

                "changed_text": "During the contract period, Party A has the ownership of the CDQ and CDQ waste heat power generation systems, but Party B maintains operational control. After the termination of the contact, Party B has the disposition right to the project. Party A will ensure the proper transfer of operation for a month, from the termination of the contract.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by creating confusion between ownership and operational control. Party A 'owns' the system but Party B 'maintains operational control'. This ambiguity can lead to disputes about responsibility for maintenance, improvements, or liabilities arising from the system's operation. This creates an internal contradiction, making the allocation of risk during the contract period uncertain.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties agree that Party B shall endeavor to provide coal coke production for CDQ system and should it not meet the agreed standard both party should cooperate to find a solution. Party A guarantees the steady operation of the CDQ and CDQ waste heat power generating systems.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by weakening Party B's obligation. Originally, Party B 'shall provide steady qualified coal coke', a seemingly firm obligation. The modified version changes this to 'Party B shall endeavor to provide' coal coke. This weakening creates an internal contradiction, as it makes Party B's obligation unclear and introduces ambiguity regarding quality and consistency.",

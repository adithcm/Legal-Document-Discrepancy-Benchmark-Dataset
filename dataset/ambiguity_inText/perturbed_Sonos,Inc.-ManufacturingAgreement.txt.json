                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict in how components are identified. Initially, it's Sonos' part numbers in Arena. The change states IAC's internal numbers are used, creating ambiguity and potential for discrepancies in tracking and billing.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding how Lead Time is determined. The original text specifies a default and exceptions in the Statement of Work, while the modification removes any defined Lead Time, making it subject to unpredictable determination. This can lead to uncertainty in planning and fulfillment.",

The names, addresses, email IDs, and telephone numbers of the Program Managers are attached to this Agreement as Exhibit B. The Program Managers shall act as liaisons and principal points of contact between the parties with respect to their respective performances of this Agreement. All communications between the Parties with respect to development of Products shall be directed to the Program Managers. The Program Managers may provide the Parties from time to time with the names and telephone numbers of additional specific contact persons (e.g., to communicate specific information regarding support, enhancements, etc.) when such direct contact is preferable. In the event that either party appoints a new Program Manager, such party shall promptly notify the other in writing, provided that Sonos reserves the right to request that IAC replace any Program Manager that is not performing at a satisfactory level, and such requests shall not be unreasonably refused by IAC.",
                "changed_text": "4.1. Program Managers. Sonos and IAC will each appoint at least one Program Manager (\"Program Manager\"). The names, addresses, email IDs, and telephone numbers of the Program Managers are attached to this Agreement as Exhibit B. All communications can happen with any of the employees from both parties and Program Managers are there to keep track of communications. Sonos does not have the right to request that IAC replace any Program Manager.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the role and control over Program Managers. The original text defines them as primary contacts and grants Sonos the right to request replacements, while the modification opens communications to all employees and removes Sonos's right to request a replacement. This creates ambiguity regarding the authority and responsibility of Program Managers.",

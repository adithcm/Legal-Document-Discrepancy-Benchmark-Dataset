                "changed_text": "5.1 The Principal shall pay the Company a fee as mutually agreed upon by both parties, taking into consideration market conditions and prevailing industry rates, per one net tonne of Commodity shipped pursuant to this Contract.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed fee, while the modified text introduces a variable fee dependent on market conditions. This contradicts any other section assuming a fixed fee and makes enforcement uncertain.",

The changed text says auto renewal occurs only when both parties agree to give a termination notice. This introduces a conflict, as the original section implies any of the parties can terminate, but in changed section, only both the parties can terminate the contract with consensus.",

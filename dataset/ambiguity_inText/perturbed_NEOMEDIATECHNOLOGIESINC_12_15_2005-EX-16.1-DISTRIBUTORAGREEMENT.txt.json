                "original_text": "4.3      DISTRIBUTOR agrees to satisfy the annual and quarterly sale targets for          the Products set forth in Appendix 3 herein as mutually agreed to by          the parties hereof.",
                "changed_text": "4.3      DISTRIBUTOR agrees to use its best efforts to satisfy the annual and quarterly sale targets for the Products set forth in Appendix 3 herein. While targets are indicative of expected performance, failure to achieve them will not constitute a breach of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the Distributor 'agrees to satisfy' the sales targets, implying a binding obligation. The modified text weakens this to 'best efforts' and clarifies that failure to meet targets is not a breach. This creates ambiguity because other sections may imply that meeting sales targets is crucial for the continuation of the agreement or for receiving incentives.",

DISTRIBUTOR is not authorized to make warranties or          representations on behalf of PPG SHANGHAI and shall make no such          warranties or representations. THESE ARE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIONS OR          WARRANTIES THAT PPG SHANGHAI MAKES, AND ALL OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED          WARRANTIES UNDER STATUTE OR ARISING OTHERWISE IN LAW FROM A COURSE OF          DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY          OF MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, ARE          DISCLAIMED BY PPG SHANGHAI. In the event that the Product fails to          conform to the warranties herein given, DISTRIBUTOR's exclusive remedy          and PPG SHANGHAI's sole responsibility is, at PPG SHANGHAI's option,          limited to the replacement of such nonconforming Product at PPG          SHANGHAI's expense or the refund of the purchase price attributable to          a specific delivery as to which a claim is made. For the avoidance of          doubt, PPG SHANGHAI hereby declares and represents that PPG SHANGHAI is          not responsible for any damage to the Products after they have been          taken away from PPG SHANGHAI's warehouse and caused by DISTRIBUTOR or          its transport agent.",
                "changed_text": "11.1     PPG SHANGHAI warrants its title to the Products. PPG SHANGHAI may, at its discretion, provide support for any defects in the Products. Any decision on support of defects is entirely at PPG SHANGHAI's sole discretion and is not an obligation under this agreement. DISTRIBUTOR is not authorized to make warranties or representations on behalf of PPG SHANGHAI and shall make no such warranties or representations. All other express or implied warranties under statute or arising otherwise in law from a course of dealing or usage of trade are disclaimed by PPG SHANGHAI. For the avoidance of doubt, PPG SHANGHAI hereby declares and represents that PPG SHANGHAI is not responsible for any damage to the Products after they have been taken away from PPG SHANGHAI's warehouse and caused by DISTRIBUTOR or its transport agent.",
                "explanation": "The original warranty clause provides a standard warranty and outlines specific remedies. The modified version removes the explicit warranty statement and replaces it with discretionary 'support for defects'. This creates conflict since it is no longer a warranty, but can be interpreted as such. This is a contradiction, as the original implied a warranty but this statement means that a warranty may or may not exist. This introduces uncertainty as to the obligations related to product quality and defect resolution.",

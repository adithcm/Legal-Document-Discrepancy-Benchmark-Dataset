                "original_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the \"Third Amendment\"), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (\"Heritage\") Premier Nutrition Corporation (\"Premier\") is effective as of July 3, 2019 (\"Third Amendment Effective Date\") and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (\"Agreement\"). Heritage and Premier are each referred to herein as a \"Party\" and collectively as the \"Parties.\"",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the \"Third Amendment\"), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (\"Heritage\") and Premier Nutrition Corporation (\"Premier\") is *deemed* effective as of July 3, 2019 (\"Third Amendment Effective Date\") and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (\"Agreement\"). Heritage and Premier are each referred to herein as a \"Party\", *unless otherwise specified*, and collectively as the \"Parties.\"",
                "explanation": "The original text states the amendment is 'effective as of' a specific date, implying a definite start. The modified text uses 'deemed effective' which introduces ambiguity, as 'deemed' suggests a legal fiction that may not reflect the actual start. Additionally, the original text definitively defines 'Party' and 'Parties'. The modification adds 'unless otherwise specified', suggesting other definitions may exist elsewhere, causing potential confusion and contradiction later if different interpretations arise.",

                "original_text": "The Parties hereby agree to remove Schedule C-1 in its entirety and replace it with the following:\n\nSchedule C-1. The following is attached to an incorporated into the Agreement as Schedule C-1:\n\nSchedule C-1([***])",
                "changed_text": "The Parties hereby agree to *consider* removing Schedule C-1 in its entirety and *potentially* replace it with the following:\n\nSchedule C-1. The following *may be* attached to and incorporated into the Agreement as Schedule C-1:\n\nSchedule C-1([***])",
                "explanation": "The original text describes a definitive action: removing and replacing Schedule C-1. The modified text introduces uncertainty by using phrases like 'consider removing' and 'potentially replace,' contradicting the clear directive. The use of 'may be' further weakens the commitment to attach and incorporate Schedule C-1. This contradiction creates ambiguity regarding the current status of Schedule C-1 and the obligations related to it, making enforcement difficult.",

                "changed_text": "Except as otherwise specified above in this Amendment, all other terms, conditions and covenants of the Agreement *may* remain in full force and effect *to the extent practicable*.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that all other terms remain fully in effect. The modified version uses 'may' instead of 'shall,' introducing doubt about their continued validity. The added phrase 'to the extent practicable' further weakens the clause, creating ambiguity about which terms are actually binding and under what circumstances they can be disregarded. If other sections of the agreement rely on specific terms, this change creates a potential conflict by undermining their enforceability.",

The \"Field of Use\" shall not include any functions or applications not expressly described in the preceding sentence, but shall include functions or applications developed by Licensor to enhance the performance within the \"Field of Use\".",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of \"Field of Use.\" The original definition states that the field of use is for exclusive purpose and shall include functions or applications developed by Licensor, whereas the revised version implies that the Licensee can also develop functions or applications. This creates uncertainty about who is responsible for developing new features or how those features will be handled regarding Intellectual Property.",

(b) The Licensee may request that the Licensor performs further development and customization work for creating a unique client front end and other enhancements to the Platform Software after the effective date. In the event the Licensee desires such services, the Licensee must agree in writing to a price and the terms for such services based upon the scope of the work requested by Licensee. Until such an agreement is entered into in writing, the Licensor shall have no obligation to perform such work. (c) The parties agree that (except for the customization work) (above) all future enhancements to the Software, including any new Revisions, Versions, updates to, or any other non-customized development work regarding the Software (which the Licensee may accept or decline) shall be provided to the Licensee during the term of this Agreement at no additional cost.",

                "explanation": "The changes introduces ambiguity around the cost of future enhancements. Originally, all future enhancements are provided at no additional cost. The modified text states future enhancements will be provided at additional cost based on service requested. This creates an in-text contradiction. Additionally, there is a weakening of the agreement. Originally there was a requirement for a written agreement, whereas in the updated version there is only a suggestion to reach an agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that either party 'shall have the right to terminate' upon the other's insolvency. The modified text weakens this by stating that either party 'may consider termination'. This introduces ambiguity about whether insolvency automatically allows termination or whether it's subject to further discretion. This directly contradicts the originally strong, definitive right to terminate, potentially leading to disputes over whether termination is justified in the event of insolvency.",

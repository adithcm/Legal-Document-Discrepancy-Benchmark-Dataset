                "original_text": "A) The initial term of this Agreement shall be three (3) calendar years from the Agreement date. After the initial term, unless terminated, this  Agreement will automatically renew for periods of one (1) calendar year each.",
                "changed_text": "A) The initial term of this Agreement shall be three (3) calendar years from the Agreement date. After the initial term, unless terminated with a 60-day notice, this Agreement will automatically renew for periods of one (1) calendar year each.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The initial term is automatically renewed unless terminated, but the added phrase 'unless terminated with a 60-day notice' implies a process for termination during the renewal period, contradicting the initial automatic renewal clause. It's unclear if the agreement can be terminated during the one-year renewal periods.",

                "changed_text": "A) The Distributor will supply to Lucid, on a monthly basis, a detailed listing of all sales prospects within the Territory. A sales prospect is considered by Lucid to be any End User who has either expressed an interest in purchasing Lucid products or has been contacted by the distributor for a sales demonstration.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction in the definition of a 'sales prospect'. The original definition states that a sales prospect must have 'expressed an interest' whereas the modified version includes any end user 'contacted by the distributor'. This introduces ambiguity as it's unclear if simply contacting an end user qualifies them as a prospect, even without expressed interest. This creates an issue about reporting requirement for Lucid and how qualified leads are determined.",

                "changed_text": "Lucid will not have any liability or responsibility to Distributor or any other person or entity for any consequential, indirect, special, punitive or  incidental damages or lost profits, whether foreseeable or unforeseeable, based on claims of Distributor or Distributor's customers (including but not limited to, claims for loss of data, goodwill, profits, use of money or use of product, interruption in use or availability of data stoppage or other work or impairment or assets) arising out of breach or failure of express or implied warranty, breach of contract, misrepresentation, negligence, strict liability in tort or otherwise, except only in the case of gross negligence resulting in death or personal injury. For any claim of loss of profits, Lucid's liability shall not exceed the total value of the specific products that caused such damages.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a contradiction by narrowing the exception for liability. The original text excludes liability for most damages except where required by applicable law for death or personal injury. The modification changes this to 'gross negligence resulting in death or personal injury' and introduces a limitation on liability for 'loss of profits', which contradicts the original broad exclusion. It's unclear which condition applies - the original broad exclusion or the new limited one, potentially leading to disputes.",

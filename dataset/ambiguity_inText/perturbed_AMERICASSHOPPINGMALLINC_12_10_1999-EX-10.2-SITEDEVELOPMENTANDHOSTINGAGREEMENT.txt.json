Notices will be sent to a Party at its address set forth above or such other address as that Party may specify in writing pursuant to this Section.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of acceptable notice delivery methods includes 'confirmed facsimile, or certified or registered mail, return receipt requested' and deems delivery on 'confirmation of receipt of facsimile or five (5) days after deposit in the mail.' The modified version includes 'email,' deems delivery on 'sending of the email' (removing any confirmation requirement), and excludes 'confirmed facsimile, or certified or registered mail, return receipt requested'. If legal action requires proof of receipt, the email provision conflicts with the stronger verifiable methods required originally. This creates ambiguity on whether an email needs a read receipt or not to be valid.",

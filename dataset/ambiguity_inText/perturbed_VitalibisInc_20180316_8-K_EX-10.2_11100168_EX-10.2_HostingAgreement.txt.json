This Agreement shall automatically renew beyond the Initial Term for successive one (I) year terms (each, a \"Renewal Term\"), unless a Party provides the other with written notice of termination at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or the then-current Renewal Term.

In addition, failure of Licensee to fully pay any fees within sixty (60) days after the applicable due date, shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement, justifying suspension of the performance of Services by VOTOCAST, and will be sufficient cause for immediate termination of this Agreement by VOTOCAST. Any such suspension does not relieve Licensee from paying fees past due plus interest and in the event of collection enforcement, Licensee shall be liable for any costs associated with such collection, including, but not limited to, legal costs, attorneys' fees, court costs and collection agency fees.",

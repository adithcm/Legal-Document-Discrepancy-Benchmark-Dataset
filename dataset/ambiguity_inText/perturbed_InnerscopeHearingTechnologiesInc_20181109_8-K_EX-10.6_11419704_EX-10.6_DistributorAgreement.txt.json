                "original_text": "a. Erchonia agrees to provide Products to Distributor pursuant to orders placed by Distributor in the form of individual purchase orders issued by Distributor to Erchonia. Such purchase orders shall set forth the quantity of each product ordered, the required delivery date, and the point of delivery. The price for the Products shall be as designated in Schedule A. Erchonia may revise its prices from time to time and deliver a written 90 day notice of the reasonable price revision to Distributor; provided that Erchonia agrees that the prices listed in Exhibit A shall not be increased during the first 90 days of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "a. Erchonia agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Products to Distributor pursuant to orders placed by Distributor. Such purchase orders shall set forth the quantity of each product ordered, and the point of delivery, if feasible. The price for the Products shall be as designated in Schedule A. Erchonia may revise its prices from time to time with a 30 day notice to Distributor; provided that Erchonia agrees that the prices listed in Exhibit A shall not be increased during the first 180 days of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text obligates Erchonia to provide products according to Distributor's orders with a 90-day price revision notice and locks prices for 90 days. The modified version introduces ambiguity by changing 'agrees to provide' to 'agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide', 'required delivery date' to 'if feasible', and alters the price revision period to 30 days and the price lock period to 180 days, creating contradiction as the original obligation and the modified condition create uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "b. Distributor agrees that during the term of this agreement it meet the minimum performance goals set forth in Exhibit C to this agreement. Failure to meet these minimum performance goals for any period, shall, at Erchonia's option (i) be considered a breach of this agreement for which Erchonia shall have all the rights and remedies provided for herein upon a breach of this agreement, including termination of this agreement, or (ii) shall give Erchonia to terminate or limit the exclusivity provisions of this agreement",
                "changed_text": "b. Distributor agrees that during the term of this agreement it should attempt to meet the minimum performance goals set forth in Exhibit C to this agreement. Failure to meet these minimum performance goals for any period, shall not be considered a breach of this agreement but will initiate a discussion between Erchonia and the distributor about the course of action, and Erchonia can review the exclusivity provisions of this agreement. In addition, Erchonia can change the minimum performance goals retroactively.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states that failure to meet the minimum performance goals set forth in Exhibit C is a breach of the agreement, allowing Erchonia to terminate the agreement. The change weakens this clause by stating that failure to meet the goals is not a breach but rather triggers a discussion. It also allows Erchonia to retroactively change the minimum performance goals, contradicting the original intent of having fixed performance standards.",

                "original_text": "a. Unless terminated earlier as provided in this agreement, this Agreement shall have an initial term of three (3) years. This agreement shall automatically renew for a period of three (3) years and upon the parties mutual agreement on new minimum performance goals for the renewal period.",
                "changed_text": "a. Unless terminated earlier as provided in this agreement, this Agreement shall have an initial term of three (3) years. This agreement shall automatically renew for a period of one (1) year unless one party objects to the renewal 30 days before the end of the current term. Renewal doesn't require any new performance goals.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement automatically renews for three years with mutual agreement on new performance goals. The modified version states it renews for one year unless a party objects, without requiring any performance goals agreement. This contradicts the original condition for renewal, creating uncertainty over the renewal terms and conditions.",

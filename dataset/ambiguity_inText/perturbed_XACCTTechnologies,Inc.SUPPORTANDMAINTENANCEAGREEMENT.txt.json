                "original_text": "1.2      \"Incident\" means a single, discrete, malfunction or other problem which          may require more than one (1) response before it is closed.",
                "changed_text": "1.2      \"Incident\" means a single, discrete, malfunction or other problem which requires only one (1) response before it is closed.",
                "explanation": "The original definition allows for multiple responses to an 'Incident', while the modified definition limits it to a single response. This creates confusion as other sections reference 'Incident' resolution procedures. It is unclear which definition to follow.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'reasonable commercial efforts' to 'best commercial efforts', we have increased the obligation. By changing 'are as set forth in Attachment 1' to 'as may be determined by XACCT', we remove certainty in the agreement. A conflict now exists whether XACCT must adhere to the response times in Attachment 1.",

The Agreement will be automatically          renewed for additional one (1) year terms (subject to applicable fee          adjustments) unless thirty (30) days prior to the anniversary of the          Effective Date Licensee gives written notice to XACCT of its intention          not to renew.",

                "explanation": "In the original text, the initial term is one year from the date of delivery. The modified text changes it to one year from the Effective Date. Also, instead of the Licensee providing a written notice to XACCT, the text now requires XACCT to provide a 90 day written notice of its intention not to renew.",

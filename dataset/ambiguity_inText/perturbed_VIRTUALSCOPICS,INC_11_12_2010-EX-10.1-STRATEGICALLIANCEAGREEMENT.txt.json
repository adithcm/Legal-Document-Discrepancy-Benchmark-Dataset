Services Commitment. \"Preferred Services\" shall be defined as those imaging services included within the service offerings of VS at the time of final execution of this Agreement which are specifically provided by VS in the therapeutic areas of hematology and oncology (\"Designated Therapeutic Areas\") to the extent such imaging services are subject to the commitments of VS set forth in this Section 3 (the \"Commitments\"). \"PPD Services\" shall be defined as clinical research organization services regarding the management of clinical trials for the development of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, biotechnology and other products through clinical testing. Preferred Services and PPD Services shall be subject to all of the rights and obligations otherwise set forth in this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit the provision of non-Preferred Services hereunder, however, such non-Preferred Services shall not be subject to the Commitments set forth in this Section 3.",
                "changed_text": "3. Services Commitment. \"Preferred Services\" shall be initially defined as those imaging services included within the service offerings of VS at the time of final execution of this Agreement which are specifically provided by VS in the therapeutic areas of hematology and oncology (\"Designated Therapeutic Areas\") to the extent such imaging services are subject to the commitments of VS set forth in this Section 3 (the \"Commitments\"). However, Preferred Services can also include imaging services in any therapeutic area as mutually agreed upon in writing by both parties, irrespective of being within hematology and oncology. \"PPD Services\" shall be defined as clinical research organization services regarding the management of clinical trials for the development of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, biotechnology and other products through clinical testing. Preferred Services and PPD Services shall be subject to all of the rights and obligations otherwise set forth in this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit the provision of non-Preferred Services hereunder, however, such non-Preferred Services shall not be subject to the Commitments set forth in this Section 3.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflicting definition of 'Preferred Services.' Initially, it's defined as services in hematology and oncology. The added sentence broadens the definition to include any therapeutic area by mutual agreement, creating uncertainty about the scope of services covered under the 'Commitments' in Section 3. This is an in-text contradiction.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. Originally, PPD has no payment obligations until they receive payment from the Sponsor. The modified text states that PPD has ultimate responsibility for ensuring VS is paid, regardless of Sponsor payments, conflicting with the initial 'pass-through' payment structure. Also, the invoice payment timeframe increases from 45 to 90 days.",

                "explanation": "This creates several in-text contradictions regarding termination. First, a 10% termination fee on outstanding work orders is added when the original text said all outstanding work orders would continue to be governed under the terms and conditions without this fee. PPD can now only terminate a Work Order for missing an agreed upon timeline for circumstances that are outside of VS's control. VS can now not terminate for failing to provide reasonably competitive pricing. A change in ownership has now increased from 50% to less than 90%, as well as the circumstance requiring an ownership position from a PPD Competitor pursuant to Rule 13d-1. It will not terminate in the circumstance where there is not a change in any Key Leadership Position.",

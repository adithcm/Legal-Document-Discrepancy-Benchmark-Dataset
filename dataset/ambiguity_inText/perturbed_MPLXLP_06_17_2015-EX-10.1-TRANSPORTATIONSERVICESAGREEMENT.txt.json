This introduces a contradiction about whether the agreement covers the transportation of gasoline and diesel, potentially affecting the applicable tariffs and obligations.",

                "original_text": "3.6 The dollar amount of any Quarterly Deficiency Payment paid by Shipper shall constitute prepayment for transportation of Product by Shipper on the Pipeline and will posted as a credit (\"Prepaid Transportation Credits\") to Shipper's account for that type of Product. If, during any Quarter of the Contract Year, Shipper deliveries on the Pipeline exceed the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment requirements, Shipper shall be permitted to apply Prepaid Transportation Credits against any amount due from Shipper and payable to MPL with respect to the transportation of volumes on the Pipeline for such Quarter. Any Prepaid Transportation Credits that are not used by Shipper during the four (4) Quarters immediately following the Quarter for which said Prepaid Transportation Credits were posted to Shipper's account (the \"Credit Period\") will expire. Those Prepaid Transportation Credits that are in payment dispute in accordance with Section 3.4, shall be posted as a credit on the date the payment dispute is resolved. If during any such four (4) Quarter period the nominated volume on the Pipeline for any month equals or exceeds the applicable portion in the Quarterly Volume Commitment for the Pipeline for such month (the \"Monthly Commitment\"), but Shipper is prevented from shipping volumes in excess of the Monthly Commitment because of lack of available capacity, either because (a) the Pipeline is in allocation and Shipper is specifically subject to allocation per Exhibit C, (b) the Pipeline is undergoing testing, maintenance or repair, or (c) a Force Majeure has occurred that prevents MPL from transporting Shipper volumes on the Pipeline in excess of the Monthly Commitment, then the Credit Period shall be extended by an equivalent time period for which Shipper has been prevented from shipping volumes in excess of the Monthly Commitment. For the purposes of this Section 3.6, during the Term, if the Pipeline is in allocation for any portion of the month, the Pipeline will be considered to be in allocation for the entirety of such month.",

Shipper shall be permitted to apply Prepaid Transportation Credits against any amount due from Shipper and payable to MPL with respect to the transportation of volumes on the Pipeline for any Quarter.

                "explanation": "The original section stated that the prepayment credits are for 'that type of Product', implying that different types of products have different credits. But the changed text removed that provision, so the prepayment can be applied across any type of Product, and is at MPL's discretion. This creates a conflict since there is now no specifications as to how those credit can be applied. The Credit Period also conflicts with the time period in which the credits expire which has changed from 4 Quarters to 2 Quarters.",

The rates vary depending upon project options, but in all instances will be $0.01 per barrel above the rates for uncommitted service for the same origin and destination points. A Committed Priority Shipper will have the same rates as the Committed Non-Priority Shipper (as defined below), unless the system in under prorationing. When under prorationing, the Committed Priority Shipper's rate will be charged the premium rate of $0.01 above the posted uncommitted rate.

The original text states that they will have the same rates as Committed Non-Priority Shippers but with prorationing, Committed Priority Shippers will be charged premium rate of $0.01. While the changed clause removes Committed Non-Priority Shippers. Furthermore, the original rates were $0.01 but the changed clause rates have increased to $0.05. The original section states a separate capacity request form is needed but the changed text states that Shipper can be a Committed Priority Shipper solely through this Agreement, directly contradicting what needed to be submitted.",

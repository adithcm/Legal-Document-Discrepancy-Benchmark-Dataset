                "original_text": "1.1 \"Affiliate\" shall mean any company or entity controlled by, controlling, or under common control with a party hereto and shall include any company more than 50% of whose voting stock or participating profit interest is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by a party, and any company which owns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting stock of a party.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting definitions of 'Affiliate'. Initially, an affiliate is defined as an entity with >50% ownership. The modified definition changes that threshold to >75% in the second case, creating ambiguity about which entities are actually considered affiliates and subject to the terms governing affiliates.",

Furthermore, for the purposes of Section 3.3(a), 'Test(s)' refers exclusively to tests performed by Life Technologies.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a conflicting definition of 'Test(s)'. The original definition broadly covers all tests under the agreement. The additional clause restricts the definition of 'Test(s)' only to tests performed by Life Technologies within Section 3.3(a). This creates uncertainty about which 'Tests' Life Technologies is obligated to promote under Section 3.3(a).",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding responsibility for the Technical Component of the Tests. The original text assigns 'sole responsibility' to Biocept. The revised text changes this to 'shared responsibility' between Biocept and Life Technologies. This makes it unclear who is ultimately accountable for the Technical Component and could lead to disputes over resource allocation and liability.",

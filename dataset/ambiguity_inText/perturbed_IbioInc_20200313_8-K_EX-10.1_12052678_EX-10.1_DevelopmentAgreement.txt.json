Each Product will be set forth in a separate Statement of Work in the form set forth in Appendix A, which will be signed by representatives of each Party with signing authority.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates a strict 5-year limit and requires the receiving party to use the same level of care as they would for their own confidential information. The modified text removes the time limit and weakens the standard of care, creating an ambiguity about the duration and required level of protection for Confidential Information. The original is for 5 years. the new section is indefinite.",

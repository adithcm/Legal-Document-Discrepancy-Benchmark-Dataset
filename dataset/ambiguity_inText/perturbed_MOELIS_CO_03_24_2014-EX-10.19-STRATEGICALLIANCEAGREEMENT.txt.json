A \"Client\" is (i) with respect to SMBC/Nikko, a Japanese Company or any other person or entity within Covered Regions that SMBC/Nikko Introduces to Moelis Holdings pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) with respect to Moelis Holdings, a Japanese Company or any other person or entity within Covered Regions that Moelis Holdings Introduces to SMBC/Nikko pursuant to this Agreement.",

A \"Client\" is (i) with respect to SMBC/Nikko, any entity, regardless of location, that SMBC/Nikko has an existing banking relationship with, and introduces to Moelis Holdings, for services under this agreement, and (ii) with respect to Moelis Holdings, a Japanese Company or any other person or entity within Covered Regions that Moelis Holdings Introduces to SMBC/Nikko pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Client'. In the changed text, the definition of 'Client' for SMBC/Nikko includes any entity with an existing banking relationship, regardless of location. The original definition limited it to entities within Covered Regions. This creates ambiguity because it's unclear if clients outside Covered Regions with pre-existing banking relationships with SMBC/Nikko but no Japanese company affiliation are subject to the same terms as a Client.",

The initial term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for three (3) years, subject to the prior termination rights provided below. At the end of such initial term, and any renewed term, as applicable, this Agreement shall automatically renew for an additional one (1) year term, unless a party provides written notice to the other parties at least six (6) months prior to the end of the 12 initial term.

                "explanation": "This change adds a restriction on the length of renewed terms, stating that any renewed term can only extend the agreement for a maximum of two additional years. The original text allowed for automatic one-year renewals indefinitely unless terminated, leading to an infinite term subject to termination. This creates a conflict, as the original implied unlimited renewal, while the addition limits it.",

In the event KM proposes to undertake a sale or 15 transfer of KM's Partnership Interests to which the foregoing right applies, KM shall give written notice to SMBC and Moelis General Partner at least ten (10) days in advance of such sale or transfer, describing the percent of KM's Partnership Interest being sold or transferred. KM shall give written notice to SMBC and Moelis General Partner within five (5) days of any cancellation or postponement of such sale. When an SMBC Unit- Holder elects to sell or transfer the SMBC Units pursuant to its rights granted under this Section 12.4(a), the SMBC Unit-Holder shall provide Moelis General Partner with a notice stating its intent to sell or transfer the SMBC Units pursuant to this Section 12.4(a). Within ten (10) days of receiving such notice from an SMBC Unit-Holder, Moelis General Partner shall deliver to such SMBC Unit-Holder its consent for the proposed sale or transfer, unless the proposed sale or transfer is to a Moelis Competitor. For the avoidance of doubt, if the transaction is subject to (i) a Drag- Along Right or a Tag-Along Right, and such right was exercised, the SMBC Unit-Holders shall be deemed to have sold its pro rata portion of its Partnership Interests with respect to such transaction and shall not have any additional rights under this Section 12.4(a) or (ii) Section 13.2 of this Agreement, and an SMBC Unit-Holder exercised its right thereunder, such SMBC Unit-Holder shall be deemed to have sold its pro rata portion of its Partnership Interests with respect to such transaction and shall not have any additional rights under this Section 12.4(a). The above right shall be in addition to the Drag-Along Right and the Tag-Along Right with respect to transfers by Moelis General Partner set forth in Sections 8.4.1 and 8.4.2, respectively, of the Moelis Holdings Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text forbids sales to a Moelis Competitor. The revised text permits this, saying sales can be made 'including sales to a Moelis Competitor'. Additionally, original text mandates consent from Moelis General Partner be provided within ten (10) days. Modified text changes that obligation into sixty (60) days and the right to refuse such a sale. These contradictions create uncertainty about where they can sell, which also conflicts with the original pro rata right, and the amount of time it takes for SMBC to determine the status of the sale.",

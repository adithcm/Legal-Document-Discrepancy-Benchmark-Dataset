Celebrity represents and warrants that during the Term and in the Territory, Celebrity will not endorse or  make any appearances or advertisements on behalf of any other multivitamin. However, celebrity may endorse other multivitamins if said endorsement does not take place on national television.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by adding an exception to the exclusivity clause. Originally, the celebrity was prohibited from endorsing any other multivitamin. Now, the celebrity can endorse other multivitamins if the endorsement is not on national television, creating a contradiction and uncertainty about the extent of the exclusivity. This could lead to disputes over what constitutes a national television appearance and whether certain types of endorsements are permissible.",

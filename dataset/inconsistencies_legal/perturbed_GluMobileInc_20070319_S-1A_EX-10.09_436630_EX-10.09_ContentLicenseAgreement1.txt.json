Each party shall keep a record of all sales and shall submit, together with the royalty statements, a quarterly summary report of such sales.",

Each party shall keep a record of all sales and shall submit, together with the royalty statements, a yearly summary report of such sales.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates royalty statements and payments quarterly, which is standard business practice. The modified text changes this to yearly statements and payments, 90 days after the close of each calendar year. This creates non-compliance as many jurisdictions and accounting standards require more frequent reporting and payment cycles to ensure transparency and timely remittance of royalties.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires keeping books and records for the greater of three years from the effective date or two years from termination. This ensures sufficient time for audits and disputes. The modified text reduces this to one year, potentially violating statutes of limitations for breach of contract claims. The original text states there can be an audit done twice in any given twelve month period, the modified text creates an examination once after the one year deadline which does not comply with legal regulations for auditing.",

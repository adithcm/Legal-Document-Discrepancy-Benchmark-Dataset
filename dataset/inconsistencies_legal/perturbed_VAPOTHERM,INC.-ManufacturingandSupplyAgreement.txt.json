                "explanation": "Delaying the response time for rejected cartridges significantly increases the holding costs and potential losses for Vapotherm. While not explicitly illegal, excessively long response times for addressing non-conforming goods could be seen as commercially unreasonable and possibly a breach of good faith, impacting Vapothermâ€™s operational efficiency and financial stability. This could potentially violate principles of fair dealing and reasonable commercial practices, especially if the delay causes significant harm to Vapotherm.",

An excessively long delay in notifying the indemnifying party about a claim can prejudice their ability to investigate, defend, or settle the claim effectively. While not a specific statute, failing to provide timely notice could undermine the enforceability of the indemnification agreement under general contract law principles and the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. It introduces significant uncertainty and could be seen as an unreasonable delay that harms the Indemnifying Party's ability to adequately respond to claims.",

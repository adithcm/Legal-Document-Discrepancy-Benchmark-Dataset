                "changed_text": "1.2 It is the goal of the Seller Trusts to have all of the Shares sold, on a pro-rata basis, in three or more tranches (each a \"Tranche\") commencing not earlier than one (1) month after the Effective Date with the resale of all of the shares of Stock completed within two (2) months after the Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows a reasonable timeframe for the resale of shares. The modified text creates an unrealistically short timeframe (2 months), which could potentially lead to forced sales at depressed prices, potentially violating fiduciary duties owed to the Seller Trusts' beneficiaries under applicable state laws. This timeframe might also conflict with securities regulations aimed at preventing market manipulation.",

(a) This OMA shall expire upon the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the Effective Date and (ii) the date that all Shares of Stock of the Seller Trusts as set forth on Schedule A hereto have been sold (the \"Term\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this OMA may be terminated with or without cause at any time after the Effective Date and without liability or continuing obligation by any of the Parties hereto (i) by mutual written agreement of all of the Parties; and (ii) in writing by the Trust Advisors in their sole discretion.",
                "changed_text": "4.1 Term; Termination; Withdrawal of Bank. (a) This OMA shall expire upon the earlier of (i) five years after the Effective Date and (ii) the date that all Shares of Stock of the Seller Trusts as set forth on Schedule A hereto have been sold (the \"Term\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this OMA may be terminated only for cause at any time after ninety (90) days after the Effective Date with documented liability or continuing obligation by any of the Parties hereto (i) by mutual written agreement of three-quarters of all of the Parties; and (ii) never in writing by the Trust Advisors at all.",
                "explanation": "The changes to Section 4.1(a) significantly restrict the termination rights of the parties and extends the term of the agreement. Removing the 'without cause' termination option after the 90 days and preventing the Trust Advisors from terminating it at all, could be deemed an unreasonable restriction, especially if circumstances change that make the agreement detrimental to the Seller Trusts. This could potentially violate principles of contract law related to unconscionability or violation of public policy, especially regarding fiduciary duties.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law to Delaware might be problematic if the Seller Trusts are not organized or primarily operating in Delaware, as the choice of law must bear a reasonable relationship to the parties or the transaction. Moreover, forcing all litigation to occur in China introduces practical barriers to justice for US-based parties, potentially undermining their rights. This could be seen as an unconscionable forum selection clause, especially given the power imbalance between GWG and the Trust Advisors.",

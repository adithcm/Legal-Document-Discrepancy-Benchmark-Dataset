Inquiries should be directed to contact@startengine.com.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the dispute window to 15 days is against standard business practices and consumer protection laws in many US states, which often provide for a longer period to identify and dispute billing errors, typically 30-60 days.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the grace period for late payments to 5 days is very aggressive and could be considered an unfair business practice.

                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 5 days is inconsistent with reasonable commercial practices and may violate state laws requiring adequate notice for contract termination, particularly for service agreements.

                "original_text": "During the 12 month period following the payment of any amount due under this Article 6, VerticalNet or its representative shall have the right to audit LeadersOnline's financial and other pertinent records relating to such payment in order to verify the amount of the payments owed and/or paid.",
                "changed_text": "During the 36 month period following the payment of any amount due under this Article 6, VerticalNet or its representative shall have the right to audit LeadersOnline's financial and other pertinent records relating to such payment in order to verify the amount of the payments owed and/or paid.",
                "explanation": "By extending the audit period to 36 months, the contract creates a potential conflict with statutes of limitations for breach of contract claims in Pennsylvania, which is four years. While a longer audit period isn't necessarily illegal, it could lead to disputes if financial records are no longer readily available or legally required to be maintained, increasing litigation risk. Record-keeping laws and regulations for business documents vary, but generally, a 3-year retention period for financial records is standard, and extending the audit window beyond this creates potential legal issues.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 10 days (with a maximum extension to 20) is generally unfavorable and creates a legal risk because such a short timeframe might be deemed commercially unreasonable, especially for complex breaches. Courts often require a reasonable opportunity to cure, and 10-20 days might be seen as insufficient, making the termination clause vulnerable to legal challenge.",

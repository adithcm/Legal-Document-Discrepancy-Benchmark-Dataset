                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If Biocept at any time finds that Life Technologies is not in compliance with this Section, then Biocept may notify Life Technologies in writing of such deficiencies, and if Life Technologies fails to correct such deficiencies within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, Biocept may, at its election and in addition to any other remedies, terminate the license granted to Life Technologies with respect to the Biocept Trademarks.",
                "changed_text": "If Biocept at any time finds that Life Technologies is not in compliance with this Section, then Biocept may notify Life Technologies in writing of such deficiencies, and if Life Technologies fails to correct such deficiencies within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, Biocept may, at its election and in addition to any other remedies, terminate the license granted to Life Technologies with respect to the Biocept Trademarks.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for deficiencies regarding trademark compliance from 30 days to 10 days creates a contradiction with general contract law principles that require reasonable time for cure, and may also conflict with specific state laws regarding reasonable notice and opportunity to cure in commercial contracts. California law, which governs this agreement, typically requires a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach, and 10 days may be deemed unreasonably short depending on the nature of the deficiency.",

                "changed_text": "Life Technologies shall pay Biocept within ninety (90) days following the invoice date.",
                "explanation": "Extending the payment term to 90 days may conflict with California Prompt Payment Laws applicable to certain industries or contracts, which often mandate shorter payment periods. While not universally applicable, extending payment terms without justification can be deemed an unreasonable delay in payment, especially if it causes financial hardship.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement before the end of the Term upon written notice to the other party if such other party is in material breach of this Agreement and has not cured such breach within sixty (60) days (the \"Cure Period\") after notice from the terminating party requesting cure of the breach.",
                "changed_text": "Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement before the end of the Term upon written notice to the other party if such other party is in material breach of this Agreement and has not cured such breach within thirty (30) days (the \"Cure Period\") after notice from the terminating party requesting cure of the breach.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from 60 days to 30 days may be considered unreasonable in certain situations, particularly for complex breaches that require substantial effort to rectify. This creates inconsistency with the principle of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to provide a reasonable opportunity to remedy a breach before terminating the agreement. Depending on the nature of the breach and the industry, 30 days may not provide sufficient time to cure.",

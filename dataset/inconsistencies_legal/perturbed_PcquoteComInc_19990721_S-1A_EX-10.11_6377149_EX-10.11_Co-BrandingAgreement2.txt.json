                "original_text": "This amendment to Section 2 (titled \"Term\"), Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement is made effective December 9, 1996 by and between PC Quote, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This amendment to Section 2 (titled \"Term\"), Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement is made effective December 9, 1996 by and between PC Quote, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement. This amendment is retroactively effective to January 1, 1990, regardless of any statutory limitations.",
                "explanation": "Attempting to make the agreement retroactively effective to January 1, 1990, directly contradicts statutes of limitations. Statutes of limitations are laws that set the maximum time after an event within which legal proceedings may be initiated. By trying to bypass any statutory limitations, the amendment introduces a legal contradiction, making it potentially unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Modifying the scope of application to subsidiaries and related companies, and giving PCQ sole discretion without requiring good faith, can be problematic. Many jurisdictions imply a duty of good faith and fair dealing in contracts. Giving one party unfettered discretion to approve or deny application without good faith may render the clause unenforceable and contradict legal principles regarding contractual fairness.",

                "explanation": "Changing the dates to 1986 potentially introduces issues related to the statute of limitations and the enforceability of the contract due to its age. Making the contract's effective dates that far in the past, and potentially beyond the reasonable business expectation of both parties, could make it unenforceable under current laws and standards, considering the rapid pace of technological changes and business practice evolution. It also creates potential uncertainty about which laws are applicable based on the new date.",

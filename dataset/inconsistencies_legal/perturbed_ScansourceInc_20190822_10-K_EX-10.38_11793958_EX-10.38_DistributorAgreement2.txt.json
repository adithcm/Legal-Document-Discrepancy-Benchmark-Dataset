                "explanation": "The modification reduces the return period to 14 days and specifies a partial refund instead of a full refund. This may violate consumer protection laws, which often mandate a longer return period (e.g., 30 days in some jurisdictions for software) and require a full refund for defective or non-conforming goods. It creates a legal contradiction by reducing the consumer's rights.",

This may conflict with implied warranty laws, such as the implied warranty of merchantability, which, depending on the jurisdiction and product, can extend beyond 30 days.

                "explanation": "This modification limits the time frame for remediation to 72 hours. Depending on the amount owed and the complexity of the non-compliance, this may be an unreasonably short period, particularly if the customer needs to conduct its own internal investigation or secure financing.

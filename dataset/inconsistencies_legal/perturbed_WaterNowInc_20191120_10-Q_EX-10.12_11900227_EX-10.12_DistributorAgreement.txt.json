                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity within ten (10) business days of the date the opportunity is presented to Distributor, Hydraspin shall have no obligation to enter into a contract with Distributor regarding the new territory.",
                "changed_text": "If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity within three (3) business days of the date the opportunity is presented to Distributor, Hydraspin shall have no obligation to enter into a contract with Distributor regarding the new territory.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the negotiation period for exclusivity terms to 3 business days may be considered an unreasonably short timeframe, particularly given the complexities of negotiating exclusive distribution rights. This could violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in Texas contracts, as it potentially deprives the distributor of a reasonable opportunity to evaluate and negotiate the terms. Texas law requires parties to act reasonably and in good faith in contract performance.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor reserves the right to modify or remove any trademark, copyright and other notices of proprietary rights included by AHT or Hydraspin on the Products at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change allows the distributor to unilaterally modify or remove trademarks, copyrights, and proprietary notices. This directly contradicts federal trademark and copyright laws, which protect intellectual property rights. Unauthorized removal or modification of these notices can lead to infringement claims and violations of federal law.",

                "original_text": "The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and end on the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"), unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof. Upon expiration of the Initial Term of this Agreement, this Agreement will automatically renew for additional, successive five (5) year periods unless either Party provides the other Party written notice of its desire to terminate at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any renewal.",
                "changed_text": "The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and end on the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"), unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof. Upon expiration of the Initial Term of this Agreement, this Agreement will automatically renew for additional, successive five (5) year periods unless either Party provides the other Party written notice of its desire to terminate at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any renewal.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 120 days written notice for termination before renewal. The modification reduces this to 30 days. While facially valid, in the context of an exclusive distribution agreement, such a short notice period might be deemed unconscionable or violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if it does not provide the parties with sufficient time to wind down operations, secure alternative arrangements, or mitigate potential losses. Texas courts can scrutinize contracts for unconscionability.",

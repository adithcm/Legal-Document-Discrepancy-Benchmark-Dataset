                "explanation": "This change extends the review period for marketing materials to ten business days. FINRA Rule 2210(c)(1)(B) requires that firms establish and implement policies and procedures for the review and approval of communications with the public. Delaying the review process beyond a reasonable timeframe could be construed as a failure to diligently supervise marketing materials, potentially violating FINRA regulations. The original timeline of 3 days can be considered within an adequate timeline while 10 business days is not.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the expedited review fee to $2500 could be considered excessive and potentially violate FINRA's rules regarding fair and reasonable charges for services. While firms can charge for expedited reviews, the fees must be justifiable and not create a barrier to compliance. An unreasonably high fee could deter firms from seeking timely review, increasing the risk of non-compliant marketing materials.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the 60-day notice period for termination, allowing for immediate termination upon written notice. This could violate principles of contract law that require reasonable notice for termination, especially if it causes significant harm to one party. Furthermore, it could potentially conflict with SEC or FINRA regulations that mandate reasonable steps to ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities when terminating agreements that impact investor protection.",

Except as provided in Section 2.1 above, and unless otherwise agreed and specified in Exhibit A, all amounts due and owing by HSNS shall be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of E.piphany's invoice. Overdue payments shall accrue a late payment charge at the lesser of one and one half percent (1 1/2%) per month or the maximum rate allowed under applicable law.",

Except as provided in Section 2.1 above, and unless otherwise agreed and specified in Exhibit A, all amounts due and owing by HSNS shall be paid within sixty (60) days from the date of E.piphany's invoice. Overdue payments shall accrue a late payment charge at the lesser of three percent (3%) per month.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment term to 60 days and increases the late payment charge. California law, which governs this agreement, may have regulations on maximum late payment fees and accepted payment terms. Raising the late payment charge to 3% per month could be considered usurious and violate California's usury laws, depending on the context and nature of the agreement. The original 30 day term aligns more closely with standard business practice.",

HSNS shall not disclose the results of any Application benchmark tests to any third party without E.piphany's prior written approval.

                "explanation": "The change reduces the confidentiality period from five years (or two years post-termination) to one year (or six months post-termination). This could potentially contradict California's Trade Secret Law, which protects trade secrets for as long as they remain secret and provide a competitive advantage. A one-year confidentiality period may be insufficient to protect certain types of confidential information, particularly trade secrets with long-term value, thus weakening the protection afforded under state law.",

                "explanation": "The change shortens the period to cure a breach from 30 days to 10 days. This could be considered an unreasonably short cure period, particularly for complex breaches, and may be deemed unconscionable under California law. Courts often look to industry standards and the complexity of the issue when determining the reasonableness of a cure period. A 10-day period may not provide sufficient time to remedy certain breaches, potentially violating principles of fairness and good faith.",

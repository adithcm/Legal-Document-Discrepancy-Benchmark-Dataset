                "explanation": "This change extends the payment deadline to sixty days, potentially conflicting with California Prompt Payment laws which often require payments within a shorter timeframe (e.g., 30 days) for certain types of commercial transactions, thus creating a legal contradiction. A longer payment term could be considered an unfair business practice, particularly for smaller vendors.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for service suspension or termination to just two days may violate California's requirements for reasonable notice before termination of services, particularly if such termination would significantly impact the Channel Partner's business operations. Two days is an unreasonably short time frame.",

                "explanation": "Shortening the dispute notification and claim submission periods to 15 and 30 days, respectively, imposes an unreasonably short timeframe on Channel Partner. This may violate California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to a contract to act reasonably and in good faith. Such a short window may not allow sufficient time for a thorough review of complex invoices.",

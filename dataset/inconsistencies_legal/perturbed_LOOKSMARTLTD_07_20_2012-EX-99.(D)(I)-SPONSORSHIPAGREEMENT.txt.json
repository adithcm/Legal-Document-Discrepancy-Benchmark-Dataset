                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall automatically terminate at and as of (the first to occur of): (a) 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on the 10th day after the Effective Date (if Purchaser has not commenced the Offer, without requiring the unanimous consent of the Sponsors, by then); (b) the expiration of the Offer (if the Offer is not consummated pursuant to the terms of the Offer), subject to any extension or subsequent offering period; and (c) the expiration of the Interim Period (if the Offer is consummated pursuant to the terms of the Offer), in any case, unless sooner terminated by a simple majority written consent of the Participating Sponsors; provided, however, that any liability for failure to comply with this Agreement shall not survive any such termination.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement requires unanimous consent of sponsors to continue beyond 30 days if the offer hasn't commenced. Shortening the period to 10 days and removing the unanimous consent requirement, along with stating that liability for failure to comply with this agreement shall not survive any such termination, introduces a legal contradiction because it unreasonably restricts the sponsors' ability to assess the offer. Contractual provisions that drastically limit a party's rights without adequate justification can be challenged under the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which is recognized under New York law, the governing law of the agreement. Additionally, terminating liabilities upon termination of the agreement undermines the purpose of contract law.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be amended or modified, and the provisions hereof may be waived, by a verbal agreement among the Purchaser and at least one Sponsor.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires a written agreement signed by all sponsors to amend or modify the contract. Changing this to allow verbal agreements between the Purchaser and only one sponsor contradicts the Statute of Frauds, which in New York, as well as most states, requires certain agreements, including those that cannot be performed within one year, to be in writing to be enforceable. Such an amendment could also violate basic contract law principles requiring mutual assent and clarity.",

                "original_text": "To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Sponsor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each other Sponsor  and any of its affiliates or any direct or indirect partner, member, shareholder, employee, director, officer or agent of such Sponsor or any of its  affiliates from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, judgments, awards, settlements, demands, offsets, and expenses  (including interest, penalties, court costs, arbitration costs and fees, witness fees and reasonable fees and expenses of outside attorneys,  investigators, expert witnesses, accountants and other professionals) arising out of or relating to any material breach or inaccuracy of the  representations, warranties or covenants of such Sponsor contained herein.",

                "explanation": "The original indemnification clause is limited 'to the fullest extent permitted by law' and applies only to 'material breach or inaccuracy'. The modified clause removes the 'fullest extent permitted by law' and materiality qualifier, making the indemnification obligation absolute, regardless of fault or the significance of the breach. This modification is potentially unenforceable under New York law, which requires that indemnification clauses be clear and unequivocal, particularly when indemnifying against one's own negligence. A court may find that such a broad, unqualified indemnification clause is unconscionable or violates public policy.",

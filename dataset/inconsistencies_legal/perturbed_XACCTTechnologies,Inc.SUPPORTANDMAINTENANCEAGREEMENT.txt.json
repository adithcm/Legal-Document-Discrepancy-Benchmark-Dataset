                "original_text": "Fees shall be payable within thirty (30) days of invoice which shall be exclusive of any applicable local, state, federal, use, excise, value added, GST or other taxes imposed on the fees payable for the Product Maintenance and Support Services which shall be the responsibility of Licensee.",
                "changed_text": "Fees shall be payable within sixty (60) days of invoice which shall be exclusive of any applicable local, state, federal, use, excise, value added, GST or other taxes imposed on the fees payable for the Product Maintenance and Support Services which shall be the responsibility of Licensee.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment period to 60 days. While not inherently illegal, such an extended period without clearly defined interest or late payment penalties could potentially conflict with California's prompt payment laws, especially if the licensee is a small business. California law favors payment terms of 30 days or less, particularly in specific industries and contracts.  Extending to 60 days without justification could create ambiguity and a potential dispute.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with California's prompt payment laws, especially those favoring shorter payment terms for small businesses or in specific industries (though not directly violating a specific statute without more context).",

XACCT may also terminate Support Services if Licensee breaches any provision of this Agreement or the License Agreement and such breach is not remedied within thirty (30) days after Licensee receives written notice of the breach.",

XACCT may also terminate Support Services if Licensee breaches any provision of this Agreement or the License Agreement and such breach is not remedied within ten (10) days after Licensee receives written notice of the breach.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a breach of contract to 10 days may be considered unreasonably short under California law, especially for complex software agreements. Courts often look at the materiality of the breach and the time reasonably necessary to cure it. A 10-day cure period might be deemed insufficient, particularly if the breach involves significant technical or operational issues that require more time to resolve.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with California contract law principles regarding reasonable cure periods for breaches of contract.  While no specific statute dictates the exact cure period, a court might find 10 days unreasonable depending on the nature of the breach.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for non-renewal to 10 days before the anniversary date could be deemed unconscionable under California law, particularly if the licensee is a smaller company. A shorter notice period places undue burden on the Licensee. California courts scrutinize contracts for unconscionability, particularly where there's a significant power imbalance between the parties. Ten days could be seen as insufficient time for the licensee to find a replacement support solution.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with California law related to unconscionable contract terms, specifically those imposing unreasonable burdens or surprise on one party, particularly smaller businesses.",

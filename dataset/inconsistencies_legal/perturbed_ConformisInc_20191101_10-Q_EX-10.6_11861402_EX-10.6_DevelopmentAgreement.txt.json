                "explanation": "The clause initially provided some protections to a party undergoing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, ensuring the agreement remains in force if the party continues to perform its obligations and assumes the agreement within a certain timeframe. This modification removes these protections, allowing immediate termination even if the bankrupt party is trying to fulfill its duties and assume the agreement in a timely manner. This violates the principles and protections afforded under US Bankruptcy Code, which aims to provide a debtor with an opportunity to reorganize and continue operating.",

If such alleged material breach is not remedied in the time period set forth above, the Party alleging material breach shall refer the matter to the chief executive officers of each Party, who shall meet and confer within [**] after notice from the non-breaching Party of its desire for such a meeting. If the Parties are unable to resolve any dispute in such meeting and no Action has been brought in accordance with Section 10.8 with respect to such dispute, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon delivery to the defaulting Party of a Termination Notice. The non-defaulting Party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.2(b) shall not be construed as an exclusive remedy.",

If such alleged material breach is not remedied in the time period set forth above, the Party alleging material breach can immediately terminate this Agreement upon delivery to the defaulting Party of a Termination Notice. The non-defaulting Party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.2(b) shall be construed as an exclusive remedy.",
                "explanation": "By reducing the cure period to '1 day', the modified clause creates an unreasonably short timeframe for the breaching party to remedy a material breach. Additionally, specifying that the termination is the exclusive remedy restricts the non-breaching party's options, which may violate general principles of contract law that seek to provide fair and reasonable remedies for breach of contract.",

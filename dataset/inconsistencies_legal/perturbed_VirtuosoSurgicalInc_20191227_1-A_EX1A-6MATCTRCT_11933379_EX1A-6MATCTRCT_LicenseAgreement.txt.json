                "original_text": "4.1 License Fee: As consideration for JHU's grant of a License to Company under this Agreement, Company shall pay to JHU a license fee, cash and equity, as set forth in Exhibit A within thirty (30) days of the EFFECTIVE DATE. The license fee is nonrefundable and shall not be credited against royalties or other fees.",
                "changed_text": "4.1 License Fee: As consideration for JHU's grant of a License to Company under this Agreement, Company shall pay to JHU a license fee, cash and equity, as set forth in Exhibit A within ninety (90) days of the EFFECTIVE DATE. The license fee is nonrefundable and shall not be credited against royalties or other fees.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment deadline from 30 days to 90 days does not inherently violate any specific US law, as initial payment deadlines are generally negotiable. However, delaying payment significantly beyond standard commercial terms could be considered an unreasonable delay in performance, potentially leading to breach of contract claims under general contract law principles and raising concerns about good faith negotiations, even if there is no explicit statutory violation.",

Such books and records shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.",
                "changed_text": "4.6 Records: The Company shall make and retain, for a period of one (1) year following the period of each report required by Paragraph 4.4, true and accurate records, files and books of account containing all the data reasonably required for the full computation and verification of sales and other information required in Paragraph 4.4. Such books and records shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period to one year may conflict with IRS guidelines and other state laws regarding financial record keeping. While the contract itself doesn't violate a specific statute mandating a precise retention period for *all* business records, it introduces potential non-compliance issues depending on the specific nature of the financial transactions and applicable tax laws.",

                "explanation": "While a 60-day notice period is generally acceptable, a shortened 30-day notice period for termination could be deemed commercially unreasonable in the context of a complex licensing agreement, especially if JHU needs a longer time to find a replacement licensee or adjust its business strategy. While there isn't a direct statutory violation, it raises concerns about the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "1.2. Extension of Term. This Agreement will extend automatically for monthly periods unless either party to this Agreement notifies the other party in writing at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the then current term.",
                "changed_text": "1.2. Extension of Term. This Agreement will extend automatically for monthly periods unless either party to this Agreement notifies the other party in writing at least five (5) days before the expiration of the then current term.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a 30-day notice for non-renewal, which is a standard and legally sound practice. Reducing this to 5 days creates a conflict. Depending on jurisdiction, commercial lease or service agreements often require a more substantial notice period to allow the other party adequate time to find a replacement service or tenant. In many jurisdictions, 5 days is not considered a reasonable timeframe and might be deemed unconscionable, making this clause potentially unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "1.3 Termination of Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may terminate this Agreement at any time without liability by providing thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 180 days written notice to terminate the agreement, which is a standard and legally sound practice. Reducing this to 30 days creates a conflict. Depending on the specific industry and the investments made in reliance on the contract's longer term, a 30-day notice period might be considered unreasonably short, particularly if significant resources have been allocated based on the expectation of a longer contractual relationship. This shorter notice period could lead to legal challenges based on breach of contract or failure to act in good faith, especially if one party suffers significant damages due to the abrupt termination.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, as well as potentially conflicting with state laws requiring 'reasonable' notice for contract terminations where significant reliance investments were made, though no specific statute is directly violated.",

                "original_text": "The insurance policy willname the Company as an additional insured. The Provider will provide the Company with a certificate of insurance issued to evidence such coverage. Such certificate will provide that there shall be no cancellation, non-renewal, or modification of such coverage without thirty days' prior written notice to the Company.",

The Provider will provide the Company with a certificate of insurance issued to evidence such coverage. Such certificate will provide that there shall be no cancellation, non-renewal, or modification of such coverage without ten days' prior written notice to the Company.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 30 days written notice for any changes to the insurance policy, providing the Company with ample time to react to potential changes. Reducing this notification period to 10 days creates a potential legal issue. Many jurisdictions or insurance regulations may require a minimum of 30 days' notice for cancellation or modification of insurance policies, particularly where a third party is named as an additional insured. Failing to provide adequate notice could expose the Provider to liability if the Company suffers damages due to unexpected changes in insurance coverage.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with standard insurance industry practices and could violate implied duties to maintain agreed-upon coverage. Some jurisdictions may have specific insurance regulations requiring 30 days' notice.",

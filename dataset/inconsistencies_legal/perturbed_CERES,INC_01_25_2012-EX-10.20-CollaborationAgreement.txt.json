California law dictates that payment to small businesses must be made within 30 days of receiving the invoice unless otherwise stipulated. CERES, Inc. is located in California, so this modification introduces non-compliance with CA regulations.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates a 5-year confidentiality period. Modifying this to a 1-year period potentially violates the California Trade Secrets Act, which requires the protection of trade secrets for as long as they remain trade secrets and provides remedies for misappropriation. A one-year period might be deemed insufficient to protect certain trade secrets, depending on their nature.",

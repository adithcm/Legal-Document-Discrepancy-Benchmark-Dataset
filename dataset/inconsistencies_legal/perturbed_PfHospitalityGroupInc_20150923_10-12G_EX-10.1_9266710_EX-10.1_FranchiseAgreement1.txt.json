                "changed_text": "2.2.1. You must give us written notice of your desire to exercise your option not more than one (1) months and not less than two (2) weeks before this Agreement expires.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction because it significantly reduces the notification period required to exercise the option to renew the franchise agreement. Many state franchise laws provide franchisees with specific notification periods (often much longer than two weeks) to decide on renewal, ensuring they have adequate time for due diligence and decision-making. By shortening this period, the contract now contradicts the protections afforded to franchisees under state law. The selected perturbation regarding the notice from twelve (12) months to one (1) months, and nine (9) months to two (2) weeks is a violation.",

                "changed_text": "You will have two (2) days after written notice of such default from us within which to remedy the default.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a legal contradiction by reducing the cure period for monetary defaults to two days. Many states have laws that require franchisors to provide a reasonable cure period for franchisees to address defaults, particularly monetary ones. A two-day period may be deemed unreasonable and insufficient, conflicting with state laws designed to protect franchisees from unfair termination practices. By reducing the cure period, the franchisor is not providing a reasonable time which is against fair regulations.",

                "explanation": "This edit makes the non-compete agreement overly broad and likely unenforceable under many state laws. Increasing the restriction period to five years and the radius to 15 miles is unreasonable and could violate state laws that favor competition and restrict overly broad non-compete clauses. Many jurisdictions have guidelines deeming restrictions beyond certain durations or distances as presumptively unreasonable. By modifying the non-compete clauses to extend the duration and coverage, it conflicts with state laws.",

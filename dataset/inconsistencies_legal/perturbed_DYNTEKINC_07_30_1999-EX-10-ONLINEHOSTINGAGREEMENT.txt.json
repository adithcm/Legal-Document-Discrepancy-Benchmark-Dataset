                "changed_text": "Late payments shall accrue interest at a rate equal to twenty-five (25%) percent per annum.",
                "explanation": "Many states have usury laws that limit the maximum interest rate that can be charged on debts. Charging 25% per annum may violate these laws, making the interest rate clause unenforceable. New York's usury laws, which govern this contract, restrict interest rates to 16% per annum.",

                "explanation": "Providing only two days to cure a material breach may be considered unreasonably short, especially for complex or significant breaches, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Standard commercial contracts typically provide a longer cure period, such as 10-30 days, and courts may find a 2-day period insufficient, making the termination clause unenforceable. This violates standard contract law principles requiring reasonable notice and opportunity to cure.",

                "changed_text": "Diplomat will be required to notify Tadeo at least one business day before the date of planned examination.",
                "explanation": "Requiring only one business day's notice before an audit is unreasonable and can be viewed as restricting the auditing party's right to examine records effectively. Standard auditing practices and legal norms usually mandate a more substantial notice period (e.g., 10-30 days) to allow for adequate preparation and coordination, ensuring compliance with accounting principles and verification by governmental agencies. This short notice period contradicts the purpose of allowing Diplomat to effectively examine records and violates the implied duty of cooperation.",

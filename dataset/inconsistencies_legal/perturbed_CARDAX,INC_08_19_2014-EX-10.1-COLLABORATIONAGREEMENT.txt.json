                "original_text": "6.1 Regulatory Contacts. [***] CAPSUGEL shall notify CARDAX immediately, and in no event, no later than three (3) business day(s), after it receives any contact or communication from any governmental or regulatory authority, including without limitation the FDA, that in any way relates to or may have an impact on a Product or the CAPSUGEL Development Activities.",
                "changed_text": "6.1 Regulatory Contacts. [***] CAPSUGEL shall notify CARDAX within fifteen (15) business days after it receives any contact or communication from any governmental or regulatory authority, including without limitation the FDA, that in any way relates to or may have an impact on a Product or the CAPSUGEL Development Activities.",
                "explanation": "The change extends the notification period from three business days to fifteen business days. This could potentially violate FDA regulations or other applicable laws that mandate quicker reporting of significant regulatory communications related to product safety or efficacy. The original timeline ensures quick communication of critical information, whereas this change delays that communication, potentially creating a legal contradiction.",

CARDAX has the right, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, to inspect and examine such Records. CAPSUGEL agrees to retain all such Records for a period of two (2) years after the expiration of the Term or after termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The change reduces the record retention period from five years to two years. This could conflict with FDA requirements or other applicable regulations that mandate longer retention periods for records related to drug manufacturing, testing, and distribution to ensure traceability and compliance. Shortening the retention period to two years may be insufficient to meet these regulatory obligations.",

A material breach that is subject to cure that is not cured within [***] of written notice of breach shall be cause for termination, provided that if the breaching party is diligently pursuing in good faith the remedy of the breach at the expiration of such [***] cure period, then such [***] cure period shall be extended for a reasonable period to effect the cure.",
                "changed_text": "10.2 Termination for Breach . A material breach that is subject to cure that is not cured within ten (10) days of written notice of breach shall be cause for termination, provided that if the breaching party is diligently pursuing in good faith the remedy of the breach at the expiration of such ten (10) day cure period, then such ten (10) day cure period shall be extended for a reasonable period to effect the cure.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to ten days could be considered unreasonably short, especially given the complexities often involved in pharmaceutical collaborations and regulatory compliance. This timeframe might not allow sufficient time to rectify certain breaches, potentially conflicting with legal principles of contract law that require reasonable opportunity for cure. A shorter period may expose a party to immediate termination for breaches that reasonably require more time to resolve.",

                "original_text": "The Parties agree to reconcile revenue numbers and the revenue share calculations no later than 10 days following the end of each calendar month during which the Services were rendered. Subject to the doctrine of sequential liability, payment shall be made to the appropriate Party net 30 days from the end of the calendar month.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties agree to reconcile revenue numbers and the revenue share calculations no later than 60 days following the end of each calendar month during which the Services were rendered. Subject to the doctrine of sequential liability, payment shall be made to the appropriate Party net 90 days from the end of the calendar month.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the reconciliation and payment terms, which could violate state prompt payment laws. Many states have laws requiring payments to be made within a reasonable timeframe, and 90 days net could be considered unreasonable, especially for smaller businesses.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, and for a period of five (5) years following the expiration or earlier termination thereof, Customer agrees not to work with, directly or indirectly, any Third-Party that Customer comes to know through disclosure by Kubient as part of the Services, without the express written consent of Kubient and compensation to Kubient under the applicable exhibit and/or schedule.",
                "explanation": "Extending the non-circumvent clause to five years could be deemed an unreasonably long restriction, especially if the customer's ability to conduct business is severely limited. This change could violate state laws regarding non-compete agreements which typically have stricter time limits.",

                "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to two years could be deemed an unreasonable restraint of trade, potentially violating state laws that limit the duration of non-solicitation agreements. The enforceability depends on the specific jurisdiction and the nature of the employee's role and responsibilities at Kubient.",

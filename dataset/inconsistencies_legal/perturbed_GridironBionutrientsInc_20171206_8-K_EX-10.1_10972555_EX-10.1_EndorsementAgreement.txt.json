PRIOR APPROVAL   Company agrees that no use of the name of the NFLA Identification nor any item used in connection with the name of NFLA Identification (including any Licensed Product) will be made under this Agreement unless and until the same is approved by the NFLA. The NFLA agrees that any material, advertising or otherwise, submitted for approval as provided in this section may be deemed by Company to have been approved under this section if the same is not disapproved in writing within ten (10) business days after receipt of the material.",

PRIOR APPROVAL   Company agrees that no use of the name of the NFLA Identification nor any item used in connection with the name of NFLA Identification (including any Licensed Product) will be made under this Agreement unless and until the same is approved by the NFLA. The NFLA agrees that any material, advertising or otherwise, submitted for approval as provided in this section may be deemed by Company to have been approved under this section if the same is not disapproved in writing within two (2) business days after receipt of the material.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the approval period from ten business days to two business days. This creates a potential legal issue if the approval process requires more time to ensure compliance with advertising standards, potentially leading to rushed or inadequate reviews. This could contradict state advertising laws that mandate sufficient time for review and approval.",

PAYMENTS   All payments shall be made by wire transfer drawn to the account of NFLA-NC no later than ten (10) business days after the end of each quarter as follows:   $0.05 per Unit as described herein of Company's Products sold in the Contract Territory payable to NFLA-NC. Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the NFLA-NC beginning on the first full quarter (three month period) of the Agreement and continue on a quarterly basis thereafter for the term of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity and eliminates the defined payment timeline, contradicting typical contract law requirements for clear payment terms. State prompt payment laws require businesses to adhere to specific payment deadlines. This also contradicts the initial 'ten (10) business days after the end of each quarter' promise. This creates uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The change removes the cure periods for defaults, allowing immediate termination. Some states mandate a reasonable opportunity to cure breaches of contract before termination. By removing the cure period, the contract could be deemed unconscionable or in violation of good faith and fair dealing principles.",

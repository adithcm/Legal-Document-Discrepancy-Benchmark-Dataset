                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto with verbal notification, and such revocation shall be effective immediately for all parties.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction because the original text requires a signed writing for revocation, which provides a documented record. The modified text allows for verbal revocation with immediate effect, which is insufficient under corporate and securities law that requires proper written notification for material agreements such as joint filing agreements. It also lacks clarity on how the company would maintain records of such verbal revocations, creating potential disputes and non-compliance with SEC regulations.",

                "changed_text": "Each party is responsible for their initial filing only; no party is responsible for amendments or the accuracy of information provided by any other party, regardless of knowledge.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict with securities laws. By stating that no party is responsible for amendments or the accuracy of other parties' information, even if they have knowledge of inaccuracies, it violates the 'duty to correct' inaccurate filings. SEC regulations require parties to promptly correct any misleading statements or omissions in filings, especially when they become aware of them.",

Schwarzman, on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant to the parties, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto. The parties agree that any disputes arising from this Joint Filing Agreement will only be resolved through confidential arbitration.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder' weakens the explicit commitment to comply with securities laws. Secondly, requiring 'confidential arbitration' can conflict with mandatory disclosure requirements under securities laws, especially if the dispute involves material information that should be publicly disclosed. Public companies are required to disclose events that are material to investors.",

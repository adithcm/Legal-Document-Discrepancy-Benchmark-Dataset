                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction by limiting the agreement's validity to 6 months and invalidating signatures older than 30 days before filing. SEC regulations and corporate law generally allow for longer durations and do not impose such strict limitations on signature validity periods, which may hinder the parties' ability to fulfill their obligations under securities laws.",

The electronic signatures are considered preliminary and must be ratified via traditional signature on paper document no later than 10 days after the date specified above.",
                "explanation": "By removing the '/s/' notation before the names and adding the requirement for subsequent paper signatures within 10 days, the contract introduces uncertainty about the validity of electronic signatures. Under the U.S. Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), electronic signatures are generally legally valid and enforceable, provided certain requirements are met. Requiring a subsequent paper signature within 10 days contradicts this principle by casting doubt on the initial electronic signature and setting an unreasonably short deadline for ratification.",

This agreement will automatically be considered null and void after 3 months regardless of the filing status.",
                "explanation": "This modification adds a clause stating that the agreement is automatically void after 3 months. This contradicts standard contractual principles where agreements remain valid until their stated termination date or fulfillment of obligations, unless explicitly stated otherwise under specific conditions. This addition could potentially conflict with SEC regulations regarding the required duration and enforceability of joint filing agreements, especially if the filing process extends beyond the 3-month window.",

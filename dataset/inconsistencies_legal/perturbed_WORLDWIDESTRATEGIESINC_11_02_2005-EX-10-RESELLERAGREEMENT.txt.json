All or any portion of the Fees not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half (1.5%) per month, calculated from the date such payment is due until the date on which such payment is made, inclusive; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such interest rate exceeds the amount allowed by applicable law, then the interest rate shall be adjusted to reflect the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "Payment of the Fees shall be due and payable within sixty (60) days of the date of the invoice. All or any portion of the Fees not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of twenty-five percent (25%) per month, calculated from the date such payment is due until the date on which such payment is made, inclusive; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such interest rate exceeds the amount allowed by applicable law, then the interest rate shall be adjusted to reflect the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides for payment within 10 days, which is a reasonable business practice. This is modified to 60 days. This change could create inconsistency because the standard business practice for invoice payments may require shorter payment terms. Furthermore, the imposition of 25% monthly interest, even with the caveat about legal limits, introduces a high, potentially usurious interest rate, creating a legal contradiction if the applicable state law has usury laws that cap interest rates at a lower level.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires the reseller to notify TouchStar within 5 days of any claim or proceeding. The modified text changes this to 1 day. One (1) day is an unreasonably short time frame which may not be adequate for a party to assess the situation and contact legal counsel. It potentially conflicts with the legal principle of 'reasonable notice' and creates an unconscionable burden on the Reseller, particularly if the claim involves complex legal issues requiring more time for review. If the reseller fails to comply they may be penalized.",

Reseller will cause its insurance agent or broker to issue and deliver to TouchStar certified copies of certificates evidencing that insurance coverage of the required types and limits are in full force and effect.

                "explanation": "The original text requires the reseller to maintain insurance for two years after the term, and to provide 30 days notice before insurance changes. The modified text changes this to one year, and ten days notice. Some states may require a minimum of 30 days' notice to affected parties (like TouchStar) prior to any insurance policy cancellation, non-renewal, or material modification to allow them sufficient time to secure alternative coverage. Furthermore, the one-year requirement following the term could be too short and may conflict with indemnification obligations that could remain in effect longer.",

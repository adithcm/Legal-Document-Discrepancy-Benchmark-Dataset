Each party to the agreement expressly authorizes each other party to file on its behalf any and all amendments to such statement.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13G (excluding amendments thereto) with respect to the Common Stock of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and further agree that this agreement need not be included as an exhibit to such filing. Each party to the agreement expressly prohibits each other party to file on its behalf any and all amendments to such statement.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts SEC regulations regarding Schedule 13G filings. By excluding amendments and prohibiting other parties from filing on behalf of each other, the agreement violates the requirements for accurate and timely updates to beneficial ownership information as mandated by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces several legal contradictions. First, requiring only one signature violates the principle of joint agreements needing all parties' consent. Second, declaring the agreement executed regardless of signature status after 180 days contradicts basic contract law, which requires mutual assent demonstrated by signatures or other legally recognized forms of agreement. This could lead to disputes regarding enforceability.",

Replacing valid signatures with anonymous signatures/random names introduces a contradiction with legal standards requiring proper identification and authorization of signatories for a legally binding agreement.

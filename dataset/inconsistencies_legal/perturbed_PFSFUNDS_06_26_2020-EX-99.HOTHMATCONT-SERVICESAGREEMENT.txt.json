                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement may be terminated without the payment of any penalty by either party upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated without the payment of any penalty by either party upon fifteen (15) days' written notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires 60 days' written notice for termination. Reducing this to 15 days could conflict with common law principles requiring reasonable notice or specific state laws that might imply a longer reasonable period, particularly given the nature of the services and potential disruption to the Trust. This creates a contractual term that does not allow reasonable time to find a new service provider to replace the services provided in this agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Common Law Principles of Reasonable Notice for Contract Termination; potential conflict with Massachusetts state law regarding reasonable notice periods based on industry standards.",

                "original_text": "The Adviser shall create and maintain all necessary records in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, records required by Section 31(a) of the Act and the rules thereunder, as the same may be amended from time to time, pertaining to the various functions performed by it and not otherwise created and maintained by another party pursuant to contract with the Trust. Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by the Adviser for the periods and in the places required by Rule 31a-2 under the Act.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser shall create and maintain only those records it deems necessary, notwithstanding Section 31(a) of the Act and the rules thereunder. The Adviser may dispose of records at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the Investment Company Act of 1940, which mandates specific record-keeping requirements for investment advisers. By stating that the Adviser only needs to keep records it deems necessary and can dispose of them at its discretion, the modified text creates a clear violation of federal law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 31a-2 thereunder.",

                "original_text": "For the performance of the Adviser's obligations under this Agreement, including payment of certain expenses of each of the Funds pursuant to paragraph 3 hereof, each Fund shall pay the Adviser, on the first business day following the end of each month, a fee at an annual rate of 0.65% of a Fund's average daily net assets up to $25 million, 0.35% of a Fund's average daily net assets from $25 million to $100 million, and 0.25% of a Fund's average daily net assets for such assets in excess of $100 million.",
                "changed_text": "For the performance of the Adviser's obligations under this Agreement, each Fund shall pay the Adviser, at the Adviser's discretion, with payments potentially occurring quarterly or annually, and at a rate determined solely by the Adviser. ",
                "explanation": "This change makes the payment terms vague and gives complete discretion to the Advisor in contradiction with regulations mandating accurate accounting and disclosure of fees. Payment only at the Advisor's discretion creates opportunities for unfair billing and reporting, contradicting securities laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations regarding accurate accounting and disclosure of fees in investment advisory agreements; potential violation of fiduciary duty.",

                "original_text": "(e) Party B shall arrive at the network partners determined by Party A according to the time and route stipulated in this Agreement, and strictly comply with the start time and end time. Unless otherwise approved by Party A, in the event of parcel transfer due to Party B's vehicle delay, Party B shall pay liquidated damages to Party A at the standard rate of RMB500 per trip on the first working day, RMB1,000 per trip on the second working day and RMB2,000 per trip on the third working day (based on the time records on the parcel transfer documents) and such liquidated damages will be deducted from the current month's freight.",
                "changed_text": "(e) Party B shall arrive at the network partners determined by Party A according to the time and route stipulated in this Agreement, and strictly comply with the start time and end time. Unless otherwise approved by Party A, in the event of parcel transfer due to Party B's vehicle delay, Party B shall pay liquidated damages to Party A at the standard rate of RMB5000 per trip immediately, and such liquidated damages will be deducted from the current month's freight.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement specified increasing liquidated damages for delays over multiple days. The modified text demands a large lump sum payment immediately for any delay, which could be considered an unreasonable penalty under contract law in many jurisdictions (including the United States and potentially China where the companies are located), especially if the delay is minor or caused by circumstances beyond Party B's control. Courts often scrutinize liquidated damages clauses, requiring them to be a reasonable forecast of actual damages and not punitive.",

Specific statutes and case law vary by jurisdiction (e.g., in the U.S., the principle of 'reasonable compensation' for breach of contract; in China, contract law principles regarding fairness and reasonableness).",

                "changed_text": "Party B shall pay twelve-month freight as liquidated damages in case of termination of the Agreement without consent.",
                "explanation": "Requiring twelve-month's freight as liquidated damages for early termination without consent is likely an excessive and unreasonable penalty, especially if the remaining term of the agreement is less than twelve months, or if the damages suffered by Party A are far less than this amount. This creates a potentially unenforceable penalty clause, as it doesn't reflect a reasonable estimate of actual damages.",

                "changed_text": "Any different interpretation of this Agreement by both Parties is subject to final and unquestionable interpretation by Party A.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives Party A final interpretation rights which is already heavily weighted in their favor. By adding 'unquestionable', it eliminates any possibility of challenge and denies Party B of their right to due process in resolving disputes. This clause now violates the principle of fairness and equal standing in contract law and would be likely unenforceable.",

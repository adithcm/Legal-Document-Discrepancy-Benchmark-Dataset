                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment within 45 days of invoice receipt. This has been extended to 90 days, potentially conflicting with prompt payment laws in Texas, which generally require payments to be made within 30 days unless otherwise specified and justified. Increasing this period might violate the Texas Prompt Payment Act, especially if no reasonable justification exists for the extended timeframe. See Texas Government Code, Chapter 2251.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the option period from six months to two months could be seen as unreasonably limiting MD Anderson's ability to fully assess the commercial potential of an invention and negotiate fair licensing terms, which might be viewed as unconscionable under Texas law, especially considering MD Anderson's role as a public institution. This alteration could conflict with principles of fair dealing and good faith, potentially weakening MD Anderson's position in intellectual property rights management.",

                "explanation": "Extending the publication embargo period from six months to twelve months post-study completion, or from twelve months to eighteen months after multi-site study completion, impacts academic freedom principles, which could be challenged under Texas law, especially for a public academic institution like MD Anderson. Texas law provides certain protections for academic freedom, and excessively restricting publication rights may infringe upon these protections.",

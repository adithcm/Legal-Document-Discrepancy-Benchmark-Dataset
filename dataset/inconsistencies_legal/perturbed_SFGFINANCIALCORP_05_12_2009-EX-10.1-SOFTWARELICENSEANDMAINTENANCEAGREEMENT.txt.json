                "original_text": "Licensee shall prepare and submit summary quarterly reports to Licensor no later than 20 days following the last business day of each calendar quarter, which reports must specify a complete record of usage of the Licensed Technology by the Licensee and shall accompany the payments made to Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall prepare and submit summary quarterly reports to Licensor no later than 60 days following the last business day of each calendar quarter, which reports must specify a complete record of usage of the Licensed Technology by the Licensee and shall accompany the payments made to Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The change extends the deadline for submitting quarterly reports from 20 days to 60 days. This conflicts with standard business practices and could potentially violate regulations requiring timely financial reporting, depending on the specific industry and applicable laws. While not directly violating a specific statute, it creates a risk of non-compliance with general financial transparency and reporting standards, especially if these reports are used for tax or regulatory filings.",

                "explanation": "The modification extends the timeframe for the Licensee to return all licensed technology and confidential information to the Licensor upon termination of the agreement from five (5) days to ninety (90) days.

Distributor shall pay half (1/2) of the purchase price prior to shipment and the remaining balance 30 days after shipment of the Products. Payments received after the 30 day calendar period will be subject to a late fee of 1.5% of the invoice amount. All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "changed_text": "b. Erchonia shall submit invoices to Distributor after or concurrent with shipment of Products to Distributor at the delivery address. Distributor shall pay half (1/2) of the purchase price prior to shipment and the remaining balance 60 days after shipment of the Products. Payments received after the 60 day calendar period will be subject to a late fee of 5% of the invoice amount. All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment 30 days after shipment, with a 1.5% late fee. The modification extends the payment period to 60 days and increases the late fee to 5%. While extending the payment period is not inherently illegal, California law (where Distributor is located) may consider a 5% late fee as usurious if it's significantly above market rates and deemed exploitative, especially for businesses. California usury laws generally apply to loans, but courts can recharacterize transactions to prevent evasion of these laws. A 5% late fee could be argued as an attempt to circumvent usury laws depending on the specific circumstances and relationship between the parties.",

If the breach is not cured within five days of such notice, the Agreement will terminate immediately.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows a 10-day cure period for a material breach. The modification shortens this to 5 days. Depending on the nature of the breach and applicable state law (Florida), a 5-day cure period might be deemed unreasonably short, especially if curing the breach requires significant effort or resources. This could potentially be challenged as unconscionable or a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows the distributor 30 days to dismiss a bankruptcy petition before Erchonia can terminate the agreement. Modifying this to 10 days creates an inconsistency because such a brief period to resolve complex legal proceedings related to bankruptcy or reorganisation might be deemed unreasonable or against public policy by bankruptcy courts.",

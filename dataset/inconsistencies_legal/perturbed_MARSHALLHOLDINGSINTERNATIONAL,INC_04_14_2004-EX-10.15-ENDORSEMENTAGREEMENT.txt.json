                "original_text": "The CELEBRITY will assist in getting a distributorship started through his      contacts and fan mail. The CELEBRITY can designate the party placed in the      distributorship direct to the Company. This distributorship will be      independent of the endorsement terms of the agreement and will remain on      going as long as the CELEBRITY maintains the annual membership fee.",
                "changed_text": "The CELEBRITY will assist in getting a distributorship started through his contacts and fan mail. The CELEBRITY can designate the party placed in the distributorship direct to the Company. This distributorship will be independent of the endorsement terms of the agreement and will automatically terminate after 30 days, regardless of the CELEBRITY's actions.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a clause that the distributorship automatically terminates after 30 days. This contradicts standard business practices and potentially state franchise laws (depending on the nature of the distributorship) that often require a 'reasonable' opportunity to cure any deficiencies before termination. It could also run afoul of good faith and fair dealing requirements in contract law, particularly in Nevada.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Nevada Revised Statutes related to franchise agreements or common law principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "COMPANY will pay $10,000 upfront to begin representation and support of the CELEBRITY.\n\n     (iii) CELEBRITY will receive $6,000 per month for the first month of the agreement. All subsequent payments are at the COMPANY's sole discretion and are contingent upon the CELEBRITY's performance as subjectively determined by the COMPANY.",
                "explanation": "This change makes the monthly payments discretionary after the first month. This likely violates contract law principles requiring consideration for an agreement, as the CELEBRITY's continued performance is not guaranteed compensation. It could also be considered an illusory promise. This is particularly relevant in Nevada, where contracts require mutuality of obligation.",

                "explanation": "This modification changes the deadline for implementing the business strategy from 30 days to 5 days. This creates an unreasonably short timeline for developing and implementing a business strategy, potentially contradicting the standard of 'reasonable time' implied in contract performance under Nevada law. Depending on the complexity of the required strategy, this may be deemed commercially impractical, rendering the clause unenforceable or subject to legal challenge based on impossibility of performance.",

                "original_text": "(a) This Agreement shall become effective as of the first date above written. This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, upon 60 days' written notice, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or by the vote of the Fund's Trustees or by the Blockchain Administrator.",
                "changed_text": "(a) This Agreement shall become effective as of the first date above written. This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, upon 10 days' written notice, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or by the vote of the Fund's Trustees or by the Blockchain Administrator.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 10 days could be problematic. While the Investment Company Act doesn't specify a precise notice period for termination of agreements like this, such a short notice period might be deemed unreasonable, particularly if it disrupts the Fund's operations or prejudices the interests of the Fund or its shareholders. A longer notice period is often seen as necessary to ensure an orderly transition of services and compliance with fiduciary duties. Under general contract law principles, a court may find the shortened period unconscionable.",

                "changed_text": "(b) This Agreement shall continue in effect for five years from the date hereof, and thereafter shall continue automatically for successive five-year periods, and no annual approval is required.",
                "explanation": "The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires annual approval of advisory and related agreements by the board of directors or shareholders, particularly including a majority of independent directors. Removing the annual approval requirement directly contradicts Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, making the agreement non-compliant.",

                "explanation": "Regulation S-P allows for certain disclosures of nonpublic personal information with consumer consent. By prohibiting disclosure even with prior consent, the modified clause creates an unnecessary restriction that conflicts with the flexibility provided under Regulation S-P. This could limit the Fund's ability to operate efficiently and potentially hinder compliance efforts, for instance, when needing to share information with auditors or regulatory bodies with explicit consent.",

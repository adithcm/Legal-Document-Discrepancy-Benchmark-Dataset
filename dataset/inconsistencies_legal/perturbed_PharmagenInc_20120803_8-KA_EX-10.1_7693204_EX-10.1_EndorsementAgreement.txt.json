                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "$10,000 Within ten (10) days of the parties execution of this Agreement\n$15,000 Within 60 days of the parties execution of this agreement\n$25,000* Ten (10) days prior to the Production Session",

                "explanation": "The changed deadlines for cash payments extend the payment periods beyond what is considered reasonable or standard in many jurisdictions. This could violate prompt payment laws or industry standards for influencer marketing agreements. Also, the last payment is scheduled after the production session, incentivizing Celebrity to breach contract. The original timeline ensures payment before the production session.",

                "changed_text": "Said written approval must be given within one (1) business day of CSE's receipt or said usage shall be deemed unapproved.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the approval timeframe to one business day places an unreasonable burden on the Celebrity's agent, CSE, potentially infringing on their ability to adequately review and approve advertising materials. This contradicts the reasonable business practice and potentially state laws that protect individuals from unfair contract terms.",

                "changed_text": "HDS shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately without notice to Celebrity in the event Celebrity fails to perform the duties set forth in Paragraph 4 hereof or breaches any other covenant or agreement set forth herein.",
                "explanation": "Removing the notice and cure period for breach of contract violates fundamental principles of contract law. Most jurisdictions require a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach before termination is permitted. Immediate termination without notice is generally only permissible in cases of severe breaches or as expressly permitted by law, which is not indicated here.",

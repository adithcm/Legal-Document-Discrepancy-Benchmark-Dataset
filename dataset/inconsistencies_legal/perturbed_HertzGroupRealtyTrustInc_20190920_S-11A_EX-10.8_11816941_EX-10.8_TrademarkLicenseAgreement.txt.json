                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement by giving the other Party ten (10) days' prior written notice.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 10 days could be deemed unreasonable in certain jurisdictions, particularly where significant investments or ongoing operations are involved. California courts often consider the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which may require a longer notice period depending on the circumstances. A notice period this short could lead to claims of breach of contract if it causes undue hardship or prevents the other party from taking reasonable steps to mitigate damages.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement and all rights and licenses granted under this Agreement shall terminate immediately after: 3.2.1 Licensee is acquired by a third party; or 3.2.2 Licensor or any affiliate of Licensor ceases to manage Licensee.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a 30-day wind-down period. Changing this to immediate termination upon acquisition or management cessation could contradict California law regarding reasonable wind-down periods, especially if the licensee has outstanding obligations or requires time to transition its operations. Immediate termination might not allow sufficient time to comply with legal requirements, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "The modified indemnification clause requires the Licensee to indemnify the Licensor even if the claim arises from the Licensor's own negligence or fault. This is against California law. California Civil Code Section 2782 generally prohibits indemnity agreements that purport to indemnify a party for its own sole negligence or willful misconduct in construction contracts and other agreements can be interpreted against public policy if they are overly broad and require indemnification for the indemnitee's own actions.",

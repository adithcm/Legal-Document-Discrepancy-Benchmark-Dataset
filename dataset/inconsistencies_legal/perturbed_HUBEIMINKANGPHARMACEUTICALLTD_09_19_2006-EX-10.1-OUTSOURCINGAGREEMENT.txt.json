                "explanation": "This change reduces the time frame for completing photo-editing services to 2 days. Such a short turnaround time may be deemed unreasonable and could potentially violate labor laws or regulations related to fair business practices, depending on the volume and complexity of the work, especially in states that prioritize fair and reasonable deadlines for contracted services.",

                "explanation": "This change shortens the statute of limitations for bringing a legal action to one month. This is likely inconsistent with Nevada's statute of limitations for contract disputes, which typically allows for a longer period (e.g., 4 years for written contracts).",

                "explanation": "This modification allows DGT to immediately terminate the agreement without providing any notice or opportunity to cure. This contradicts the principle of good faith and fair dealing implied in most contracts, and the lengthened cure period for DGT places an unreasonable burden on Dolphin. The modification likely violates contract law principles that require reasonable notice and opportunity to cure breaches.",

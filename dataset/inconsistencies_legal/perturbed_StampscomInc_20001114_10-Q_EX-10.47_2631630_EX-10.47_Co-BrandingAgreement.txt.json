                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Company shall pay such amounts, less the relevant Bounty Fee or eBay Fee then in effect, to MBE on the next business day or as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within one week) following the shipment date of each package, and MBE agrees to distribute such amounts to the MBE Centers.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall pay such amounts, less the relevant Bounty Fee or eBay Fee then in effect, to MBE within 60 days following the shipment date of each package, and MBE agrees to distribute such amounts to the MBE Centers at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment timeline from 'next business day or within one week' to 'within 60 days,' contradicting standard business practices and potentially violating state prompt payment laws if the agreement is interpreted as a service contract. Additionally, 'at its discretion' removes the obligation for MBE to distribute payments promptly, further conflicting with potential legal expectations of timely payment for services rendered by MBE Centers.",

                "original_text": "MBE shall, at any time during the term of this Agreement, be entitled to audit all such records upon ten (10) days written notice to the Company, in order to confirm the accuracy of such records and conformance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that no more than one (1) such audit may be conducted in any -------- ------- ninety (90)-day period.",
                "changed_text": "MBE shall only be entitled to audit such records at the Company's discretion, and with a thirty (30) days written notice. No audits are allowed after the term of the agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows MBE to audit records with 10 days' notice, but no more than once every 90 days. The modified text makes audits discretionary by the Company, extends the notice period to 30 days, and disallows audits after the agreement's term. This change could impede MBE's ability to verify payments and compliance, potentially violating legal principles of good faith and fair dealing if the audit restrictions prevent MBE from ensuring accurate accounting. Also, the restriction on audits after the term of the agreement may conflict with laws regarding access to records for resolving disputes or ensuring compliance with contractual obligations.",

                "changed_text": "(i) The Company, at its sole option, may terminate this Agreement immediately with no notice, regardless of any attempts by the other party to cure any breach.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires a notice period and an opportunity to cure a breach before termination. The modified text allows the Company to terminate the agreement immediately without any notice or opportunity to cure, which may violate legal principles of fairness and good faith, particularly if state law requires reasonable notice and opportunity to cure material breaches of contract. Some states may deem such a provision unconscionable or unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "The Services are deemed to be accepted if MMI does not receive a notification within 60 days after delivery to Dragon Systems or its customers.",
                "changed_text": "The Services are deemed to be accepted if MMI does not receive a notification within 100 days after delivery to Dragon Systems or its customers.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the acceptance period to 100 days could create an unreasonable delay in acceptance, conflicting with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in performing their contractual obligations. A court may find 100 days to be commercially unreasonable, especially considering the nature of the services and industry standards, potentially rendering this clause unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Extending the payment deadline to 90 days without any apparent justification could be considered an unreasonable delay in payment, violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. While not explicitly illegal, such an extended payment term, especially in the absence of mutual agreement or industry custom, could be deemed a breach of contract due to its commercial unreasonableness.",

                "changed_text": "Should MMI not supply the Services as agreed or should the Services become defective within 1 month from their delivery to Dragon Systems, Dragon Systems may at its option require MMI to complete or re-perform the Services within a reasonable period of time, rescind the contract or refuse payment of the compensation in part or in total, notwithstanding any damage claims.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the warranty period to one month for defective services could be considered unconscionable, particularly if the defects are not immediately apparent or the nature of the services warrants a longer period for detection. This could conflict with consumer protection laws or general principles of contract law regarding reasonable warranty periods, making this clause potentially unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A, which prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices, could be implicated if the warranty period is deemed unreasonably short.",

                "original_text": "4.2 Payment for the Products shall be in U.S. Dollars, or such other currency as STAAR may require in its sole discretion, and made within thirty (30) days of STAAR's invoice. Late payments shall be subject to an interest charge of 1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.",

Late payments shall be subject to an interest charge of 2% per month, regardless of the maximum amount permitted by applicable law.",
                "explanation": "This modification changes the payment terms to contradict usury laws. Charging 2% interest per month may exceed the legal interest rate in California, where the contract is governed, thus creating non-compliance. California usury laws limit the interest rate that can be charged on certain types of loans and debts. This also includes a contracted time frame that exceeds industry standards.",

Documentation with respect to Complaints shall include the Product model and serial or lot number, customer contact information, and as much detail as possible regarding the nature of the Complaint. Distributor will forward to STAAR any Complaint involving significant bodily injury, illness or death resulting from use of Products within one (1) calendar day of receipt and Distributor must notify STAAR of any such incident prior to issuing any notice required by law in respect of such incident (including those to be issued to governmental or regulatory authorities).

Distributor shall forward to STAAR all other Complaints within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt.",
                "explanation": "This modification alters the reporting timelines for complaints, particularly those involving serious harm. Requiring a 5-day reporting window for significant bodily injury, illness, or death, and removing the obligation to notify before issuing legal notices, contradicts medical device reporting regulations (e.g., FDA regulations in the US or similar regulations in other countries) that require immediate or very prompt reporting of such incidents. The increased time frame for 'all other complaints' also contradicts industry standards.",

On a separate endorsement, Distributor shall name STAAR as an additional named insured. Such separate endorsement shall indicate that Distributor's insurance is primary and that STAAR's coverage as an additional named insured is not contributory. Each such insurance policy and endorsement shall provide that the insurance will not be canceled or reduces without at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to STAAR. On request, Distributor shall provide STAAR with copies or certificates of all such insurance policies.",
                "changed_text": "13.2 Distributor shall, at its own expense, maintain at a minimum general and product liability coverage in the Territory of at least US$500,000 per occurrence, US$1 million in the aggregate. Distributor is not required to name STAAR as an additional named insured. Such insurance policy and endorsement shall provide that the insurance can be canceled or reduced with five (5) days' prior written notice to STAAR. On request, Distributor shall provide STAAR with copies or certificates of all such insurance policies.",
                "explanation": "This modification decreases the minimum insurance coverage amounts and reduces the notification period for cancellation or reduction of coverage to five days. Decreasing the coverage amounts to US$500,000 per occurrence and US$1 million in aggregate may be insufficient to cover potential liabilities arising from product defects or other incidents, contradicting industry standards and potentially violating legal requirements in some jurisdictions depending on the nature of the products and the scale of distribution. Reducing the notification period to five days also violates California law.",

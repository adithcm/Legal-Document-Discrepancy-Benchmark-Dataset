                "original_text": "(a) You will use your best efforts to locate and select a proposed site for the Premises that is acceptable to us as suitable for the operation of the Franchise, which must be reviewed and approved by us within six (6) months of the Agreement Date. Our review and approval process may take up to thirty (30) days, so we recommend you submit your proposed site to us within one hundred fifty (150) days of the Agreement Date. You must submit to us, in the form we specify, a description of the site and such other information or materials as we may reasonably require. We will not unreasonably withhold approval of a site that meets our standards for general location and neighborhood, traffic patterns, parking size, layout and other physical characteristics, for The Joint Corp. Location franchises. Our approval of a site shall not constitute, nor be deemed, a judgment as to the likelihood of success of a The Joint Corp. Location at such location, or a judgment as to the relative desirability of such location in comparison to other locations. If you fail to identify a mutually-agreeable site within the aforementioned six (6) month period, we may terminate this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires site approval within six months. The modified text reduces this to three months and extends the review process to 45 days. This could create a legal issue if the franchisee needs more than three months, and could violate laws that mandate sufficient time for due diligence in franchise agreements. Also, it would depend on the state, as some states may have laws preventing unreasonable deadlines for site selection.",

                "explanation": "This clause originally allows nine months to open the franchise. Reducing this to three months creates an unreasonable timeframe, violating franchise laws that require franchisors to provide sufficient time for franchisees to prepare and open their businesses. Some states have laws regarding reasonable opening timelines.",

In consideration of the services to be rendered under this Agreement as set forth above, the Company shall be\nentitled to compensation in the amount of $150,000.00 (One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars), to be paid in equal installments of $37,500.00\n(Thirty Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars) on January 1, 2008, April 1, 2008, July 1, 2008 and October 1, 2008. If Cano fails to make any\npayment when required by this Agreement, the Company shall have the option of canceling this Agreement following the passage of ten\n(10) days after having given Cano written notice of its default. While the Company shall have no further obligation to Cano following\ncancellation of the Agreement, Cano shall remain liable for all unpaid installments for the then current term of the Agreement, which\ninstallments shall be immediately due and payable.",

                "explanation": "The modification reduces the cure period for payment default from ten days to two days. This contradicts standard commercial practice and could be deemed unconscionable, particularly if such a short cure period is not reasonable given the amount of payment due and the potential impact of cancellation. This also pressures the paying party unduly, which is against good-faith contract performance.",

                "explanation": "The modification removes the option of using registered or certified mail, return receipt requested for delivering notices. This can create issues of proof of delivery, especially in legal disputes. Restricting notice to only 'personal delivery in writing' is not commercially reasonable and can be deemed insufficient under Texas law that favors reasonable notice methods. It opens the door for disputes over whether notice was actually received.",

                "explanation": "By adding \"regardless of fault or negligence by Cano,\" the exculpatory clause now attempts to shield Cano from liability even in cases where their own negligence directly causes injury. This is problematic under Texas law because exculpatory clauses releasing a party from liability for its own negligence are generally disfavored and are subject to specific enforceability requirements, including conspicuousness and fair notice. A clause that attempts to release a party from gross negligence or intentional misconduct is generally unenforceable as against public policy.",

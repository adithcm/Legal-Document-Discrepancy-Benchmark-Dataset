                "explanation": "This change extends the payment timeframe beyond what is typically considered reasonable or legally compliant in many jurisdictions, potentially violating prompt payment laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of California Prompt Payment Laws (though specific requirements vary depending on industry and contract type). General contract law principles of reasonableness.",

                "explanation": "This reduces the notice period for non-renewal to five days, which is likely unreasonable and potentially violates implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Many states require more substantial notice periods for contract non-renewal.",

                "explanation": "This change specifies that notice is deemed given upon sending an email, disregarding whether the email was actually received or read. This can lead to legal problems because it doesn't ensure actual notice, potentially contradicting legal requirements for proper notification.",

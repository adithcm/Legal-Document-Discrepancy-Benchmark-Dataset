                "explanation": "Delaying the initial payment to 60 business days could create inconsistencies if standard commercial practices or regulations in PRC mandate a quicker payment timeframe, potentially violating typical payment terms.",

                "explanation": "Making the second payment discretionary introduces uncertainty and contradicts the original fixed payment schedule. This violates the principle of 'consideration' in contract law, where both parties must provide something of value. Under PRC Contract Law, contracts must clearly define the obligations of each party, and this change makes Party B's payment obligation ambiguous and unenforceable.",

If Party B receives any complaint of any third party regarding the tort or breach of any content in the Cooperation channel which is forwarded from Party A, Party B will delete such content within 72 hours.",
                "explanation": "Changing the response time to complaints to 'earliest convenience' provides no definite answer for the other parties. Delaying content removal related to torts to 72 hours may not satisfy legal requirements in the PRC for prompt action in cases of defamation, copyright infringement, or other illegal content, potentially leading to legal liability.",

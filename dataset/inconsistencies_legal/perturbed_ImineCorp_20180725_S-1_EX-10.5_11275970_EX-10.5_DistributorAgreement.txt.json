                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Terms of payment shall be net thirty (30) days.",
                "changed_text": "Terms of payment shall be net sixty (60) days.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by extending the payment terms to 60 days. While not universally illegal, such a significant extension without clear justification could be deemed an unfair business practice or lead to disputes, especially if it deviates substantially from industry standards in Taiwan, where the Distributor is located. Many jurisdictions have regulations regarding fair and reasonable payment terms, especially for smaller businesses. The original 30-day term is more standard.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates fair trade practices or implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under Taiwanese commercial law, depending on industry standards and specific circumstances.",
                "location": "Section 6.1"
            },
            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Distributor shall have thirty (30) days (the \"Inspection Period\") upon receipt of each shipment to inspect and test the Products. If the Distributor determines any unit of Products defective, the Distributor shall promptly notify JRVS of such defects.",
                "changed_text": "The Distributor shall have ten (10) days (the \"Inspection Period\") upon receipt of each shipment to inspect and test the Products. If the Distributor determines any unit of Products defective, the Distributor shall promptly notify JRVS of such defects.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the inspection period from 30 to 10 days. This could be considered an unreasonably short period for inspecting complex cryptocurrency mining rigs, potentially violating implied warranties of merchantability under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) principles, especially if Taiwan recognizes similar principles. The shortened period places an undue burden on the Distributor to identify defects quickly and may not allow for thorough testing, thus conflicting with consumer protection norms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, based on UCC principles or similar consumer protection laws applicable in Taiwan.",
                "location": "Section 7.2"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "NO ACTIONS, REGARDLESS OF FORM, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, MAY BE BROUGHT BY DISTRIBUTOR MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION HAS ARISEN.",
                "changed_text": "NO ACTIONS, REGARDLESS OF FORM, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, MAY BE BROUGHT BY DISTRIBUTOR MORE THAN SIX (6) MONTHS AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION HAS ARISEN.",
                "explanation": "This change shortens the statute of limitations for actions arising from the agreement to 6 months. This could conflict with statutory limitation periods provided under Indiana law (specified as the governing law in Section 15.11), which are often longer than 6 months for contract-related claims. It could also be deemed unconscionable if it unreasonably restricts the Distributor's ability to pursue legal remedies. While parties can sometimes agree to shorter limitations periods, they must be reasonable and not contravene public policy.",
                "contradicted_law": "Conflicts with Indiana's statute of limitations for contract claims, and potentially violates principles of fairness and reasonable opportunity to pursue legal remedies.",
                "location": "Section 13.2"

                "changed_text": "(c) Payment of License Fees shall be made in Canadian funds in arrears within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter during the Term in which Licensed Programs were exhibited hereunder and shall be accompanied by a statement of account showing the calculation of the License Fees.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment of license fees within 30 days of each calendar month. The modified text changes this to within 60 days of each calendar quarter. This creates a delay in payment that could conflict with provincial regulations regarding timely payment for services or royalties.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with provincial laws in Canada regarding payment terms and frequency, or industry standards for royalty payments which typically mandate more frequent payments.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the licensor provides the advertising samples 5 business days in advance to Rogers to approve. By changing the number of days to one (1) it is creating the possibility for the advertising promotions to be late and disrupt the timeline of the contract. This is inconsistent with the minimum notice periods for marketing materials, especially if any changes are needed.",

                "original_text": "No later than seven days after the Effective Date, VerticalNet shall, at VerticalNet's sole cost and expense, design, develop and implement the Co-Branded Sites with the overall \"look and feel\" agreed upon by VerticalNet and PaperExchange, as shown in Exhibit A. After the Co-Branded Sites are implemented, VerticalNet shall notify PaperExchange in writing at least five days prior to making any material change to a Co-Branded Site, including, without limitation, a change in the location, sizing or placement of the PaperExchange Links. If PaperExchange does not notify VerticalNet of its rejection of such change within five days, PaperExchange shall be deemed to have approved such change.",
                "changed_text": "No later than two days after the Effective Date, VerticalNet shall, at VerticalNet's sole cost and expense, design, develop and implement the Co-Branded Sites with the overall \"look and feel\" agreed upon by VerticalNet and PaperExchange, as shown in Exhibit A. After the Co-Branded Sites are implemented, VerticalNet shall notify PaperExchange in writing at least one day prior to making any material change to a Co-Branded Site, including, without limitation, a change in the location, sizing or placement of the PaperExchange Links. If PaperExchange does not notify VerticalNet of its rejection of such change within one day, PaperExchange shall be deemed to have approved such change.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 7-day period for VerticalNet to implement the Co-Branded Sites and a 5-day period for PaperExchange to reject changes. Reducing these timeframes to 2 days and 1 day, respectively, creates a potential breach of contract if these deadlines are not practically achievable, particularly given the complexities of design, development, and communication. This could be deemed unreasonable and thus contradict standard business practices and potentially create grounds for legal disputes regarding adequate time for fulfilling contractual obligations.",

                "original_text": "Each party shall provide the other party with all amounts due under this Agreement for the prior calendar quarter within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Term. Each payment shall be accompanied by a statement detailing the amount of applicable gross revenue received, the calculation of the amount due to the other party and the amount of the payment accompanying such statement.",
                "changed_text": "Each party shall provide the other party with all amounts due under this Agreement for the prior calendar quarter within 90 days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Term. Each payment will not need to be accompanied by a statement detailing the amount of applicable gross revenue received, the calculation of the amount due to the other party and the amount of the payment accompanying such statement.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the payment timeframe from 30 days to 90 days significantly delays payments, which might violate standard payment term expectations and could be deemed commercially unreasonable, especially if the delay causes financial harm. Additionally, removing the requirement for a detailed statement with each payment contradicts standard accounting and transparency practices, making it difficult to verify payments and raising legal concerns about proper financial reporting. This can be a contradiction of the law since this can cause potential financial risks.",

                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party in the event any material breach of a material term of this Agreement by such other party that remains uncured 30 days in the case of a breach of a payment obligation, or 45 days for all other breaches, after notice of such breach was received by such other party; provided, however that if such breach is not reasonably capable of cure within the applicable cure period, the breaching party shall have an additional 180 days to cure such breach so long as the cure is commenced within the applicable cure period and thereafter is diligently prosecuted to completion as soon as possible.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party in the event any material breach of a material term of this Agreement by such other party that remains uncured 10 days in the case of a breach of a payment obligation, or 15 days for all other breaches, after notice of such breach was received by such other party; provided, however that if such breach is not reasonably capable of cure within the applicable cure period, the breaching party shall have an additional 30 days to cure such breach so long as the cure is commenced within the applicable cure period and thereafter is diligently prosecuted to completion as soon as possible.",
                "explanation": "By reducing the cure periods for breaches (30 days to 10 days for payment obligations, 45 days to 15 days for other breaches, and the additional cure period of 180 days to 30 days), this modification makes it significantly easier to terminate the agreement. These shorter timeframes may be insufficient to reasonably address complex breaches, potentially contradicting the principles of good faith and fair dealing in contract law. Furthermore, the abbreviated periods to cure may be unreasonable for many breaches, potentially making the termination clause unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "Within thirty days after the end of each calendar quarter during the term of this Agreement, LICENSEE shall provide D2 with written reports setting forth the number of LICENSEE Products containing the Licensed Technology that were licensed to end users by LICENSEE in such calendar quarter as more particularly described in Article 2.2 (iii) above.",
                "changed_text": "Within ninety days after the end of each calendar year during the term of this Agreement, LICENSEE shall provide D2 with reports setting forth the number of LICENSEE Products containing the Licensed Technology that were licensed to end users by LICENSEE in such calendar year.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires quarterly reports, offering more frequent monitoring and accountability. The modified text reduces the reporting frequency to annually. This change could violate generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or other financial regulations which may expect more frequent reporting on sales or revenue depending on the context and industry standards. Some jurisdictions or specific agreements related to revenue recognition might require more granular data than an annual report provides.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the maintenance and support period from five years to one year after acceptance of the Licensed Technology could be a breach of implied warranty or violate consumer protection laws. Several jurisdictions mandate a reasonable duration for product support, especially in software licensing agreements. A one-year support period may be deemed insufficient depending on the product's nature and industry standards, thus creating a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates automatic delivery within fifteen days, ensuring timely access for the licensee. The modified text introduces ambiguity ('may deliver at their discretion') and extends the delivery timeframe to ninety days. This delay and uncertainty could violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, and could impact the licensee's ability to maintain and update the software promptly. Such changes undermine the licensee's rights concerning access to essential source code and creates a legal contradiction.",

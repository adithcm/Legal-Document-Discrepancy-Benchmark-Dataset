In the event that Skype provides any Payment Services hereunder, within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, Skype shall furnish to the Company complete and accurate Statements in a form acceptable to Online BVI, certified to be accurate by an officer of Skype, showing with reasonable detail (i) the Gross Revenue actually received and collected by Skype, or if applicable, its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (including, without limitation, a Subsidiary or other Affiliate of Skype Holding), licensee, distributor or reseller thereof, during the preceding calendar quarter and on a cumulative basis, (ii) the Direct Expenses incurred thereby, during the preceding calendar quarter and on a cumulative basis, and (iii) the calculation of Adjusted Net Revenue.",

These statements need not be certified and will be provided 'as is'. The contents of the statement will be determined at Skype's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires companies to furnish complete and accurate financial statements within a specific 30-day timeframe. The modified text removes this requirement, allowing companies to provide statements at their discretion, without needing to be certified, and without specifying what must be included. This contradicts standard accounting practices and legal obligations for accurate and timely financial reporting, creating non-compliance by removing accountability, and precise time and contents.",

The Parties (including Online BVI on behalf of the Online Group) agree to maintain records (i) of all information reasonably necessary to verify all calculations to be made under Section 8.3.2, and (ii) supporting, verifying and necessary to demonstrate the calculation and collection of fees and/or revenue, as well as any deductions thereto, and payments made hereunder, including, without limitation, budgets, purchase orders, expense records, invoices, correspondence, banking and financial and other records pertaining to the determination of Gross Revenue, Direct Expenses and Adjusted Net Revenue, during the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years following the expiration or termination hereof. Not more than once per calendar quarter, each Party or its independent auditor (who shall be a certified public accountant) shall have the right, on not less than fifteen (15) calendar days prior notice and not during the first twenty (20) days after the close of any fiscal quarter of the other Parties, or within sixty (60) day of the close of such Parties' respective fiscal years, to audit the books of account and records of any and all such Parties.",

If a discrepancy is discovered, it will be addressed at the sole discretion of the party being audited.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes clear audit rights with specific notice periods, record-keeping requirements, and procedures. The modified text severely restricts these rights, making audits subject to mutual agreement (which can be withheld), limiting the audit duration to 24 hours, prohibiting record copying, and granting the audited party sole discretion to address discrepancies. This conflicts with standard auditing practices and potentially breaches fiduciary duties, creating non-compliance by limiting transparency.",

The modified clause eliminates this right, mandating that each party bear its own costs regardless of the outcome.

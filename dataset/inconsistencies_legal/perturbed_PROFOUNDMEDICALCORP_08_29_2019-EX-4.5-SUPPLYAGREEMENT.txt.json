                "original_text": "Philips shall confirm to Customer the receipt of each Purchase Order issued hereunder (each, a \"Confirmation\") within seven (7) days following Philips's receipt thereof in writing or in any other mutually agreed manner of communication (e.g., EDI or email). Each Confirmation must reference Customer's Purchase Order number, confirm acceptance of the Purchase Order, include a confirmed date of Delivery (which may differ from the requested one in the Purchase Order) or, solely if permitted under this clause 4.4, advise Customer of Philips's rejection of such Purchase Order, the date of acceptance or rejection and the basis for rejection, if applicable.",
                "changed_text": "Philips shall confirm to Customer the receipt of each Purchase Order issued hereunder (each, a \"Confirmation\") within fifteen (15) days following Philips's receipt thereof in writing or in any other mutually agreed manner of communication (e.g., EDI or email). Each Confirmation must reference Customer's Purchase Order number, confirm acceptance of the Purchase Order, include a confirmed date of Delivery (which may differ from the requested one in the Purchase Order) or, solely if permitted under this clause 4.4, advise Customer of Philips's rejection of such Purchase Order, the date of acceptance or rejection and the basis for rejection, if applicable.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the confirmation period for Purchase Orders to 15 days. This contradicts standard commercial practices that require prompt acknowledgement of orders. The UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), which governs commercial transactions in the United States, implies a reasonable timeframe for acceptance or rejection, and 15 days may be deemed unreasonable, particularly if industry standards dictate faster turnaround.",

                "changed_text": "Philips invoices, compliant with the requirements of this Agreement, will be payable within 120 days following the end of the month of the date of invoice. Customer shall make all payments in Euros by check, wire transfer or automated clearing house to the bank account designated by Philips.",
                "explanation": "Extending the payment term to 120 days could be considered an unfair or exploitative practice, particularly for smaller suppliers. Such extended payment terms may violate prompt payment laws designed to protect businesses from unreasonable delays in compensation. This is particularly relevant in jurisdictions with specific regulations on payment terms for commercial transactions. While no singular federal law dictates payment terms, this could be considered unconscionable under general contract law principles.",

                "explanation": "The modified text eliminates any post-termination confidentiality obligations. This directly conflicts with standard intellectual property and trade secret laws, which typically require ongoing protection of confidential information even after a contractual relationship ends. Eliminating this protection could allow for the misappropriation of trade secrets or other confidential information, violating legal protections afforded to such information.",

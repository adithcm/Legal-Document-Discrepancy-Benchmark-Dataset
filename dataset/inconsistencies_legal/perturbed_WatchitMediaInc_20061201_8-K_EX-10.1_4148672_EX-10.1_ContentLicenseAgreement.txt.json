                "original_text": "In the event that Oceanic Time Warner Cable removes the above content and or terminates this agreement prior to December 31, 2006, Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to pay a cancellation fee of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) per month multiplied by the number of months remain on the agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that Oceanic Time Warner Cable removes the above content and or terminates this agreement prior to December 31, 2006, Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to pay a cancellation fee of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) per month, due and payable immediately upon termination, regardless of the number of months remaining on the agreement. Oceanic may withhold payment pending its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a potential violation of contract law and wage laws. By stating that the cancellation fee is due immediately, regardless of the number of months remaining, and introducing a clause that allows Oceanic to withhold payment at their discretion, the contract becomes inconsistent and potentially unenforceable. In many jurisdictions, such open-ended discretion on payment terms may be deemed unconscionable or a breach of good faith.",

                "explanation": "By adding the clause \"Oceanic Time Warner Cable may delay the provision of such data indefinitely,\" the agreement creates uncertainty and conflicts with basic contract principles requiring reasonable performance. This indefinite delay essentially renders the obligation to provide data meaningless and could hinder Watchit's ability to assess the value of the agreement and secure advertisers. This creates an unenforceable promise.",

                "explanation": "Adding the clause \"may be terminated by either party without notice or cause\" contradicts the initial term of the agreement (until the end of 2006). While at-will agreements are permissible, this change introduces ambiguity regarding the intended duration and termination rights. If state law requires reasonable notice for contract termination, especially where reliance is involved, this clause may conflict with such regulations. It also weakens the initial agreement's defined term.",

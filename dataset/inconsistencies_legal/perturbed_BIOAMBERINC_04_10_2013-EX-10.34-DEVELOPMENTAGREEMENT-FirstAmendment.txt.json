                "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days of the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrating such production levels of succinic acid, Bioamber will cease any further funding and/or other support for the BRI Project. Further Bioamber will require that any unexpended funds received from Bioamber be utilized for a project other than the BRI Project.",
                "changed_text": "Within ten (10) days of the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrating such production levels of succinic acid, Bioamber will cease any further funding and/or other support for the BRI Project. Further Bioamber will require that any unexpended funds received from Bioamber be utilized for the BRI Project, regardless of its progress.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires Bioamber to cease funding and redirect unexpended funds away from the BRI Project within 30 days of achieving certain production levels. The modified text shortens the period to 10 days, which might not be a sufficient timeframe for winding down financial operations according to standard accounting practices or agreements with the Canadian National Research Council (if such agreements require longer notice periods, as common in research grants) violating general contract performance standards. Additionally, mandating that unexpended funds be used for the BRI project even after demonstrating specific production levels introduces a contradiction and potential waste of resources.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring reasonable timeframes for fulfilling obligations; potential conflicts with grant agreements or funding terms requiring specific timelines for project termination and reallocation of funds.",

                "original_text": "Bioamber shall use best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for the use of the CB1 Strain in all countries where Bioamber and/or a Bioamber  licensee are using any strain other than the CB1 strain for the production of succinic acid and/or salts thereof. Additionally, Bioamber shall use  best efforts to scale up the CB1 Strain and fermentation protocols utilizing the CB1 Strain.",
                "changed_text": "Bioamber may, at its convenience, seek regulatory approvals for the use of the CB1 Strain in countries where it deems necessary. Bioamber has no obligation to scale up the CB1 Strain or fermentation protocols; it may proceed at its own discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'best efforts' to obtain regulatory approvals and scale up the CB1 strain. The modified text replaces 'best efforts' with discretionary action, removing any binding obligation. This alteration contradicts standard commercial practice and potentially voids the intent of the agreement. If regulatory approvals are legally required in specific jurisdictions to commercially sell succinic acid produced using CB1, this change introduces a significant inconsistency that could result in non-compliance and legal issues.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, regulatory compliance requirements in jurisdictions where succinic acid production and sale are regulated.",

                "original_text": "WHEREAS, Bioamber further desires to scale-up the production of succinic acid using a Corynebacteria biocatalyst (MCC-17) available from  Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (\"MCC\") and to possibly produce succinic acid or salts using MCC-17 as an alternative to the E. coli BioAmber  has licensed from the DOE at: (1) Bioamber's existing demonstration-scale succinic acid production facility located at Pomacle, France; and (2) a  succinic acid production facility located at Sarnia, Ontario Canada having a maximum production capacity of 35,000 metric tons of succinic acid per  year (the \"Sarnia Plant\"). Together these scale-up projects will be referred to as the \"Scale-up and Production Project\";",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Bioamber desires to scale-up the production of succinic acid using a Corynebacteria biocatalyst (MCC-17) available from Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (\"MCC\") and to produce succinic acid or salts using MCC-17 as an alternative to the E. coli BioAmber has licensed from the DOE. Bioamber is not obligated to adhere to previously agreed production capacities or locations, and can modify plans at their sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines Bioamber's intention to scale up production at specific locations with a defined capacity. The modified text removes the obligation to adhere to these specifics, giving Bioamber sole discretion to change production capacities and locations. This contradicts the initial 'WHEREAS' clauses setting the stage for the agreement, potentially voiding the enforceability of the overall Development Agreement due to lack of commitment to specific terms, especially if Cargill's willingness ('WHEREAS, Cargill is willing to allow Bioamber to fund...') was predicated on these specific locations and capacities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contradicts the principle of mutual agreement and intent necessary for contract formation; undermines the enforceability of the overall agreement due to lack of specific performance obligations.",

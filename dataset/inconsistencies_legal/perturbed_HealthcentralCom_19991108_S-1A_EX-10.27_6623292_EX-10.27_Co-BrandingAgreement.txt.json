                "explanation": "The original text states that monthly payments are due by the 10th of each month. The modified text changes the due date to the 30th of the subsequent month. This introduces potential inconsistencies with prompt payment laws, which often require payment within a specific timeframe. Delaying the payment to the 30th of the following month could violate these laws, leading to legal disputes and penalties.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the advance written notice for audits from seven days to two days may be considered unreasonably short, especially for complex financial audits. This could be seen as a violation of good faith and fair dealing, as it doesn't allow sufficient time for the other party to prepare for the audit. The change can be seen as legally contradictory as it imposes an unreasonable burden and violates standard business practices.",

                "explanation": "The original text prohibits MediaLinx from using user data for competitive purposes for six months after the agreement ends.

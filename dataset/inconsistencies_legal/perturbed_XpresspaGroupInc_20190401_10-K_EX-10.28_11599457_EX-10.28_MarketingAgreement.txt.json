                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Following the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive terms of six (6) months (each a \"Renewal Term\", and together with the Initial Term, the \"Term\") unless written notice is given by either Party no later than thirty (30) days in advance of the expiration of the Initial Term or the applicable Renewal Term.",
                "changed_text": "Following the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive terms of six (6) months (each a \"Renewal Term\", and together with the Initial Term, the \"Term\") unless written notice is given by either Party no later than five (5) days in advance of the expiration of the Initial Term or the applicable Renewal Term.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the advance notice period for non-renewal from 30 days to 5 days. This creates a legal contradiction because, depending on the state (e.g., California), such a short notice period might be deemed unreasonable or insufficient, potentially violating laws related to fair business practices or contract termination notice requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state laws regarding reasonable notice for contract termination, such as implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "XSPA's representatives may, from time to time during regular business hours without any advance notice, during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) month thereafter, inspect and audit such books and records and examine and copy all other documents and material in the possession or under the control of Calm with respect to the subject matter and the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'reasonable advance notice' and reducing the audit period to one month, this change introduces a legal contradiction. Many jurisdictions require reasonable notice for audits to avoid undue disruption to business operations and to allow for proper preparation. Furthermore, limiting the post-term audit period to one month may be deemed insufficient under statutes of limitations or other regulations pertaining to financial record-keeping and auditing rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as well as potential conflicts with statutes of limitations or record-keeping regulations.",

                "explanation": "The change shortens the time frame for the indemnified party to respond to a settlement offer from ten (10) days to two (2) days. This is a legal contradiction because this timeframe may not allow the indemnified party sufficient time to adequately assess the settlement offer, consult with legal counsel, and make an informed decision, potentially conflicting with their due process rights or the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; possible conflict with due process considerations.",

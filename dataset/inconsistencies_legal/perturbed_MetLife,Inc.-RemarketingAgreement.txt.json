                "original_text": "By no later than 4:30 P.M., New York City time, on the Remarketing Settlement Date, provided that there has been a Successful Remarketing, the Remarketing Agents shall advise, by telephone, the Company, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and the Trustee that the Remarketing was a Successful Remarketing and of the Reset Rates determined in the Remarketing and the aggregate principal amount of Remarketed Securities sold in the Remarketing.",
                "changed_text": "By no later than 9:00 P.M., New York City time, three business days following the Remarketing Settlement Date, provided that there has been a Successful Remarketing, the Remarketing Agents may, at their discretion, advise the Company, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and the Trustee that the Remarketing was a Successful Remarketing and of the Reset Rates determined in the Remarketing and the aggregate principal amount of Remarketed Securities sold in the Remarketing.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the Remarketing Agents to notify specific parties of the success of the Remarketing by a specific time. The modified text extends the deadline to three business days following and makes the notification discretionary. This introduces non-compliance because timely notification is crucial for the involved parties to manage their obligations related to the securities. Delaying the notification and making it optional impedes their ability to meet their legal and contractual obligations in a timely manner.",

                "changed_text": "To make available to securityholders of the Company at the Company's discretion, an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) at any point after three years from the effective date of the Registration Statement, unless the company deems it confidential.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that the company must make an earnings statement available within eighteen months. This is being changed to be discretionary, after three years, and unless deemed confidential. This is a contradiction because it makes it more difficult for security holders to have access to important information within a time frame that helps them protect themselves as investors.",

Any changes will be considered binding 30 days after posting them on the company website without direct notice to the other parties. It is the responsibility of all involved parties to regularly check the company website for updates to this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a written instrument signed by all parties to amend the agreement. The modified text allows the Company's General Counsel to unilaterally amend the agreement, with changes becoming binding after 30 days of website posting. This conflicts with standard contract law principles requiring mutual agreement for amendments, as it eliminates the need for consent from all parties and shifts the burden of monitoring changes onto them.",

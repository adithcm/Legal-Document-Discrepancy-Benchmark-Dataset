                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If the Work or any portion thereof is held to constitute an infringement of another Person's rights, and use thereof is enjoined, Garman shall, at its election and expense, make every reasonable effort to correct the situation with minimal effect upon the operations of Sparkling and shall either:\n\n     (a)    procure the right to use the infringing element of the Work;\n\n     (b)    procure the right to an element which performs the same function without any material loss of functionality; or\n\n     (c)    replace or modify the element of the Work so that the infringing portion is no longer infringing and still performs the same function without any material loss of functionality.",
                "changed_text": "If the Work or any portion thereof is held to constitute an infringement of another Person's rights, and use thereof is enjoined, Garman's sole obligation is to discontinue support of the infringing Work. Garman is not obligated to procure rights, replace, or modify the Work. Sparkling is solely responsible for finding alternative solutions.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes Garman's responsibility to resolve infringement issues, shifting the entire burden to Sparkling. This could contradict intellectual property laws that hold the provider of infringing material liable, at least to some extent, and may violate the implied warranty of non-infringement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied Warranty of Non-Infringement under UCC Article 2; Intellectual Property Law (e.g., Copyright Act, Patent Act)",

                "original_text": "Sparkling shall notify Garman in writing of any such claim within ten calendar days of a responsible officer of Sparkling becoming aware of such claim.",
                "changed_text": "Sparkling shall notify Garman in writing of any such claim within two calendar days of a responsible officer of Sparkling becoming aware of such claim.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for intellectual property infringement claims to two calendar days is unreasonably short. This could be deemed unconscionable, especially considering the complexity of investigating such claims. This creates a high risk that Sparkling will forfeit its indemnification rights due to the short timeframe.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law principles of reasonableness and unconscionability.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one year thereafter, both parties agree not to hire or allow its respective affiliates to hire any employee of the other party, or any person who was an employee of the other party during the previous six months and who was directly involved in the provision of services under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of five years thereafter, both parties agree not to hire or allow its respective affiliates to hire any employee of the other party, or any person who was an employee of the other party during the previous two years.",
                "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to five years and removing the clause 'who was directly involved in the provision of services under this Agreement' makes the restriction unreasonably broad and potentially unenforceable. Such broad restrictions on employment may be considered an unlawful restraint of trade, especially in jurisdictions with strong employee mobility protections.",
                "contradicted_law": "Restraint of Trade Doctrines, potentially violating antitrust laws or state laws protecting employee mobility (e.g., California Business and Professions Code Section 16600).",

                "changed_text": "Each of AWP and the Company shall change its respective corporate name and trade name and cause its organizational documents to be amended to remove any reference to \"Armstrong\" at their earliest convenience.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a specific deadline of thirty days for AWP and the Company to change their names. The modified text replaces this deadline with 'at their earliest convenience,' which is vague and could potentially conflict with state laws regarding required notifications and filings for business name changes. Many states require businesses to update their name and organizational documents within a defined timeframe to maintain good standing.",

                "explanation": "The Arizona Trademark License Term has been shortened from 24 months to 6 months. Depending on the specific trademarks and industry, this could be unreasonably short and conflict with established business practices or reasonable expectations, potentially affecting the ongoing viability of the Buyer's business. This may impact the buyer's ability to use the trademarks in commerce and develop brand recognition.",

The modified text reduces this window to 15 days.

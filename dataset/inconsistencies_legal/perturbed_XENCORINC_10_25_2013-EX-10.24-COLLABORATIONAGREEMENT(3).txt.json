                "original_text": "XENCOR shall diligently examine all Product delivered under this Agreement as soon as practicable after receipt. Notice of all claims arising out of or relating to Obvious Defects shall be given in writing to BII within [...***...] after the date of XENCOR's receipt of Product, otherwise, such Product shall be considered free of any Obvious Defects as between BII and XENCOR. XENCOR shall make a damaged Product available for inspection and shall comply with the requirements of any insurance policy covering the Product, and BII shall offer XENCOR all reasonable assistance, at the cost and expense of XENCOR, in pursuing any claims arising out of the transportation of the Product.",
                "changed_text": "XENCOR shall examine all Product delivered under this Agreement at its discretion. Notice of all claims arising out of or relating to Obvious Defects must be given in writing to BII within 24 hours after the date of XENCOR's receipt of Product, otherwise, such Product shall be considered free of any Obvious Defects as between BII and XENCOR. XENCOR may dispose of damaged Product at its discretion and is not obligated to comply with any insurance policy requirements covering the Product. BII is not obligated to offer any assistance in pursuing claims related to transportation damage.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a diligent examination 'as soon as practicable' and sets a reasonable timeframe for reporting obvious defects. The modified text imposes a 24-hour deadline, which may be insufficient and unreasonable, especially considering the complexity of the product and potential need for specialized inspection. Additionally, removing the obligation to comply with insurance requirements and eliminating BII's assistance contradicts standard commercial practices and potentially shifts undue burden onto XENCOR, creating non-compliance with standards of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties agree, for the duration of this Agreement only: (a) to hold in confidence all Confidential Information and Know足How of a Party (\"Disclosing Party\") which has been or will be made available to the other Party (\"Receiving Party\"), and not to disclose such Confidential Information and Know足 How of the Disclosing Party to any third party without explicit permission from the disclosing party, (b) not to use such Confidential Information and Know-How of the Disclosing Party for their own purposes.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a defined period after the agreement's effective date for maintaining confidentiality. The modified text removes this post-agreement obligation, limiting confidentiality to only the duration of the agreement. This is against common and accepted standards where confidentiality obligations typically extend beyond the agreement's term to protect proprietary information. By removing this clause, it creates uncertainty around protection of sensitive information after the agreement expires which can cause disputes and non-compliance with trade secret laws.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated immediately by either Party, if the other Party breaches this Agreement in any manner without opportunity to cure. The terminating party's determination of breach shall be final.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows a 30-day cure period for material breaches. The modified text removes this cure period, allowing immediate termination for any breach, regardless of materiality or possibility of remedy. This conflicts with the legal principle that termination should be proportional to the breach and that parties should have a reasonable opportunity to rectify defaults, especially in commercial contracts. The statement that the terminating party's determination is final removes any recourse or judicial review which is a violation of due process and fair dealing.",

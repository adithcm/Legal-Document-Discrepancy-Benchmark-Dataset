                "original_text": "Within 30 days of the end of each quarter during the term of this agreement, PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT shall receive from THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION, a detailed accounting statement showing Net Due and Paid Shared Revenues for that quarter and shall remit to PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT its share of such revenues.",
                "changed_text": "Within 90 days of the end of each quarter during the term of this agreement, PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT shall receive from THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION, a summary accounting statement showing Net Due and Paid Shared Revenues for that quarter and shall remit to PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT its share of such revenues.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment and detailed accounting statement deadline from 30 days to 90 days after the end of each quarter, and changing the statement to 'summary' accounting statement might be considered an unreasonably long delay and insufficient detail, potentially violating California's prompt payment laws regarding contractual obligations and good faith dealing, as Pacificap Entertainment is located in California and is subject to these laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law regarding contractual obligations, good faith and fair dealing, and potentially prompt payment laws depending on interpretation.",

                "changed_text": "After the Initial Term, this Agreement will be automatically renewed for successive additional 3~year periods (\"Extension Terms\"), unless otherwise terminated by either party by giving notice to the other party not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the end of a Term.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period from 60 days to 15 days before the end of the term could be deemed unconscionable or insufficient notice under California contract law, especially considering the potentially significant business relationship. California law generally requires reasonable notice, and 15 days might not be considered reasonable for a multi-year agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing the arbitration location from San Diego County, California, to Tijuana, Mexico, without specifying choice-of-law provisions that align with California law could conflict with California's public policy regarding enforcement of contracts within its jurisdiction. While parties can agree to arbitration, the location must be reasonable and not designed to deprive a party of their legal rights. This change introduces uncertainty regarding the applicable law and forum and might violate due process if it effectively prevents one party from adequately presenting its case.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law regarding contract enforcement, choice-of-law, and due process; potentially conflicting with the FAA if the agreement does not clearly indicate that California law governs the arbitration process.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires Supplier to confirm or reject Purchase Orders within a certain timeframe of receipt of the Purchase Order. The modified text reduces the timeframe to 1 hour. This timeframe is not commercially reasonable and violates general contract law principles, potentially putting undue pressure on the supplier and not allowing sufficient time to properly assess the order, thereby contradicting established business practices.",

                "original_text": "2.3 NeuroBo shall, at its costs and expenses, deliver the API to the place designated by Dong-A no later than [***] days prior to the requested delivery date for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in accordance with the Firm Order.",
                "changed_text": "2.3 NeuroBo shall, at its costs and expenses, deliver the API to the place designated by Dong-A no later than 5 days prior to the requested delivery date for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in accordance with the Firm Order.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the delivery window for the API. Depending on the complexity of the API and the shipping distance between NeuroBo (Boston, MA) and Dong-A (Republic of Korea), a 5-day window might be insufficient, thus creating potential delays. This contradicts standard commercial practices and potentially violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, as it sets an unreasonably short timeframe that could hinder performance.",

                "changed_text": "3.3 Within 2 days after receipt of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo hereunder, NeuroBo may, in its discretion, perform a quality control test (the \"Product Test\") in accordance with the methods of the test on such Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for acceptance (the \"Product Test Methods\"), which shall be separately agreed in writing by and between Dong-A and NeuroBo and attached hereto as Exhibit B, as may be amended by the Parties' agreement in writing from time to time.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the time allowed for NeuroBo to conduct quality control tests. Two days may not be enough time to perform the necessary tests to ensure product quality, especially if specialized equipment or extensive analysis is required. This could be considered an unreasonable constraint that undermines the purpose of the quality control process. This time frame could be considered unreasonable and contradict general commercial practices and potentially violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "4.3 Upon agreement by the Parties of the Firm Order, Dong-A shall issue to NeuroBo an invoice in Korean Won for each shipment of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo based on the Firm Order. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Dong-A, NeuroBo shall pay the invoiced supply price (i) in Korean Won (KRW) or (ii) in United States Dollars (USD) which amount shall correspond the invoiced amount converted from KRW to USD at the exchange rate of the payment date, no later than [***] days prior to the shipment date by way of wire transfer",
                "changed_text": "4.3 Upon agreement by the Parties of the Firm Order, Dong-A shall issue to NeuroBo an invoice in Korean Won for each shipment of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo based on the Firm Order. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Dong-A, NeuroBo shall pay the invoiced supply price (i) in Korean Won (KRW) or (ii) in United States Dollars (USD) which amount shall correspond the invoiced amount converted from KRW to USD at the exchange rate of the payment date, no later than 1 day prior to the shipment date by way of wire transfer",
                "explanation": "This modification mandates payment only one day before shipment. Given the complexities of international wire transfers, a single day is highly impractical and unreasonable. Wire transfers, especially across borders, can often take several business days to process. Demanding payment one day before shipment creates a high risk of late payment and could lead to breach of contract. This contradicts reasonable business practices and may violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

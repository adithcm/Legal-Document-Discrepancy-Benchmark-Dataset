                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Terms of payment will be 1/3 upon  placement  of order and 2/3  balance  net thirty (30) days  or as  mutually  agreed  upon in  writing  between  the  parties.",
                "changed_text": "Terms of payment will be 1/3 upon placement of order and 2/3 balance net sixty (60) days, regardless of any written agreement to the contrary.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts potential Prompt Payment laws, which, in many jurisdictions, require payment within a shorter timeframe (e.g., 30 days for certain industries) unless explicitly agreed upon in writing. By stating 'regardless of any written agreement to the contrary', the contract prohibits any negotiation for faster payment terms that might be legally required or more favorable to the supplier.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state-specific Prompt Payment Acts (e.g., Colorado's Prompt Payment Act for construction projects, C.R.S. ยง 24-109-101 et seq.)",
                "location": "Section 4"

                "original_text": "The  term of this  Agreement  shall  be two (2)  years  from the Effective  Date with  automatic  annual  renewals  thereafter  provided either  party does not provide  sixty (60) days  notice of  termination prior to the renewal date or the Agreement is not otherwise  terminated as set forth in Section 8.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be two (2) years from the Effective Date with automatic annual renewals thereafter provided either party does not provide thirty (30) days notice of termination prior to the renewal date or the Agreement is not otherwise terminated as set forth in Section 8.",
                "explanation": "This modification reduces the notice period for termination to 30 days. In some jurisdictions, franchise agreements or other distribution agreements may require longer notice periods to provide adequate time for the distributor to wind down operations or find alternative suppliers. Shortening the notice period could be deemed unreasonable and contradict implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, or specific franchise law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state franchise laws or common law principles of good faith and fair dealing that may require a reasonable notice period for termination (varies by state).",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Upon  termination,  ENVISION shall have eighteen (18) months to exhaust any  inventories,  packaging  and  advertising  materials  bearing  the \"SierraSil\"  trademark  and SIERRA  shall have first option to buy back any inventory at ENVISION's net purchase price.",
                "changed_text": "Upon termination, ENVISION shall immediately cease using all inventories, packaging, and advertising materials bearing the \"SierraSil\" trademark, with no compensation for remaining stock.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the grace period for selling off existing inventory and removes the buy-back provision. This could be considered an unreasonable restriction and a violation of contract law, especially if ENVISION has a significant amount of inventory that it cannot reasonably sell off immediately. Some jurisdictions may view the sudden termination of the ability to sell existing inventory as a form of economic duress or unfair business practice, potentially violating state franchise laws or commercial codes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state franchise laws, Uniform Commercial Code provisions regarding reasonable commercial practices, or common law principles against economic duress (varies by state).",

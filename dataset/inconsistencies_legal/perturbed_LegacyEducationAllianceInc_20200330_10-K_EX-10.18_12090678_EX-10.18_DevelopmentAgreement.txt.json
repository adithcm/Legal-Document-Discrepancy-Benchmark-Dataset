                "original_text": "9.3 Base Royalties and Marketing Royalties shall be paid monthly to T&M within 15 days after the end of the applicable month. Payments will be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "changed_text": "9.3 Base Royalties and Marketing Royalties shall be paid monthly to T&M within 60 days after the end of the applicable month. Payments will be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment deadline from 15 days to 60 days. While the law does not strictly prohibit longer payment terms, extending them significantly without reasonable justification or industry standard practices could potentially violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, especially if it causes financial hardship to T&B. Some states could view such a delay as an unreasonable business practice.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contract law; potential violation of state-specific prompt payment laws if the delay is deemed unreasonable.",

                "changed_text": "11.2 The Agreement may be terminated: (i) immediately by either party in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the other party that is susceptible of cure and such breach is not cured within the 5-day period after written notice of such breach to the breaching party.",
                "explanation": "This reduces the cure period for a breach of contract from 30 days to 5 days. This could be deemed unreasonably short, particularly for complex breaches that require substantial time to remedy. Some states may find such a short cure period unconscionable, especially if it significantly prejudices one party. Some breach of contracts could take months, or even years to resolve. Changing this to 5 days is not commercially reasonable.",

All notices and other written communications required to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the addressee in person, mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by reputable overnight courier. Any such notice shall be deemed to be delivered, given and received for all purposes as of the date so delivered, if delivered personally, or, if sent by certified or registered mail, three days following the date on which the same was deposited in a regularly maintained receptacle for the deposit of United States mail, postage and charges prepaid.",

All notices and other written communications required to be given under this Agreement shall be communicated orally and documented by a simple text message. Any such notice shall be deemed to be delivered, given and received for all purposes as of the date so texted.",
                "explanation": "The modified clause mandates only oral communication via text message and disregards the writing requirement, and disregards registered or certified mail. The majority of contracts require these to be in writing. Not fulfilling these conditions renders this contradictory.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A. In consideration for the services to be provided, AVDU agrees that it will remit the agreed upon stock certificate within five (5) days of both parties executing this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "A. In consideration for the services to be provided, AVDU agrees that it will remit the agreed upon stock certificate within one (1) day of both parties executing this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing the remittance period of the stock certificate to one day is unreasonably short. While there isn't a specific statute dictating the remittance timeframe, such a short period could be deemed unconscionable or commercially unreasonable, potentially violating general contract law principles of fairness and good faith, especially if administrative hurdles prevent compliance within 24 hours.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time with 30 days written notice.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time with 14 days written notice.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for termination to 14 days may conflict with certain state laws regarding contract termination, particularly if the agreement implicitly involves an ongoing business relationship or relies on a longer reasonable notice period for winding down affairs. A 30-day notice is more common and ensures a smoother transition, protecting both parties' interests and preventing potential damages from abrupt termination. This creates a legal contradiction where standard commercial practice dictates a longer, more reasonable timeframe.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles of reasonable notice and good faith, potentially conflicting with state-specific regulations on contract termination.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "C. AVDU agrees that for a twenty four months (24) following the execution of this Agreement, AVDU shall not, without UTEK's prior written consent, directly or indirectly solicit for employment any present employee of UTEK, or request induce or advise any employee of UTEK to leave the employ of UTEK. In turn, UTEK agrees that it will not directly or indirectly solicit any present employee of AVDU.",
                "changed_text": "C. AVDU agrees that for a five years (5) following the execution of this Agreement, AVDU shall not, without UTEK's prior written consent, directly or indirectly solicit for employment any present employee of UTEK, or request induce or advise any employee of UTEK to leave the employ of UTEK. In turn, UTEK agrees that it will not directly or indirectly solicit any present employee of AVDU.",
                "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to five years may be considered an unreasonable restraint of trade and may be unenforceable under state law, especially if the restriction is overly broad or not necessary to protect legitimate business interests. Many states have laws that limit the duration of non-compete or non-solicitation agreements to a shorter period, such as one or two years, depending on the circumstances. A five-year ban could be deemed excessive and against public policy, making it legally contradictory.",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws regarding non-compete and non-solicitation agreements; potential violation of statutes related to restraint of trade.",

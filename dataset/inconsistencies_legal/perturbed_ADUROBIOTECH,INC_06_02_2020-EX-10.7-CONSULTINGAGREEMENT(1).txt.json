                "original_text": "Aduro shall pay Consultant any amounts due that are not reasonably disputed by Aduro, by check or direct bank deposit, within thirty days after receiving the invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Aduro shall pay Consultant any amounts due that are not reasonably disputed by Aduro, by check or direct bank deposit, within sixty days after receiving the invoice.",
                "explanation": "California Labor Code Section 2750.5, which governs independent contractor agreements, requires timely payment to contractors. While it doesn't specify an exact timeframe like wage laws for employees, a payment term of 60 days after invoice receipt could be deemed unreasonable, especially if the services are ongoing and require frequent payments. This delay could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent prompt payment obligations, potentially leading to disputes and legal challenges under general contract law principles.",

                "changed_text": "From the Effective Date and for twenty-four (24) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates.",
                "explanation": "California law, specifically Business and Professions Code Section 16600, generally prohibits non-solicitation agreements that restrain a person from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business. While there are narrow exceptions (e.g., sale of a business), a blanket two-year non-solicitation clause for a consultant is likely overbroad and unenforceable under California law. California courts are hesitant to enforce restrictions that significantly impede an individual's ability to earn a living.",

                "changed_text": "Consultant may choose to comply with Aduro's Insider Trading and Trading Window Policy.",
                "explanation": "Federal law, specifically the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and related SEC regulations, strictly prohibits insider trading. By making compliance with the company's insider trading policy optional, the modified text creates a situation where the consultant could potentially violate federal securities laws without clear contractual repercussions. This weakens the company's ability to enforce compliance and potentially exposes both the consultant and the company to legal liability.",

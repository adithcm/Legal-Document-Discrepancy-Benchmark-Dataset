                "original_text": "(a) In the case that the company would not like to extend the terms of agreement for an additional month. The company must notify the consultant within 5 days of the conclusion of the 12 month term. Without notification the contract will automatically extend for an additional month of service.",
                "changed_text": "(a) In the case that the company would not like to extend the terms of agreement for an additional month. The company must notify the consultant within 1 day of the conclusion of the 12 month term. Without notification the contract will automatically extend for an additional month of service.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the company to notify the consultant within 5 days if they don't want to extend the agreement. By changing this to 1 day, it may be deemed an unreasonably short notice period, conflicting with standard business practices and potentially applicable laws requiring reasonable notice. New York Law states that reasonable notification should be provided for contract termination. 1 day may be seen as unreasonable",

                "changed_text": "All knowledge and information of a proprietary and confidential nature relating to the Company which the Consultant obtains during the Consulting period, from the Company or the Company's employees, agents or Consultants shall be for all purposes regarded and treated as strictly confidential for a period of 6 months and shall be held in trust by the Consultant solely for the Company's benefit and use and shall not be directly or indirectly disclosed in any manner whatsoever by the Consultant.",
                "explanation": "By limiting the confidentiality period to only 6 months, the contract fails to provide adequate protection for trade secrets and confidential information, potentially violating New York's trade secret laws which require a reasonable duration of protection. A 6 month window for confidentiality is unreasonable.",

                "changed_text": "Any disputes under this Consulting Agreement shall be resolved through mandatory binding arbitration conducted in the People's Republic of China, governed by Chinese law, with no right to appeal.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several issues. First, forcing arbitration in China under Chinese law could be seen as an unreasonable forum selection clause, especially given the contract is between a Canadian company and a consultant seemingly based in Canada. New York courts may refuse to enforce this clause. Second, waiving the right to appeal could be problematic as it limits access to legal recourse, particularly if the arbitration process is unfair or biased.",

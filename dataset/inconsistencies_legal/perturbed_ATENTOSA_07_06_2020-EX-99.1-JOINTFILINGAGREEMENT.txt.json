                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Pursuant and subject to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D to which this Joint Filing Agreement is attached, and any amendments thereto may be filed without the necessity of filing additional joint filing agreements.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant and subject to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D to which this Joint Filing Agreement is attached, and no amendments thereto may be filed without executing a new joint filing agreement for each amendment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction because Rule 13d-1(k)(1) permits amendments to be filed without new joint filing agreements. Requiring a new agreement for each amendment conflicts with the established procedure under federal securities law, increasing administrative burden and potentially delaying required filings. This contradicts the allowance provided in the regulation itself.",

                "changed_text": "This Joint Filing Agreement must be executed in a single original document; electronic signatures and counterparts are strictly prohibited.",
                "explanation": "This contradicts standard practice and legal allowances for electronic signatures and counterpart execution, which are generally accepted under the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) and similar state laws (like the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act). Prohibiting electronic signatures and counterparts without a valid legal reason introduces unnecessary restrictions and contradicts common business practices.",

                "changed_text": "The execution and filing of this agreement shall automatically constitute an admission that the below-named parties are a group and have acted as a group, regardless of their actual intent or actions.",
                "explanation": "This statement creates a contradiction with the purpose and interpretation of Schedule 13D filings. While filing a Schedule 13D may indicate a group, it is not automatically an admission. The change asserts a definitive admission, conflicting with the nuanced legal interpretation of 'group' status under securities law, which requires more than just a joint filing. This impacts the parties' legal standing by creating a potentially false admission.",

                "original_text": "Should either Party fail to observe faithfully and materially perform each of the material obligations assumed by it in this IP Agreement for thirty (30) days after its attention has been directed to any such breach by notice in writing from the other Party, the non-breaching Party shall, at its option, have the right to terminate the license granted by it under this Agreement, such termination to be effected by serving notice in writing upon the breaching Party to that effect on or after the expiration of such period of thirty (30) days.",
                "changed_text": "Should either Party fail to observe faithfully and materially perform each of the material obligations assumed by it in this IP Agreement for ten (10) days after its attention has been directed to any such breach by notice in writing from the other Party, the non-breaching Party shall, at its option, have the right to terminate the license granted by it under this Agreement, such termination to be effected by serving notice in writing upon the breaching Party to that effect on or after the expiration of such period of ten (10) days.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows a 30-day cure period for breaches of the IP Agreement. This has been changed to a 10-day cure period, which may be insufficient under California law for complex contractual breaches, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, especially if reasonable time to cure requires more than 10 days.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract, which requires that neither party do anything to injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement. Shortening the cure period to 10 days may violate this covenant if it doesn't allow a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach, depending on the nature and complexity of the breach.",

                "changed_text": "All notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder will be in writing and, unless otherwise provided in this IP Agreement, will be deemed to have been duly given when dispatched by regular mail to the appropriate Party at the address specified below:",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies methods for ensuring prompt delivery and confirmation of notices (personal delivery, fax with written confirmation, overnight courier). The modified text allows only regular mail, which is unreliable and slow, potentially violating California's requirements for adequate notice in contractual matters where timing is crucial. This increases the risk of a party not receiving critical information in a timely manner, prejudicing their rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "California contract law requires that notice be reasonably calculated to provide actual notice under the circumstances. Using only regular mail, without any confirmation or tracking, may be deemed unreasonable, particularly where the agreement involves important intellectual property rights and deadlines.",

                "original_text": "If any action at law or in equity is necessary to enforce or interpret the terms of this IP Agreement, the Person prevailing shall be entitled to recover in such action its reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and necessary disbursements in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.",
                "changed_text": "If any action at law or in equity is necessary to enforce or interpret the terms of this IP Agreement, each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees, costs and necessary disbursements regardless of the outcome.",
                "explanation": "The original text includes a prevailing party attorneys' fees clause. The modified text eliminates this clause, preventing the prevailing party from recovering attorneys' fees. While California law generally allows parties to contractually agree on attorneys' fees provisions, eliminating such a provision might be deemed unconscionable if there is a significant power imbalance between the parties and the absence of fee recovery severely disadvantages the weaker party, particularly in complex intellectual property litigation. This can deter valid claims or defenses, especially for smaller entities.",
                "contradicted_law": "While generally permissible, eliminating a prevailing party attorneys' fees clause can raise concerns under California's doctrine of unconscionability, particularly in contracts of adhesion or where there is a significant disparity in bargaining power. Courts may scrutinize such waivers to ensure they are not unduly oppressive or surprising to the weaker party.",

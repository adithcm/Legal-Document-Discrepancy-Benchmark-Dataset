                "original_text": "(ii) The MDO will be payable within ninety (90) days from the date of the transaction (First Month payable by the end of ninety (90) days from the end of the month).",
                "changed_text": "(ii) The MDO will be payable within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the transaction (First Month payable by the end of one hundred eighty (180) days from the end of the month).",
                "explanation": "The change extends the payment period for MDO to 180 days. This alteration could potentially violate prompt payment laws, which vary by state but generally mandate quicker payment timeframes, particularly in industries like healthcare or for independent contractors. By extending the payment window, the contract increases the risk of non-compliance with state laws designed to ensure timely compensation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Texas prompt payment laws for independent contractors (varies by industry but generally shorter than 180 days).",

This contract shall remain in effect initially for the five (5) year term (\"Initial Term\") from the date signed and shall be automatically extended for one (1) year periods after the Initial Term (\"Renewal Term\") unless (i) either party provides written notice of its intention not to renew the Agreement within 180 days prior to any Renewal Term; or (ii) this Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 12.",
                "changed_text": "12.1 Generally. This contract shall remain in effect initially for the five (5) year term (\"Initial Term\") from the date signed and shall be automatically extended for one (1) year periods after the Initial Term (\"Renewal Term\") unless (i) either party provides written notice of its intention not to renew the Agreement within 30 days prior to any Renewal Term; or (ii) this Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 12.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for non-renewal to 30 days may be problematic, as it could be deemed unreasonably short and conflict with contract law principles requiring sufficient notice for termination or non-renewal, especially given the significant investment a distributor may make over five years.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with general contract law principles requiring reasonable notice for non-renewal, especially in long-term distribution agreements where significant investments are made. Vague and Subjective.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the payment timeframe to 60 days after termination could contradict state-specific prompt payment laws. While 30 days could comply, extending to 60 days increases the risk, potentially violating requirements that final payments be made more swiftly.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Texas or other applicable state prompt payment laws related to final invoices or contract termination.",

                "original_text": "B. Termination. In the event of a material breach by either Party of any term of this Agreement, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the breaching Party if the breaching Party fails to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice thereof.",
                "changed_text": "B. Termination. In the event of a material breach by either Party of any term of this Agreement, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the breaching Party if the breaching Party fails to cure such material breach within ten (10) days of receipt of written notice thereof.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the cure period for a material breach from 30 days to 10 days. This may be considered an unreasonably short time frame in some jurisdictions, potentially conflicting with principles of good faith and fair dealing or specific state laws regarding contract remedies that implicitly or explicitly require a reasonable opportunity to cure.",

                "explanation": "This change shortens the time FMM has to respond to the renewal proposal. This could be deemed unconscionable if the timeline is too short to reasonably allow proper evaluation of the proposal. Depending on the specifics of the law and the value of the proposal, a very short window for review may be considered bad faith dealing.",

In the event that any of the Ford-branded links and/or mentions set forth in this Section 2.F. are, in FMC's reasonable judgment, materially injurious to FMC. FMC shall provide written notice of such offense to iVillage. iVillage shall then have one (1) business day in which to cure said offense.",

FMC shall provide written notice of such offense to iVillage. iVillage shall then have four (4) hours in which to cure said offense.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly reduces the cure period for offenses regarding the use of Ford's brand. Providing only 4 hours to correct a potentially complex issue is unreasonable and could be seen as an attempt to trigger a breach of contract. This may be challenged as unconscionable depending on the context and applicable state law.",

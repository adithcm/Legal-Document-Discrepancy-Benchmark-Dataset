                "original_text": "10.1 If the Executive cannot attend work due to sickness or injury, the Executive will keep the Chairman informed of his condition and, where the absence lasts for a period of seven calendar days or more, the Executive will (at the request of the Company) produce a doctor's certificate to the Company in respect of his absence. (a) Provided the Executive complies with the Company's sickness absence notification and certification requirements, the Executive shall be entitled to receive his full salary and contractual benefits during any period of sickness absence not exceeding 26 weeks in any rolling period of 12 months. These payments shall be inclusive of any Statutory Sick Pay due. No payment of salary will be made during any subsequent period of absence when the Executive is eligible to receive benefits under the Group income protection plan referred to in sub clause 9.2.",
                "changed_text": "10.1 If the Executive cannot attend work due to sickness or injury, the Executive will keep the Chairman informed of his condition and, where the absence lasts for a period of fourteen calendar days or more, the Executive will (at the request of the Company) produce a doctor's certificate to the Company in respect of his absence. (a) Provided the Executive complies with the Company's sickness absence notification and certification requirements, the Executive shall be entitled to receive his full salary and contractual benefits during any period of sickness absence not exceeding 2 weeks in any rolling period of 12 months.

                "explanation": "The original text complies with UK employment law regarding sick pay and the requirement for a doctor's note. Modifying the requirement for a doctor's certificate to 14 days violates the statutory sick pay regulations. Reducing the sick pay entitlement from 26 weeks to 2 weeks is non-compliant with standard practices and statutory requirements for sick pay, potentially violating employment law.",

If the Company elects to terminate the Executive's employment in this way, it will make, within 30 days, either the first instalment (of equal monthly instalments) of a, or an entire, payment in lieu of notice (Payment in Lieu) equal to the basic salary, benefit allowance and any benefits, as at the Termination Date, which the Executive would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period), less all relevant deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions.",

If the Company elects to terminate the Executive's employment in this way, it will make, within 90 days, either the first instalment (of equal monthly instalments) of a, or an entire, payment in lieu of notice (Payment in Lieu) equal to 50% of the basic salary, benefit allowance and any benefits, as at the Termination Date, which the Executive would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period), less all relevant deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment in lieu of notice to be made within '90 days' and reducing the amount to '50% of the basic salary' is a legal contradiction. Depending on the length of service and the specific terms of the employment contract, the employee is legally entitled to a minimum notice period (or payment in lieu) as prescribed by UK employment law. Reducing the amount to 50% is a violation of employment standards and the right to proper compensation upon termination.",

The Chairman's decision will be final.",
                "explanation": "Removing the option to appeal to the Board in grievance procedures and making the Chairman's decision final and not subject to further review contradicts UK employment law which requires fair and reasonable grievance procedures. While companies have the right to structure their internal procedures, these must not effectively remove an employee's right to a fair hearing and access to justice. By eliminating any further recourse beyond the Chairman, the company is restricting the employee's ability to challenge decisions, which could be considered an unfair practice.",

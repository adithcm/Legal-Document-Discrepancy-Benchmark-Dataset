                "explanation": "The original text requires that notices sent by registered or certified mail are considered duly given five business days after being sent and one business day after being sent by an internationally recognized overnight courier service. The modification extends the time for notice to be considered duly given to 15 business days for registered/certified mail and ten business days for overnight courier service. This contradicts standard legal practices, as it provides an unreasonably long period for notice, which can negatively affect legal proceedings by delaying required actions and potentially violating due process, given the agreement is governed by Nevada law, where shorter timeframes for notice are generally expected.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a thirty (30) day period for termination upon written notice. This modification shortens the termination period to ten (10) days. Depending on the specific industry and obligations under the agreement, a ten-day termination period might be deemed unreasonably short, especially if it involves complex projects or winding down operations. This could be deemed commercially unreasonable and potentially conflict with good faith and fair dealing requirements under Nevada law if it causes undue hardship.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the parties must develop a list of cooperation projects and common goals within six months. Changing this to twelve months extends the period for establishing these fundamental aspects of the agreement. This change introduces uncertainty because, especially with a relatively short one-year term for the overall agreement, delaying the definition of target projects and goals could constitute a failure of consideration or render the agreement unenforceable. This conflicts with general contract law principles that require clear objectives and timely performance, especially under Nevada law.",

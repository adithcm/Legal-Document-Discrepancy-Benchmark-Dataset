                "original_text": "Sutro shall promptly accept all purchase orders with respect to the amounts of Products to be purchased under the applicable Work Order and shall accept or reject any amount in the purchase order in excess of the amounts of Products to be purchased under the applicable Work Order and all other purchase orders for Product submitted by SutroVax in accordance with this Article 2 within [***] days from receipt of the order; provided however that Sutro shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to accept such amounts and purchase orders. Accepted purchase orders may not be cancelled without the prior written agreement of both Parties except as set forth in Sections 2.5. Unless otherwise directed by SutroVax, Sutro shall fill all accepted purchase orders for Product in accordance with the requested due dates as set forth in further detail in Section 2.9.2.",
                "changed_text": "Sutro shall accept or reject all purchase orders for Product submitted by SutroVax in accordance with this Article 2 within 60 days from receipt of the order. Accepted purchase orders may be cancelled by SutroVax at any time without penalty. Unless otherwise directed by SutroVax, Sutro shall fill all accepted purchase orders for Product in accordance with the requested due dates as set forth in further detail in Section 2.9.2.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces several points of non-compliance. First, extending the acceptance/rejection period to 60 days is unreasonable and could be deemed unconscionable, violating general principles of contract law requiring good faith and fair dealing. Second, allowing SutroVax to cancel accepted purchase orders 'at any time without penalty' undermines the principle of mutual obligation and could be seen as a violation of good faith if it leads to Sutro incurring costs and losses. Together, these changes introduce imbalance and legal vulnerability.",

If SutroVax determines that the Product(s) do not conform to the Required Standards, it hall notify Sutro within the Acceptance Period, and, if requested by Sutro, SutroVax shall ship a sample of such non-conforming Product(s) to Sutro at Sutro's expense. SutroVax's failure to notify Sutro of the non-conformity within the Acceptance Period will be deemed for purposes of this Supply Agreement to constitute SutroVax's acceptance of such shipment, provided, however, that such acceptance shall be subject to SutroVax's right to reject Product(s) until [***] days from the delivery date of the applicable Product, in each case, due to discovery by SutroVax or SutroVax's Affiliates or designees that the applicable Product does not conform to the Required Standards and such non-conformance could not reasonably be discovered within the Acceptance Period (\"Latent Defects\") provided that SutroVax gives Sutro with written notice of such Latent Defect within [***] days of SutroVax or any SutroVax Affiliate or designee becoming aware of such defect.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the acceptance period to 5 days and latent defect discovery to 10/15 days for the products in question is unreasonably short, especially considering the complexity of testing biological products. The modification may violate the implied warranty of merchantability under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which requires goods to be fit for their ordinary purpose for a reasonable period. Five days is insufficient time to reasonably assess the products.",

                "explanation": "This modification restricts SutroVax's ability to use qualified external experts for audits, which may be necessary for thorough and impartial assessments. This may conflict with regulatory requirements or industry standards that mandate independent audits to ensure quality and compliance. Limiting audits solely to internal personnel may introduce bias and compromise the objectivity of the audit process, particularly if internal personnel lack specific expertise or independence.",

                "original_text": "HPS shall pay such amount to SHPS within fifteen days following the end of the applicable month. At the time of payment HPS shall submit to SHPS a schedule for the month of payment setting forth the calculation of fees payable under this Section 2.1 and Care Management Revenues by Client.",
                "changed_text": "HPS shall pay such amount to SHPS within thirty days following the end of the applicable month. At the time of payment HPS may submit the schedule to SHPS at its discretion, with no strict deadline or guaranteed provision.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 15-day payment period, which is a reasonable and common practice. Changing it to 30 days and removing the guaranteed provision gives HPS the option to submit the schedule which is detrimental to SHPS. The promptness of payment affects the finances of SHPS, as a delay in payment directly impacts SHPS's cash flow. It will no longer have any legal remedy for HPS's late schedule submission. This contradicts basic principles of contract law requiring good faith and fair dealing.",

Thereafter this Agreement will automatically be renewed for successive additional periods of one year, unless either party gives notice of cancellation on or before October 1 of any such year.",
                "changed_text": "Unless either party gives the other at least thirty days' prior written notice that it has elected not to extend the term of this Agreement beyond December 31, 1998, the term of this Agreement will be automatically extended until December 31, 1999. Thereafter this Agreement will automatically be renewed for successive additional periods of one year, unless either party gives notice of cancellation on or before December 30 of any such year.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement requires a 90-day notice period for non-renewal, and provides that notice of cancellation be given on or before October 1 of any such year. Reducing the notice period to 30 days and moving the date to December 30 is prejudicial to both parties, especially if either party needs more time to find a replacement contractor or adjust their operations accordingly. By not having enough time to make adjustments, this change fails to maintain a commercially reasonable standard that is implicit in contract law.",

                "original_text": "In the event that either party materially or repeatedly defaults in the performance of any of its duties or obligations hereunder and does not substantially cure such default within thirty days after being given written notice specifying the default, or, with respect to those defaults which cannot reasonably be cured within thirty days, if the defaulting party fails to proceed promptly after being given such notice to commence curing the default and thereafter to reasonably proceed to cure the same, then the party not in default",
                "changed_text": "In the event that either party materially or repeatedly defaults in the performance of any of its duties or obligations hereunder and does not substantially cure such default within five days after being given written notice specifying the default, or, with respect to those defaults which cannot reasonably be cured within five days, if the defaulting party fails to proceed promptly after being given such notice to commence curing the default and thereafter to reasonably proceed to cure the same, then the party not in default",
                "explanation": "The original agreement allows 30 days to cure a default. Reducing this cure period to 5 days is unreasonable, especially for complex defaults. This creates an imbalance, as it is difficult to fix complex defaults within such a short period. The change makes it easier to terminate the contract for minor or unintentional breaches, which goes against the standard contract law requiring reasonable opportunity to remedy breaches.",

                "original_text": "8 . Broker Dealer will promptly forward to the appropriate office of Distributor, or its authorized designee,   all Annuity Contract applications along with other documents, if any, and any payments received with   such applications and will have no rights of set off for any reason. Any Annuity Contract application   that is rejected, together with any payment made and other documents submitted, shall be returned to   Broker Dealer or the source of the payments.",
                "changed_text": "8 . Broker Dealer will forward Annuity Contract applications, documents, and payments to Distributor's office within 30 days of receipt. Broker Dealer retains the right to set off commissions against payments received. Rejected applications, along with payments and documents, will be returned at the Distributor's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several inconsistencies. First, it extends the application forwarding timeframe to 30 days, which could violate SEC regulations requiring prompt handling of investor funds and applications. Secondly, granting Broker Dealer the right of set-off conflicts with industry standards for handling customer payments. Finally, delaying the return of rejected applications contravenes regulatory expectations for returning funds promptly.",

                "original_text": "13 . Broker Dealer agrees to notify Distributor promptly of any change, termination, or suspension of its   status as a broker dealer or FINRA member. Broker Dealer shall immediately notify Distributor with   respect to i) the initiation and disposition of any form of disciplinary action by the FINRA or any other   agency or instrumentality having jurisdiction with respect to the subject matter hereof against Broker   Dealer or any Registered Representative; ii) the issuance of any form of deficiency notice made part of   the public record by FINRA or any such agency regarding Broker Dealer's training, supervision or sales   practices; and/or iii) the effectuation of any consensual order with respect thereto.",
                "changed_text": "13 . Broker Dealer will notify Distributor of changes to its broker-dealer status or FINRA membership only upon Distributor's written request. Notification of disciplinary actions, deficiency notices, or consensual orders is at Broker Dealer's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts regulatory requirements for broker-dealers to promptly disclose material events like disciplinary actions or changes in registration status. Delaying or omitting such notifications violates FINRA and SEC rules that mandate transparency and timely reporting to ensure investor protection.",

Each Party acknowledges that, in the course of performing its duties under this   Agreement or otherwise, it may receive or learn information about individuals who have applied for   or purchased financial products or financial services from the other Party, including, but not limited   to, personal, financial and/or health information (\"Confidential Information\"). Each Party agrees   that it will not use or disclose to any affiliate or third party, orally or in writing, any Confidential   Information of the other Party for any purpose other than the purpose for which the Confidential   Information was provided to that Party. Without limiting any of the foregoing, each Party agrees to   take all precautions that are reasonably necessary to protect the security of the other Party's   Confidential Information. Each Party agrees to restrict access to the other Party's Confidential   Information to those employees who need to know that information to perform their duties under this   Agreement. Each Party further agrees that, upon request of the other Party, it will return to the Party   making such request all tangible items containing any Confidential Information of the other Party,   including all copies, abstractions and compilations thereof, without retaining any copies of the items   required to be returned. The obligations of this paragraph extend to the employees, agents, affiliates   and contractors of each Party and each Party shall inform such persons of their obligations   hereunder.",

Each Party may disclose Confidential Information to affiliates and third parties without restriction. Precautions to protect Confidential Information are optional. Upon request, parties will attempt to return Confidential Information, but are not required to destroy copies.",
                "explanation": "This change severely weakens the confidentiality provisions. Allowing unrestricted disclosure to affiliates and third parties violates privacy regulations such as HIPAA and GLBA, depending on the nature of the Confidential Information. Making precautions optional and allowing retention of copies further undermines the security and integrity of personal and financial data, conflicting with industry best practices and legal requirements for data protection.",

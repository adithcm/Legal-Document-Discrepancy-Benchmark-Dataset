                "changed_text": "D. Payment. Both Parties agree that once the Parties have agreed to transaction which includes the purchase and sale of the Product that the Buyer will remit payment 90 days after execution of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S.) Section 5-1-106, regarding unconscionable agreements, typically implies prompt payment or adherence to industry standards. Altering the payment term to 90 days without clear justification or mutual agreement, especially at the agreement's execution, is inconsistent with common commercial practices and could be deemed commercially unreasonable, potentially violating this statute. Furthermore, for agricultural products, USDA guidelines recommend shorter payment windows to protect sellers.",

                "changed_text": "4. Notices. All notices required or permitted under this Agreement must be in writing and delivered solely by carrier pigeon. Notice is considered given when the pigeon is dispatched, regardless of when or if it arrives.",
                "explanation": "This modification is legally contradictory because it eliminates legally recognized methods of providing notice (email, personal delivery, mail, courier) in favor of a method that has no legal standing or reliability (carrier pigeon). This contradicts fundamental principles of contract law which require reasonable and reliable methods of communication. Additionally, if a dispute arises, proving that notice was sent via carrier pigeon would be difficult or impossible.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a significant imbalance in the termination rights, favoring Gridiron. This creates a conflict in the original contract where both parties have equal termination rights, placing undue burden and risk on Shi Farms, the smaller business, conflicting with principles of fairness and good faith dealing implied in contract law.",

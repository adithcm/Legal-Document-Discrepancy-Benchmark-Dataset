The retention of any license grants are subject to the Divested Entity's and, in the event it is acquired by a Third Party, such Third Party's execution and delivery to the non-transferring Party, within 90 days of the effective date of such divestment, of a duly authorized, written undertaking, agreeing to be bound by the applicable terms of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Modifying the deadline for the Divested Entity or its acquirer to execute and deliver a written undertaking to be bound by the agreement's terms introduces a legal contradiction. By extending the deadline to 300 days, the agreement deviates from typical commercial reasonableness standards and may conflict with legal precedents requiring prompt action in such corporate transactions. This delay in formalizing the agreement's terms could lead to disputes and uncertainties, potentially rendering this clause unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The alterations to the notice provisions introduce inconsistencies that create a legal contradiction. Changing electronic mail notice to be effective only after 90 days introduces an unreasonable delay, conflicting with the principle of timely notice required for contractual obligations. Similarly, mandating personal acknowledgement for courier services introduces an overly burdensome condition that deviates from standard practices and may hinder the effective delivery of notices, making contract enforcement problematic.",

Upon any such determination, any such provision, to the extent determined to be invalid, void or unenforceable, shall not be replaced.",
                "explanation": "The modified severability clause creates a legal contradiction. By stipulating that the entire agreement terminates upon the invalidity of any provision, it contradicts the principle of severability intended to preserve the valid portions of a contract. This 'all-or-nothing' approach deviates from standard severability practices, potentially invalidating the entire agreement even for minor infractions.

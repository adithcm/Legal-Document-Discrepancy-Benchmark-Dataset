                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from 30 days to 10 days could be deemed unreasonable and conflict with general contract law principles regarding sufficient opportunity to remedy a breach, potentially rendering this clause unenforceable under Tennessee law, which prioritizes fair dealing and reasonable notice.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for insurance cancellation or modification from 15 days to 5 days creates an inconsistency. Standard insurance practices and some state regulations (though not explicitly defined in Tennessee statutes regarding general liability policies for sponsorships) often require insurers to provide a minimum of 10-30 days' notice to additional insured parties for policy changes or cancellations, allowing adequate time to secure alternative coverage, which this modification does not satisfy.",

                "explanation": "By removing the pro rata refund, the contract now stipulates that Logan's keeps all prepaid amounts even if they terminate the agreement. This may be viewed as an unreasonable penalty or unjust enrichment under Tennessee law, especially if the termination occurs early in the calendar year and is not due to SRP's fault. This clause could be challenged as unconscionable or a violation of good faith and fair dealing.",

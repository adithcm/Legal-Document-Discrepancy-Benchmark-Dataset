                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "During the Consultation Period (as defined below) and for a period of one year thereafter, except in connection with his performance of the Services, the Consultant shall not engage in any activity in the field described on Schedule A to this Agreement, and he shall not assist any other person or organization that engages in any such activity.",
                "changed_text": "During the Consultation Period (as defined below) and for a period of five years thereafter, except in connection with his performance of the Services, the Consultant shall not engage in any activity in the field described on Schedule A to this Agreement, and he shall not assist any other person or organization that engages in any such activity.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the non-compete period to five years, which may be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable under Massachusetts law, where the contract is governed. Massachusetts courts scrutinize non-compete agreements and generally require them to be limited in time and scope to protect legitimate business interests, and a five-year restriction may be considered excessive, especially if the consultant's role is not highly specialized or if the company's confidential information has a shorter lifespan.",

                "changed_text": "The Company shall pay to the Consultant amounts shown on each such statement within sixty (60) days after receipt thereof.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the payment period to 60 days may violate Massachusetts Prompt Payment Act (M.G.L. c. 149, ยง 29E), which requires payments to independent contractors within a reasonable time. While 'reasonable' is not rigidly defined, 60 days could be considered unreasonable, especially if the consultant is a small business or individual relying on timely payments.",

                "changed_text": "The Consultant may terminate the Consultation Period at any time upon ten (10) days' written notice.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination by the consultant to 10 days could be deemed unreasonable and potentially a breach of good faith and fair dealing, implying the consultant does not give the company sufficient time to find a replacement, thus disrupting the business.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All such representations and warranties shall not merge in or be prejudiced by, and shall survive for a period of three years from the completion of the distribution of the Units.",
                "changed_text": "All such representations and warranties shall not merge in or be prejudiced by, and shall survive for a period of six months from the completion of the distribution of the Units.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that representations and warranties survive for three years. Reducing this survival period to six months could be deemed unreasonably short, potentially conflicting with standard commercial practices and case law regarding reasonable periods for discovering breaches of representations and warranties, especially in complex financial transactions. Depending on the jurisdiction, a longer period might be legally implied or required to provide adequate protection.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with implied terms under the Sale of Goods Act or similar legislation regarding reasonable durability and fitness for purpose, as well as general contract law principles regarding unconscionability.",

Either  party hereto may designate a new address by giving written notice thereof to the other party at least ten days in advance of the effective date of such designation.",

Either party hereto may designate a new address by giving written notice thereof to the other party at least one day in advance of the effective date of such designation.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the mailing notification period to ten business days and decreasing the address designation notice to one day is not compliant to basic legal and practical obligations, which constitutes a breach in time requirements.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 'time is of the essence' clause can create ambiguity and potential legal challenges, especially when specific deadlines are set. This contradicts fundamental principles of contract law that rely on time-sensitive obligations being strictly enforced. It will also go against specific legal cases where timely fulfilment is a basic and essential legal factor.",

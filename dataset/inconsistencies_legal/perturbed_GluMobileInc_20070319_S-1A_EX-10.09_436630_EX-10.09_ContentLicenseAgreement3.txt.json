Royalty: In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox, or such other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n\n(a) From the first unit sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee's Gross Receipts (as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee's sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products. (\"IA2 Audio and Video Royalty\"). For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may not recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "changed_text": "1. Royalty: In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox, or such other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n\n(a) Fox shall earn a royalty payment from Licensee's sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products within 120 days following the calendar quarter in which sale occurred. Failure to make payments within this term does not constitute a breach of this agreement. (\"IA2 Audio and Video Royalty\"). For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "explanation": "The modification of the text introduces a legal contradiction by extending the payment terms to 120 days after the calendar quarter and saying that non-compliance is not a breach of contract. This conflicts with standard commercial contract law, which mandates that payments should be made in a timely manner and according to industry norms (typically 30-60 days) and late or non-payments is a breach of contract.",

Fox is not required to provide licensee with an accounting of these payments, and licensee has no right to audit Fox's books in regards to the royalty calculation.",
                "explanation": "The added text violates the implicit duty of good faith and fair dealing and basic accounting principles.

                "explanation": "The addition of \"Fox has the right to terminate this agreement at will\" introduces a contradiction. Without specifying a valid reason, allows Fox to break the contract at anytime. This violates general principles of contract law, which require cause for early termination, especially when the initial contract is ratified. Many jurisdictions do not allow contract termination at will.",

                "original_text": "Any payment under this Agreement that is not paid on or before the date such payment is due shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, at […***…] points above the average one-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), as reported by Reuters from time to time, calculated on the number of days such payment is overdue.",
                "changed_text": "Any payment under this Agreement that is not paid on or before the date such payment is due shall bear interest at a rate of 25% per annum, calculated from the date such payment was originally due.",
                "explanation": "Imposing a 25% per annum interest rate on late payments is usurious and violates state laws on maximum interest rates. Many states have laws that cap the allowable interest rate on debts, and 25% would exceed those limits, making the clause unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "State usury laws (e.g., New York General Obligations Law § 5-501, which sets the criminal usury rate at 25%)",

                "changed_text": "FMI will provide Roche with Sample Results and patient reports via email. FMI is not responsible for ensuring the security of patient data during transmission.",
                "explanation": "Failing to ensure data security and transmitting patient data via unencrypted email violates HIPAA regulations, which mandate specific security measures to protect patient health information. This change creates non-compliance with regulatory standards.",

                "changed_text": "FMI shall notify Roche of any Data Security Breach involving Roche data within 90 days of discovery. FMI is not responsible for disclosures to affected parties, government, or regulatory agencies.",
                "explanation": "Delaying notification of a data breach to 90 days violates various state data breach notification laws (e.g., Massachusetts General Law c. 93H), which require notification within a much shorter timeframe (e.g., 30-45 days) and immediately after discovery in some cases. Also, removing responsibility for disclosures is against regulations.",

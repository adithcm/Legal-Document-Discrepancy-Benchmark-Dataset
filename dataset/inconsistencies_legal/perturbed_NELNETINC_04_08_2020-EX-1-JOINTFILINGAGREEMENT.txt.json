                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D, but any future amendments will be filed individually at each party's discretion. The initial Schedule 13G or 13D filing is deemed sufficient, regardless of subsequent changes in ownership.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts SEC regulations requiring timely and accurate updates to Schedule 13G and 13D filings to reflect changes in ownership. The modified text suggests that updates are optional, which violates the mandatory reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",

This contradicts the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts and potentially violates securities laws that hold parties accountable for misleading statements or omissions in filings, particularly if they have knowledge of inaccuracies.",

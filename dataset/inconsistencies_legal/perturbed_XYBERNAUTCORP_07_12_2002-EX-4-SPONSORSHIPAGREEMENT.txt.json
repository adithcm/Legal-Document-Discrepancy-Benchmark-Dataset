Pursuant to the Lock-Up, AJR agrees that following the registration of Registrable Securities, it shall not directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge, assign, gift, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of more than 25,000 shares of Common Stock during any five (5) consecutive trading days on the principal securities exchange or securities market where XC's Common Stock is then traded.",

Pursuant to the Lock-Up, AJR agrees that following the registration of Registrable Securities, it shall directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge, assign, gift, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of all shares of Common Stock immediately.",
                "explanation": "The modified text removes the limitation on the number of shares AJR can sell within a specific timeframe and allows for the immediate disposal of all shares upon registration. This introduces a contradiction because such a restriction could violate federal securities laws requiring fair and orderly markets and could be deemed an unreasonable restraint on AJR's ability to manage its investment.",

                "original_text": "4.2.3 MediWound shall make payment for each Bromelain SP batch that was supplied by CBC on a [***] days basis as of the date of delivery of the applicable batch at MediWound, provided that MediWound has provided CBC with an Acceptance Batch Notice for such purchased batch pursuant to Section 6.4. Payment for each purchase batch shall be effected by MediWound by swift to a bank account designated by CBC, or by other requested method as agreed between the parties. MediWound shall make down payment of USD[***]/kg for the [***]% of the amount of Annual Forecast before Dec.31 of the respective year for the insurance of components and materials and maintenance of manufacture and supply capacity of the requested [***]% of the next calendar year's Annual Forecast. The down payment will be then deducted respectively as every shipment is made to MediWound and listed in CBC's Invoice to MediWound.",
                "changed_text": "4.2.3 MediWound shall make payment for each Bromelain SP batch that was supplied by CBC on a 180 days basis as of the date of delivery of the applicable batch at MediWound, provided that MediWound has provided CBC with an Acceptance Batch Notice for such purchased batch pursuant to Section 6.4. Payment for each purchase batch shall be effected by MediWound at CBC's discretion. MediWound shall make a non-refundable down payment of USD[***]/kg for 100% of the amount of Annual Forecast before Dec.31 of the respective year. The down payment will not be deducted respectively as every shipment is made to MediWound and will be kept by CBC as insurance for the purchase order.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a specific timeframe ([***] days) for MediWound to make payments. Modifying this to 180 days may contradict standard business practices or regulations in some jurisdictions regarding reasonable payment terms, creating financial strain. Forcing MediWound to pay at CBC's discretion is highly unusual and unfair practice. The down payment should not be non-refundable or as an insurance to be kept by CBC.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or similar commercial laws regarding reasonable payment terms and fairness in transactions.",

Any deviation that may impact on the safety/quality of the Bromelain SP or the Products and on other related issues will be investigated by CBC, and communicated to MediWound within 48 hours from the time of discovery. Following the investigation, the relevant corrective actions shall be taken and implemented.",
                "changed_text": "5.7.1 Any deviation from the production process during the manufacture thereof may, at CBC's sole discretion, be explained and documented in batch records. Any deviation that may impact on the safety/quality of the Bromelain SP or the Products and on other related issues will be investigated by CBC at their convenience, with no obligation to communicate to MediWound. Corrective actions will only be implemented at CBC's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the obligation to communicate deviations to MediWound and making corrective actions discretionary, the modified text could violate regulations related to pharmaceutical manufacturing standards. This hinders transparency, could lead to safety issues, and breaches requirements for open communication in regulated industries. This change introduces non-compliance with regulatory standards like GACP and cGMP which requires reporting of deviations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates Good Agricultural and Collection Practice (GACP) and Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations, which require timely reporting of deviations and quality control issues.",

                "original_text": "6.4 Prior to delivery of each batch of Bromelain SP, CBC shall submit a batch sample to MediWound for inspection and approval. MediWound shall have the right, for a period of [***] days following receipt, to reject any Bromelain SP sample which:\n\n6.4.1 fails to comply with MediWound's purchase order; or\n\n6.4.2 fails to comply with the sample incoming inspection Specifications.\n\nWithin the said [***] days, MediWound shall notify CBC of either: (i) its approval and acceptance of such batch sample (\"Acceptance Sample Notice\"); or (ii) its rejection of the batch sample in which case MediWound shall detail the reason(s) for the rejection of any such Bromelain SP sample. In the event of rejection by MediWound, CBC shall deliver complying Bromelain SP sample to MediWound within [***] days of rejection, free of cost (including transportation, duty, handling and insurance costs). For clarification purposes, MediWound's Acceptance Sample Notice in accordance with this section above shall in no event derogate from CBC's responsibilities hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "6.4 Prior to delivery of each batch of Bromelain SP, CBC shall submit a batch sample to MediWound for inspection. MediWound's inspection is optional, and CBC will proceed regardless of whether MediWound completes an inspection. MediWound may only reject a batch of Bromelain SP sample due to force majeure, and rejection must occur within 24 hours of delivery. In the event of rejection by MediWound, CBC is not obligated to deliver a complying Bromelain SP sample. MediWound's Acceptance Sample Notice shall derogate from CBC's responsibilities hereunder.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation heavily restricts MediWound's rights to inspect and reject non-conforming goods. Limiting rejection to 'force majeure' and setting a 24-hour deadline is unreasonably short. Removing CBC's obligation to deliver compliant goods violates basic contract principles. Allowing 'Acceptance Sample Notice' to waive CBC's liability directly contradicts contract laws regarding product quality and liability.",
                "contradicted_law": "Conflicts with fundamental contract law principles regarding product quality, acceptance, rejection, and seller's liability for non-conforming goods, as well as potentially violating the UCC.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.2 Tripath may discontinue manufacture or sale, or otherwise treat as obsolete, any or all of the Products covered by this Agreement upon thirty days written notice.",
                "changed_text": "1.2 Tripath may discontinue manufacture or sale, or otherwise treat as obsolete, any or all of the Products covered by this Agreement upon ten days written notice.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for discontinuing products to ten days contradicts standard commercial practice and potentially violates implied obligations of good faith and fair dealing, particularly if the distributor has made significant investments based on the product line. Reasonable notice is typically required to allow the distributor to adjust its business.",

                "changed_text": "7.7 If Tripath notifies Distributor of any discrepancy in a credit request, Distributor has five days to resolve the discrepancy and pay the amount of the discrepancy.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the dispute resolution period for credit discrepancies to five days is unreasonably short, especially considering potential accounting complexities and cross-border transactions. This timeframe violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires a reasonable opportunity to investigate and resolve disputes.",

                "location": "Section 7.7"

                "changed_text": "18.1 The terms of this Agreement shall be one year from the effective date and will be automatically renewed on each anniversary of the effective date, for a renewal term of one year unless either party provides written notification of its intention not to renew this Agreement at least one week prior to the expiration of the initial or any renewal terms.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for non-renewal to one week is not commercially reasonable and can be seen as a breach of good faith. Distributors require reasonable time to make adjustments and preparations for their business if the contract is not renewed. Typically, 30-90 days is considered commercially reasonable.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Owner shall pay all such amounts prior to the later of (a) 50 days after the end of the month in which the expenses were incurred or (b) 10 days after the date of receipt of each invoice. Invoices received after 1:00 pm local time  will be deemed received on the next Business Day. If the day on which any payment is due is not a Business Day, then the relevant payment  shall be due upon the immediately succeeding Business Day. Any amounts which remain due and owing after the due date shall bear interest at  the lower of the prime rate as published in the \"Money Rates\" section of The Wall Street Journal plus two percent (2%) per annum and the  maximum lawful rate of interest, compounded daily from the date such payment is due until such payment is made.",
                "changed_text": "Owner shall pay all such amounts prior to the later of (a) 120 days after the end of the month in which the expenses were incurred or (b) 60 days after the date of receipt of each invoice. Invoices received after 1:00 pm local time will be deemed received on the next Business Day. If the day on which any payment is due is not a Business Day, then the relevant payment shall be due upon the immediately succeeding Business Day. Any amounts which remain due and owing after the due date shall bear interest at a rate of one percent (1%) per annum, simple interest, from the date such payment is due until such payment is made.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a payment timeline, but it is changed to contradict standard and reasonable business practices, and possibly state laws regarding payment terms. The change extends the payment period significantly and reduces the interest rate, creating a less favorable condition for the Operator, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the event that Operator receives notice, either in writing or orally, of an asserted or threatened Liability Claim against Operator or Owner,  Operator shall provide Owner within 10 days of receipt of such Liability Claim a copy of any demand letter, petition, or similar documentation of the  Liability Claim.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that Operator receives notice, either in writing or orally, of an asserted or threatened Liability Claim against Operator or Owner, Operator shall provide Owner within 60 days of receipt of such Liability Claim a copy of any demand letter, petition, or similar documentation of the Liability Claim.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the notification period for liability claims to 60 days prejudices the Owner's ability to promptly respond to and mitigate potential damages from said claim. This contradicts the standard of care and could violate legal requirements for timely notification in insurance and liability contexts, since the state requires claims to be notified in a short time period of usually 30 days",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state insurance regulations regarding timely claim notification, breach of duty of care.",

                "original_text": "Owner shall have up until two years after the close of a Calendar Year in which to make an audit of Operator's records  for such Calendar Year. Except for any bill or statement with respect to which an Adjustment Claim is made within the two-year audit period, the  bills and statements rendered for the Calendar Year prior to such two-year audit period shall be conclusively established as correct.",
                "changed_text": "Owner shall have up until six months after the close of a Calendar Year in which to make an audit of Operator's records for such Calendar Year. Except for any bill or statement with respect to which an Adjustment Claim is made within the six-month audit period, the bills and statements rendered for the Calendar Year prior to such six-month audit period shall be conclusively established as correct.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the audit period to six months is unreasonable and unduly restricts Owner's ability to identify and rectify financial discrepancies. This may conflict with statutes of limitations applicable to breach of contract or fraud claims, which often extend beyond six months, thus violating the Owner's legal rights to pursue such claims, usually claims of fraud can go up to 4 years.",

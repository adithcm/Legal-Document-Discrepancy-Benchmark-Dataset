                "original_text": "Impresse shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to all support requests by VerticalNet relating to the Co-Branded Site within one Business Day (as defined below) of Impresse's receipt of such notification. Impresse shall use reasonable efforts to cure the reported problem as soon as reasonably possible. VerticalNet shall provide Impresse with all information reasonably requested by Impresse in connection with a reported problem for which VerticalNet is requesting support under this Section 3.1 [ONGOING SUPPORT]. VerticalNet shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to all support requests by Impresse relating to the Co-Branded Site within one Business Day (as defined below) of VerticalNet's receipt of such notification. VerticalNet shall use reasonable efforts to cure the reported problem as soon as reasonably possible. Impresse shall provide VerticalNet with all information reasonably requested by VerticalNet in connection with a reported problem for which Impresse is requesting support under this Section 3.1 [ONGOING SUPPORT].",
                "changed_text": "Impresse shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to all support requests by VerticalNet relating to the Co-Branded Site within seven Business Days (as defined below) of Impresse's receipt of such notification. Impresse will address the reported problem within a timeframe solely determined by its workload. VerticalNet shall provide Impresse with all information reasonably requested by Impresse in connection with a reported problem for which VerticalNet is requesting support under this Section 3.1 [ONGOING SUPPORT]. VerticalNet shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to all support requests by Impresse relating to the Co-Branded Site within five Business Days (as defined below) of VerticalNet's receipt of such notification. VerticalNet shall address the reported problem at its convenience. Impresse shall provide VerticalNet with all information reasonably requested by VerticalNet in connection with a reported problem for which Impresse is requesting support under this Section 3.1 [ONGOING SUPPORT].",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a 'one Business Day' response time for support requests, which promotes efficiency. The modified version changes this to 'seven Business Days' for Impresse and 'five Business Days' for VerticalNet and makes the problem-solving timeframe discretionary. This introduces a legal contradiction because, under California law, all contracts must have elements of good faith and fair dealing, including reasonable response times.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for one year thereafter, VerticalNet shall have the right to appoint a certified public accountant to audit Impresse's financial records relating to such payment to verify the accuracy of Impresse's financial records in order to verify the amount of the payments owed and/or paid hereunder, but no more frequently than once per year. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was underpaid, the additional amount owed shall be paid to VerticalNet within 15 days of notice of such underpayment to Impresse. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was underpaid in excess of 10% of the amount owed, the fees of such audit shall also be paid to VerticalNet within 15 days of notice of such to Impresse. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was overpaid, the excess amount paid shall be returned by VerticalNet within 15 days of notice of such overpayment. VerticalNet shall give reasonable advance notice to Impresse of such audit and each audit shall be conducted in a manner that does not cause unreasonable disruption to the conduct of business by Impresse. The results of any such audit shall be deemed to be Confidential Information and may not be disclosed by either party or its certified public accountants except as may be necessary to enforce such party's rights.",

If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was underpaid, the additional amount owed shall be paid to VerticalNet within 90 days of notice of such underpayment to Impresse. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was underpaid in excess of 10% of the amount owed, the fees of such audit shall be borne equally between the parties. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was overpaid, the excess amount paid shall be returned by VerticalNet within 60 days of notice of such overpayment. VerticalNet may give notice to Impresse of such audit one day prior and each audit may be conducted in a manner that does not take into consideration the conduct of business by Impresse. The results of such audit shall be deemed to be public information and may be disclosed by either party or its certified public accountants.",
                "explanation": "The original clause balances audit rights with protections for Impresse. The modified version extends the audit period, removes the requirement for a 'certified' accountant, allows for multiple audits per year, extends the repayment period for underpayments to 90 days, increases the overpayment return period to 60 days, decreases the advance notice for audits to one day, removes the protection against business disruption, and makes the audit results public. These changes conflict with standard business practices and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in Delaware contract law, which requires fair and reasonable conduct.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a two-year limitation period for claims. The modified version shortens this to six months. This creates a legal contradiction because the statute of limitations for breach of contract claims in Delaware (where the contract is governed) is typically three years. Shortening the contractual limitation period to six months could be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable, particularly for complex commercial disputes where discovery and investigation may take considerable time. In California, the statute of limitations for fraud is three years.",

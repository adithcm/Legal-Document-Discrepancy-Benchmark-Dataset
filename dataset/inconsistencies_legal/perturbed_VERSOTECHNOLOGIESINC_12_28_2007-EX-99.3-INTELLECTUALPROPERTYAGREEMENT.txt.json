                "original_text": "Seller hereby covenants and agrees, that from time to time forthwith upon the reasonable written request of Backhaul or Buyer, that Seller will, at Backhaul's cost and expense, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, each and all of such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and assurances as may reasonably be required by Backhaul or Buyer in order to transfer, assign, convey and deliver unto and vest in Backhaul title to all right, title and interest of Seller in, to and under the Assigned Intellectual Property.",
                "changed_text": "Seller hereby covenants and agrees, that from time to time within 180 days of the written request of Backhaul or Buyer, that Seller will, at Backhaul's cost and expense, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, each and all of such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and assurances as may reasonably be required by Backhaul or Buyer in order to transfer, assign, convey and deliver unto and vest in Backhaul title to all right, title and interest of Seller in, to and under the Assigned Intellectual Property.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces a fixed timeframe of 'within 180 days' for the Seller to comply with requests from Backhaul or Buyer, replacing the original 'forthwith upon the reasonable written request.' This could be deemed unreasonable and contradict the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contract law, potentially hindering the timely transfer of intellectual property rights which Georgia Law requires to be addressed promptly. It could be argued that 180 days is an unreasonable delay for executing simple acts.",

                "explanation": "The contract originally specifies that Georgia law governs its interpretation. Changing this to Delaware law introduces a potential conflict, especially if Delaware law differs significantly from Georgia law on matters related to intellectual property assignment or contract interpretation. Since the Seller is a Delaware corporation, it could create ambiguity, and Georgia law emphasizes the importance of upholding contracts according to their clear terms and the intentions of the parties at the time of formation.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows for facsimile signatures to be considered legally binding, equivalent to a manual signature. By negating this clause, the modified text introduces ambiguity and potential non-compliance with Georgia's Electronic Transactions Act (O.C.G.A. ยง 10-12-1 et seq.), which generally recognizes the validity of electronic signatures, including those transmitted via facsimile, unless otherwise specified by law. Eliminating the acceptance of facsimile signatures could impede the contract's enforceability if a party relies on a faxed signature.",

                "original_text": "Definitive minutes of all committee meetings shall be finalized no later than thirty (30) days after the meeting to which the minutes pertain as follows:\n3.3.1 Distribution of Minutes. Within ten (10) days after a committee meeting, the secretary of such committee shall prepare and distribute to all members of such committee draft minutes of the meeting. Such minutes shall provide a list of any issues yet to be resolved, either within such committee or through the relevant resolution process.",
                "changed_text": "Definitive minutes of all committee meetings shall be finalized no later than sixty (60) days after the meeting to which the minutes pertain as follows:\n3.3.1 Distribution of Minutes. Within thirty (30) days after a committee meeting, the secretary of such committee shall prepare and distribute to all members of such committee draft minutes of the meeting. Such minutes shall provide a list of any issues yet to be resolved, either within such committee or through the relevant resolution process.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires minutes to be finalized within 30 days and draft minutes distributed within 10 days. By changing these deadlines to 60 and 30 days respectively, it introduces a delay that may conflict with regulations or best practices for timely corporate governance. These changes introduce a contradiction by extending the timeframe for crucial documentation, potentially violating legal standards. California Corporations Code Section 1501 requires corporations to maintain accurate records of all meetings and actions of the board and committees. Delaying the finalization of these minutes may run contrary to the duty of care owed to shareholders and stakeholders to maintain accurate corporate records in a timely manner.",

                "changed_text": "At the company's discretion, GSK shall pay Theravance royalty payments based on Net Sales. No specific date is set for when GSK has to pay Theravance. \nOn total Annual Worldwide Net Sales up to and including U.S. $3 Billion: 15 %\nOn total Annual Worldwide Net Sales greater than U.S. $3 Billion: 5 %",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates royalty payments within 20 days after each calendar quarter. The modification introduces a contradiction by removing the fixed deadline and making payment contingent on GSK's discretion. This violates the contractual obligations for timely payments, potentially violating state laws. The contract now lacks a clear payment timeline, making it unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract principles under California law where timely payment is a material term. Failure to remit payments for the work performed or services rendered or goods delivered is a violation.",

The review period may be extended for an additional sixty (60) days if a representative of the non-publishing Party on the Joint Project Committee can demonstrate a reasonable need for such extension including, but not limited to, the preparation and filing of patent applications.",

The review period will not be extended.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for a 60-day submission window before publication, with a 10-day comment period and a potential 60-day extension for patent filings. The modification shortens the submission window to 15 days, reduces the comment period to 5 days, and removes the extension option. This significantly reduces the time available for patent review and filing, potentially violating intellectual property protection obligations and legal standards. California law protects trade secrets and confidential information, and adequate time for review is crucial for ensuring this protection. By restricting this review period, it creates a contradiction with the implied duty to protect intellectual property.",

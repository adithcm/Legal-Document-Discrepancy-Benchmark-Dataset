                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Such payments will be paid by Shipper to MPL within fifteen (15) Days of the invoice date or resolution of any dispute, if applicable.",
                "changed_text": "Such payments will be paid by Shipper to MPL within thirty (30) Days of the invoice date or resolution of any dispute, if applicable.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment deadline from 15 days to 30 days is a perturbation because some states have laws regarding prompt payment, especially in industries such as oil and gas, that mandate shorter payment periods (e.g., 10-20 days) to ensure timely compensation and avoid financial strain on service providers. While Ohio law may not explicitly specify a timeframe, generally accepted business practices and fairness principles are undermined by a longer payment period, especially given the volume and rates of the transaction.",

                "changed_text": "MPL will provide a fifteen (15) day notice to Shipper, notifying it of the actual in-service date for the included projects.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for the in-service date from 30 days to 15 days could be problematic. Shorter notification periods may not provide sufficient time for the Shipper to prepare necessary operational adjustments, potentially leading to disruptions. Changing the period to 15 days creates a contradiction in the amount of time allotted.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement will automatically renew for up to two (2) renewal terms of five (5) years each (each, an \"Extension Period\") unless either Party provides the other Party with written notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or the then current Extension Period.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination from six months to thirty days is a perturbation because it may not provide sufficient time to wind down operations, secure alternative transportation, or address other logistical issues.",

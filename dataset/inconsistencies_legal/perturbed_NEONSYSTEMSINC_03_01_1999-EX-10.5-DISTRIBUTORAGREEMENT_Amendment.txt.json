                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Any royalty payment that is not paid when due will bear interest from the date such amount is due until the           date payment is made at a rate equal to ten percent (10%) per annum.",
                "changed_text": "Any royalty payment that is not paid when due will bear interest from the date such amount is due until the date payment is made at a rate equal to twenty-five percent (25%) per annum.",
                "explanation": "This change increases the interest rate for late royalty payments to 25% per annum. While parties are generally free to agree on interest rates, some states have usury laws that set a maximum allowable interest rate. Charging 25% could violate these laws, making the clause unenforceable or subject to penalties.",

                "original_text": "Licensee shall have the right and a first opportunity           to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire, as the case may be, all or           the applicable portion of such stock or assets (as specified in the           applicable Offering Notice) on the Terms and Conditions set forth in           the Offering Notice, such right to be exercised by notice in writing           to the Offeree within ninety (90) days after the giving of the           Offering Notice.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall have the right and a first opportunity to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire, as the case may be, all or the applicable portion of such stock or assets (as specified in the applicable Offering Notice) on the Terms and Conditions set forth in the Offering Notice, such right to be exercised by notice in writing to the Offeree within ten (10) days after the giving of the Offering Notice.",
                "explanation": "This amendment reduces the time Licensee has to exercise its right of first refusal from 90 days to 10 days. A 10-day period may be deemed unreasonably short under state law, making it difficult for the Licensee to conduct adequate due diligence and secure financing. A court might find that the shortened period is not commercially reasonable and thus unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Upon the expiration or any termination of this Agreement, Licensor shall repay to Licensee the aggregate amount of all Royalty Advances then outstanding, only if Licensor deems it appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This revision introduces significant uncertainty regarding the repayment of Royalty Advances. By adding \"only if Licensor deems it appropriate\", Licensor gains the power to evade the repayment obligation entirely. Such discretionary control over repayment clashes with fundamental contract law requirements that provide for 'good faith and fair dealing.' A court could deem this clause unconscionable and therefore unenforceable, since it offers no real guarantee of repayment to the Licensee and gives Licensor unilateral control over the obligation.",

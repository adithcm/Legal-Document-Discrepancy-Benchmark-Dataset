                "original_text": "c.  Upon reasonable written request of the Company which shall be          tendered at least 30 days prior the date requested, the Professional           shall make himself available for the purpose of posing for print ads,          making commercials and other promotional materials, or attending           promotional events organized by the Company once per calendar year.  In          the event of such requests by the Company, the company shall be           responsible for the payment of all reasonable travel, lodging and           meal expenses incurred in connection with the Professional rendering          services described in this subsection. Should the services of the          Professional be required for longer than one day, the Professional           shall be entitled to his daily appearance fee, plus reasonable           expenses, for each day in excess of one day.",
                "changed_text": "c.  Upon reasonable written request of the Company which shall be          tendered at least 5 days prior the date requested, the Professional           shall make himself available for the purpose of posing for print ads,          making commercials and other promotional materials, or attending           promotional events organized by the Company once per calendar year.

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period to 5 days for requiring the Professional's services for promotional events creates a potential conflict, as it may not provide sufficient time for the Professional to reasonably accommodate the request, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing present in Colorado contract law. This is especially true considering travel arrangements and other commitments.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a breach of contract from 30 days to 10 days is problematic. While Colorado law doesn't mandate a specific cure period, it may be deemed unreasonably short, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing and principles of commercial reasonableness. A shorter period might not afford the breaching party a fair opportunity to rectify the situation, especially for complex breaches. This is a legal contradiction, as it conflicts with the general commercial reasonableness standards.",

If such association is not then in existence, an           independent association of arbitrators may be utilized  which is           designated by agreement of the parties. In the event the parties are           unable to agree on an independent association of arbitrators, either           party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for appointment          of arbitrators.",

The parties waive all rights to legal recourse.",
                "explanation": "Replacing binding arbitration with a coin flip to resolve disputes and waiving all rights to legal recourse is unconscionable and unenforceable. It eliminates fundamental due process rights and access to the courts, conflicting with established legal principles and public policy. Colorado courts would likely find this clause to be against public policy and unenforceable. It violates basic principles of fairness and justice, creating a legal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "Bills not paid when due shall accrue extended  payment charges from the day  following  the date on which  payment was due in  accordance  with Subparagraph  14.2 until the day on which it is paid.  For the purposes of this Agreement, extended payment charges shall be computed at a rate equal to 150 % of the  appropriate  financial  charges as  indicated in Subparagraph 14.3 on the day following the date payment of the bill was due. In the event that applicable law allows the imposition of extended payment  interest  charges only at a rate less than that established in accordance with this Subparagraph, extended payment charges shall be at the  highest  rate  permitted  by such  applicable  law.  In this case, appropriate  documents to  demonstrate  the  applicability  of such law shall be provided by the concerned Party.",
                "changed_text": "Bills not paid when due shall accrue extended payment charges from thirty (30) days following the date on which payment was due in accordance with Subparagraph 14.2 until the day on which it is paid. For the purposes of this Agreement, extended payment charges shall be computed at a rate equal to 250% of the appropriate financial charges as indicated in Subparagraph 14.3 on the day following the date payment of the bill was due. In the event that applicable law allows the imposition of extended payment interest charges only at a rate less than that established in accordance with this Subparagraph, no interest shall be charged.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a perturbation by modifying the terms related to late payment charges. Firstly, delaying the start of accrual to 30 days after the due date contradicts standard commercial practices that usually impose late fees shortly after the payment deadline. Secondly, escalating the interest rate to 250% is likely to conflict with usury laws or regulations on permissible interest rates in many jurisdictions, making it legally challengeable. Lastly, stating that no interest shall be charged goes against the contract.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year is a perturbation. A five-year confidentiality period is commonly accepted in commercial agreements to protect sensitive business information. Reducing it to one year may be deemed unreasonable and insufficient to protect trade secrets or other confidential data, depending on the nature of the information and industry standards.",

                "explanation": "This is a perturbation because it does not account for undelivered notices, which opposes contract laws regarding delivered/received notices. By changing the definition of when a notice is considered 'given' to 'upon transmission,' the contract now disregards scenarios where an email bounces or isn't received, creating an unreasonable risk for parties who may not actually be aware of critical communications. This introduces a potential legal issue where a party could argue they were not properly notified despite the other party having sent an email.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a delay that could violate SEC regulations regarding the timely settlement of securities transactions. SEC Rule 15c6-1 requires settlement to occur no later than two business days after the trade date (T+2). Specifying a 90-day settlement period directly contradicts this requirement.",

Investment advisors must have a reasonable basis for recommendations and cannot act solely based on analyst's advice, this change removes due diligence.

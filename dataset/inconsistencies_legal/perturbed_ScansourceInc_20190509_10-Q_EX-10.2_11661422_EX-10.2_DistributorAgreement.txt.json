                "original_text": "Distributor has the right to cancel, reschedule or modify all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such cancellation or modification request is made within [*****] business days of PO acceptance or rescheduling request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor has the right to cancel, reschedule or modify all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such cancellation or modification request is made within 1 business day of PO acceptance or rescheduling request is made at least 1 business day prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows the distributor a period of time ([*****] business days) to cancel or modify a purchase order. By reducing this period to 1 business day, it creates an unreasonable restriction on the distributor's ability to manage its orders, potentially violating fair business practices, especially if the original period was aligned with industry standards or implied a reasonable timeframe. This contradicts the implicit requirement of good faith and fair dealing present in most commercial contracts under US law.",

Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non- cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least 1 business day prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non- cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame for destination changes to 1 business day before the estimated shipping date is unduly restrictive. This timeframe might not be adequate for distributors to respond to changing customer demands or logistical challenges, potentially leading to financial losses. This could be viewed as a violation of fair business practices and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, depending on the specific circumstances and industry norms.",

                "original_text": "If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties.",
                "changed_text": "If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than one-hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, may, at their sole discretion, choose not to replenish the stock.",
                "explanation": "By extending the period before Xplore is obligated to replenish stock to 180 days and giving Xplore the sole discretion to choose not to replenish the stock, the modified text significantly weakens the distributor's ability to meet customer demand and maintain a viable business. This substantial alteration of the agreement's core benefit to the distributor, combined with the discretionary aspect, could be deemed unconscionable or a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if it severely impairs the distributor's business operations.",

                "original_text": "For a period of five (5) years after the Distribution Date, in the event any member of the SpinCo Group, in SpinCo's reasonable judgment, requires a license under any Honeywell IP in order to initiate and pursue any new technical projects not covered by the licenses granted in Section 3.01(a), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to license such Honeywell IP to the applicable member of the SpinCo Group on commercially reasonable terms.",
                "changed_text": "For a period of one (1) year after the Distribution Date, in the event any member of the SpinCo Group, in SpinCo's reasonable judgment, requires a license under any Honeywell IP in order to initiate and pursue any new technical projects not covered by the licenses granted in Section 3.01(a), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to license such Honeywell IP to the applicable member of the SpinCo Group on commercially reasonable terms.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the negotiation period for Honeywell IP licenses from five years to one year could be considered unreasonably short under certain state laws. For example, depending on the industry and the complexity of the IP, this timeframe might not provide sufficient opportunity for SpinCo to secure necessary licenses, potentially conflicting with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing present in contract law and certain business regulations.",

                "changed_text": "SpinCo shall, and shall cause each member of the SpinCo Group to, remove any Honeywell Trademarks or reference to the Honeywell Business appearing on any Honeywell Content at their convenience.",
                "explanation": "Changing the deadline for removing Honeywell Trademarks from 'no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days' to 'at their convenience' creates an inconsistency. This weakens the obligation and could be deemed an unreasonable delay, potentially infringing on Honeywell's trademark rights. Trademark law requires reasonable measures to avoid consumer confusion, and indefinite removal could violate this.",

                "explanation": "Removing the five-year period and stating that Honeywell will only provide notice 'at Honeywell's discretion' creates a potential conflict. This change weakens Honeywell's obligation to inform SpinCo of IP infringements, and the term is not based on a time parameter. Depending on the nature of the IP and the potential damages from infringement, this discretionary notification may conflict with general requirements of reasonable cooperation and potentially create risks related to IP protection laws.",

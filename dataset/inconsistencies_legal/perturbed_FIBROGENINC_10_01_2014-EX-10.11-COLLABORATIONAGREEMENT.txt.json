                "explanation": "The original text requires reporting of serious adverse events within 5-7 calendar days. This modification extends those deadlines to 15-30 calendar days. This introduces non-compliance with FDA regulations, which often mandate quicker reporting timelines for certain serious adverse events, particularly those that are unexpected and serious. The delay could impede prompt safety assessments and regulatory actions.",

                "explanation": "The original text ties the interest rate for late payments to the U.S. prime rate plus an additional amount. The modified text sets a fixed interest rate of 18% per annum, irrespective of usury laws that may be applicable in the State of California. Depending on the applicable state's usury laws, an interest rate of 18% may be deemed illegally high and therefore unenforceable.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement may be terminated, either in respect of a Fund or in its entirety, by either Oaktree US or the Sub-Advisor for any reason upon 30 days' written notice to the other.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated, either in respect of a Fund or in its entirety, by either Oaktree US or the Sub-Advisor for any reason upon 1 days' written notice to the other.",
                "explanation": "The modified text reduces the notice period for termination to 1 day, which is inconsistent with standard commercial practice and could be deemed unreasonable, particularly in contracts involving complex financial services. A notice period of 30 days is generally considered a minimum to allow for orderly transitions.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding reasonable notice; potential violation of implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under English law.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Sub-Advisor shall forthwith upon termination deliver to Oaktree US a full account including a statement of all investments then under management, the income derived therefrom since the last report to Oaktree US, and the value at which they were acquired. The Sub-Advisor shall also ensure that any documents relating to Oaktree US assets over which it has control are released as soon as practicable to Oaktree US or (if so instructed by Oaktree US) to any other party as may be specified by Oaktree US.",
                "changed_text": "The Sub-Advisor shall, at its convenience, deliver to Oaktree US a summary account of investments then under management, excluding details of income derived therefrom, and a list of assets it controls within 180 days of termination.",
                "explanation": "The modified text alters the obligations of the Sub-Advisor upon termination. Removing the obligation to provide a 'full account' and income details, and changing 'forthwith' to 'at its convenience' and providing a broad deadline of 180 days weakens Oaktree US's ability to ensure a swift and transparent transfer of assets and information. This alteration could lead to a breach of fiduciary duty, conflicting with UK regulations and general principles of contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of fiduciary duty, potential violation of FCA regulations related to orderly wind-down and transfer of assets.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Oaktree US will be the Sub-Advisor's client for the purposes of the FCA Rules. Accordingly, in conformity with the FCA Rules, a number of additional statements and provisions are required to be included in this Agreement. Such additional statements and provisions are set out in Schedule 1 hereof (\"Additional FCA Provisions\"), which is hereby incorporated into and will form part of this Agreement and will apply to the services to be provided pursuant to this Agreement with effect from the Effective Date.",
                "changed_text": "Oaktree US will not be the Sub-Advisor's client for the purposes of the FCA Rules. Accordingly, in conformity with internal regulations, a number of additional statements and provisions are not required to be included in this Agreement. Such additional statements and provisions are not set out in Schedule 1 hereof, which is explicitly not incorporated into and will not form part of this Agreement and will not apply to the services to be provided pursuant to this Agreement with effect from the Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "By stating that Oaktree US will *not* be the Sub-Advisor's client for FCA rules and explicitly excluding the additional FCA provisions, the modified text directly contradicts requirements under the Financial Conduct Authority rules. This has significant impacts on regulatory compliance, potentially invalidating the agreement and opening the Sub-Advisor to enforcement actions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Direct contradiction of FCA Rules relating to client categorization and regulatory requirements for investment firms.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows for a 90-day cure period for a breach of contract. This has been reduced to 10 days. Depending on the nature of the breach and the jurisdiction (Ontario, Canada), this cure period may be deemed unreasonably short, particularly for complex breaches, and a court may not enforce such a short period.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a strict 5-day return window. Depending on the complexity of the product and the location of the distributor (London), a 5-day window for inspection and return could be deemed commercially unreasonable, especially if latent defects are present, which are not easily discovered, potentially conflicting with consumer protection laws and general contract principles requiring reasonable time for inspection and rejection.",

                "explanation": "Extending the payment term to 360 days, or 180 days after the sale or rental, for products delivered directly to the distributor could be considered an unreasonably long payment term for international transactions, especially considering the vendor is based in the United States and the distributor is based in the UK.

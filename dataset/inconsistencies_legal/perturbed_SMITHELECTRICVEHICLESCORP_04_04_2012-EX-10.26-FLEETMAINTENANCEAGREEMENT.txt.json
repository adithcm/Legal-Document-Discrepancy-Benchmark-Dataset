                "explanation": "This modification extends the payment period to sixty days, which may conflict with prompt payment laws or standard business practices, potentially harming SEV's cash flow and violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under contract law.",

In the event of SEV failing to attend at  the Place of Use within two hours then a senior representative of SEV will meet DCL to explain the reason for the failure.",

In the event of SEV failing to attend at the Place of Use within twelve hours then no representative of SEV will meet DCL to explain the reason for the failure.",
                "explanation": "This modification extends the breakdown response time to twelve hours, this could be considered commercially unreasonable and a breach of contract if it leads to significant operational disruptions for DCL, particularly in industries where timely vehicle maintenance is critical. Moreover, removing the obligation for a representative to explain failures could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "Extending the vehicle removal timeframe to 60 days could be commercially unreasonable if it significantly impacts DCL's operational space or creates storage-related burdens. This delay might violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing if it demonstrably harms DCL's interests without a legitimate business justification.",

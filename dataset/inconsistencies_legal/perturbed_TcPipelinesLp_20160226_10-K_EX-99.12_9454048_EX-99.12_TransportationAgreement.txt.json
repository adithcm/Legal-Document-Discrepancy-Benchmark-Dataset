                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All notices and communications with respect to this Agreement shall be in writing by mail, e-mail, or fax, or other means as agreed to by the parties, and sent to the addresses stated below or to any other such address(es) as may be designated in writing by mail, e-mail, or fax, or other means similarly agreed to:",
                "changed_text": "All notices and communications with respect to this Agreement shall be delivered exclusively via carrier pigeon, with delivery confirmation required within 24 hours. Any other form of communication shall be deemed invalid.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legally contradictory requirement. While the original text allows for flexibility in communication methods, the modified text mandates a specific, impractical method (carrier pigeon) and sets an unreasonably short delivery confirmation timeframe (24 hours), potentially conflicting with standard notice periods required by law for contract-related matters, violating principles of reasonable notice and accessibility.",

                "original_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement, Shipper's and Transporter's obligations to each other arising under this Agreement, prior to the date of termination, remain in effect and are not being terminated by any provision of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement, all Shipper's obligations, including any outstanding payments, are immediately and irrevocably forfeited to the Transporter, regardless of prior performance or outstanding invoices. The Transporter's obligations cease immediately.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction with contract law related to unjust enrichment and fair dealing. The original clause preserves pre-termination obligations. The modified clause imposes a penalty on the Shipper upon termination, causing the shipper to forfeit any remaining payment obligations to the transporter, potentially violating laws regarding fair dealing and preventing unjust enrichment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Unjust Enrichment, Fair Dealing",
                "location": "Section 14"

                "original_text": "Any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved by the parties shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan.",
                "changed_text": "Any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved by the parties shall be resolved through a public trial by combat, judged by a panel of chimpanzees, with the losing party forfeiting all assets. The decision is final and non-appealable.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces a standard choice of law clause with an absurd and illegal dispute resolution method. Requiring 'trial by combat' judged by chimpanzees directly contradicts legal principles of due process, fair trial, and access to the courts and is obviously unenforceable and unlawful.",

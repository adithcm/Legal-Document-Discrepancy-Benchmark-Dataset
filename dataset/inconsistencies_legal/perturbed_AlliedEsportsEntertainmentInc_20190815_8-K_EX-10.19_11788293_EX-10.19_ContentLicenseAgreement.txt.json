                "original_text": "Zynga will, within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the first full calendar quarter following the Effective Date, furnish WPT with complete statements containing the following information with respect to all Net Revenue from the use of the WPT-brand on the Zynga platform, during the preceding period covered by such statement: the Territory; the amount due WPT (or the remaining unrecouped Annual Minimum Guarantee balance as applicable); Net Revenue; Royalties rate; the distribution channels or portals, the platform, the territory(ies), and itemized Allowable Deductions (\"Royalty Statement(s)\"). The amount shown to be payable to WPT shall be paid simultaneously with the rendition of the respective Royalty Statement.",
                "changed_text": "Zynga will, within ninety (90) days of the end of each calendar year, commencing with the first full calendar year following the Effective Date, furnish WPT with statements containing only the amount due WPT. The amount shown to be payable to WPT shall be paid within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the statement.",
                "explanation": "The modified text alters the reporting frequency from quarterly to annually and drastically extends the payment deadline. California law, which governs this agreement, requires more frequent and timely payments and reporting, especially in cases involving royalties or revenue sharing. Reducing the information provided in the statement also creates a legal contradiction.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Labor Code Section 221 requires prompt payment of wages and accurate itemized wage statements; California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 regarding unfair business practices by delaying payments.",

                "changed_text": "The other party shall have ten (10) days from the effective date of such notice in which to correct any such default(s) (except those which are not curable), and failing such correction by the end of such ten (10) day cure period, this Agreement shall thereupon immediately terminate.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to ten (10) days for a material breach of contract may be deemed unreasonably short, particularly for complex issues. California law generally implies a reasonable time for cure, and ten days may be insufficient, potentially leading to a claim of wrongful termination.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Commercial Code Section 2A518 (lessor's rights to dispose of goods after lessee's default), which implies reasonable time for cure.",

                "explanation": "Changing the notice provision to deem notice as given upon dispatch (instead of delivery) for courier services creates a risk of notice being considered effective even if never received. Extending the mailing period to fifteen (15) days is also unreasonable. California law typically requires reasonable methods for providing notice, and relying on dispatch alone or an extended mailing period may not satisfy this requirement.",

                "original_text": "The Advisory Board shall, within fourteen (14) days of its receipt of the Notice, make a recommendation to PFHOF to either approve or reject such proposal as set forth in the Notice. PFHOF shall, within fourteen (14) days of its receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, either approve or reject the proposal as set forth in the Notice. If PFHOF does not approve the proposal as set forth in the Notice within fourteen (14) days of PFHOF's receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, such proposal shall be deemed rejected by PFHOF.",
                "changed_text": "The Advisory Board shall, within five (5) days of its receipt of the Notice, make a recommendation to PFHOF to either approve or reject such proposal as set forth in the Notice. PFHOF shall, within five (5) days of its receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, either approve or reject the proposal as set forth in the Notice. If PFHOF does not approve the proposal as set forth in the Notice within five (5) days of PFHOF's receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, such proposal shall be deemed rejected by PFHOF.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the review and approval period from fourteen days to five days could create an unreasonable timeframe, potentially contradicting the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in Ohio contracts. If the complexity of the proposal requires more than five days for reasonable review, this clause could be deemed unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the non-renewal notice period from six months to one month may be deemed commercially unreasonable. Ohio law generally requires sufficient notice to allow the other party to make alternative arrangements. One month might be insufficient, especially considering the significant investments and dependencies likely involved in a media license agreement of this nature. This could be seen as violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "After consultation with the Advisory Board, either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time for any breach by the other Party, provided that the non-breaching Party provides written notice to the breaching Party, specifying the alleged breach, and further provided that the breaching Party shall have five (5) days after receipt of such notice to cure the breach. There will be no extension for the breach.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a breach from 30 days (potentially extendable to 90 days) to 5 days is unreasonable, especially for complex commercial contracts. Ohio law requires a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach. A 5-day cure period may be deemed insufficient and unconscionable, particularly for complex breaches requiring significant effort to rectify. Eliminating the 'good faith efforts' extension further exacerbates this issue.",

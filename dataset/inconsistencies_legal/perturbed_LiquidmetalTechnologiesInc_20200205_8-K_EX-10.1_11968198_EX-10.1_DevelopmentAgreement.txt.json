Payment terms are net 30 days after the date of the invoice, or the date of receipt by Liquidmetal of the invoice if the invoice is received more than 10 days after the date of the invoice. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Order or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, payment shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",

Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Order or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, payment shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that payment terms are net 30 days. The modification extends the payment term to 90 days, which could violate the California Prompt Payment Law (Cal. Pub. Contract Code ยง 10261.5), which mandates faster payment timelines for government contracts. This change introduces a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows 30 days to cure a material breach. The modification reduces the cure period to 10 days. For certain types of breaches, such as those involving intellectual property or significant financial obligations, a 10-day cure period may be deemed unreasonably short under California law, particularly if complex corrective actions are required. This shortened period could lead to wrongful termination claims, because it violates California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (California Civil Code ยง 1655-1657).",

Upon reasonable prior notice to Eutectix and at Liquidmetal's expense, no more than once per year, during the Term of this Agreement and for one (1) year following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Liquidmetal or its designee shall have the right from time to time to confirm and validate: (a) that Eutectix has complied with the pricing provisions of this Agreement; (b) Eutectix's financial condition, successorship planning, and ability to continue operations; (c) that Eutectix's performance is consistent with the Agreement; (d) that Eutectix has complied with Article 10 (Compliance) of this Agreement.",

Upon reasonable prior notice to Eutectix and at Liquidmetal's expense, four times per year, during the Term of this Agreement and for two (2) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Liquidmetal or its designee shall have the right from time to time to confirm and validate: (a) that Eutectix has complied with the pricing provisions of this Agreement; (b) Eutectix's financial condition, successorship planning, and ability to continue operations; (c) that Eutectix's performance is consistent with the Agreement; (d) that Eutectix has complied with Article 10 (Compliance) of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text says that Liquidmetal can audit Eutectix once per year, while the changed text says that Liquidmetal can audit four times per year. This change implies that Liquidmetal can look into Eutectix's financial information four times in a year and for two years following the agreement, while only bearing Liquidmetal's expenses. The change is contradictory because it allows Liquidmetal to excessively intrude into Eutectix's confidential financial documents more than the original text. This violates California's right to privacy, California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1 and California Financial Information Privacy Act, which puts a lot of safeguards in place so that people can expect their financial information to be protected. Because Eutectix is headquartered in New Jersey, this also affects New Jersey residents. New Jersey also has the right to privacy in New Jersey Constitution, Article 1, paragraph 1 and common law.",

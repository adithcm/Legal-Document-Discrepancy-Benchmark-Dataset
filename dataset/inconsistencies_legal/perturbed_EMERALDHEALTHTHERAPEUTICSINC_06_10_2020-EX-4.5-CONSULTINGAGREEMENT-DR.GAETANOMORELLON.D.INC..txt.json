                "original_text": "5.2 Contractor's Right to Terminate Agreement for any Reason. The Contractor may terminate this Agreement and his or her engagement for any reason at any time upon providing 30 days advance notice in writing to Emerald. Termination will be effective, at Emeralds' election, on a date which is no earlier than the date such notice is received and no later than the date which is 30 days following that date.",
                "changed_text": "5.2 Contractor's Right to Terminate Agreement for any Reason. The Contractor may terminate this Agreement and his or her engagement for any reason at any time upon providing 5 days advance notice in writing to Emerald. Termination will be effective immediately upon Emerald's receipt of such notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 30 days' notice for the Contractor to terminate the agreement. The modified text reduces this to 5 days and makes the termination effective immediately upon receipt, potentially conflicting with employment standards that might require longer notice periods, depending on how a court interprets the independent contractor relationship. This immediate termination could also be seen as unconscionable or a breach of good faith.",

The Company may terminate this Agreement and the engagement of the Contractor without Cause at any time on 30 days prior written notice.

The Company may terminate this Agreement and the engagement of the Contractor without Cause at any time on 1 week prior written notice. The date of termination will be the date specified in the written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides 30 days' notice for termination without cause. The modified text reduces this to 1 week. Depending on the specific circumstances and interpretation of the contractor's role, this shorter notice period could be deemed unreasonable and violate implied contractual obligations or relevant employment standards if the contractor is considered a de facto employee.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment of outstanding fees within 30 days of termination. The modified text extends this to 90 days.

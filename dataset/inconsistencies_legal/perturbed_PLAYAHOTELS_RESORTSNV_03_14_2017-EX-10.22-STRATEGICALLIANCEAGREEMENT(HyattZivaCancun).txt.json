                "original_text": "The Receiving Party will have ten (10) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity.",
                "changed_text": "The Receiving Party will have three (3) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period to three business days may be considered unreasonably short, potentially conflicting with regulations or legal precedents requiring a reasonable timeframe for due diligence and decision-making in real estate transactions. This timeframe may not be sufficient for a thorough evaluation of the Development Opportunity, creating a potential legal challenge.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding reasonable timeframes for decision-making and due diligence; potential violation of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

To the extent there is any conflict between the Rules and the Federal Arbitration Act as it pertains to such arbitration, the Rules shall prevail.",
                "changed_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall to the extent possible be settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties within five (5) days from the date of written notice by either Party of the existence of such dispute, and, failing such amicable settlement, shall be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (\"Rules\"). To the extent there is any conflict between the Rules and the Federal Arbitration Act as it pertains to such arbitration, the Rules shall prevail.",
                "explanation": "Shortening the amicable negotiation period to five days may be deemed insufficient under certain dispute resolution laws, particularly if the disputes are complex or involve significant financial stakes. This can create a procedural unfairness that a court might find unlawful, impacting the enforceability of the arbitration clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of dispute resolution fairness; potential conflict with state laws requiring reasonable opportunities for pre-arbitration negotiation.",

                "explanation": "Changing the notice delivery method to regular postal mail and extending the effective date to five days creates a conflict with standard commercial practice, which commonly uses courier services to ensure timely and trackable delivery of important legal notices. This modification potentially violates legal requirements for reasonable notice, as regular mail is less reliable and slower than courier services.",

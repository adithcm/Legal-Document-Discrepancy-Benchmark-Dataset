                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, except to the extent that he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for filing initial statements only. The responsibility for timely filing of amendments and the completeness and accuracy of information concerning all parties shall rest solely with Sculptor Capital LP, irrespective of individual knowledge or belief regarding accuracy.",
                "explanation": "This change attempts to absolve all parties except Sculptor Capital LP from the responsibility for timely and accurate filings, even if they have reason to believe information is inaccurate. This contradicts SEC regulations regarding individual responsibility for filings under Schedule 13G, which requires each reporting person to individually ensure the accuracy of their reported information.",
                "contradicted_law": "SEC Rule 13d-1(k) and general principles of securities law regarding individual accountability for filings.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G shall be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned without the necessity of filing additional joint acquisition statements.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed, but any subsequent amendments will only be filed at the discretion of Sculptor Capital LP, and no further joint acquisition statements will be necessary unless explicitly mandated by Sculptor Capital LP.",
                "explanation": "This change gives Sculptor Capital LP unilateral control over filing amendments, potentially leading to delayed or omitted filings. SEC regulations require timely amendments to Schedule 13G filings to reflect material changes in beneficial ownership. Removing the obligation for other parties to participate in amendments and vesting it solely in Sculptor Capital LP creates a conflict.",

                "explanation": "Backdating the filing date introduces a contradiction. SEC filings must accurately reflect the date on which the information is being reported. Falsifying the date could have legal ramifications.",

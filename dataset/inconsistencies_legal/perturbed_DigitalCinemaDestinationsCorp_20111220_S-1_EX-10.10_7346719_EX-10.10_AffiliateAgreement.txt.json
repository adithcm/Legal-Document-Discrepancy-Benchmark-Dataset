                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each party shall render an accounting to the other on a monthly basis substantiating the calculation of Net Revenue payable during such month pursuant to  Section 8.3.",
                "changed_text": "Each party shall render an accounting to the other on a quarterly basis substantiating the calculation of Net Revenue payable during such month pursuant to Section 8.3.",
                "explanation": "Changing the accounting period from monthly to quarterly reduces the frequency of financial reporting. Many states require businesses to provide employees or other parties with financial statements or accounting on a monthly basis, especially where revenue sharing is involved. A less frequent reporting schedule could violate laws related to timely and transparent financial disclosures.",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws regarding frequency of financial reporting and transparency requirements (e.g., California Labor Code Section 226)",
                "location": "Section 7.1(b)"

                "original_text": "If either party wishes to extend the Initial Term it shall provide  notice to the other not later than 180 days, nor sooner than 270 days, before the end of the Initial Term. The parties shall then engage in  discussions regarding renewal for a period of 30 days. If no agreement is reached during that 30-day period, then neither party shall have any  obligation to extend this Agreement beyond the Initial Term.",
                "changed_text": "If either party wishes to extend the Initial Term it shall provide notice to the other not later than 30 days, nor sooner than 45 days, before the end of the Initial Term. The parties shall then engage in discussions regarding renewal for a period of 10 days. If no agreement is reached during that 10-day period, then neither party shall have any obligation to extend this Agreement beyond the Initial Term.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for extending the term of the agreement to 30-45 days, and the discussion period to 10 days may contradict laws requiring 'reasonable notice' for contract renewals, particularly if the agreement involves significant business operations or dependencies. What constitutes 'reasonable notice' varies by state, but generally, shorter timeframes can be challenged if they prejudice one party's ability to make informed decisions.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles of 'reasonable notice' and state-specific laws regarding contract renewals.",
                "location": "Section 8.1"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Notwithstanding termination of this Agreement, each party shall pay to the other, within five (5) days after the effective date of such termination, any and all fees  (including costs and expenses) owed hereunder as of such termination.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding termination of this Agreement, each party shall pay to the other, within thirty (30) days after the effective date of such termination, any and all fees (including costs and expenses) owed hereunder as of such termination.",
                "explanation": "Delaying final payments owed after termination to 30 days may contradict state wage and hour laws that require immediate or very prompt final payment of wages and other compensation upon termination of a contract or employment. Depending on the specific state, the allowable timeframe for final payment can be much shorter, and a 30-day delay could incur penalties.",
                "contradicted_law": "State wage and hour laws regarding final payment deadlines (e.g., California Labor Code Section 201, New York Labor Law Section 191).",

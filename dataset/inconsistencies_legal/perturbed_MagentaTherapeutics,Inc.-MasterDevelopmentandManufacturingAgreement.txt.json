                "explanation": "The original text requires payments to be made within a certain timeframe ([***] is confidential, but let's assume it's less than 30 days). Changing the payment term to 120 days introduces a contradiction with standard business practices and potentially violates prompt payment laws that exist in many US states. These laws often mandate shorter payment periods, especially for smaller businesses or specific industries. Massachusetts law, which is the principal place of business of Magenta, establishes requirements for prompt payments to contractors and subcontractors.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the acceptance period to 2 days for pharmaceutical products is commercially unreasonable and potentially violates regulations related to quality control and due diligence in the pharmaceutical industry. It does not provide adequate time for thorough testing and inspection to ensure the product meets specifications and safety standards. This creates a risk of accepting non-conforming or unsafe products. The USPTO requires reasonable testing times for acceptance of products.",

By removing the requirement to maintain insurance after the Initial Term, the change contradicts basic risk management principles and may violate laws related to product liability. Manufacturers are generally expected to maintain insurance coverage for a reasonable period after product delivery to cover potential claims arising from defects or injuries, even after the contract has ended. It weakens product liability coverage.",

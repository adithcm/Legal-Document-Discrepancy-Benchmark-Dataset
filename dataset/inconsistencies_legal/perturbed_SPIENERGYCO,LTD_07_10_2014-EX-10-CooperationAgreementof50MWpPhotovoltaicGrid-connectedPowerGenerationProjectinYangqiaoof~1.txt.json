            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Party B will register a foreign-funded company in Fenyi County before implementing the project; Party A will offer all the preferential policies to the company as per local investment promotion policies for foreign investment introduction.",
                "changed_text": "Party B will register a foreign-funded company in Fenyi County within 180 days of signing this agreement; Party A will offer preferential policies, at its sole discretion and if deemed beneficial, to the company as per local investment promotion policies for foreign investment introduction.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires Party B to register a company before the project implementation, implying a reasonable timeframe. The modified text introduces a specific 180-day deadline which may conflict with the actual time required for foreign company registration and potentially creates an unreasonable delay that hinders project commencement. Also, 'at its sole discretion and if deemed beneficial' weaken government obligation under the initial agreement and creates an open door of biases.",
                "contradicted_law": "Vague deadlines and discretionary clauses related to foreign investment can conflict with fair practice regulations and investment protection laws.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Party A supports and guarantees the project construction and development of Party B, and will provide the most preferential policies and all- round service in the aspects of preliminary work, construction and grid-connected of the project, and actively coordinate relevant departments and units to help Party B accelerate project construction progress.",
                "changed_text": "Party A supports the project construction and development of Party B, but provides no guarantees. Party A will provide preferential policies and all-round service, but only during the first three months of the project, in the aspects of preliminary work, construction and grid-connected of the project, and will not actively coordinate relevant departments and units to help Party B accelerate project construction progress.",
                "explanation": "By removing the guarantee and limiting the preferential policies and all-round service to just three months, the modified text contradicts the original agreement's intent to provide sustained support for the project. Also, the removal of the active coordination commitment impacts project progress and could violate agreements predicated on timely bureaucratic support.",

                "original_text": "Party B promises that land nature will not be changed for building large-scale PV grid-connected power generation project in the plot; comprehensive development will be carried out according to relevant national stipulations, such commercial crops will be interplanted as agriculture and forestry as well as medicinal materials; local employees will enjoy the priority to be employed; local building materials will be adopted and relevant expenses will be paid on schedule.",
                "changed_text": "Party B promises that land nature will not be changed unless deemed necessary for project success; comprehensive development will be carried out at Party B's discretion; local employees may be considered for employment; local building materials may be adopted if cost-effective, and relevant expenses will be paid within one year of invoicing.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces multiple contradictions. The phrase 'unless deemed necessary' allows Party B to potentially violate land-use regulations. 'At Party B's discretion' removes the obligation for comprehensive development. 'May be considered' weakens the commitment to local employment, and 'if cost-effective' weakens the commitment to using local building materials. Finally, 'within one year of invoicing' creates an unreasonably long payment period which conflicts with standard business practice.",

                "original_text": "Within [***] following the end of each Calendar Quarter during the Term, Valeant shall provide Dova with a written report (each a \"Compensation Report\"), which describes (i) the details of the incentive compensation package of each Sales Representative as it relates to the Product and the Designated Product (or Alternate Product, as the case may be) (but, in the case of the Designated Product or Alternate Product, such details shall be limited to information regarding what portion of the Sales Representatives' target incentive compensation package is derived from achieving sales targets or goals of the Designated Product (or Alternate Product) , but shall not include any sales targets or goals for the Designated Product (or Alternate Product)), and (ii) the actual incentive compensation payouts for each Sales Representatives as described in Section 4.1.3. Through the JSC, the Parties shall agree on a mutually acceptable form of Compensation Report.",
                "changed_text": "Valeant will provide Dova with a Compensation Report at its discretion. The content and frequency of these reports will be determined solely by Valeant, and Dova has no right to specify the data included or the format. Valeant is not required to disclose details of the incentive compensation package of each Sales Representative.",
                "explanation": "This change conflicts with general employment law principles requiring transparency and accountability in compensation practices. By removing the obligation to provide regular, detailed compensation reports, the modified text reduces Dova's ability to monitor Valeant's compliance with the agreement and potentially masks discriminatory or unfair compensation practices. This could violate equal pay or anti-discrimination laws, which require employers to justify pay disparities based on legitimate, non-discriminatory factors.",

                "original_text": "If Dova has a reasonable basis for believing any member of the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing has violated any Applicable Laws, or failed to comply with this Agreement, then Dova shall notify Valeant of the alleged violation and Valeant shall promptly investigate the matter and, if the allegation turns out to be true, shall take the appropriate remedial action. Subject to the foregoing, Valeant shall be solely responsible for taking any disciplinary actions in connection with its Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing. If, at any time, Dova has any other compliance-related concerns regarding any Field Force Personnel Detailing, Dova's Compliance Manager shall notify Valeant's Compliance Manager of such concerns in writing and the Compliance Managers will discuss and resolve such matters pursuant to Section 4.3.9.",
                "changed_text": "If Dova suspects any member of the Field Force Personnel has violated any law or failed to comply with this agreement, Dova may directly discipline or terminate the involved personnel without Valeant's consent or participation. Valeant is not responsible for any consequences resulting from Dova's actions.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts labor laws regarding the employer-employee relationship. It allows Dova to directly discipline or terminate Valeant's employees, violating Valeant's rights as the employer and potentially creating wrongful termination or interference claims. Employers have specific procedures and responsibilities regarding employee discipline and termination, which this change disregards.",

                "original_text": "Each Party agrees that, during the Term and for a period of [***] thereafter, it shall keep confidential and shall not publish or otherwise disclose and shall not use for any purpose other than as provided for in this Agreement (which includes the exercise of its rights or performance of any obligations hereunder) any Confidential Information furnished to it by or on behalf of the other Party pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties.",

However, after termination of this agreement, all confidentiality obligations shall immediately cease, regardless of the nature or sensitivity of the information.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens confidentiality protections by removing any post-termination confidentiality obligations. This contradicts standard business practices and legal principles that recognize the need to protect trade secrets and confidential information even after a contractual relationship ends. The lack of any post-term protection could violate state trade secret laws, such as the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which protect confidential business information from misappropriation.",

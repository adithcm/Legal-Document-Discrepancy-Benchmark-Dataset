                "explanation": "Changing the payment terms to net 60 days may conflict with standard commercial practices and prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions (including within the United States and Israel).

In the event that a defect is not apparent upon visual inspection during the shelf life of the Product (\"Hidden Defect\"), Kitov shall use commercially reasonably best efforts to provide Dexcel with written notification within thirty (30) Working Days of discovering the same, to be accompanied by samples of any such allegedly defective Product, if such samples are available In the event of any failure by Kitov to provide Dexcel with written notification of any such shortfall, Apparent Defect or Hidden Defect within the respective aforementioned periods, it shall be deemed as Kitov having accepted the relevant consignment.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for apparent and hidden defects from 30 to 10 working days is likely to be considered unreasonably short under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as adopted by many US states, or similar regulations in Israel for international transactions. The UCC requires a 'reasonable time' for inspection and rejection, and 10 days is likely insufficient for complex pharmaceutical products, particularly when 'hidden defects' are involved. Therefore, this creates a potential legal contradiction.",

Courts often consider the nature of the breach, the effort required to cure it, and industry standards when evaluating the reasonableness of a cure period. This change could be deemed unconscionable or against public policy, potentially conflicting with contract law principles related to good faith and fair dealing.",

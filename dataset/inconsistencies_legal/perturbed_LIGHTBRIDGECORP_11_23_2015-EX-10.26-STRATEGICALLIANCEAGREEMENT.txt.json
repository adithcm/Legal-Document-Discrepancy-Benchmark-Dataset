                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to 10 days may conflict with standard commercial law principles that require a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach. Depending on the nature of the breach and the jurisdiction (England), 30 days is likely considered reasonable, whereas 10 days might be deemed insufficient, making the clause potentially unenforceable.",

This Agreement is effective on the Effective Date and shah continue in effect until the earlier of (a) the fifth (5t h) anniversary of the Effective Date, and (b) termination by either Party for any reason upon ten (10) days' written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that no Party shall be able to terminate this Agreement so long as such Party is a Defaulting Party under this Agreement. The occurrence of the Termination Date shall not relieve either Party of any unfulfilled obligation or undischarged liability of such Party relating to the period prior to the Termination Date.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period from 30 days to 10 days introduces a contradiction. Under English law (as per Section 7.2), a reasonable notice period is typically required for termination, especially for agreements of this nature. Ten days may be deemed unreasonably short, especially if it involves significant operational adjustments, thus potentially rendering the termination clause unenforceable or subject to legal challenge.",

Such delivery of Confidential Information will occur within 90 days after the termination date.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the return or destruction of confidential information until 90 days after termination creates a contradiction. English law emphasizes the immediate protection of trade secrets and confidential information. A delay of 90 days could expose the disclosing party to undue risk and potential damages, thus contradicting the principle of immediate protection.",

                "original_text": "12.1 Distributor shall have the option to return to Cisco, for credit, up [*****] of the dollar value of Products from the Wholesale Price List (or, if no Wholesale Price Lists exists for Distributor's Territory, then the applicable price list) shipped to Distributor, net of credits, less returns to Cisco, in the preceding [*****] period (the \"Balancing Cap\") of the preceding Cisco fiscal quarter. The above-referenced cap shall be determined based on all Product purchases made under this Agreement. The responsibility to manage the Balancing Cap shall rest solely upon Distributor. Distributor shall be entitled to return Product once per quarter, provided such returns do not exceed the Balancing Cap. \"Dead on Arrival\" and Obsolete Products returned pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement shall be excluded from calculation of the Balancing Cap. Cisco shall credit Distributor's account in the amount of the price paid by Distributor therefore, less any price protection credits issued to Distributor related to the Product returned (the \"Return Credit\").",

                "explanation": "By changing \"once per quarter\" to \"once per year\", this modification creates a less frequent return option for the distributor. This conflicts with general commercial reasonableness standards, as quarterly returns are more common and accepted practice in distribution agreements, especially regarding electronics and technology. This change is unfavorable to the distributor and can be challenged based on good faith and fair dealing principles.",

                "explanation": "By stipulating that the original agreement shall prevail in case of a conflict, instead of the amendment, it creates uncertainty in the parties' obligations and may render the amendment ineffective. This violates the general principle of contract law that later agreements (amendments) supersede prior agreements to the extent of any inconsistency. This contradiction makes the amendment potentially unenforceable and contradicts legal standards for contract modifications.",

                "explanation": "The modification extends the anti-corruption training interval from 12 months to 36 months. For industries that requires regular compliance to anti-corruption training, 36 months is considered too long and can be challenged legally in court if the company were to encounter legal issues with the authorities for corruption, due to not following the best practice standards with employee corruption training.",

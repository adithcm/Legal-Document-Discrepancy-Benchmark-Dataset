The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",

                "explanation": "Removing the approval requirement by January 1, 2019 could become an issue of breach if there are any undisclosed issues with the facility that are not uncovered until later. Failure to get the correct approvals can hinder the company from producing, and therefore the company is now non-compliant. Automatic renewals for another year is also a legal issue if not properly disclosed.",

                "explanation": "Giving Heritage Foods sole discretion in interpreting the contract terms could violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which exists in most U.S. jurisdictions. This covenant requires both parties to act honestly and reasonably in the performance and enforcement of the contract. Granting one party absolute interpretive power could allow for arbitrary or unfair decisions, potentially harming Premier Nutrition Corporation.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period to one day places an unreasonable burden on Integrity and could hinder its ability to adequately prepare a defense. Most jurisdictions require a reasonable notification period for indemnification claims, and one day is insufficient. This could lead to a court invalidating the indemnification clause due to impracticality.",

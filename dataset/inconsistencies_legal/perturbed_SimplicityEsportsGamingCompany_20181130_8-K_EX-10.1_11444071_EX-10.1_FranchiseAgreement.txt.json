Franchisor may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to Franchisee upon the occurrence of any of the following: (a) Franchisee fails to make any payment required under or in connection with this Agreement; (b) Franchisee ceases to operate or otherwise abandon the Smaaash Centres without the consent of Franchisor, or otherwise forfeit the right to do or transact business in the Territory; (c) Franchisee fails to use its best efforts to market and promote Smaaash Centres and the services and products offered by Smaaash Centres within the Territory and such failure is not cured within thirty (30) days of Franchisor's notification to Franchisee of such failure.",

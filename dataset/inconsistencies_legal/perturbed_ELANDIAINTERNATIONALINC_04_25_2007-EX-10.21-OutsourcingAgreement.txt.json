                "original_text": "If, following that period the BSP requests replacement of the person, Datec must replace that person, within 60 days with another person of suitable ability and qualifications.",
                "changed_text": "If, following that period the BSP requests replacement of the person, Datec will replace that person at their earliest convenience, with no set deadline for finding a replacement.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 60-day deadline for replacing personnel. This change removes the deadline, which could violate labor laws requiring reasonable timeframes for addressing staffing issues. In Papua New Guinea, employment laws require employers to act promptly and reasonably in staffing matters.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates a 30-day period for dispute resolution before referral to expert determination or mediation, and the cost of which will be at either parties own cost. The changed text reduces this period to 15 days and makes referring the dispute discretionary, and the full cost will be borne by the initiating party. While Papua New Guinea law does not specify a minimum timeframe, international best practices and typical commercial standards suggest at least 30 days for initial good-faith negotiations.",

Reducing this to 30 days may not be sufficient to ensure a smooth transition of services, potentially violating implied obligations to provide a reasonable disengagement process.

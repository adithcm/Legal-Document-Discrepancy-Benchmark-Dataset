That is, if the compensation committee (the \"Compensation Committee\") of the board of directors (the \"Board\") of the Company's parent company, Bicycle Therapeutics plc (\"BTL\") determines that you have completed all such corporate and personal objectives to its satisfaction in a given year, your bonus would be 35% of your Earned Salary in that year, excluding any other bonuses in this offer. Such bonus may be payable in cash or, in whole or in part, in share options in BTL, as agreed by you and the Compensation Committee following notification by you of your preference at least 90 days prior to the normal payment date (and in the case of share options with the appropriate HMRC valuation process (if required by the Compensation Committee) and Board approval so as to be compliant with BTL's share option plan rules), with due consideration for the operational requirements of the Company at that time in your role as CBO.",

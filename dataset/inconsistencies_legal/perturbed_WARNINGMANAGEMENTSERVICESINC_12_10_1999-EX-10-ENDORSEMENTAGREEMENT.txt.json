                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days following the conclusion of each Contract Year Quarter, Company shall deliver to Pey Dirt an itemized statement setting forth the total shipments of Endorsed Products during said Contract Year Quarter and, at the same time, shall pay to Pey Dirt a royalty with respect to such shipments as hereinafter provided.",
                "changed_text": "Within ninety (90) days following the conclusion of each Contract Year Quarter, Company shall deliver to Pey Dirt an itemized statement setting forth the total shipments of Endorsed Products during said Contract Year Quarter and, at the same time, shall pay to Pey Dirt a royalty with respect to such shipments as hereinafter provided.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment within 30 days of the end of each quarter. Modifying this to 90 days delays payment significantly. Delayed payments may conflict with generally accepted accounting principles, good faith principles, or laws requiring timely payments (although a specific law is not directly violated here, the extended payment period could create financial hardship and potential breach of good faith).",

                "changed_text": "Pey Dirt, or its representatives, shall, upon one (1) day's written notice, have the right at all times (prior to the expiration of one (1) year after the termination of the Contract Period) to inspect and make copies of the books and records of Company insofar as they shall relate to the computation of royalties to be paid to Pey Dirt hereunder and the shipment of Endorsed Products pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires two weeks' notice for auditing the company's books and records and has a window of two years for auditing after the termination of contract. By reducing the notice to one day and the audit window to one year, this change makes auditing more disruptive and challenging for the company, potentially conflicting with reasonable business practices. Audits generally need preparation time to avoid disruption and ensure accurate records.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the insurer must provide at least 20 days' notice before terminating or modifying the insurance policy. Reducing this to 5 days creates less time for the other parties to seek and maintain alternative coverage, conflicting with standard insurance practices that typically require greater notification periods (e.g., 30 days).",

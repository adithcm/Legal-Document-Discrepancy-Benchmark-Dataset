                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 14 days' written notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 14 days could be deemed unreasonable and contradict the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in Massachusetts contracts. Courts often require a reasonable notice period to allow the other party to make alternative arrangements.",

                "changed_text": "The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder.",
                "explanation": "Removing the exception for 'willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder' attempts to exculpate the Sponsor from liability even in cases of egregious misconduct. This violates public policy and principles of Massachusetts law that prevent parties from contracting away liability for intentional or grossly negligent conduct.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law to Delaware when the Trust and Sponsor are both Massachusetts entities, and the agreement is executed in Massachusetts, could be challenged if Delaware law provides less protection to investors or is less stringent regarding fiduciary duties. This may contradict established Massachusetts public policy related to investor protection within investment trusts.",

                "original_text": "As soon as it becomes practicable after the end of each quarter, but not later than thirty (30) days thereafter, the Parties shall review the actual revenue of the Company versus the Business Plan based on the wafer loading by each of FSL/AFSL and TPH/TPH-A for the previous quarter, and if there are any shortfalls in revenue from the Business Plan in such quarter, the compensation for such shortfalls shall be made by a Party who caused such shortfalls to the Company within sixty (60) days after the end of the fiscal year of the Company where such quarter resides.",
                "changed_text": "As soon as it becomes practicable after the end of each quarter, but not later than sixty (60) days thereafter, the Parties shall review the actual revenue of the Company versus the Business Plan based on the wafer loading by each of FSL/AFSL and TPH/TPH-A for the previous quarter, and if there are any shortfalls in revenue from the Business Plan in such quarter, the compensation for such shortfalls shall be made by a Party who caused such shortfalls to the Company within one-hundred and twenty (120) days after the end of the fiscal year of the Company where such quarter resides.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 30-day deadline for reviewing quarterly revenue and a 60-day deadline for compensating shortfalls. The modified text extends these deadlines to 60 and 120 days, respectively. This is a contradiction since companies are generally expected to reconcile their finances in a timely manner.",

Special meetings of the Board shall be held upon notice of not less than three (3) Business Days setting forth an agenda or purpose for the meeting; provided, however, that any Director may waive compliance with such notice requirement before or after the meeting.",

Special meetings of the Board shall be held upon notice of not less than one (1) Business Day setting forth an agenda or purpose for the meeting; provided, however, that any Director may waive compliance with such notice requirement before or after the meeting.",
                "explanation": "Changing the board meeting frequency from every three months to every six months and reducing the notice periods for both regular and special meetings to 5 and 1 business days, respectively, introduces a conflict. Standard corporate governance practices generally recommend more frequent board meetings and longer notice periods to ensure directors have adequate time to prepare, this change potentially violates best practices.",

Should no solution be agreed upon within sixty (60) days after submission of the matter to the Designated Individuals, then any Party may refer the matter for resolution in accordance with the dispute resolution procedure set forth in Section 11.15.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for board resolution from 30 to 10 business days and the CEO resolution period from 60 to 30 days creates an unrealistic expectation for complex decision-making processes. This rushed process may not allow sufficient time for due diligence and informed decision-making, potentially leading to hasty or poorly considered resolutions. The parties involved might not have sufficient time to properly evaluate the issue.",

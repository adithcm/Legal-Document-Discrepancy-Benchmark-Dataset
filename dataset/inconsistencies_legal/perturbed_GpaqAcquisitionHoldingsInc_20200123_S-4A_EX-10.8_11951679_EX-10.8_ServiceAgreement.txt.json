                "original_text": "Constellation shall be invoiced by the HOF Entities for any such materials at the retail cost charged to the HOF Entities (or either of them) by the supplier, without mark-up. Payment with respect to such invoice will be due thirty (30) days following receipt by Constellation of such invoice.",

Payment with respect to such invoice will be due ninety (90) days following receipt by Constellation of such invoice.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the payment term to 90 days contradicts standard business practices and potentially violates prompt payment laws, which often mandate payment within a shorter timeframe (e.g., 30 days) to ensure fair and timely compensation for goods and services. Longer payment terms can place undue financial strain on suppliers.",

                "changed_text": "A Party shall be in default hereunder if any of the following events shall occur (each of such events being an \"Event of Default\"): (i) Such Party fails to perform timely any of its material obligations hereunder and such default shall continue for a period of ten (10) days following receipt by such Party of written notice from the other Party specifying such default; provided that, if the default specified in such notice is curable but of a nature such that it cannot be cured through the exercise of reasonable diligence within the ten (10) day cure period, then such ten (10) day cure period shall be extended to a period as is reasonable (but in no event more than ten (10) days, subject to delay due to force majeure) to cure such default pursuant to a mutually agreed plan of cure, provided that the non-performing Party has proceeded at all times and is continuing to proceed in a diligent and reasonable manner to cure;",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for defaults to 10 days (with a maximum extension of 10 days) is unreasonably short and could be deemed unconscionable, especially for complex or material defaults. Many jurisdictions would find such a limited cure period insufficient, potentially rendering the default provision unenforceable.",

In the event that an HOF Entity seeks indemnification on behalf of an HOF Entity Indemnified Person, or Constellation seeks indemnification on behalf of a Constellation Indemnified Person, such Party seeking indemnification (the \"Indemnified Party\") shall give reasonably prompt notice to the indemnifying Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") specifying the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted; provided, however, that the right of a person or entity to be indemnified hereunder shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, any Indemnifying Party is actually irrevocably and materially prejudiced thereby. Subject to the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any valid claim not more than ten (10) days after the Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of such amount.",

Subject to the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any valid claim at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "Eliminating the notice requirement for indemnification claims and stating payment is at the discretion of the indemnifying party directly contradicts standard legal practice and principles of fairness. The requirement to provide notice is fundamental in indemnity agreements. Removing this requirement is generally unenforceable as it prevents the indemnifying party from adequately investigating and defending against the claim.",

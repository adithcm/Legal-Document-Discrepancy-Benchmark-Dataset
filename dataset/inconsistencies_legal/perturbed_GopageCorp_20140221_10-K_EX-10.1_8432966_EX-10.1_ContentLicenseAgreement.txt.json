                "original_text": "If Licensor instructs Licensee to delete or make inaccessible any Content Item because such Content Item may contain errors, is or could be subject to a third-party claim or for any other good faith reason, Licensee shall comply with such instruction as promptly as reasonably possible and, in any case, within twenty-four (24) hours. The License Term for each such Content Item terminates at the end of such 24-hour period.",
                "changed_text": "If Licensor instructs Licensee to delete or make inaccessible any Content Item because such Content Item may contain errors, is or could be subject to a third-party claim or for any other good faith reason, Licensee shall comply with such instruction at their earliest convenience, or within one (1) hour if deemed absolutely necessary by Licensor. The License Term for each such Content Item terminates at the end of such 1-hour period.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows the licensee 24 hours to remove content. Reducing it to one (1) hour if needed imposes an unreasonable burden on the Licensee, particularly if content removal requires significant technical work or occurs outside of normal business hours. Some jurisdictions might view this as an unfair business practice, especially if the 'good faith reason' is not clearly defined, potentially contradicting fair business practice laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of fair business practice laws depending on the specific jurisdiction and interpretation of 'good faith reason'. Could also violate reasonable notice periods depending on context.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee shall deliver to Licensor (i) a report vaguely showing Gross Revenues of the Licensee for the previous quarter and (ii) payment of an approximate amount of Royalties payable for such previous quarter, at the Licensor's discretion. Under no circumstances shall the Licensor deliver the report of gross revenues.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires licensees to provide a detailed report and payment of the Royalties payable each quarter. By removing the obligation to deliver the report and to deliver actual royalties, it weakens the Licensor's ability to audit and collect rightfully owed royalties. This contradicts the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most contracts, especially regarding financial obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, potentially violating contract law principles.",

By editing the text to include sensitive information required to be disclosed to the SEC as part of confidential information to protect and by allowing the use of private information of the party, it weakens the clause and increases the risk of the party's exposure of its confidential data, which may contradict trade secret laws.",

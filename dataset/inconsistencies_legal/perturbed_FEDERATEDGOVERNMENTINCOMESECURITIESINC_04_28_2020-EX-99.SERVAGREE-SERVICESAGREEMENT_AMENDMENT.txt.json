                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the British Virgin Islands.",
                "explanation": "By changing the governing law to the British Virgin Islands, it introduces potential conflicts. The original agreement specifies Pennsylvania law, which provides a known legal framework and predictability for interpreting the contract. The British Virgin Islands, a different jurisdiction, has distinct legal principles and standards that might contradict established expectations under Pennsylvania law, creating uncertainty and potentially jeopardizing the enforceability of the agreement, particularly concerning provisions related to investment advisory services and fiduciary duties, which are extensively regulated under US federal and state laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varying legal interpretations and enforcement standards between Pennsylvania law and British Virgin Islands law regarding investment advisory services.",

                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be effective 90 days after the date first above written, regardless of execution and delivery by each of the parties hereto.",
                "explanation": "Changing the effective date to 90 days after the written date, regardless of execution, contradicts standard contract law. Typically, an amendment becomes effective upon mutual agreement and execution. Delaying effectiveness and removing the requirement of execution creates uncertainty and potential unenforceability, as it conflicts with fundamental contract formation principles.",
                "contradicted_law": "Basic contract law principles requiring mutual agreement and execution for a contract to be valid and effective.",

                "original_text": "Employees of Federated Advisory Services Company provide support to portfolio managers and other employees of affiliated advisers. Such services may include development of risk management programs, production of portfolio and compliance reports for clients and/or fund Boards, coordination of client portfolios and related fixed income trade execution implementation and administration, completion of required broker and custody documentation, development and documentation of operational procedures, coordination of proxy voting activities, on-site support of hardware and software, etc.",
                "changed_text": "Employees of Federated Advisory Services Company may provide support to portfolio managers. The extent and nature of this support are at the sole discretion of Federated Advisory Services Company, without any obligation to provide specific services or meet regulatory compliance standards.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the detailed description of services, including risk management, compliance reports, and regulatory documentation. It introduces ambiguity and discretionary control, which conflicts with the regulatory expectation that investment advisers provide comprehensive and documented support to ensure compliance with securities laws.",

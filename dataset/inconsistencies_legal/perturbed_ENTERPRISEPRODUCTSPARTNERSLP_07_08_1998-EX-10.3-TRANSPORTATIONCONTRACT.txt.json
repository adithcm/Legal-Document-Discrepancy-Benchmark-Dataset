A claim must be filed with Carrier within thirty (30) days from the date the shipment in question was delivered, and     (i) contain facts sufficient to identify the shipment (or shipments)     involved (ii) assert the grounds for Carrier's liability for alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay, and (iii) request payment of a specified or determinable amount of money.",

A claim must be filed with Carrier within ten (10) days from the date the shipment in question was delivered, and     (i) contain facts sufficient to identify the shipment (or shipments)     involved (ii) assert the grounds for Carrier's liability for alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay, and (iii) request payment of a specified or determinable amount of money.",
                "explanation": "This change shortens the claim filing deadline to 10 days, which could be deemed unreasonably short and contradict the Carmack Amendment, which generally allows for a reasonable time for filing claims (often interpreted as at least nine months for domestic shipments). This shorter timeframe may not provide shippers sufficient time to discover and document cargo loss or damage fully.",

Provided, however, that, if the claim cannot be processed and     disposed of within 120 days after receipt thereof, Carrier shall at that     time and at the expiration of each succeeding 60 day period while the claim     remains pending, advise the claimant in writing of the status of the claim     and the reason for the delay in making final disposition thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Carrier shall pay, decline, or make a firm compromise settlement offer in     writing to the claimant within 365 days after receipt of the claim by     Carrier. Provided, however, that, if the claim cannot be processed and     disposed of within 365 days after receipt thereof, Carrier shall at that     time and at the expiration of each succeeding 180 day period while the claim     remains pending, advise the claimant in writing of the status of the claim     and the reason for the delay in making final disposition thereof.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the claim settlement period to 365 days.  While the Carmack Amendment does not explicitly state a maximum settlement period, unreasonably delaying settlement can be seen as a violation of the carrier's duty to promptly and fairly resolve claims. This excessive delay could subject the carrier to legal challenges regarding claim handling practices.",

                "explanation": "This change reduces the timeframe for filing overcharge claims from nine months to three months. This could be deemed unreasonably short under the Interstate Commerce Commission's (ICC) regulations and related court interpretations. While the ICC no longer exists, its principles about reasonable claim periods still influence legal considerations. This limitation can severely restrict shippers from discovering billing errors within a realistic timeframe.",

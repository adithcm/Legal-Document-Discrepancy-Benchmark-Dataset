Such acceptance shall be issued in the form of Attachment C by Integra within ten (10) business days of receipt by Integra or its Affiliates of product (and related quality and testing documentation) meeting specifications mutually agreed upon by Integra and PcoMed.",

Such acceptance shall be issued in the form of Attachment C by Integra within one (1) business day of receipt by Integra or its Affiliates of product (and related quality and testing documentation) meeting specifications mutually agreed upon by Integra and PcoMed.",
                "explanation": "This modification reduces the acceptance period to 1 business day, which is an unreasonably short timeframe that may violate general commercial reasonableness standards and could be deemed an unfair business practice, especially considering the complexity of quality and testing documentation review.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the payment timeframe to 90 days after the end of each quarter could be seen as an unfair and unreasonable delay, potentially violating state prompt payment laws if such laws exist for commercial transactions in New Jersey or Colorado (where the parties are located).  This could lead to legal challenges based on breach of contract and violations of fair business practices.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the records retention period to one year is inconsistent with standard business practices and potentially conflicts with statutes of limitations for breach of contract claims, which often extend beyond one year (e.g., six years in New Jersey for contract claims).

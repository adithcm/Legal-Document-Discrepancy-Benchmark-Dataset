                "original_text": "WHITHIN 14 DAYS OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF CHANGED PARTICIPATION TERMS, AFFILIATE AND SOFTWARE PUBLISHER MAY OBJECT TO SUCH CHANGES. IF NO OBJECTION IS RECEIVED DURING THIS TIME, THE PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHANGES AND THEY WILL BECOME PART OF THE EXISTING RELATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT.",

IF NO OBJECTION IS RECEIVED DURING THIS TIME, THE PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHANGES AND THEY WILL BECOME PART OF THE EXISTING RELATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT.",
                "explanation": "This change shortens the objection period to 3 days, which may be unreasonably short depending on jurisdiction and the nature of the changes, potentially conflicting with principles of fair notice and reasonable opportunity to review. A period of 14 days or more is more aligned with industry practices.",

If this is not the case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100 EUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the Affiliate's participation in the Program.",

If this is not the case, the sum due can be retained indefinitely, even upon termination of the Affiliate's participation in the Program.",
                "explanation": "This modifies the payment terms to occur quarterly with a higher minimum threshold (500 EUR/USD) and allows for indefinite retention of smaller amounts, even after termination. This conflicts with prompt payment laws, which often require timely payment of earned compensation, and wage and hour laws that govern the final payment of earnings upon termination of a relationship. Holding earned compensation indefinitely is generally illegal.",

                "explanation": "This removes any defined timeframe for final payment, allowing element 5 to withhold funds indefinitely. This directly conflicts with wage and hour laws and contract law principles requiring timely payment and fair dealing. Such a clause would likely be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable.",

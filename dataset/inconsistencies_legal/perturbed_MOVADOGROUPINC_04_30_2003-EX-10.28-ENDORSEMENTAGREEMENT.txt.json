                "original_text": "In the event of a \"Company Default\" (as defined below), the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to cure the Company Default by notifying the Company in writing within sixty (60) days after its receipt of notice of a Company Default, or if later, within thirty (30) days after a Trustee becomes aware of the Company Default. If the Company fails to cure the Company Default within sixty (60) days after being notified by the Trust of the Company Default, the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to transfer its interest in the Policy to the Trust. The Trust may exercise this right by notifying the Company, in writing, within sixty (60) days after the Company Default occurs.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of a \"Company Default\" (as defined below), the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to cure the Company Default by notifying the Company in writing within fifteen (15) days after its receipt of notice of a Company Default, or if later, within ten (10) days after a Trustee becomes aware of the Company Default. If the Company fails to cure the Company Default within fifteen (15) days after being notified by the Trust of the Company Default, the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to transfer its interest in the Policy to the Trust. The Trust may exercise this right by notifying the Company, in writing, within fifteen (15) days after the Company Default occurs.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 60-day cure period for a Company Default. Shortening this to 15 days may be deemed unreasonably short under New York law (the governing law of the contract as stated in section 12), potentially conflicting with principles of good faith and fair dealing in contract performance. Courts may find such a short timeframe insufficient for the Company to rectify the default, especially considering the complexity of financial or operational issues that could constitute a default.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York law principles of good faith and fair dealing in contract performance; potential conflict with commercially reasonable standards for cure periods.",

                "changed_text": "The Company shall notify the Trustees of the Trust within twenty (20) business days of any event which constitutes a Company Default.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the Company to notify the Trustees of a default within 5 business days. Changing this to 20 business days creates a potential conflict because it extends the notification period significantly. Depending on the nature of the default, this delay could cause financial harm to the Trust, since New York law demands prompt and reasonable notification, and that it has a duty to mitigate loss.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential breach of fiduciary duty or duty of good faith and fair dealing under New York law, particularly if the delay in notification exacerbates the harm resulting from the default.",

The Plan Administrator shall schedule an opportunity for a full and fair review of the issue within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal. The decision on review shall set forth specific reasons for the decision, and shall cite specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Agreement on which the decision is based.",
                "changed_text": "A claimant who has been completely or partially denied a benefit shall be entitled to appeal this denial of his or her claim by filing a written statement of his or her position with the Plan Administrator no later than fifteen (15) days after receipt of the written notification of such denial. The Plan Administrator is not obligated to schedule an opportunity for a full and fair review of the issue. The decision on review does not need to set forth specific reasons for the decision, nor does it need to cite specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Agreement on which the decision is based.",
                "explanation": "Section 14 outlines claims procedures. Reducing the appeal period to 15 days and removing the requirement for a fair review and detailed explanation of the decision violates ERISA requirements for reasonable claims procedures, by creating procedural unfairness and hindering the claimant's ability to understand and challenge the denial.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violation of ERISA's requirements for reasonable claims procedures (29 CFR 2560.503-1).",

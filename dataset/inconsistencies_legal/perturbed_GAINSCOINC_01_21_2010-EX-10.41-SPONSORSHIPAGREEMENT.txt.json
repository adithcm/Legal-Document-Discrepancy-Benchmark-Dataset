Racing shall provide the Sponsor a certificate of insurance evidencing \"Gainsco Inc. and all related entities\" as additional insureds, stating that such insurance is primary in coverage to any other insurance which may be available the Sponsor, and providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Sponsor of cancellation, modification or material change to the policy.",
                "changed_text": "Racing shall also provide comprehensive (fire and theft) and collision insurance on each vehicle used in the Business. Racing shall provide the Sponsor a certificate of insurance evidencing \"Gainsco Inc. and all related entities\" as additional insureds, stating that such insurance is primary in coverage to any other insurance which may be available to the Sponsor, and providing at least ten (10) days' prior written notice to the Sponsor of cancellation, modification or material change to the policy.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'thirty (30) days' to 'ten (10) days' prior written notice of cancellation, modification, or material change to the insurance policy creates a legal contradiction. In Texas, insurance policies typically require a minimum of 30 days' notice for cancellation or significant changes, especially for commercial policies. Reducing this to 10 days violates standard insurance practices and could be deemed insufficient notice under Texas law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Insurance Code - General insurance regulations typically require at least 30 days' notice for cancellation or material changes to insurance policies.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame from 15 to 5 days for Racing to terminate an employee after receiving notice of offensive conduct introduces a legal contradiction. This shorter timeframe may not allow Racing to conduct a proper investigation or follow legally required termination procedures under Texas employment law, potentially leading to wrongful termination claims. Texas law typically requires employers to provide reasonable time for investigation and due process before termination.",

                "explanation": "By limiting acceptable notice methods to solely 'hand delivery', the clause contradicts established legal standards for contract notices. Texas law generally recognizes mail and overnight delivery services as valid methods for delivering legal notices, especially in commercial contracts. Eliminating these options could render certain notices ineffective, particularly if hand delivery is impractical or impossible, leading to potential breaches and disputes.",

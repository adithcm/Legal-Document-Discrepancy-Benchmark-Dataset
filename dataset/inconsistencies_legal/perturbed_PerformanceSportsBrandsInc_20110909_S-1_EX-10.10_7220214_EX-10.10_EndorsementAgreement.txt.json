                "changed_text": "Amounts not received within ten (10) days following their respective due dates shall be assessed a late charge equal to ten percent (10%) per month of the overdue amount until paid, commencing on the eleventh day.",
                "explanation": "Charging 10% per month interest on late payments could violate usury laws, which set limits on the maximum interest rate that can be charged on a debt. Usury laws vary by state, and a rate this high may be illegal in Florida, the governing law jurisdiction. By increasing the late charge significantly, we've created a potential violation of these laws.",

                "changed_text": "North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Company to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by North within two (2) business days after receipt thereof.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the approval window for advertising materials to two business days may be deemed unreasonable and could constitute a breach of good faith, especially if the materials are complex or require significant review. This timeframe is particularly problematic if North is traveling or has other commitments, making it difficult to provide timely feedback. Florida law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract, and this abbreviated timeline could violate that covenant.",

                "original_text": "Company shall make said books available to North or North's representative on reasonable notice during the Term of this Agreement and the two (2) year period immediately following thereafter. The cost of any and all inspections shall be paid by North, unless an inspection shows an under-reporting or under-payment of more than five- percent (5%) for any quarterly period, in which event Company shall reimburse North for all such inspection costs.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall make said books available to North or North's representative on reasonable notice only during the Term of this Agreement. The cost of any and all inspections shall always be paid by North, regardless of the inspection results.",
                "explanation": "Restricting the inspection period to only during the term of the agreement and requiring North to always pay for inspections, regardless of findings, could be deemed unconscionable and violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. This is particularly problematic because it limits North's ability to verify royalty payments after the agreement ends, potentially depriving him of rightfully earned compensation. By removing the clause that allows North to be reimbursed for inspection costs if under-reporting is found, the provision unfairly favors the Company and discourages accurate reporting. The governing law of Florida considers the duty of good faith in all contracts and is also aware of the unconscionable acts that would violate legal regulations.",

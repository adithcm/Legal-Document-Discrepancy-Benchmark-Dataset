                "original_text": "The Steering Committee shall meet at least once in each month and as otherwise agreed between Committee Member. Such meetings shall take place in Moscow, in a location agreed by Otkritie and QIWI Group or by telephone.",
                "changed_text": "The Steering Committee shall meet at least once every three months, or as otherwise agreed. All meetings will be held exclusively via written correspondence.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates monthly meetings, while the modified text changes the frequency to at least once every three months. This could contradict requirements for regular oversight in corporate governance depending on the specific regulations in Cyprus, where QIWI plc is registered, potentially violating requirements for regular board or committee activity. By restricting meetings to written correspondence, it introduces a level of inefficiency that could impact proper corporate governance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates corporate governance regulations in Cyprus concerning the frequency and method of board/committee meetings and oversight duties. Specifically, the Cyprus Companies Law, Cap. 113, outlines director duties and responsibilities, which could be compromised by infrequent and solely written meetings.",

                "original_text": "For two (2) years following the Effective Time, QIWI covenants that at least one half of the total transactions processed by the Contact money transfer system during such two-year period shall be settled through PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie, provided that QIWI may terminate its obligation under this Clause 4.1 at any time, in which case it shall pay to Otkritie a fee equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Otkritie for such period starting from 1 September 2014, until the date of termination of QIWI's obligations under this Clause 4.1 in connection with (i) the transfer of settlement bank function to PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie ; and (ii) supporting the settlement bank functionality for the Contact money transfer system, provided further that such fee shall in no event exceed RUB 50 000 000 (fifty million roubles).",
                "changed_text": "For five (5) years following the Effective Time, QIWI covenants that all transactions processed by the Contact money transfer system will be settled exclusively through PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie. QIWI may not terminate its obligation under this clause.",
                "explanation": "The modified clause extends the mandatory settlement period from two to five years and removes QIWI's right to terminate the obligation, effectively creating an exclusive dealing arrangement. This could violate antitrust or competition laws, depending on the market share and competitive landscape, specifically if it substantially lessens competition by preventing QIWI from using other banks for settlement. This arrangement may be viewed as overly restrictive and anti-competitive, leading to potential legal challenges under antitrust laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates antitrust or competition laws in Russia, where PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie is located and where the settlement is occurring. Specifically, Article 10 of the Federal Law 'On Protection of Competition' (135-FZ) prohibits agreements that restrict competition, especially exclusive dealing arrangements that significantly limit other market participants.",

                "original_text": "In the absence of evidence of earlier receipt, any notice shall take effect from the time that it is deemed to be received in accordance with Clause 8.3.",
                "changed_text": "All notices shall be considered received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery or acknowledgment.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts standard legal practice and potentially conflicts with contract law principles that require proof of delivery for notices, particularly important legal notices. By stating that notice is effective upon dispatch, regardless of receipt, it could lead to situations where a party is bound by a notice they never received, violating due process and fundamental fairness. This directly affects the rights and obligations of both parties by potentially eliminating the need for verifiable communication.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates general principles of contract law regarding notice requirements, which generally mandate proof of receipt for legal notices to be effective. It could also conflict with specific legal requirements regarding notice in legal proceedings, where proper service is essential for due process under the laws of England and Wales, the governing law of the agreement.",

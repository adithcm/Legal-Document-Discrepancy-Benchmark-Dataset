                "original_text": "In the event that the Proposed Contract Notice is a Considered Contract, the Joint Venture Company will have the right to review and determine whether to accept or reject the Considered Contract within ten (10) days following Joint Venture Company's receipt of the Proposed Contract Notice (the \"Review Period\"). Joint Venture Company shall provide Loop with a written acceptance or rejection of each Considered Contract (\"Acceptance Notice\" or \"Rejection Notice,\" as applicable) within the Review Period, which acceptance or rejection shall be in Joint Venture Company's sole discretion. If Joint Venture Company does not provide an Acceptance Notice or Rejection Notice to Loop within the Review Period, the Considered Contract will be deemed rejected by Joint Venture Company.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that the Proposed Contract Notice is a Considered Contract, the Joint Venture Company will have the right to review and determine whether to accept or reject the Considered Contract within three (3) days following Joint Venture Company's receipt of the Proposed Contract Notice (the \"Review Period\"). Joint Venture Company shall provide Loop with a written acceptance or rejection of each Considered Contract (\"Acceptance Notice\" or \"Rejection Notice,\" as applicable) within the Review Period, which acceptance or rejection shall be in Joint Venture Company's sole discretion. If Joint Venture Company does not provide an Acceptance Notice or Rejection Notice to Loop within the Review Period, the Considered Contract will be deemed accepted by Joint Venture Company.",
                "explanation": "The change from ten (10) days to three (3) days for the review period could be considered unreasonably short depending on the complexity and volume of the contracts being reviewed, potentially violating good faith dealing implied in contract law and the reasonable expectations of the parties. Additionally, changing the default action from 'deemed rejected' to 'deemed accepted' if no notice is given significantly alters the power dynamics and can be viewed as an unconscionable term, especially if Loop is in a weaker negotiating position. This creates a legal contradiction based on fairness and potential duress.",

                "explanation": "The change from ninety (90) days to one-hundred and eighty (180) days could be considered as an unreasonably long period, depending on the industry standards or regulations. It is not considered as an emergency.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from thirty (30) days to five (5) days is a significant change that may be considered unreasonable and contradict the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Many jurisdictions find that such a short cure period does not provide the breaching party with sufficient time to rectify a significant breach, especially if it involves complex operational or financial issues. This could lead to a claim of wrongful termination if the non-breaching party acts hastily based on the shortened cure period.",

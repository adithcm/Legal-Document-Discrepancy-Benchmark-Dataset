                "original_text": "Pursuant to the doctrine of sequential liability, payment from Kubient to Customer shall be made within seven (7) days from Kubient's receipt of payment, regardless of when Customer submits an invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant to the doctrine of sequential liability, payment from Kubient to Customer shall be made within thirty (30) days from Kubient's receipt of payment, regardless of when Customer submits an invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment timeframe from 7 days to 30 days. While a longer payment period isn't inherently illegal, it could be viewed as an unreasonable delay, especially in jurisdictions that imply a 'reasonable time' for payment where no specific timeframe is agreed. This alteration could potentially conflict with general contract law principles ensuring fairness and good faith, especially if the 7-day period is standard practice.",

                "changed_text": "No action, suit or proceeding shall be brought against a Party more than six months after the date of termination this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification reduces the statute of limitations for bringing a claim related to the agreement from one year to six months. This conflicts with the standard statute of limitations for breach of contract in New York (where the contract is to be performed) which is typically six years. Reducing it to six months is an unreasonably short period and may be deemed unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Recipient will protect the Confidential Information, for six (6) months from the date of disclosure, by using only what degree of care it wants to protect its own Confidential Information, but no less than bad faith, to prevent unauthorized use, disclosure or publication.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the confidentiality period from one year to six months and weakens the standard of care. Changing \"at least the same degree of care\" to \"only what degree of care it wants\" removes the requirement for the recipient to mirror the disclosing party's diligence. Further, changing the minimum acceptable care from 'a reasonable degree of care' to 'no less than bad faith' creates a lower, unacceptable, and unenforceable standard. These changes are against general contract law, as Confidential Information must be reasonable.",

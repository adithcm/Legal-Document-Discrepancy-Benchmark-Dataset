                "explanation": "This change extends the payment period to 90 days. California law generally favors shorter payment terms, especially for smaller businesses or independent contractors. While not a direct violation, unreasonably extending payment terms could be challenged, particularly if it imposes a significant financial burden on NETTAXI, which is implied to be the smaller business receiving payments from SpinRecords.com. California Prompt Payment laws favor businesses being paid in a reasonable time frame. If NETTAXI is a small business this can be more problematic",

                "explanation": "California law, specifically the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA), requires reasonable measures to protect trade secrets. Mandating the return of confidential information within just two days of notice may be deemed commercially unreasonable in certain cases, especially if the Receiving Party needs more time to fully purge its systems and ensure complete compliance. This haste might be viewed as an insufficient allowance to properly comply with trade secret protection requirements, especially if there's a substantial amount of data involved, potentially putting the Receiving Party at risk of inadvertent disclosure while trying to comply quickly.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the advance notice for audits to 3 business days and decreasing the record retention period to six months creates a potential conflict with general principles of contract law and accounting standards. While California doesn't have a specific statute mandating a minimum record retention period for contracts of this nature, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and prudent business practices suggest longer retention periods, particularly for financial records related to revenue and royalty payments. A shorter retention period of six months could impede NETTAXI's ability to verify payments accurately in the event of disputes and may conflict with industry standards for financial audits, as NETTAXI only has a 3-day heads up.",

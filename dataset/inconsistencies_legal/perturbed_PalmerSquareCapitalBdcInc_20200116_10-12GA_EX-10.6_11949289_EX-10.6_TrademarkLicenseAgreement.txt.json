                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be terminable by Licensor at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that Licensor or Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of Licensee's use of the Licensed Mark; by Licensor or Licensee upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the other party; or by Licensee at any time in the event Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of Licensee's rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be terminable by Licensor at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that Licensor or Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of Licensee's use of the Licensed Mark; by Licensor or Licensee upon ten (10) days' written notice to the other party; or by Licensee at any time in the event Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of Licensee's rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of Licensor.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for termination to 10 days may be considered unreasonably short, especially considering the potential impact on the Licensee's business operations. This might be challenged under general contract law principles, which consider if the period aligns with fair dealing and good faith standards, especially if the licensee needs a reasonable period to wind down operations that depend on the licensed trademark.",

For twenty-four (24) months following termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall specify on all public-facing materials in a prominent place and in prominent typeface that Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",
                "changed_text": "Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Mark shall cease, and Licensee shall immediately delete the term \"Palmer Square\" from its corporate name and shall discontinue all other use of the Licensed Mark. For six (6) months following termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall specify on all public-facing materials in a prominent place and in prominent typeface that Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the period for the Licensee to notify the public that they are no longer operating under the Licensed Mark from 24 months to 6 months can be problematic if it leads to customer confusion and damages the Licensor's brand reputation in the long term. This may conflict with trademark law principles aimed at preventing consumer deception and protecting trademark holders from potential damages.",

                "explanation": "Changing the notice requirement from 'upon receipt' to 'upon sending' for standard mail introduces ambiguity and potential disputes about when a notice is considered valid. Removing the requirement for signature confirmation or registered mail creates further uncertainty and conflicts with typical commercial standards for ensuring proper notification, especially for critical legal or financial communications. Also, changing written notice to verbal notice may be a contract law violation as major changes require written documentation.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement requires full payment upon signing, while the modified version allows for payment within 90 days. Although seemingly more lenient, this contradicts the standard and legally sound practice of immediate payment for services, potentially creating ambiguity around fulfillment obligations if the service is provided before payment. It weakens the enforceability and clarity of the payment terms.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires overnight courier or certified mail (return receipt requested), providing proof and a specific timeline for delivery. The modified clause only requires standard mail, which does not provide proof of delivery or a guaranteed timeframe. This contradicts standard legal practice, potentially leading to disputes over whether notice was properly given, especially concerning critical deadlines.",

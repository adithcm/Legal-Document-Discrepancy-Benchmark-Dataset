                "original_text": "5.7 Payment for Products. Todos shall invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to the Reseller, and the Reseller shall pay such sums by no later than thirty (30) days from the date of shipment. All payments made to Todos shall be in New Israeli Shekels.",

Todos shall invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to the Reseller, and the Reseller shall pay such sums by no later than ninety (90) days from the date of shipment. All payments made to Todos shall be in New Israeli Shekels.",
                "explanation": "In Israel, the 'Payment Clearing Law' mandates that payment terms exceeding 60 days require explicit justification and agreement. Extending the payment deadline to 90 days without such justification creates a contradiction with Israeli payment laws, potentially rendering the clause unenforceable without proper documentation.",

                "explanation": "The Israeli Companies Law mandates timely and accurate financial reporting. Unduly delaying the submission of quarterly reports to 45 days, without a reasonable basis can conflict with legal obligations for prompt financial disclosure and transparency.",

                "explanation": "Under Israeli contract law, particularly concerning commercial agreements, providing an unreasonably short cure period (10 days) for a material breach may be deemed insufficient and conflict with the principle of good faith and fair dealing. Similarly, requiring termination for insolvency after only 30 days could violate bankruptcy laws protecting businesses attempting to reorganize. A reasonable timeframe must be allowed for remediation of the breach and the insolvency.",

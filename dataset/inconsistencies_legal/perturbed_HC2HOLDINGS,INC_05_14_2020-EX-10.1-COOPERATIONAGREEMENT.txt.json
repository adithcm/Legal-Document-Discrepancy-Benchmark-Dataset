                "original_text": "The Company agrees that it shall hold the 2020 Annual Meeting no later than July 8, 2020 and shall not cause or permit any delay, postponement or adjournment thereof, except for any adjournment solely due to a lack of quorum under the Company's Fourth Amended and Restated By-Laws (the \"By-Laws\").",

                "explanation": "Delaying the annual meeting until December 31, 2020, could violate Delaware law if it is outside the permitted window for holding annual meetings, especially given the company's bylaws and the specific context of director elections agreed upon in the contract.",

                "explanation": "By removing the three-day deadline and making the indemnification agreement discretionary, the modified text introduces a contradiction. Indemnification agreements for directors are considered best practices for corporate governance and are expected to be provided promptly. A discretionary approach may violate fiduciary duties to the new directors, potentially conflicting with corporate law obligations.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definite timeline and guaranteed amount for reimbursement, the modified text introduces a legal contradiction. This contradicts the initial agreement to reimburse expenses, potentially leading to breach of contract claims. It also creates uncertainty regarding financial obligations, affecting the enforceability of the agreement and potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "Changing the notice period for interruptible transportation to 10 days is problematic because it may not provide sufficient time for the other party to secure alternative arrangements, potentially conflicting with reasonable notice requirements implied under contract law and industry standards.",

                "explanation": "Changing the delivery timeframe for notices to ten business days after mailing is problematic.

The transporter has the sole discretion to switch the firm service to interruptible service without prior notice.",
                "explanation": "Adding a clause that allows the transporter to switch firm service to interruptible service without notice contradicts the fundamental nature of 'firm' service, which guarantees uninterrupted transportation. This change can lead to breaches of contract and conflicts with legal principles requiring good faith and fair dealing in contractual performance.",

                "original_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any delay by Service Recipient in its payment of any Service Fee to Service Provider, for each day of delay in such payment, Service Recipient must pay Service Provider liquidated damages at 0.5 percent (0.5%) of the Service Fee that are due and unpaid. In the event that such delay in payment is more than fifteen (15) days, Service Provider may terminate this Agreement. Service Recipient shall be liable for indemnifying Service Provider in full for the losses it incurred therefrom.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any delay by Service Recipient in its payment of any Service Fee to Service Provider, for each day of delay in such payment, Service Recipient must pay Service Provider liquidated damages at 5 percent (5%) of the Service Fee that are due and unpaid. In the event that such delay in payment is more than five (5) days, Service Provider may terminate this Agreement. Service Recipient shall be liable for indemnifying Service Provider in full for the losses it incurred therefrom.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for a 15-day grace period before termination due to non-payment, and sets liquidated damages at 0.5%. The modified text reduces the grace period to 5 days and increases the liquidated damages to 5% per day. This could be considered usurious or an unreasonable penalty under Chinese Contract Law if the 5% daily rate is deemed excessive and disproportionate to the actual loss suffered, especially if it accumulates quickly, as excessive late fees are often restricted.",

Any written notice sent by facsimile shall be deemed being delivered when the receipt is confirmed.\n\nIn addition, Service Provider may send any notice by email to the email address provided by Service Recipient in this Agreement, and the notice shall be deemed as being delivered when such email is successfully sent.",
                "changed_text": "Any written notice sent by registered or express mail shall be deemed being delivered ten (10) business days after the date on which the mail is dispatched (evidenced by the postmark) unless the address on the mailing slip is different from the address specified in this Agreement. Any written notice sent by facsimile shall be deemed being delivered only when it is acknowledged by the receiver. \n\nIn addition, Service Provider may send any notice by email to the email address provided by Service Recipient in this Agreement, and the notice shall be deemed as being delivered only one month after being sent.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 3-day delivery timeframe for notices sent by mail and immediate delivery for email. The modified text extends the mail delivery timeframe to 10 days and email delivery to one month after being sent. This may contradict Article 16 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, which states that a notice arrives when it reaches the addressee. Delaying the deemed delivery significantly impairs the ability of the service recipient to act promptly on received notices, potentially causing them to miss critical deadlines or rights.",

This Agreement shall be renewed automatically for another ten (10) years upon the expiration unless either party objects verbally.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that the agreement renews for five years, but the modified text changes it to ten years and says that only verbal objections are sufficient to prevent renewal. As per the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, renewals are required to be explicitly confirmed, preferably in writing, to be legally binding. Making verbal communication acceptable to prevent automatic renewal, and greatly extending the renewal period, creates an imbalance, potentially leading to the unintended and prolonged continuation of the agreement to the detriment of one of the parties. Verbal agreements can be difficult to prove, potentially leading to disputes.",

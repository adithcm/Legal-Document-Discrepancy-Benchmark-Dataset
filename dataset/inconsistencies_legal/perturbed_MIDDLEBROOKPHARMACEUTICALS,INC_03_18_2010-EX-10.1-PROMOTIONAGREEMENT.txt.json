                "original_text": "The Parties agree to meet via conference call within five (5) business days of the end of  each month to determine the necessary adjustment, if any, to the Deposit. If it is determined that the Deposit must be  increased, within ten (10) business days of the date upon which the new Deposit is determined, MBRK shall send to  DD the funds necessary to increase the Deposit.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties agree to meet via conference call within fifteen (15) business days of the end of each quarter to determine the necessary adjustment, if any, to the Deposit. If it is determined that the Deposit must be increased, within forty-five (45) business days of the date upon which the new Deposit is determined, MBRK shall send to DD the funds necessary to increase the Deposit.",
                "explanation": "The original contract mandates a review and adjustment of the deposit amount within 5-10 business days, which aligns with standard business practice promoting timely financial oversight. The modified version extends this timeline to 15-45 business days which could potentially create inconsistency with standard accounting practices requiring more frequent reconciliation, thus creating potential financial discrepancies. This slower pace fails to meet the prudent financial management expectations, especially concerning deposit adjustments.",

                "explanation": "The original contract mandates payment of promotion fees within 15 days, which is a standard payment term. The modified version extends this to 90 days, which may conflict with state prompt payment laws for services rendered.  Many states have laws requiring faster payment timelines, especially for small businesses or specific industries.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires DD to provide records within 48 hours. The modified clause extends this to 30 days and adds a condition that DD's legal counsel must approve document release.

                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each party is responsible for filing, but has no obligation to ensure the accuracy or completeness of any filing, even concerning their own information. Responsibility for accuracy lies solely with the lead filer, regardless of individual knowledge.",
                "explanation": "This modification contradicts SEC regulations regarding individual responsibility for the accuracy of information filed under the Securities Exchange Act. Each party is legally responsible for the accuracy of their own information, regardless of a lead filer's presence.",
                "contradicted_law": "Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and related SEC rules regarding individual filer responsibility.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in effect for 30 days. After 30 days, termination requires unanimous written consent from all parties.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an arbitrary short duration of effectiveness (30 days) followed by an unreasonably restrictive termination clause (unanimous consent). The original agreement allows individual revocation, which is generally permissible under contract law, but the modified version is an unreasonable restraint on trade. Also, agreements under Exchange Act are expected to be in effect for extended periods, such as the duration of investment.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding reasonable duration and termination clauses and implied requirements around securities regulations.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement must be executed in a single, original document. Copies or electronic signatures are not permitted.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts established practices and laws (e.g., the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act - ESIGN) that recognize the validity of electronic signatures and counterpart execution. The original clause is standard and legally sound, but the modification imposes an unnecessary and legally questionable restriction.",
                "contradicted_law": "Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN) and general contract law regarding acceptable forms of execution.",

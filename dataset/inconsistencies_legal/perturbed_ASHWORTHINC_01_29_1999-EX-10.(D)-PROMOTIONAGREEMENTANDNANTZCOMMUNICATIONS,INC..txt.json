                "explanation": "The change extends the period for submitting insurance policies to 60 days, potentially conflicting with requirements for immediate coverage. Reducing the advance notice for policy modification or termination to 10 days does not align with standard insurance practices and could leave the insured parties inadequately protected. Some states require insurance companies to provide longer periods of notice before modifying or terminating policies.",

                "explanation": "The original contract states claims for shortage in product delivery must be made within 10 business days. This has been modified to 2 business days. This creates a legal contradiction, as it unreasonably restricts the time for filing claims, potentially violating state laws regarding reasonable opportunity to inspect goods upon delivery.",

Terms of payment by the Agent to the Company for Products shipped to the Customer will be net thirty (30) days from the date of statement unless the Agent chooses to pay the Company via electronic funds transfer in which case the terms of payment will be net forty-five (45) days.

Terms of payment by the Agent to the Company for Products shipped to the Customer will be net sixty (60) days from the date of statement regardless of payment method. All payments will be made in United States Dollars without set-off or counterclaim, free and clear of (and without deduction for) any taxes, duties, charges, withholdings, restrictions or conditions of any nature imposed or levied by any political, taxing or other authority.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows 30 days for payment, or 45 days if paid via electronic funds transfer. This has been modified to net 60 days regardless of payment method. Extending payment terms beyond what is standard in the industry without justification could be construed as an unfair business practice and a violation of good faith, particularly if it places undue burden on the supplier without commensurate benefit to the Agent. This can violate certain state commercial regulations.",

Shortening the cure period, particularly for significant breaches, may be deemed unreasonable and violate implied covenants of good faith, depending on the nature of the breach and applicable state laws. A very short cure period, particularly for complex contractual breaches, can be seen as giving insufficient time for a party to reasonably address and rectify the issue.",

                "original_text": "5.5 Every invoice shall be reviewed by the invoiced Party and subject to paragraphs 5.2, shall pay the invoice net fifteen (15) days from the date of invoicing. Invoices shall be delivered to the invoiced Party within three (3) days of the date of invoicing.",
                "changed_text": "5.5 Every invoice shall be reviewed by the invoiced Party and subject to paragraphs 5.2, shall pay the invoice net forty-five (45) days from the date of invoicing. Invoices shall be delivered to the invoiced Party within ten (10) days of the date of invoicing.",
                "explanation": "By changing the payment terms to 'net forty-five (45) days,' the agreement could potentially contradict prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions (including the US and Canada) which might require faster payment terms, especially for specific types of services or industries. In addition, changing the delivery of the invoice to 'ten (10) days' may also cause delays and may violate regulations requiring prompt invoicing.",

                "changed_text": "6.2 A Party shall, in the event of loss, damage or delay to Freight while in its care, custody or control, notify the other Party of the loss or damage when practically possible, carry out an investigation of the incident to determine the cause of such loss, damage or delay and shall within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the event of loss, damage or delay or knowledge of such incident of loss, damage or delay, whichever is later, as the case may be, report its findings to the other Party.",
                "explanation": "Extending the reporting deadline to 'one hundred and twenty (120) days' for loss, damage, or delay of freight potentially violates regulations or common carrier practices that expect faster reporting and claim filing timelines. Many transportation laws mandate shorter periods for reporting such incidents to ensure timely investigations and claims processing.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe to 'ten (10) days' for withdrawing or dismissing a bankruptcy petition, this creates an unreasonably short period that may conflict with bankruptcy laws and legal procedures, which typically allow a more extended period for such actions. This could result in a premature declaration of default.",

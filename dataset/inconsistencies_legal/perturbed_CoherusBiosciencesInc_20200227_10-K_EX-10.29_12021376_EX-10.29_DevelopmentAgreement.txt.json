                "original_text": "4.1.1 First BLA for a Licensed Product. Within [***] ([***]) [***] following the Effective Date, Bioeq shall make available to Licensee the complete draft of the Biologics License Application that Bioeq has prepared and intends to file for the first Licensed Product with the FDA. Licensee shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to review such draft without delay and to notify Bioeq in writing of any concerns it may identify in relation to such draft within [***] ([***]) days of such draft being made available to Licensee by Bioeq. Subsequently, Licensee may notify Bioeq in writing of any concerns that it identifies in relation to such draft promptly after such identification. For clarity, nothing in this Section 4.1.1 shall restrict Bioeq's right to file the first Biologics License Application for a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory at its sole discretion.",
                "changed_text": "4.1.1 First BLA for a Licensed Product. Bioeq is not required to make available to Licensee the complete draft of the Biologics License Application that Bioeq has prepared and intends to file for the first Licensed Product with the FDA. If Bioeq chooses to share, Licensee must provide all feedback regarding the BLA draft in a single meeting immediately following Bioeq making the draft available. Licensee may not provide any further feedback following that initial meeting. For clarity, nothing in this Section 4.1.1 shall restrict Bioeq's right to file the first Biologics License Application for a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts typical regulatory expectations for collaboration and thorough review processes in BLA filings. The FDA expects comprehensive and iterative feedback, whereas this clause limits licensee feedback drastically. This may violate regulations relating to BLA submissions, which require thoroughness and accuracy.",
                "contradicted_law": "FDA regulations regarding Biologics License Applications (BLAs) and requirements for comprehensive data review and submission.",

                "changed_text": "4.3.2 Additionally, Bioeq will make reasonable efforts to forward to Licensee a summary of any communications received from Regulatory Authorities outside of the Territory in relation to the Licensed Products when, in Bioeq's sole discretion, such communications are considered to have a material, negative impact on the receipt or maintenance of Regulatory Approval for, or the Commercialization of the Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory, and at least annually provide Licensee a summary of all communications. Licensee waives the right to see full communications.",
                "explanation": "The modification grants Bioeq complete discretion over the dissemination of potentially essential regulatory information. This conflicts with transparency standards, especially when dealing with potentially critical data affecting product approval and safety. In the United States, regulations are in place to protect whistleblowers of company misconduct, which this might be construed as discouraging.",

Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, the Receiving Party shall cease all use of and return to the Disclosing Party, or destroy, as the Disclosing Party shall specify in writing promptly upon such expiration or termination, all materials transferred pursuant to Section 11.4 and all copies of all documents and other materials that contain or embody any of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, except to the extent that the Receiving Party is required by Applicable Laws to retain such documents, and provided further that each Party may keep copies of all Confidential Information within its ordinary legal archives (including IT back-up systems). Within [***] ([***]) days after the date of expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall furnish the Disclosing Party with a certificate, duly executed by an officer of the Receiving Party, confirming that the Receiving Party has complied with its obligations under this Section 11.4.",

Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, the Receiving Party shall cease all use of and return to the Disclosing Party, or destroy, as the Disclosing Party shall specify in writing at their later convenience, all materials transferred pursuant to Section 11.4 and all copies of all documents and other materials that contain or embody any of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, without exception. The Receiving Party is not required to confirm that such destruction has taken place.",
                "explanation": "This change undermines the obligation to properly handle confidential information upon termination.

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date the Parties will enter into the Pharmacovigilance Agreement, setting forth guidelines and procedures for the receipt, investigation, recording, review, post-marketing surveillance, communication, reporting and exchange between the Parties of adverse event reports, technical complaints and any other information concerning the safety of the Licensed Products.",
                "changed_text": "Within one hundred eighty (180) days of the Effective Date the Parties will enter into the Pharmacovigilance Agreement, setting forth guidelines and procedures for the receipt, investigation, recording, review, post-marketing surveillance, communication, reporting and exchange between the Parties of adverse event reports, technical complaints and any other information concerning the safety of the Licensed Products.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates the establishment of a pharmacovigilance agreement within 90 days. Increasing this timeline to 180 days introduces non-compliance because regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, often expect these agreements to be in place much sooner to ensure patient safety and efficient reporting of adverse events. The delay can lead to potential regulatory issues.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Part 314 (FDA regulations regarding post-marketing safety reporting) and similar global regulations.",

                "original_text": "Vyera shall pay all amounts due to CytoDyn with respect to Net Sales by Vyera or its Affiliates for such Calendar Quarter at the time of the submission of such quarterly report.",
                "changed_text": "Vyera shall pay all amounts due to CytoDyn with respect to Net Sales by Vyera or its Affiliates for such Calendar Quarter within 90 days of the submission of such quarterly report.",
                "explanation": "The original contract language mandates payment at the time of the quarterly report submission. Modifying this to allow payment within 90 days contradicts standard business practices and potentially violates laws related to timely payments and contract performance. Such delays can lead to financial discrepancies and legal disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract principles; potential violation of state-specific prompt payment laws if such laws mandate shorter payment periods.",

                "original_text": "Upon reasonable prior notice, but not more than once per Calendar Year, such records of Vyera and its Affiliates shall be available during Vyera's and its Affiliates regular business hours for a period of three (3) years from the end of the Calendar Year to which they pertain for examination at the expense of CytoDyn by an independent certified public accountant selected by CytoDyn and reasonably acceptable to Vyera, for the sole purpose of verifying the accuracy of the financial reports and correctness of the payments furnished by Vyera pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Upon reasonable prior notice, but not more than once every five Calendar Years, such records of Vyera and its Affiliates shall be available during Vyera's and its Affiliates regular business hours for a period of one (1) year from the end of the Calendar Year to which they pertain for examination at the expense of CytoDyn by an independent certified public accountant selected by CytoDyn and reasonably acceptable to Vyera, for the sole purpose of verifying the accuracy of the financial reports and correctness of the payments furnished by Vyera pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original provision allows annual audits of financial records for three years. Reducing the audit frequency to once every five years and the record availability to one year significantly limits CytoDyn's ability to verify financial accuracy and compliance. This contradicts generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) which emphasize regular and thorough audits, and may violate laws or regulations requiring adequate financial oversight.",
                "contradicted_law": "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and potential violations of securities regulations requiring accurate financial reporting.",

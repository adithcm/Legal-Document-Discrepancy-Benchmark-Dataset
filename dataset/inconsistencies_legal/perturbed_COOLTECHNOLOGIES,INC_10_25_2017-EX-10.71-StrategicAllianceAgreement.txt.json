This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive one year periods unless either party gives written notice of termination to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of expiration.",

This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive one year periods unless either party gives written notice of termination to the other party at least ten (10) days prior to the date of expiration.",
                "explanation": "The modification shortens the required notice period for termination from 30 days to 10 days. This contradicts standard contract law principles that require reasonable notice for termination, which often exceed 10 days, especially for agreements of this nature and duration (5 years). In many jurisdictions, a 10-day notice period may be deemed unconscionably short, making the termination clause unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The original text included a six-month non-solicitation clause, which is fairly standard. The modified text extends this period to two years. Depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the employees' roles, a two-year non-solicitation clause might be deemed overly broad and unenforceable as an unreasonable restraint of trade. California, for example, generally disfavors non-solicitation agreements. Even in states where they are permitted, the length and scope must be reasonable.",

                "original_text": "Each of VET TECH and COOL TECH agrees to give the other prompt written notice of any claim or other matter as to which it believes this indemnification provision is applicable. The indemnifying party shall have the right to defend against any such claim with counsel of its own choosing and to settle and/or compromise such claim as it deems appropriate.

The indemnifying party shall have the right to defend against any such claim with counsel of its own choosing and to settle and/or compromise such claim as it deems appropriate. Each party further agrees to cooperate with the other in the defense of any such claim or other matter.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement specified that \"prompt written notice\" would be provided in the event of a claim for indemnification. The modification introduces a specific timeframe of 180 days. While seemingly concrete, this change may contradict the legal requirements related to the statute of limitations in Missouri (the governing law as stated in the agreement). For instance, contract disputes in Missouri typically have a statute of limitations of 5 years. Mandating notice within 180 days could effectively limit the ability to claim indemnification even when the full statute of limitations period has not expired, potentially rendering the indemnification provision less effective than intended and creating a conflict with the legal timeframe for pursuing contractual remedies.",

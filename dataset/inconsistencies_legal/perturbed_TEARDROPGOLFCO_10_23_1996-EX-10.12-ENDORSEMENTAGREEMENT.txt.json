All other Tournament Bonuses due to Consolidated Artists shall be paid by TPC within thirty (30) days following TPC's receipt of an invoice from Consolidated Artists or Advantage.",

                "explanation": "The modified text extends the payment deadlines for tournament bonuses beyond a reasonable timeframe. Delayed payment conflicts with general contract law principles requiring timely compensation for services rendered and may violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing. Specifically, unreasonably delaying payments can cause financial harm and is not an accepted business practice, particularly for high-profile endorsements.",

                "explanation": "Extending the payment deadline for Money List Bonuses to seventy-five (75) days after invoice receipt increases the risk of delayed compensation and can be interpreted as a breach of contract. This delay is particularly concerning because the Money List Bonus is directly tied to Ogle's performance and ranking, making timely payment even more critical. Such an extended delay could be considered unreasonable and potentially violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

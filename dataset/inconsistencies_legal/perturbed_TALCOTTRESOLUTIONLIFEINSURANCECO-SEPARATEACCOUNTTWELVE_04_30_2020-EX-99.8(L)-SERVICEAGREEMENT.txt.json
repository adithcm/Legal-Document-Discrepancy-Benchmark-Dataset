                "original_text": "The Trust agrees to sell to the Administrator those shares of the Funds which the Administrator orders on behalf of any Separate Account, executing such orders on a daily basis at the net asset value next computed after receipt and acceptance by the Fund or its designee of such order. Receipt by such designee shall constitute receipt by the Fund; provided that the Fund receives notice of such order via the National Securities Clearing Corporation (the \"NSCC\") by 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the next following Business Day. The Fund will receive all orders to purchase Fund shares using the NSCC's Defined Contribution Clearance & Settlement (\"DCC&S\") platform. The Fund will also provide the Administrator with account positions and activity data using the NSCC's Networking platform. The Administrator shall pay for Fund shares by the scheduled close of federal funds transmissions on the same Business Day it places an order to purchase Fund shares in accordance with this section using the NSCC's Fund/SERV System. Payment shall be in federal funds transmitted by wire from the Fund's designated Settling Bank to the NSCC. \"Business Day\" shall any day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on which the Fund calculates it net asset value pursuant to the rules of the SEC.",

Receipt by such designee shall constitute receipt by the Fund; provided that the Fund receives notice of such order via the National Securities Clearing Corporation (the \"NSCC\") by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time three Business Days after the order date. The Fund will receive all orders to purchase Fund shares using the NSCC's Defined Contribution Clearance & Settlement (\"DCC&S\") platform. The Fund will also provide the Administrator with account positions and activity data using the NSCC's Networking platform. The Administrator shall pay for Fund shares five Business Days after it places an order to purchase Fund shares in accordance with this section using the NSCC's Fund/SERV System.

                "explanation": "The change in notification and payment deadlines introduces non-compliance. Extending the notification period to 5:00 p.m. three business days after the order date and payment to five business days after the order date is a significant departure from standard practices and could violate SEC regulations regarding timely transaction processing and settlement, thus causing delays in processing the orders.",

                "explanation": "Delaying payment for fund shares redeemed until ten business days after notification contradicts standard and legally required settlement times for fund redemptions.

                "explanation": "Reducing the advance notice period for termination to 15 days and the cure period for a material breach to two days may conflict with standards for reasonable notice and cure periods in contracts, especially those involving complex financial services. Such short periods could be deemed unconscionable or commercially unreasonable under contract law, particularly if they prejudice one party's ability to transition services or remedy a breach. In certain industries or jurisdictions, a longer notice period (e.g., 30-90 days) might be legally expected.",

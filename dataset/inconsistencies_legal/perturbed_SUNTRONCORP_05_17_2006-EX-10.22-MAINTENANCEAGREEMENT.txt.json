For purposes of this Section 19, the term \"Release Date\" shall mean the date which is five (5) days after the date on which the Agent has received all documentation and other information reasonably necessary to determine that all of the foregoing conditions have been satisfied and has confirmed such satisfaction to the Borrowers in writing.",

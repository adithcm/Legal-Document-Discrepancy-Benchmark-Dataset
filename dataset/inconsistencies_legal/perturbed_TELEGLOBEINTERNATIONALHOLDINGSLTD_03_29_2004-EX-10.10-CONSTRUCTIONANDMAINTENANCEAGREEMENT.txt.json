The Party rendering an invoice shall furnish such further details of such invoice as the other Parties may reasonably require. On the basis of such invoices, the CBP shall pay such amounts as may be owed sixty (60) days from the 10th calendar day of the month in which the invoice was rendered or on the following working day if day sixty (60) is not a working day in the CBP's Country.",

                "explanation": "The change extends the payment period from 60 days to 120 days. Delayed payment terms could violate prompt payment laws in certain jurisdictions (e.g., California Business and Professions Code) if the extended timeframe is deemed unreasonable or creates undue hardship for the invoicing party. There is no specific law being violated here, but creates potential risk and liability.",

                "explanation": "The contract mandates that overdue payments will incur a 500% charge on top of the rates described in the subparagraph. This is an issue because there are usury laws, which places a limit on the amount of interest to be charged. It is illegal to charge above that rate, and because of that, this may become legally challenged.",

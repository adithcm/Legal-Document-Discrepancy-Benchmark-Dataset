Heritage agrees to do so within [***] of Heritage or Jasper receiving the Report or of sending the response as appropriate.",

Heritage agrees to do so within 90 days of Heritage or Jasper receiving the Report or of sending the response as appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction because it extends the timeframe for Heritage to provide FDA reports to Premier to 90 days. FDA regulations and GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) typically require prompt and timely reporting of significant findings, often within a much shorter timeframe (e.g., within days or weeks), to ensure swift corrective actions and prevent potential health hazards. Delaying the report for 90 days could be considered a failure to comply with regulatory requirements for timely communication and corrective action.",

For Product produced at Heritage facilities, Heritage shall invoice Premier on the date the Products are loaded onto Premier's carrier. Payment terms for all these Product invoices shall be [***]. Failure by Premier to meet payment terms of any invoice shall result in interest being imposed on any unpaid balance at the rate of [***] per month, pro rata on a daily basis for partial months, accrued from its due date or in the event such rate exceeds that permitted to be charged by law, the maximum rate permitted by law.",
                "changed_text": "Payment terms for these Product invoices shall be 180 days. For Product produced at Heritage facilities, Heritage shall invoice Premier on the date the Products are loaded onto Premier's carrier. Payment terms for all these Product invoices shall be 180 days. Failure by Premier to meet payment terms of any invoice shall result in interest being imposed on any unpaid balance at the rate of 25% per month, pro rata on a daily basis for partial months, accrued from its due date or in the event such rate exceeds that permitted to be charged by law, the maximum rate permitted by law.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces two legal contradictions. First, extending payment terms to 180 days may violate prompt payment laws in some states, which require businesses to pay their suppliers within a reasonable timeframe (often 30-60 days). Second, imposing an interest rate of 25% per month (300% annually) significantly exceeds usury laws, which set legal limits on interest rates to prevent predatory lending practices. California usury laws limit interest rates for non-exempt transactions.",

                "explanation": "The modified text reduces the written notice period for insurance cancellation or change to 5 days. Standard insurance policies and state regulations typically require insurers to provide at least 30 days' notice of cancellation or significant changes to coverage to allow the insured party adequate time to secure alternative coverage. California law usually requires a minimum of 10-30 days' notice, depending on the policy type and reason for cancellation. The 5-day notice period is insufficient and could leave Premier without adequate insurance coverage, violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing. Additionally, extending the time to provide such certificate to 60 days after the agreement is created could cause issues with confirming that the company has insurance at all.",

                "original_text": "3.1.3 Aucta shall provide to ETON all regulatory and compliance-related documents and correspondence with the FDA within five (5) Business Days after submission or receipt of such documents or correspondence with the FDA relating to the Products or Dossiers for the Products, including without limitation any oral (notes thereof) and written correspondence with FDA relating to the Products or Dossiers and any compliance-related oral (notes thereof) or written correspondence with FDA relating to the Product(s)' manufacturing facility(ies)' status or deficiencies.",

                "explanation": "The change from five (5) business days to one (1) business day to provide regulatory and compliance-related documents and correspondence with the FDA could be considered an unreasonably short time frame, potentially violating regulations or guidelines that implicitly require a 'reasonable time' for such actions. While no specific law mandates the exact timeframe, such a short period may make it difficult for Aucta to comply, potentially leading to breaches and disputes.",

If either Party shall learn of (a) any claim or assertion that the manufacture, use or marketing of the Product under this Agreement, or any other action taken by either party in performance of its obligations hereunder infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights of any Third Party, or (b) the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or other violation by any Third Party of the intellectual property rights of any party that are the subject of this Agreement (\"Intellectual Rights Suits\"), then the Party becoming so informed shall as soon as reasonably practicable, but in all events within three (3) Business Days thereafter (the \"Infringement Notification Date\"), notify the other Party of such claim or assertion, or actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or other violation.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the 'three (3) Business Days' deadline to notify the other party of any infringement creates uncertainty and contradicts standard practices for intellectual property protection. The addition of 'when such notification is deemed appropriate' introduces subjectivity, potentially violating legal requirements or best practices that necessitate prompt action to preserve IP rights.",

There is no cure period.",
                "explanation": "Eliminating the cure period violates the principles of contract law, which generally allow a reasonable time for a breaching party to remedy the breach. By making the termination effective immediately, the change introduces a potential violation of good faith and fair dealing, especially if the breach is minor or easily curable.",

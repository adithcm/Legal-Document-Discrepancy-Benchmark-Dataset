                "original_text": "The Suppliers shall notify the Company of acceptance or rejection of a [***]within [***]hours of receipt of a [***]. Failure of the Suppliers to accept or reject a [***]within [***]hours shall constitute acceptance of such [***].",
                "changed_text": "The Suppliers shall notify the Company of acceptance or rejection of a [***] within 4 hours of receipt of a [***]. Failure of the Suppliers to accept or reject a [***] within 4 hours shall constitute acceptance of such [***].",
                "explanation": "Reducing the acceptance/rejection timeframe for purchase orders to 4 hours may be deemed commercially unreasonable and could contradict the general principles of contract law, especially under the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), which emphasizes reasonable timeframes for acceptance. Furthermore, depending on the complexity of the products, providing only 4 hours could contradict good faith business practices.",

                "explanation": "Extending the payment terms to 120 days could violate prompt payment laws or regulations in certain jurisdictions (e.g., if Taiwan law applies to PDMC or Chinese law applies to Xiamen), which often mandate shorter payment periods, especially for businesses dealing with smaller suppliers. This delay could also be considered an unfair trade practice.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to just 10 days might be considered unreasonable, especially considering the complexities of an outsourcing agreement. Some jurisdictions may require a longer cure period to ensure fair business practices and to allow the breaching party adequate time to rectify the issue, particularly if the breach involves complex technical or operational challenges.",

                "original_text": "Commissions on premiums shall be paid to the Agency within 30 business days of the month in which such premiums are received and recorded by MICOA, subject to deduction by MICOA of any return commissions due from the Agency.",
                "changed_text": "Commissions on premiums shall be paid to the Agency within 90 business days of the month in which such premiums are received and recorded by MICOA, subject to deduction by MICOA of any return commissions due from the Agency.",
                "explanation": "Nevada law requires timely payment of commissions. Extending the payment timeframe to 90 business days could be considered an unreasonable delay, especially if it negatively affects the agent's financial stability, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason, MICOA agrees to purchase from Agency, and Agency agrees to sell to MICOA Agency's ownership interest in the expirations for the MICOA insurance issued pursuant to this Agreement. The purchase price shall be two times Agency's commissions on business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be completed within 60 calendar days after the termination date. In return for this payment, for a two-year period following the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason, MICOA agrees to purchase from Agency, and Agency agrees to sell to MICOA Agency's ownership interest in the expirations for the MICOA insurance issued pursuant to this Agreement. The purchase price shall be one-half times Agency's commissions on business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be completed within 180 calendar days after the termination date. In return for this payment, for a one-year period following the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modification lowers the purchase price and lengthens the purchase completion timeframe, while reducing the non-compete duration. The reduced purchase price may be considered unconscionable or a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, potentially violating Nevada contract law, especially if it significantly undervalues the agency's book of business. Moreover, the extended purchase completion timeframe could unreasonably delay the agent's receipt of funds, causing financial harm. While shortening the non-compete period might seem beneficial, combining it with a significantly lower purchase price could be seen as an attempt to unfairly exploit the agency's assets upon termination.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall terminate, subject to any automatic renewal or extension for one year as required by law, upon either party giving at least one hundred twenty (120) days advance written notice to the other, if not otherwise contrary to applicable law or this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall terminate, subject to any automatic renewal or extension for one year as required by law, upon either party giving at least thirty (30) days advance written notice to the other, if not otherwise contrary to applicable law or this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 30 days could be deemed unreasonable and potentially violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Nevada law. A shorter notice period may not provide sufficient time for the agency to secure alternative representation or for MICOA to transition its business, leading to potential disruption and financial harm. This is especially true given the existing relationship and the need to protect the interests of insured parties during the transition.",

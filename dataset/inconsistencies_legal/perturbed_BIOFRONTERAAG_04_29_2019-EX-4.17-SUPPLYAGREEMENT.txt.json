                "original_text": "2.6.1 All Products shall be submitted to inspection and evaluation by or on behalf of CUTANEA to determine whether or not said Products meet the Specifications. CUTANEA will provide in good faith written acceptance of a batch of Product or written notification of any deficiencies within two (2) Business Days after receipt of the Certificate of Analysis for the Product batch. Written acceptance of a batch of the applicable Product is required as a condition to the delivery of Product to Cutanea's designated shipping agent in accordance with Section 3. If for any reason Supplier does not receive any such notification within such two (2) Business Day period, Supplier will promptly notify CUTANEA of such fact and CUTANEA will as soon as practicable and, in any event within another two (2) Business Days thereafter provide such written notice to Supplier and be responsible for any storage or similar charges that Supplier may incur for not delivering such Product. The lack of reception of such written acceptance within the second two (2) Business Day period shall be deemed as the batch is accepted. If, once the Product is delivered, CUTANEA determines that there is any deficiency with respect to any Product, CUTANEA will notify Ferrer of such claim within fifteen (15) Business Days of delivery of the Products. Each such notice of rejection to Supplier shall specify in reasonable detail the ways in which the Product batch failed to meet Specifications.",

                "explanation": "Shortening the inspection and deficiency notification periods to one and five business days respectively may be unreasonably short, potentially violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, as Cutanea may not have sufficient time to thoroughly inspect the Products. This is particularly relevant in New York, where the UCC applies, and the 'reasonable time' for inspection is a key consideration.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to ten calendar days may be deemed unreasonably short, especially for complex breaches, potentially violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.

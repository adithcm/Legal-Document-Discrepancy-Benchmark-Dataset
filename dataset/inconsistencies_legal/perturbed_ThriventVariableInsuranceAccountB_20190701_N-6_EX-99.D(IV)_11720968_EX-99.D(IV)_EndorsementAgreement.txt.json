                "original_text": "If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "If you do not make the extra payment within 15 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the payment period for deficiency shares to 15 days creates an unreasonably short timeframe that could be deemed unconscionable or violate fair business practices, especially considering the complexity members might face in assessing the deficiency and arranging payment. This timeframe may be deemed legally insufficient for providing adequate due process or opportunity to respond to the assessment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state laws regarding fair business practices, consumer protection, and unconscionable contract terms.",

                "changed_text": "You may transfer ownership of this contract only with the Society's explicit and discretionary approval. Society membership rights and privileges cannot be transferred or assigned.",
                "explanation": "Adding the requirement for the 'Society's explicit and discretionary approval' places an undue restriction on the transfer of ownership. This could be seen as an unreasonable restraint on alienation, potentially conflicting with established property rights and state laws governing contract transfers.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state laws regarding property rights and freedom of contract.",

                "original_text": "Each year, we will determine our divisible surplus. This contract's share, if any, will be credited as a dividend. Since we do not expect this contract to contribute to divisible surplus, it is not expected that any dividends will be credited.",
                "changed_text": "We may or may not determine our divisible surplus at our sole discretion. Whether this contract's share will be credited as a dividend will be determined by the Society.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Each year, we will determine...' to 'We may or may not determine...' creates uncertainty around the calculation and distribution of divisible surplus, which weakens the rights of the contract holder to receive potential dividends. Adding that is at the discretion of the Society allows the potential to deny or delay dividends without clear justification or reason, which could potentially violate equitable distribution principles in insurance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state insurance regulations regarding equitable distribution of surplus and transparency in dividend calculations.",

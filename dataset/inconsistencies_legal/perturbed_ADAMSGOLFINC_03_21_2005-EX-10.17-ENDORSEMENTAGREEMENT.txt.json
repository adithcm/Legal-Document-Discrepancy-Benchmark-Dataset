                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within ninety (90) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.",
                "changed_text": "ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within thirty (30) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.",
                "explanation": "This change shortens the timeframe within which Adams Golf can exercise its right to terminate the agreement due to the consultant's behavior. This could be problematic because some legal frameworks require a more reasonable timeframe to allow for proper investigation and decision-making, especially in cases of serious misconduct, moral turpitude, or legal violations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding reasonable notice and opportunity to cure, potentially conflicting with standards of fairness and due process.",

                "original_text": "Prior to publishing or placing any advertising or promotional material which uses CONSULTANT'S name, facsimile signature, nickname, voice or likeness, ADAMS GOLF shall submit the same to CONSULTANT, or CONSULTANT'S designee, for approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If CONSULTANT disapproves, the reasons therefore shall be given to ADAMS GOLF in writing within three (3) business days or shall be deemed approved.",
                "changed_text": "Prior to publishing or placing any advertising or promotional material which uses CONSULTANT'S name, facsimile signature, nickname, voice or likeness, ADAMS GOLF shall submit the same to CONSULTANT, or CONSULTANT'S designee, for approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If CONSULTANT disapproves, the reasons therefore shall be given to ADAMS GOLF in writing within one (1) business day or shall be deemed approved.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the approval timeframe for advertising materials to one business day puts undue pressure on the consultant. This timeframe may be insufficient to reasonably review complex materials, particularly considering the consultant's other obligations and travel schedules, thus potentially infringing on their right to reasonable review and approval.",

                "original_text": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving five (5) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such five (5) day period.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for breach rectification to five days may be deemed unreasonably short, particularly for complex breaches that require more time to investigate and resolve. This violates principles of fair notice and opportunity to cure, potentially leading to wrongful termination claims.",

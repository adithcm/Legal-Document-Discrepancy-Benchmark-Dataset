                "original_text": "Following the completion of such maintenance term, Bankers Bank may, at its option, renew maintenance for subsequent periods of one (1) year each, subject to adjustments proposed by Netzee not to exceed 5% at least sixty (60) days in advance of the applicable renewal date.",
                "changed_text": "Following the completion of such maintenance term, Bankers Bank may, at its option, renew maintenance for subsequent periods of one (1) year each, subject to adjustments proposed by Netzee not to exceed 5% at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the applicable renewal date.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for renewal adjustments to 15 days may be deemed unreasonable, especially considering that the agreement applies to banking services. Courts often require reasonable notice periods for contract changes, and 15 days is unlikely.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the call-in support hours from 5x12 to 5x8 constitutes a significant reduction in the service provided. This could be a contradiction, depending on banking regulations around service support, but it is likely a breach of contract.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the uptime guarantee from 99% to 90% significantly decreases the reliability of the service. If banking regulations or industry standards require a higher level of uptime for critical systems, this change would violate those requirements.",

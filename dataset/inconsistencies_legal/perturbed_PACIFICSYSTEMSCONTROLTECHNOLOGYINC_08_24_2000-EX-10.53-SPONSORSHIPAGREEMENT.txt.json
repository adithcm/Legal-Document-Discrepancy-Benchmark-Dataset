                "original_text": "For the above sponsorship components, the Sponsor agrees to pay ACM a total amount of US$400,000.00.  The amount is payable 180 days from the date of the Event.",
                "changed_text": "For the above sponsorship components, the Sponsor agrees to pay ACM a total amount of US$400,000.00. The amount is payable 365 days from the date of the Event.",
                "explanation": "California law, which governs this agreement, generally favors prompt payment, especially in commercial transactions. Extending the payment term to 365 days (approximately one year) without reasonable justification could be considered an unreasonably long delay. While not a directly illegal act, such an extended payment term could be challenged as unconscionable or violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under California contract law, especially if it places undue hardship on ACM.",

                "changed_text": "Display materials from the Sponsor must be delivered to the Tian He Stadium at least one day prior to the event.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the delivery time to one day before the event might be insufficient for ACM to adequately review and approve the display materials, potentially leading to breaches of copyright or trademark laws if the materials infringe on ACM's or other parties' intellectual property rights. California law requires due diligence in protecting intellectual property, and this shortened timeframe could be seen as a failure to exercise such diligence, especially considering ACM's approval is required per section 4.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of a dispute, the parties may, at their sole discretion, consider mediation at a location determined by the prevailing party.",
                "explanation": "California law favors mandatory mediation clauses. By making mediation discretionary and allowing the prevailing party to choose the location, the modified clause undermines the spirit of good faith dispute resolution encouraged by California courts. This could be interpreted as an attempt to deter the weaker party from pursuing legitimate claims, conflicting with the principle of fairness in contractual relationships under California law.",

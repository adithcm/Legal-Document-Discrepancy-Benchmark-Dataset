                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a breach of contract to one business day is unreasonable and potentially contradicts the PRC Contract Law, which requires a reasonable period to remedy breaches, depending on the nature and circumstances of the breach. One day may not provide sufficient time for the breaching party to take corrective action, potentially leading to premature termination of the agreement.",

In the event that such dispute is not resolved within five (5) Business Days following such notice,\neither Party may upon the expiration of the such 5-day notice period submit such dispute to arbitration by the Hong Kong International\nArbitration Centre in accordance with the arbitration rules of such centre then in effect.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the negotiation period for dispute resolution to five business days is arguably insufficient under general principles of PRC law, which emphasizes good faith negotiation and reasonable timeframes for resolving disputes. Depending on the complexity of the dispute, five days may not allow parties enough time to thoroughly investigate, negotiate, and potentially reach a settlement, potentially conflicting with legal expectations for dispute resolution processes.",

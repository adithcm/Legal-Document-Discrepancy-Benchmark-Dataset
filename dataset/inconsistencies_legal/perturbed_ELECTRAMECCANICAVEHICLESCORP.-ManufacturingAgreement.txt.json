                "original_text": "EMV has the right to examine the goods on arrival and has Fifteen (15) business days to notify Manufacturer of any claim for damages on account of the condition, grade or quality of the goods, or non-conformity to the Specifications. The notice must set forth the basis of the claim in reasonable detail. EMV acknowledges that failure to notify Manufacturer of a claim within specified period in reasonable detail shall constitute acceptance of the goods.",
                "changed_text": "EMV has the right to examine the goods on arrival and has Five (5) business days to notify Manufacturer of any claim for damages on account of the condition, grade or quality of the goods, or non-conformity to the Specifications. The notice must set forth the basis of the claim in reasonable detail. EMV acknowledges that failure to notify Manufacturer of a claim within specified period in reasonable detail shall constitute acceptance of the goods.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the claim notification period to 5 business days may be unreasonably short, especially for complex manufacturing defects, and can potentially conflict with the implied warranty of merchantability under the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), which may grant a reasonable time for inspection and notification depending on the nature of the goods and defect. Some jurisdictions interpret 'reasonable time' to be longer than 5 days for complex products.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 30 days may be deemed unreasonably short, especially for complex manufacturing agreements. Some jurisdictions or legal principles, such as good faith and fair dealing, might require a longer, more reasonable period to remedy significant breaches, potentially conflicting with the contract's termination clause.",

                "explanation": "Extending the deemed receipt time for notices to 15 business days could violate the principle of reasonableness, especially in contracts requiring timely actions.

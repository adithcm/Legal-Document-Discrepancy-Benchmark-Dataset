                "original_text": "PSS agrees that it will publish such results as promptly as practicable following the Merger in the sole discretion of PSS, but in any event within 45 days after the end of the first fiscal quarter of PSS containing the required period of post-Merger combined operations and that it will notify the undersigned promptly following such publication.",
                "changed_text": "PSS agrees that it will publish such results at its convenience with no set deadline following the Merger and will notify the undersigned at its convenience, if at all.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the specific deadline (45 days after the end of the first fiscal quarter) for publishing financial results, giving PSS complete discretion over the timing and potentially delaying or avoiding publication altogether. This conflicts with SEC regulations requiring timely and accurate financial reporting.",
                "contradicted_law": "SEC regulations regarding timely financial reporting, specifically related to post-merger combined operations.",

                "changed_text": "PSS is not obligated to file any reports after the effective date of the Merger. The filing of any report is at the sole discretion of PSS.",
                "explanation": "This modification eliminates PSS's obligation to file reports required under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, contradicting securities laws which mandate regular financial disclosures by public companies. It affects the affiliate's ability to sell shares under Rule 145(d).",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned further recognizes that any sale of PSS Common Stock is permissible at any time following the effective time of the Merger regardless of whether the undersigned is a director or officer of PSS.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 'short-swing profit rule'), which prevents insiders (directors, officers, and beneficial owners) from profiting from purchases and sales of their company's stock within a six-month period. The modified text suggests that such sales are permissible regardless of the insider status or the holding period, directly violating federal securities law.",

                "original_text": "In the event that the Company desires to terminate the Agreement prior to the Termination Date, it shall provide AGI with at least 60 days prior written notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement and this Agreement shall so terminate following the expiration of this 60-day period, without any further responsibility by either Party except as provided in Section 5.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that the Company desires to terminate the Agreement prior to the Termination Date, it shall provide AGI with at least 10 days prior written notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement and this Agreement shall so terminate following the expiration of this 10-day period, without any further responsibility by either Party except as provided in Section 5.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 10 days may be problematic because standard commercial contracts often have requirements for reasonable notice. A notice period this short may be deemed unreasonable in certain jurisdictions, particularly if AGI needs a longer period to find a replacement endorsement partner.",

                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time in the event of a material breach by the other Party with no written notice required.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for written notice and a cure period before termination due to material breach contradicts fundamental principles of contract law. Most jurisdictions require that a party be given notice of a breach and an opportunity to cure it before the contract can be terminated.",

                "original_text": "AGI shall thereafter have three business days within which to submit its editions or amendments to the public announcement and/or description for inclusion therein, and the Company shall in its reasonable judgment and subject to the advice of its counsel attempt to incorporate such editions and amendments in the final version disseminated by the Company.",
                "changed_text": "AGI shall thereafter have one business day within which to submit its editions or amendments to the public announcement and/or description for inclusion therein, and the Company has no obligation to incorporate such editions and amendments in the final version disseminated by the Company.",
                "explanation": "Reducing AGI's review period to one business day puts significant pressure on AGI, making it difficult for them to adequately assess and respond to the public announcement. Removing the obligation for the Company to incorporate AGI's feedback effectively silences AGI's input and shifts control entirely to the Company.",

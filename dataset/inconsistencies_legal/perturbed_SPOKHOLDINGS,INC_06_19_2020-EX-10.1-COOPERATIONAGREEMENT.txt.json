                "changed_text": "The White Hat Parties shall provide written evidence of the votes made in accordance with the foregoing sentence to the Company no later than two business days before the 2020 Annual Meeting.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time for providing written evidence of votes to two business days before the annual meeting may be insufficient to allow the company adequate time to verify the votes and prepare for the meeting. This timeframe is unreasonably short and could be challenged.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with Delaware law regarding reasonable notice and shareholder rights, although not a direct violation, it creates grounds for challenge based on insufficient time for verification and preparation.",

The White Hat Parties agree that they shall not issue a press release regarding the subject matter of this Agreement for a period of three (3) months after the date of this Agreement.",

The White Hat Parties agree that they shall not issue a press release regarding the subject matter of this Agreement for a period of one (1) year after the date of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Extending the restriction on the White Hat Parties from issuing a press release to one year may be deemed an unreasonable restraint on their ability to communicate with their investors and the public. This could be considered an unreasonable restriction on free speech and access to information.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the reimbursement cap to $10,000 may be deemed insufficient to cover the White Hat Parties' reasonable expenses, particularly legal fees. This might be considered a breach of contract if the actual reasonable expenses demonstrably exceed this amount, as the original agreement implied reasonable reimbursement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with contract law principles regarding good faith and fair dealing, particularly if the actual expenses incurred were substantially greater than the capped amount and the company was aware of this likely outcome.",

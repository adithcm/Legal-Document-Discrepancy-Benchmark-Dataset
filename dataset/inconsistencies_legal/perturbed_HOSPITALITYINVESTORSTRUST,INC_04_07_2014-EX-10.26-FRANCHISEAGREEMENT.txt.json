                "explanation": "This change reduces the cure period for general defaults to fifteen days. State laws often mandate a longer cure period for franchisees to rectify breaches, which could invalidate the shorter contractual timeframe.",

Notices under this Agreement must be in writing and must be delivered in person, by prepaid overnight commercial delivery service, or by prepaid overnight mail, registered or certified, with return-receipt requested. Notices to us must be sent to 7930 Jones Branch Drive, Suite 1100, McLean, VA 22102, ATTN: General Counsel. We will send notices to your address set forth in the Addendum. If you want to change the name or address for notice to you, you must do so in writing, signed by you or your duly authorized representative, designating a single address for notice, which may not be a P.O. Box, in compliance with this Subsection. Notice will be deemed effective on the earlier of: 1) receipt or first refusal of delivery; 2) one (1) day after posting if sent via overnight commercial delivery service or overnight United States Mail; or 3) three (3) days after placement in the United States mail if overnight delivery is not available to the notice address.",

Notices to us must be sent to our designated email address. We will send notices to your email address set forth in the Addendum. Notice will be deemed effective immediately upon sending the email.",
                "explanation": "This modification changes the required method of delivering notice from physical to electronic, and eliminates the requirement for confirmation of receipt. This conflicts with statutes of frauds which require written notice for legally binding changes. Further, the reduction of notice periods to 'immediately upon sending' may violate requirements for adequate notice in business dealings.",

                "original_text": "The Customer is responsible for paying i-on the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450. The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",

The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 25th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees after 2 days will result in the immediate interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
                "explanation": "Florida Statute 83.060 states that a landlord (i-on, in this case providing a service) must provide a 3-day notice before interrupting services. Shortening the grace period to 2 days before interruption contradicts this statute.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the non-renewal notice period to five (5) days may be deemed unconscionable in Florida, particularly if the customer is a small business with limited legal resources. While there isn't a specific statute mandating a specific notice period in this type of service agreement, courts often consider reasonableness, and five days is potentially too short, especially considering the complexities involved in transitioning web hosting services.",

                "explanation": "While Florida law permits termination clauses, reducing the notice period for termination without cause to ten (10) days may be deemed unreasonable, particularly if the other party would suffer significant damages because of such short notice. A short time may create an undue burden for the Customer to migrate their website on time. Contract law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which this change may violate.",

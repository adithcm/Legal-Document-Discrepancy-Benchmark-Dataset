                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for non-renewal to one month may be deemed unreasonable and potentially violate state franchise laws or common law principles requiring adequate notice in contract renewals, particularly for agreements with significant financial implications. States often have specific regulations regarding auto-renewal clauses, demanding clearer and longer notification windows to prevent unfair surprise renewals.",

Upon not less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice and not more than once in any calendar year, Affiliate shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, during the Term and for one (1) year thereafter, to examine during normal business hours the books and records of Network for up to the prior calendar year and the then-current calendar year solely to the extent reasonably necessary to verify the Revenue Share Records.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period to six months and the audit notice period to five days is insufficient for a complex financial relationship.  This timeframe may violate state laws requiring businesses to maintain financial records for a longer duration (e.g., for tax or regulatory purposes).  Furthermore, a five-day notice for an audit is likely unreasonable, hindering Affiliate's ability to adequately prepare and potentially breaching the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "Removing \"forever\" on the last sentence will reduce the protection for individuals, opening a gate for legal actions, and creating confusion on the time limitation of the Non-Recourse clause. Many states protect individuals from company liabilities.",

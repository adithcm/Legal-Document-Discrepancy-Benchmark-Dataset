                "changed_text": "Owner fails to pay when due any amount due and payable hereunder, including, without limitation, any interest, fees, reimbursements or indemnifications, and such failure shall continue for a period of 5 days after the due date thereof; or\n\n(c)     other than as set forth in clause (b) above, Owner breaches or fails to observe or perform any material term, condition, or obligation contained in this Agreement and fails to correct, or fails to diligently pursue correction of, such breach within 10 days after receipt of written notice from Operator of any such breach.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 15-day grace period for payment defaults and a 60-day cure period for other breaches. By reducing these periods to 5 and 10 days respectively, the contract becomes more stringent than what is typically considered reasonable and contradicts standard commercial law practices that allow for reasonable cure periods. This creates a legal contradiction as it may be deemed unconscionable or against public policy to enforce such short timeframes, especially for significant breaches of contract. Louisiana law requires fair and reasonable periods for remedying breaches.",

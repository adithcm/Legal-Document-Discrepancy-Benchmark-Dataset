                "original_text": "All representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall survive the Closing of this Agreement, except that any party to whom a representation or warranty has been made in this Agreement shall be deemed to have waived any misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty of which such party had knowledge prior to Closing. Any party learning of a misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty under this Agreement shall immediately give written notice thereof to all other parties to this Agreement. The representations and warranties in this Agreement shall terminate one year from the Closing Date, and such representations or warranties shall thereafter be without force or effect, except any claim with respect to which notice has been given to the party to be charged prior to such expiration date.",
                "changed_text": "All representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall terminate thirty (30) days from the Closing Date, and such representations or warranties shall thereafter be without force or effect, regardless of any notice given prior to such expiration date. Any party learning of a misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty under this Agreement shall immediately give written notice thereof to all other parties to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modification shortens the survival period of representations and warranties to 30 days. Under Nevada law, the statute of limitations for breach of contract claims can extend beyond one year, especially for written agreements. Limiting the survival of representations and warranties to such a short period could be deemed unconscionable and contradict the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing inherent in Nevada contract law. Additionally, the clause stating that representations and warranties terminate regardless of any notice given removes an important protection for the parties involved.",

All notices, requests, demands, and other communications required or permitted hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when sent by any means, including standard mail without return receipt. The date of sending shall be considered the date of receipt.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the requirement for certified or registered mail with return receipt requested, replacing it with standard mail without tracking. This creates potential disputes regarding whether a notice was actually received, which contradicts the principle of providing adequate notice under contract law. In Nevada, courts generally require evidence of actual or constructive notice. Deeming the sending date as the receipt date, regardless of actual delivery, is also problematic and potentially violates due process.",

However, if any legal action or other proceeding is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement, or because or arising out of an alleged dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and other costs incurred in that action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it or he may be entitled.",

                "explanation": "The modification removes the provision that the prevailing party in a legal dispute is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees. While Nevada law allows parties to agree on attorney's fees provisions, a complete waiver of the right to recover attorney's fees, even in cases of breach or misrepresentation, could be deemed unconscionable if it creates a significant imbalance of power and prevents a party from effectively enforcing their rights under the contract. This is especially true if one party has significantly more resources than the other. Nevada courts have the power to refuse to enforce contract terms deemed unconscionable.",

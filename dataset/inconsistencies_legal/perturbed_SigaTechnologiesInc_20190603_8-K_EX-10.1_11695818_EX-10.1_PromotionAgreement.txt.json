Reports of the results of any such examination (each an \"Audit Report\") will be (a) limited to details of any discrepancies in MMT's records relating to the Product together with an explanation of the discrepancy and the circumstances giving rise to the discrepancy (b) made available to both Parties and (c) subject to ARTICLE 10. An Audit Report shall become final and binding on the Parties thirty (30) days following MMT's receipt thereof, unless MMT delivers written notice of its agreement thereto (in which case such Audit Report shall become final and binding on the date of delivery of such notice of agreement) or written notice of its disagreement thereto (\"Notice of Disagreement\") to SIGA in either case on or prior to such date. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is delivered by MMT to SIGA, then the Audit Report shall become final and binding on the Parties on the earlier of (i) the date MMT and SIGA resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and (ii) the date all matters in dispute are finally resolved in writing by the Independent Auditor. During the thirty (30) days following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, MMT, SIGA and SIGA's Auditor shall seek to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement.

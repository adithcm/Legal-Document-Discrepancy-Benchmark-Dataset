                "original_text": "Before expiration of the Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon: (i) any material breach of the Agreement by the other Party, if such breach is not remedied to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party within ten (10) business days after written notice",
                "changed_text": "Before expiration of the Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon: (i) any material breach of the Agreement by the other Party, if such breach is not remedied to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party within five (5) business days after written notice",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from ten (10) business days to five (5) business days may be considered unreasonable in many jurisdictions, particularly when dealing with complex contractual obligations. This shorter timeframe potentially violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most contracts, as it may not allow the breaching party sufficient time to rectify the issue. Some states might view this as an attempt to unfairly force termination.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for cancellation of an insurance policy to 10 days and notice for non-payment to 5 days violates standard insurance regulations and practices. Most states require insurance companies to provide at least 30 days' notice for cancellation to allow the insured party sufficient time to obtain replacement coverage. A shorter notice period leaves the Association vulnerable to unexpected lapses in coverage, potentially resulting in significant financial losses. Additionally, a 5 day notice for non-payment before policy cancellation goes against industry norms as most allow a 10 day grace period.",

This may violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. It might not provide adequate time to ensure complete removal of the marks from all materials, increasing the risk of unauthorized use. Courts may find this timeframe insufficient and unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor shall pay Company within sixty (60) days of Distributor's or, as the case may be, the end-user's receipt of Products.",
                "explanation": "The change extends the payment term from 30 to 60 days. While not explicitly illegal, this could create conflicts with the Illinois Prompt Payment Act (815 ILCS 505/), which encourages prompt payment to vendors and subcontractors. While this act mainly concerns government contracts, extending payment terms beyond what is commercially reasonable could be challenged, especially if it imposes undue hardship on the Company.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor shall submit written reports to the Company each quarter during the first year of the Term, commencing one hundred eighty (180) days after execution of this Agreement, describing its efforts, the potential customers it has approached and the status of its efforts.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the first report submission to 180 days (6 months) from the original 90 days can be problematic. If the contract is interpreted to have an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing (which is common), significantly delaying required reporting without a valid reason could be seen as a breach. This could impede the Company's ability to monitor the distributor's performance and take corrective action if needed. Therefore, a court may find the distributor is in breach of conduct.",

                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter,  the  Distributor (on behalf of itself,  each of its affiliates and each of their respective representatives) agrees that it will not  directly  or  indirectly  solicit  or  hire  any executive,  managerial  or technical  employee of the Company or any of its affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of thirty-six (36) months thereafter, the Distributor (on behalf of itself, each of its affiliates and each of their respective representatives) agrees that it will not directly or indirectly solicit or hire any executive, managerial or technical employee of the Company or any of its affiliates.",
                "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to 36 months after the agreement's term might be considered an unreasonable restraint of trade under Illinois law, depending on the scope of the restriction and the specific circumstances. Illinois courts scrutinize non-solicitation agreements to ensure they are not overly broad or unduly restrictive, balancing the employer's legitimate business interests against the employee's right to earn a living. A three-year restriction might be deemed excessive, especially for lower-level employees or if the geographic scope is not clearly defined.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Illinois public policy against unreasonable restraints of trade regarding employee non-solicitation agreements.",

                "original_text": "Within 30 days of the end of the Initial Term, and within 30 days of the end of each Renewal Term, both parties hereto shall have the right renegotiate the fee specified below for the use of the vessels. If no such agreement on such fee is reached by such parties by the commencement of a Renewal Term, this Agreement shall automatically terminate.",
                "changed_text": "Within 10 days of the end of the Initial Term, and within 10 days of the end of each Renewal Term, both parties hereto shall have the right renegotiate the fee specified below for the use of the vessels. If no such agreement on such fee is reached by such parties by the commencement of a Renewal Term, this Agreement shall automatically terminate.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the renegotiation period to 10 days creates a potential legal issue if state laws provide for longer negotiation periods or impose requirements for good-faith negotiation, which 10 days may not satisfy. This also could be an issue if the initial term is a long term, because it would not allow the recipient to have an adequate amount of time to renegotiate or find another deal. This creates an unreasonable deadline and thus is unconscionable and unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment term to 60 days from invoice date introduces a potential contradiction. Many jurisdictions have Prompt Payment Acts, which dictate payment timelines, especially in B2B transactions or government contracts. A 60-day payment term could be considered a violation of such acts if they mandate quicker payment timelines, for example, 30 or 45 days.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to 3 days may conflict with legal standards of 'reasonable opportunity to cure' a breach. Depending on the nature of the breach, 3 days might be deemed insufficient, particularly if significant corrective action is needed. This could lead to claims of wrongful termination.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Supplier will, upon request from Purchaser or Playboy, deliver to Purchaser or will destroy in the presence of Purchaser  or its representative(s), all molds, designs or any other elements used in reproducing any or all of the Playboy Properties.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier will, only upon a final, unappealable court order from Purchaser or Playboy, deliver to Purchaser, and at Supplier's sole discretion, all molds, designs or any other elements used in reproducing any or all of the Playboy Properties.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a legal contradiction by unduly restricting Playboy's ability to request the return or destruction of molds and designs, which could impede their intellectual property rights. Requiring a 'final, unappealable court order' adds a burdensome and unnecessary legal hurdle before Playboy can exercise control over its properties, conflicting with standard intellectual property enforcement practices. Furthermore, granting the supplier 'sole discretion' over destruction of materials undermines Playboy's rights.",

                "changed_text": "This Contract may only be modified or terminated verbally, and a handshake from an authorized representative of either the supplier or purchaser is sufficient. No written document or signature is required for any change to be considered binding.",
                "explanation": "This clause directly contradicts the Statute of Frauds, which requires certain contracts, including those involving significant transactions or intellectual property, to be in writing to be enforceable. Eliminating the requirement for written modification or termination creates ambiguity and makes the contract susceptible to disputes and misinterpretations, undermining the enforceability of any changes made to the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT BY SUPPLIER MAY RESULT IN PROSECUTION FOR PLAYBOY PROPERTIES INFRINGEMENT, UNFAIR COMPETITION AND OTHER CAUSES OF ACTION. However, the supplier is not subject to any kind of criminal or monetary penalties.",
                "explanation": "The original clause correctly states that violation may result in prosecution which then may result in fines. The modification removes the imposition of fines, which is a contradiction since violations are subject to monetary penalties. If Playboy is suing the supplier, there could be fines involved.",

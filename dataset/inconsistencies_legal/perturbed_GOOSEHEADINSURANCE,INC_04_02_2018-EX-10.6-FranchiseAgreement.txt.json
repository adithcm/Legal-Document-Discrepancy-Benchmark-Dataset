                "explanation": "The original text requires the franchisee to forward any premiums, policy fees, or agency fees within 24 hours of receipt. By modifying this to 72 hours, it contradicts laws in certain jurisdictions that may require faster remittance, especially when dealing with trust accounts or client funds. Changing the remittance of net revenues to 45 days contradicts the monthly payment schedule.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the opening deadline to three months might contradict laws that grant franchisees a reasonable time to establish their business, considering the complexities involved in site selection, construction, and regulatory compliance. This shorter timeframe introduces non-compliance with standards deemed reasonable under franchise law.",

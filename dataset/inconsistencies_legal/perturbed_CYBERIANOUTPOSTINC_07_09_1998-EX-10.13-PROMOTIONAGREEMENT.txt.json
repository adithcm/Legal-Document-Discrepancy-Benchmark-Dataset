                "original_text": "Within 30 days after the end of each month during the Term, CNET will provide a report to the Company indicating the number of Retail Promotions displayed on the CNET Sites during such month and the number of times that a User clicked on a Retail Promotion during such month. CNET will also provide standard reporting for banner advertisements and television Promotions.",
                "changed_text": "Within 60 days after the end of each quarter during the Term, CNET will provide a report to the Company indicating the number of Retail Promotions displayed on the CNET Sites during such quarter and the number of times that a User clicked on a Retail Promotion during such quarter. CNET will provide reporting for banner advertisements and television Promotions when it deems necessary.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires monthly reporting from CNET to the Company. The modification changes this to quarterly reporting and extends the deadline to 60 days after each quarter's end. This could create a legal issue if California law requires more frequent reporting on advertising metrics or campaign performance, impacting transparency and potentially violating regulations related to marketing and advertising disclosures.",

                "changed_text": "Within 90 days after the end of each year during the Term, the Company will provide a single, unaudited report to CNET indicating the estimated number of referrals from the CNET Sites to the Company Site during such year, and an approximation of revenue attributable to the Online Promotions. The company is under no obligation to specify sales tax, shipping costs, returns and cancellations, and is able to amend the report at any given time without any notification.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates monthly reports from the Company to CNET, providing detailed sales and referral data. The modification changes this to a single annual report, significantly delays the reporting timeline, reduces the level of detail required, removes auditing, and gives company rights to amend the report at any time without notification. This conflicts with standard business practices requiring timely and accurate financial reporting, impacting accountability and transparency.",

                "original_text": "either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving written notice of termination to the other party, if the other party commits a material breach of its obligations hereunder that is not cured within 30 days after notice thereof from the non-breaching party.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows termination for 'material breach' with a 30-day cure period. The modification broadens the termination clause to include any breach, regardless of materiality, and shortens the cure period to 10 days. This introduces non-compliance with general contract law principles, as termination clauses typically require a 'material breach' and provide a reasonable cure period. The shortened timeframe may not allow sufficient time to rectify even minor issues, potentially leading to unfair termination. This can be seen as an unconscionable term that favors one party over the other.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract principles related to material breach and reasonable cure periods, potential violation of California's laws against unconscionable contract terms.",

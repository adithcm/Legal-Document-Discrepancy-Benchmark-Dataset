                "explanation": "Modifying the timeframe for providing adequate assurances of performance from ten (10) days to two (2) days creates a potential inconsistency with Section 2-609 of the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code, which requires a reasonable time to provide adequate assurance. Two days may not be considered a reasonable time, particularly for complex matters, potentially violating the UCC.",

                "explanation": "Shortening the timeframe for providing insurance documentation from ten (10) to five (5) days upon written request and from thirty (30) to fifteen (15) days before policy expiration can be problematic. Depending on the complexity of the insurance requirements and the responsiveness of the insurer, this reduced timeframe may not provide sufficient time to gather and submit the necessary documents, particularly the declaration pages of insurance policy, potentially conflicting with what is considered a reasonable timeframe under general contract law principles.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period for non-trade secret confidential information from sixty (60) months (5 years) to twelve (12) months (1 year) may be insufficient to adequately protect sensitive business information in Illinois. Illinois courts generally enforce confidentiality agreements, but the duration must be reasonable based on the nature of the information and the industry. A one-year period may be deemed unreasonably short for certain types of confidential business data, creating unenforceability issues.",

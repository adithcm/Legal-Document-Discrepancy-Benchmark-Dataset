                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1. General. ABG shall respond to each initial request for Approval from PAPA JOHN'S (\"First Request\") within three (3) days of ABG's receipt of such request (\"Approval Window\"); provided, however that ABG's silence or failure to respond to the First Request prior to the expiration of the Approval Window shall be deemed ABG's disapproval of the Materials contained in the First Request for Approval.",
                "changed_text": "1. General. ABG shall respond to each initial request for Approval from PAPA JOHN'S (\"First Request\") within one (1) day of ABG's receipt of such request (\"Approval Window\"); provided, however that ABG's silence or failure to respond to the First Request prior to the expiration of the Approval Window shall be deemed ABG's disapproval of the Materials contained in the First Request for Approval.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows ABG three days to respond to approval requests. Reducing this to one day could be deemed unreasonable in some jurisdictions (depending on the specific type of approval and the industry), particularly if approval requires significant review, thus contradicting good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts, thus rendering the obligations possibly unenforceable.",

In the event that ABG is silent with respect to, or fails to reply to, the Second Request within three (3) days of ABG's receipt thereof, then ABG's silence with respect to, or failure to respond to, the Second Request shall be deemed ABG's Approval of the Materials included in the Second Request.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the response time for the second approval request to one day places an unreasonable burden on ABG, potentially conflicting with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This is particularly problematic if the materials require legal or technical review that cannot be completed within 24 hours.",

Insurance must be obtained from a company reasonably acceptable to ABG, in an amount not less than Five Million United States Dollars ($5,000,000 USD) in the aggregate, or PAPA JOHN'S standard insurance policy limits, whichever is greater.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the insurance period from three years to one year after the term of the agreement could be deemed insufficient to cover potential liabilities arising from product defects or advertising claims that may surface after the agreement's termination. This is particularly relevant given statutes of limitations for certain claims, which often extend beyond one year. Thus this can be considered gross negligence.",

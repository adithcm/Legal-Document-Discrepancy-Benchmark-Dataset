                "original_text": "(a)  Section 6.1 of the Agreement shall be, and hereby is, amended by deleting the date \"September 30, 2003\" where it appears therein, and inserting in its place the date \"July 20, 2006\".",
                "changed_text": "(a)  Section 6.1 of the Agreement shall be, and hereby is, amended by deleting the date \"September 30, 2003\" where it appears therein, and inserting in its place the date \"December 31, 2003\".",
                "explanation": "The contract's original amendment extends the agreement to July 20, 2006. Shortening the extension to December 31, 2003, introduces a potential breach if the original terms or expectations require a longer duration, creating a contractual inconsistency. By reducing the time frame, this modification creates non-compliance with the initially agreed operational timeline.",

                "original_text": "Any curtailment under this provision shall be in an amount sufficient to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or to reduce the Transmission Line line losses, as applicable, up to and including the Projects of all of the LIFO Partners. Such curtailment shall continue until the Manager shall determine that reconnecting the Projects of the LIFO Partners shall not result in the recurrence of the event giving rise to the curtailment.",
                "changed_text": "Any curtailment under this provision shall be in an amount determined solely at the Manager's discretion, without regard to the Transmission Line's capacity or line losses. Such curtailment shall continue indefinitely, regardless of whether the conditions giving rise to the curtailment persist. The LIFO partners shall bear all risks associated with this provision.",
                "explanation": "This modification gives the Manager unfettered discretion in curtailing projects of the LIFO Partners, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing. The indefinite curtailment, regardless of actual need, is commercially unreasonable. By removing the standard of 'sufficient to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity' and making it indefinite, it creates a conflict with standard commercial reasonableness.",

                "original_text": "In connection with any attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment, no change to the Transmission Line shall be made without the prior unanimous consent of the Partners (excluding the LIFO Partners), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "changed_text": "In connection with any attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment, the Manager may make any changes to the Transmission Line, at the sole expense of the LIFO partners, without needing any consent from any of the partners. The LIFO Partners hereby waive any right to contest such changes.",
                "explanation": "This clause previously protected the partners and is now removed. This shift in power directly hurts the LIFO partners since it doesn't require the Manager to receive consent from any of the partners. It also forces the LIFO partners to waive any contest of such changes, which could have legal implications depending on the scope and impact of the changes.",

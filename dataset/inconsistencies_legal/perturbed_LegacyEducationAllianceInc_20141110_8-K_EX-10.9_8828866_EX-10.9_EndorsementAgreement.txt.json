                "original_text": "ii. Payment  to CSA no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of invoice from CSA. CSA shall submit  invoice to the Company no later than thirty (30) days after Company provides CSA with the list of the sales of Product (containing the Property with such supporting information that may be required or requested to be disclosed).",
                "changed_text": "ii. Payment  to CSA no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of invoice from CSA. CSA shall submit  invoice to the Company no later than ninety (90) days after Company provides CSA with the list of the sales of Product (containing the Property with such supporting information that may be required or requested to be disclosed).",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment timeframe to 60 days after invoice receipt, and invoice submission to 90 days. This contradicts standard business practices and regulations in the UK, where payment terms are typically shorter to ensure fair compensation and cash flow for businesses, especially smaller entities like CSA. Extended payment terms could be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable under UK contract law, particularly if they cause undue hardship.",

Talent  shall have seven (7) days following receipt of such Materials or any part thereof displaying  the intended use of the Property to review and for CSA to provide to Company written approval for such use.\n\nd. In the event that Talent objects to the Products or any part thereof and/or any proposed use of the Property, CSA on behalf of Talent shall submit to Company, within seven (7) days following Company's official submission of materials, a written request for revisions.",

Talent  shall have two (2) days following receipt of such Materials or any part thereof displaying  the intended use of the Property to review and for CSA to provide to Company written approval for such use.\n\nd. In the event that Talent objects to the Products or any part thereof and/or any proposed use of the Property, CSA on behalf of Talent shall submit to Company, within one (1) days following Company's official submission of materials, a written request for revisions.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the review periods to 2 and 1 days, respectively, is arguably unreasonable and may not allow sufficient time for Talent to properly assess materials, especially under UK advertising standards and consumer protection laws. This could be viewed as an unfair practice.",

Talent agrees that Company shall, for a period of nine (9) months (Sell-Off Period) following the effective date of termination, have the right to continue to sell Product bearing  the Property and/or utilize advertising materials and collateral bearing the Property.

Such sales and use shall be made subject to all the provisions of this Agreement and in particular clause 4 hereof.",
                "explanation": "Extending the sell-off period to 18 months could potentially conflict with UK competition law and consumer protection regulations, especially if the Talent's brand has moved on and continued use creates market confusion or misleads consumers about the Talent's current endorsement.",

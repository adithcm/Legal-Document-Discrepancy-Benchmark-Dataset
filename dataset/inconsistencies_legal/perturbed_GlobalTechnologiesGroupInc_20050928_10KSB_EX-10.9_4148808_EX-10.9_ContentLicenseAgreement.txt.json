                "original_text": "Distributor will provide IMNTV with a quarterly report or monthly report if available, summarizing the data relevant to the payment obligations herein within five (5) business days from the end of the calendar quarter. The reports will contain sufficient information to permit Provider to verify payments hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will provide IMNTV with a quarterly report, summarizing the data relevant to the payment obligations herein within ninety (90) business days from the end of the calendar quarter. The reports will contain only basic revenue figures.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires reporting within five business days, ensuring timely financial oversight. The modified text extends the reporting deadline to ninety business days and limits the report's content to basic revenue figures, hindering IMNTV's ability to promptly verify payments and potentially violating general accounting principles requiring timely and accurate financial reporting.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Accounting Principles (GAAP) which emphasizes timely and accurate financial reporting.",

                "explanation": "The modification shortens the cure period for a material breach from 30 days to 10 days. Depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the breach, a 10-day cure period may be deemed unreasonably short, especially for complex breaches, and can potentially conflict with principles of good faith and fair dealing in contract law. In some jurisdictions, courts may refuse to enforce such a short cure period.",

                "explanation": "By reducing the confidentiality period from two years to ninety days, the modified text potentially undermines the protection of confidential information. Depending on the nature of the information and the industry, a 90-day confidentiality period may be considered unreasonably short and insufficient to protect trade secrets and other proprietary information, conflicting with industry standards and potentially violating laws related to trade secret protection.",

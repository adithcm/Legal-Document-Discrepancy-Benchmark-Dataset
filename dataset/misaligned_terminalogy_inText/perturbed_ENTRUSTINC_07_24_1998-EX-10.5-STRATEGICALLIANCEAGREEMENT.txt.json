                "explanation": "The term 'Entrust' is initially defined to include both ETI and its subsidiaries. By changing this definition to exclude subsidiaries, any clause that refers to 'Entrust' becomes ambiguous. For example, obligations assigned to 'Entrust' may or may not apply to its subsidiaries, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "\"Nortel\" shall mean NTL only and does not include Nortel Subsidiaries.",
                "explanation": "Similarly to the first perturbation, the term 'Nortel' is redefined to exclude Nortel Subsidiaries. This contradicts the original definition and causes confusion about which entities are bound by obligations or entitled to rights assigned to 'Nortel'. For instance, the obligations under Section 7.01 become unclear whether they apply only to NTL or also to Nortel Subsidiaries.",

For any cause of action arising under this --------------- Agreement, Nortel's liability to Entrust, and Entrust's liability to Nortel shall not exceed U.S.$5,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Nortel's and Entrust's liability to the other Party for breach of Article II shall not exceed U.S.$10,000,000.",

For any cause of action arising under this --------------- Agreement, Nortel's liability to Entrust, and Entrust's liability to Nortel shall not exceed U.S.$5,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of NTL's and ETI's liability to the other for any dispute shall not exceed U.S.$1,000,000.",
                "explanation": "Here, Nortel is replaced by its parent company 'NTL', and Entrust by 'ETI'. Given the definitions of 'Nortel' and 'Entrust' initially include subsidiaries, altering this clause creates conflict about who is actually liable for the damages of a breach. Also, it changes the monetary limits.",

                "original_text": "DGT shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement if Dolphin fails to meet its requirements and material obligation hereunder and only after DGT have given Dolphin written notice of such failure and only after Dolphin has not rectified such failure within 10 days of the notice.",
                "changed_text": "DGT may terminate this Agreement if Dolphin fails to meet its requirements and material obligation hereunder and only after DGT have given Dolphin written notice of such failure and only after Dolphin has not rectified such failure within 10 days of the notice.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall' to 'may' introduces ambiguity. 'Shall' indicates a mandatory action, whereas 'may' indicates a permissive action. This creates uncertainty regarding DGT's obligation to terminate the agreement if Dolphin fails to meet its obligations. Is it required or optional?",

                "explanation": "By removing 'hereby', 'holds harmless', 'defends', 'consequential or otherwise,' the strength of the indemnification is reduced. 'Hereby' creates a present obligation and the removal creates ambiguity. Removing the clarification of consequential damages leaves room for interpretation and potential legal disputes on whether consequential damages are covered.",

                "changed_text": "Dolphin should deliver to DGT 30 days after each year a report on services provided.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall' with 'should' weakens the obligation for Dolphin to provide the report, changing it from a mandatory requirement to a suggestion. Removing 'detailed photo-editing report on all services provided on a unit basis (i.e. customer number, file number, cost)' reduces the specific requirements of the report, making it unclear what information needs to be included. This could lead to disputes over the sufficiency of the report.",

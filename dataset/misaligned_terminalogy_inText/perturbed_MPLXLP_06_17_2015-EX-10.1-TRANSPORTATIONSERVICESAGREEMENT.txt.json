                "explanation": "The change from 'owner of a common carrier pipeline' to 'operator of a private pipeline' for ORPL contradicts the initial statement that both MPL and ORPL operate common carrier pipelines, introducing uncertainty about the nature of ORPL's pipeline services and potential obligations.",

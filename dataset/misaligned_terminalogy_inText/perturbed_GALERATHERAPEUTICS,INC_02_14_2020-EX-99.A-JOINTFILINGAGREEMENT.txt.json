                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \"Exchange Act\") the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of Clarus IV-A, L.P., Clarus IV-B, L.P., Clarus IV-C, L.P., Clarus IV-D, L.P., Clarus IV GP, L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.L.C., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings I/II GP L.L.C., The Blackstone Group Inc., Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. and Stephen A. Schwarzman, on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \"Exchange Act\") the undersigned hereby consent to the joint submission of Clarus IV-A, L.P., Clarus IV-B, L.P., Clarus IV-C, L.P., Clarus IV-D, L.P., Clarus IV GP, L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.L.C., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings I/II GP L.L.C., The Blackstone Group Inc., Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. and Stephen A. Schwarzman, on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such actor under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or directive thereunder (including any alteration, reiteration, addendum, and/or display thereto) with respect to securities of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and further endorse the submission, delivery, and/or inclusion by citation of this Contract as an exhibit thereto.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'agree' and 'consent' are subtly different, 'party' and 'actor', 'rule' and 'directive', 'amendment' and 'alteration', 'agreement' and 'contract' could refer to different things or aspects of the same thing, introducing ambiguity. Similarly, 'filing' becomes 'submission', which carries a potentially different legal weight. The cumulative effect is to create potential misinterpretations.",

                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each signatory is accountable for the prompt submission of such submissions and any modifications thereto, and for the comprehensiveness and correctness of the data concerning such individual included therein; but none of them is accountable for the comprehensiveness or correctness of the data concerning the other signatories performing the submission, unless such individual is aware or has cause to suspect that such data is imprecise.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'responsible' to 'accountable' and 'person' to 'signatory' and 'information' to 'data' could create confusion as to the extent of liability and scope of accuracy required. 'Filing' being replaced with 'submission' further creates inconsistency. 'Inaccurate' becomes 'imprecise', which might suggest a different threshold for accuracy, further complicating the enforcement.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This Contract will stay completely operative and effective until rescinded by any participant herein in a documented communication delivered to each other participant herein, and consequently solely regarding such rescinding participant.",
                "explanation": "The use of 'Agreement' versus 'Contract', 'revoked' versus 'rescinded', 'party' versus 'participant', and 'signed writing' versus 'documented communication' introduces ambiguity. Whether or not a 'documented communication' has the same legal weight as a 'signed writing' is now unclear, which could impact the validity of a revocation. Similarly, 'operative' and 'effective' have slightly different connotations than 'full force and effect.'",

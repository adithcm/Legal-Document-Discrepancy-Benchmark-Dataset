                "explanation": "The terms 'Franchise' and 'Business Opportunity' are used interchangeably, but the agreement only defines 'Franchise.' This creates confusion about whether the rights and obligations apply equally to both, especially if a 'Business Opportunity' is considered a lesser form of the Franchise.",

However, these terms can have different legal implications, potentially affecting the scope of the franchisee's rights and the franchisor's obligations.

You agree to concentrate Your promotional efforts to customers located in Your Territory, and You agree not to advertise the Products using media or publications whose primary coverage area is outside Your Designated Area.",
                "explanation": "The text alternates between 'marketing efforts' and 'promotional efforts,' and replaces 'Exclusive Territory' with 'Designated Area.' The shift introduces ambiguity because ‘marketing’ encompasses broader activities than promotion. This alters the franchisee's responsibility. Switching 'Exclusive Territory' to 'Designated Area' without properly defining it adds confusion.",

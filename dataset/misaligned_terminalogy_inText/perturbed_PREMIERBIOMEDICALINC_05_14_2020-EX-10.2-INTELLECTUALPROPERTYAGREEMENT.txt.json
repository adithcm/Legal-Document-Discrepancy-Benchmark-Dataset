The costs listed below are to be hereinafter referred to as the \"License Fee\", to be paid by and through THI. The use of the License Fee is further broken down below:\n\n 1. $20,000, payable to Marv Enterprises, LLC or as it directs, which has already been paid into the account of Marv Enterprises, LLC at the Lynch Law Group\n\n 2. The total sum of non-paid invoices (estimated to be approximately $80,000) payable to Marv Enterprises, LLC, previously owed by Premier to Marv up until the effective date of this Agreement, payable in total by no later than July 20, 2020.",

                "explanation": "The term 'License Fee' is replaced with 'Payment'. Throughout the agreement, the original 'License Fee' is defined and used consistently. By switching the term to 'Payment' without further definition, it creates ambiguity as to whether it refers to the same set of costs outlined or something else entirely. The phrase 'use of the Payment' is non-sensical, introducing confusion as to how this 'payment' should be used, potentially contradicting the original intent regarding the License Fee's allocation.",

THI shall reimburse Marv for all IP Costs incurred on behalf of THI, as well as pre-paid IP Costs incurred prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement, including the costs of provisional and non-provisional applications that are filed to preserve Intellectual Property.

Reimbursement for pre-paid IP Costs shall be in accordance with 2 (b) 2 above.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Costs' to 'Expenses' introduces a degree of uncertainty. While seemingly synonymous, legal definitions can differentiate between reimbursable 'costs' and 'expenses'. Later mentions of IP Costs are not necessarily interchangeable with Expenses, thus introducing a question of the exact items for which THI must reimburse Marv. This creates uncertainty regarding which expenditures fall under THI's reimbursement obligation, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The term 'payments' is replaced with 'compensations'. The original text clearly refers to 'payments', while the replacement uses the term 'compensations', creating ambiguity as to whether it refers to the same set of monetary obligations outlined or something else entirely. The phrase 'obligatory compensations' is more broad, potentially creating conflicts on how the exclusive licenses will revert back to the premier.",

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, PPI hereby appoints EKR and EKR agrees to be retained as the exclusive distributor, and Authorized Distributor of Record, of the Products in the Field in the Territory during the Term to market, distribute, warehouse and sell the Products. EKR shall have the right to appoint sub-distributors hereunder in each country of the Territory.",

EKR shall have the right to appoint sub-distributors hereunder in each country of the Territory.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'distributor' to 'vendor' introduces a potential contradiction, as these terms have distinct meanings in commercial contexts. 'Distributor' implies a role in a distribution chain, while 'vendor' typically refers to a seller. This ambiguity could cause confusion regarding EKR's specific responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "The alteration of 'royalties' to 'fees' creates uncertainty, particularly concerning payments contingent on product sales or usage. 'Royalties' generally imply a usage-based payment, while 'fees' can cover various types of payments. This substitution introduces ambiguity regarding the payment obligations and may alter the distribution of financial risk.",

                "original_text": "In the event that a Party is required under the laws of a country or other political subdivision of competent jurisdiction to withhold any tax to the tax or revenue authorities in such jurisdiction in connection with any payment to the other Party, such amount shall be deducted from the payment to be made by such withholding Party; provided that the withholding Party shall take reasonable and lawful actions to avoid and minimize such withholding and promptly notify the other Party so that the other Party may take lawful actions to avoid and minimize such withholding. The withholding Party shall promptly furnish the other Party with copies of any tax certificate or other documentation evidencing such withholding as necessary to satisfy the requirements of the appropriate regulatory authority related to any application by such other Party for foreign tax credit for such payment. Each Party agrees to reasonably cooperate with the other Party in claiming exemptions from such deductions or withholdings under any agreement or treaty from time to time in effect.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that a Party is required under the laws of a country or other political subdivision of competent jurisdiction to withhold any levy to the tax or revenue authorities in such jurisdiction in connection with any payment to the other Party, such amount shall be deducted from the payment to be made by such withholding Party; provided that the withholding Party shall take reasonable and lawful actions to avoid and minimize such withholding and promptly notify the other Party so that the other Party may take lawful actions to avoid and minimize such withholding.

                "explanation": "Swapping 'tax' for 'levy' introduces a degree of uncertainty. While 'tax' generally encompasses mandatory contributions to state revenue, 'levy' can be broader and encompass fees, assessments, or even forced contributions. This can cause ambiguity in the scope of the withholding obligation and the associated actions a withholding party must take.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses the term 'say-on-pay' proposal to describe a vote on executive compensation. The changed text replaces all instances of \"say-on-pay\" with \"executive compensation proposal\". While these terms are often used synonymously, the contract does not explicitly define them as such. This creates ambiguity as to whether the MG Capital Parties are bound to vote in accordance with the Board's recommendation on *all* matters related to executive compensation (which could include things beyond a simple 'say-on-pay' vote). This could lead to disputes over the scope of the voting agreement.",

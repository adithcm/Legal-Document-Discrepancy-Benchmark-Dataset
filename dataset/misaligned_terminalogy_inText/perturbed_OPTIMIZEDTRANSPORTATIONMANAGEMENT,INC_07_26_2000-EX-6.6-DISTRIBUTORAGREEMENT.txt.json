                "explanation": "The terms 'Products', 'Items', 'Commodities', and 'Merchandise' are used interchangeably without clear definition. This creates confusion about what exactly COMWARE is incorporating into its systems and what is covered under the agreement, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Products' is replaced with 'Deliverables' and 'equipment' is changed to 'hardware'. This change creates ambiguity because the contract already referred to products, which are now deliverables, and the change from equipment to hardware narrows the scope of what is covered by the warranty. This could lead to disputes over what constitutes a 'deliverable' or 'hardware' and whether certain defective items are covered under the warranty.",

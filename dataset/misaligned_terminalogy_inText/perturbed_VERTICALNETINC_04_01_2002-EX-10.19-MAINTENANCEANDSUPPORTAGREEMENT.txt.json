Only authorized personnel designated by Converge (\"Converge Support Personnel\") may communicate Problem Reports and Support 3 Requests to VNE. The number of Converge Support Personnel will not exceed seven persons without VNE's prior approval. The initial Converge Support Personnel shall be identified to VNE in writing within 10 business days following the Effective Date. Converge may change the Converge Support Personnel on written notice to VNE; provided, however, that Converge shall use reasonable efforts not to change the Converge Support Personnel more frequently than once every 30 days. All replacement personnel shall be required to participate in Support Training as described in Section 3.3 below.

                "explanation": "The change from 'personnel' to 'agents' introduces ambiguity, as 'agents' is not defined and could imply different levels of authority/responsibility. Making training optional creates contradiction with earlier text requiring all replacements to have training. Changing from 'single point of contact' to 'one of the points of contact' creates uncertainty on who exactly is responsible for support.",

Each of Converge and VNE shall appoint a Project Manager to coordinate such party's activities with respect to the Professional Services hereunder. The initial VNE Project Manager shall be Michael Decker and the initial Converge Project Manager shall be Farooq Ahmad. Either party may change its Project Manager on notice (via e-mail or in some other reasonable fashion not necessarily in accordance with the express notice 6 provisions of this Agreement) to the other party's Project Manager and Relationship Manager at any time. 3.2 Monthly Work Plans. As reasonably requested by either party, the Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager will conduct planning meetings to determine the Professional Services that VNE will provide to Converge for each month during the Term. In connection with each such planning meeting, the Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager will jointly prepare a written work summary or plan (each, a \"Work Plan\") indicating the Professional Services to be performed by VNE for such month.",

Each of Converge and VNE may designate a Project Leader, but there is no obligation, to coordinate such party's activities with respect to the Professional Services hereunder. The initial VNE Project Leader may be Michael Decker and the initial Converge Project Leader could be Farooq Ahmad. Either party may change its Project Leader with no prior notice at any time. 3.2 Monthly Work Plans. If reasonably convenient for both parties, a suitable Converge Project contact and a VNE Project coordinator will conduct planning meetings to determine the Professional Services that VNE will provide to Converge for each month during the Term. In connection with each such planning meeting, the Converge Project contact and the VNE Project coordinator may prepare a work plan (each, a \"Work Plan\") indicating the Professional Services to be performed by VNE for such month.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Project Manager' to 'Project Leaders' and then to Project contact/coordinator introduces inconsistency. Stating there's no obligation to designate a leader and that leader *may* be a person is contradicting. Removing any notice requirement will lead to communication issues in the implementation of work plans. Also, the 'will jointly prepare' is softened to a conditional 'may prepare', reducing obligations.",

VNE warrants that the Services provided hereunder will be provided in accordance with generally-accepted industry standards applicable to the performance of services of a similar nature. In the event of any breach of the foregoing warranty, and provided that Converge reports such breach to VNE in writing within 90 days following the date of performance of the Services in question, VNE shall, as its sole obligation and Converge's sole and exclusive remedy, promptly repair, replace or re-perform the Services in question, without additional cost to Converge, so as to correct the warranty non-compliance as promptly as practicable (within 30 days to the extent technically feasible). 5.2 Disclaimer.

                "explanation": "Changing 'warranty' to 'guarantee' weakens the obligation. Then, modifying the wording from strict adherence to industry standards, to a general alignment, makes the standard subjective. Replacing 'reports such breach to VNE in writing within 90 days' with 'notifies VNE verbally within a reasonable timeframe' weakens Converge's burden, but also weakens the recourse and timeline. Replacing the obligation to 'promptly repair, replace or re-perform' with 'VNE might, at its sole discretion, consider addressing the issue' removes any guarantee of service, and introducing potential additional cost for correcting compliance.",

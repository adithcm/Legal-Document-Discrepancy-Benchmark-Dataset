                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Horst Entertainment agrees to pay Galactcomm $0.01 (one cent) per access up to 400,000 accesses thereafter payment shall be $0.005 (one-half cent) per access. Horst Entertainment shall send this amount to Galacticomm by no later than Wednesday for accesses used from the previuos week (Monday thru Sunday).",
                "changed_text": "Horst Entertainment agrees to compensate Galacticomm $0.01 (one cent) per access up to 400,000 accesses, after which the rate may be adjusted based on market conditions. Horst Entertainment will remit payment to Galacticomm according to a mutually agreed upon schedule.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed payment schedule and amount. The modified version replaces 'pay' with 'compensate', introduces ambiguity regarding payment amounts after 400,000 accesses ('may be adjusted based on market conditions'), and makes the payment schedule flexible ('mutually agreed upon schedule'). This creates a contradiction regarding the financial obligations.",

                "original_text": "Galacticomm must provide a person(s) to correct any technical problems (Server being down or inaccessible) 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. This person(s) must be available by beeper or telephone. Horst Entertainment shall provide this same 24 hour service at the broadcast location.",
                "changed_text": "Galacticomm must ensure system availability. Horst Entertainment will address any technical issues at their broadcast location within reasonable business hours.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 24/7 support availability from Galacticomm and Horst Entertainment. The modified version replaces the specific support obligations with vague terms like 'ensure system availability' for Galacticomm and introduces 'reasonable business hours' for Horst Entertainment, effectively contradicting the original 24/7 requirement and leading to uncertainty regarding response times and service levels.",
                "location": "Paragraph 4"

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the event Galacticomm, Inc. chooses to terminate this agreement, Horst Entertainment Inc. will have the right to purchase a license copy of the software in the amount of $15,000.00.",
                "changed_text": "Should Galacticomm, Inc. decide to discontinue the agreement, Horst Entertainment Inc. may negotiate a license agreement for the software, subject to Galacticomm's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides Horst Entertainment with a clear right to purchase a software license at a fixed price upon termination by Galacticomm. The modified text changes 'terminate' to 'discontinue', removes the guaranteed right, and makes the license agreement subject to negotiation and Galacticomm's discretion. This contradicts the original clear entitlement and creates uncertainty about Horst Entertainment's ability to obtain a license.",

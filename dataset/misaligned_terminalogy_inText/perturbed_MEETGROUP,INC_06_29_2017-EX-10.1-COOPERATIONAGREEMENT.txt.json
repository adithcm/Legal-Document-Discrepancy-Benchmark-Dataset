                "original_text": "The Company agrees that, concurrent with the appointment of the New Directors to the Board, the Board shall take such action as is necessary such that each of the New Directors is appointed to at least one (1) of the three (3) standing committees of the Board that the Company is required to maintain in accordance with the NASDAQ listing standards; provided that, with respect to each such committee appointment, the New Director is and continues to remain eligible to serve as a member of such committee pursuant to applicable law and the rules of NASDAQ that are applicable to the composition of such committee.",

                "explanation": "The text now uses 'Corporation' interchangeably with 'Company', without clarification. Also, removing 'that the Company is required to maintain in accordance with the NASDAQ listing standards' and 'the rules of NASDAQ that are applicable to the composition of such committee' generates enforcement uncertainty, since the commitment is now more vague, with no reference to NASDAQ requirements.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'Company' and 'Investors' are replaced by the terms 'Business' and 'Investors' in the text, creating a misaligned terminology. Also, instead of 'shall be responsible for its own fees and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution, and effectuation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and all other activities related to the foregoing' we have 'will cover its costs incurred in connection with the execution of this Agreement and the transactions considered here, including attorney's fees related to the execution of this Agreement'.

Prior to the issuance of the Mutual Press Release, neither the Company nor any of the Investors shall issue any press release or make any public announcement regarding this Agreement or take any action that would require public disclosure thereof without the prior written consent of the other party. During the Standstill Period, neither the Company nor the Investor Group or any of its Affiliates or Associates shall make any public announcement or statement that is inconsistent with or contrary to the statements made in the Mutual Press Release, except as required by law or the rules of any stock exchange (and, in any event, each party will provide the other party, prior to making any such public announcement or statement, a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such disclosure, to the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances, and each party will consider any comments from the other in good faith) or with the prior written consent of the other party, and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement.",

During the Standstill Period, neither the Entity nor the Investor Team or any of its Affiliates or Associates will make any public statement that conflicts with the statements made in the Joint Announcement, except when required by law, and each party will consider any comments from the other.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'Company', 'Investor Group', 'Mutual Press Release', 'press release', 'public announcement' whereas the changed text now has 'Entity', 'Investor Team', 'Joint Announcement', 'statement', creating uncertainty due to misaligned terminology. Also removing 'or the rules of any stock exchange (and, in any event, each party will provide the other party, prior to making any such public announcement or statement, a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such disclosure, to the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances, and each party will consider any comments from the other in good faith) or otherwise in accordance with this Agreement.' makes the agreement vague.",

                "original_text": "SIERRA hereby appoints ENVISION as its exclusive distributor for the Product in any blend with Krill Oil within the Territory subject to ENVISION fulfilling the terms and conditions of the best efforts marketing requirements set forth herein in Sections 4, 5, and 9. SIERRA shall cease making sales to any customer or distributor who, during the term of this Agreement, violates ENVISION's exclusivity.",
                "changed_text": "SIERRA hereby appoints ENVISION as its exclusive reseller for the Product in any blend with Krill Oil within the Territory subject to ENVISION fulfilling the terms and conditions of the best efforts marketing requirements set forth herein in Sections 4, 5, and 9. SIERRA shall cease making sales to any customer or distributor who, during the term of this Agreement, violates ENVISION's exclusivity.",
                "explanation": "The term 'distributor' is changed to 'reseller'. While seemingly similar, 'distributor' typically implies broader rights and responsibilities, including marketing and potentially sub-licensing, while 'reseller' suggests a more limited role focused on simply reselling the product. This introduces ambiguity as to ENVISION's actual rights and obligations.",

                "original_text": "The price for the Product as set forth in Section 9 herein, sold by SIERRA to ENVISION, shall be subject to change due to changes in manufacturing costs and so as to maximize profits; any changes in price for the Product shall not be applicable to previously accepted orders and shall be made with at least ninety (90) days advance notice in writing and in good faith by conference of the parties. ENVISION shall not resell the Product alone.",
                "changed_text": "The fee for the Product as set forth in Section 9 herein, sold by SIERRA to ENVISION, shall be subject to change due to changes in manufacturing costs and so as to maximize profits; any changes in price for the Product shall not be applicable to previously accepted orders and shall be made with at least ninety (90) days advance notice in writing and in good faith by conference of the parties. ENVISION shall not resell the Product alone.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'price' to 'fee' creates an internal inconsistency. 'Price' is the standard term for the cost of goods, whereas 'fee' typically applies to services. This subtle change could be interpreted as SIERRA providing a service rather than selling a product, potentially impacting warranty and liability obligations.",

In the event of any breach of this warranty or in the event any user of Product makes a claim that the Product was the cause of personal injury or property damage (product liability claim), SIERRA shall indemnify, defend and hold ENVISION harmless from any liability occasioned by a breach of warranty or a product liability claim. SIERRA warrants that it carries general liability insurance of not less than $2 million per occurrence and product liability insurance of not less than $5 million per occurrence and that, upon the execution of this Agreement, it will name ENVISION as an additional insured on such policies. SIERRA further warrants that the Product will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of any federal, state, or local law or regulation or other applicable law. SIERRA agrees to promptly notify ENVISION of any problem, anomaly, defect or condition which would reasonably cause ENVISION's concern relative to stability, reliability, form, fit, function or quality of the Product.",

                "explanation": "The word \"warrants\" is changed to \"guarantees.\" While often used interchangeably in colloquial language, in a legal context, \"warranties\" and \"guarantees\" can have different implications. \"Guarantee\" may imply a stronger level of assurance than a \"warranty,\" which could create ambiguity and potentially conflicting interpretations regarding SIERRA's obligations.",

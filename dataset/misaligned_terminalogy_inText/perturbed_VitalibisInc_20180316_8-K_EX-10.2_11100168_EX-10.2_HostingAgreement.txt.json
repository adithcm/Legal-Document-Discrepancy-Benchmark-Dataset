                "explanation": "Changing 'Licensee' to 'Customer' in the initial definition creates ambiguity. The document now uses both 'Licensee' and 'Customer' seemingly interchangeably, but without explicit definition. This leads to potential confusion regarding which entity holds specific obligations or rights throughout the agreement.",

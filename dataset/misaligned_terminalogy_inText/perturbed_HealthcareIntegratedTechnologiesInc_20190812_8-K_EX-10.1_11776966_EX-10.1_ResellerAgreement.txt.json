                "explanation": "The term 'Supplier' is changed to 'Vendor' in the opening paragraph without defining if they are the same entity. This creates confusion because throughout the document, both terms are used, creating uncertainty about which entity is responsible for specific obligations. This is a form of misaligned terminology.",

                "explanation": "Following the change in the opening paragraph, 'Supplier' has been changed to 'Vendor' in this section too. The contract lacks clarity on whether Vendor and Supplier are the same entity. As a result, the indemnification clause becomes vague. It creates a situation where it is unclear if Reseller is obliged to indemnify both Vendor and Supplier. Is it for one or the other? This ambiguity causes uncertainty in the legal agreement, because it becomes uncertain who can be defended by the indemnification clause.",

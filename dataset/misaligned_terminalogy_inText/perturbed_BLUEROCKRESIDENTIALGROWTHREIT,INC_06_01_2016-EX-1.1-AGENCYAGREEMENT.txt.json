                "explanation": "Changing 'Company' to 'Corporation' at the beginning and then referencing the 'Transaction Entity' for responsibility creates confusion as to which legal entity ultimately bears the responsibility for compliance. This introduces a contradiction because the sentence initially defines the 'Company' (Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc.) and then later uses 'Transaction Entity', which includes both the 'Company' and the 'Operating Partnership'. It makes the agreement ambiguous as to which party holds the duty of compliance.",

While Subsidiaries are defined later, the initial representation implies that a separate legal entity (other than the primary 'Company') is responsible. The following sentance says the Operating Partnership is responsible which goes against the claim the the Subsidiary is responsible, because it is ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "Using inconsistent terminology such as 'Corporation', 'Bluerock Entity', 'Holding Entity', and 'Enterprise' to refer to what is presumably the same entity (Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc., previously defined as just 'Company' and now 'Corporation') creates massive confusion about which entity's shares and capitalization are being discussed. This would introduce doubts about the validity and enforceability of the stock issuance, as preemptive rights and other matters related to the stock are unclear. If different entities, those entities are never defined. The terms are used randomly within the same assertion which is contradictory.",

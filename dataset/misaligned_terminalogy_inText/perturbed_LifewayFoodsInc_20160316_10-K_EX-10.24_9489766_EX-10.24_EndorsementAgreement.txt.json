                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless' to 'may be required to protect' weakens the obligation and introduces ambiguity. Removing 'all claims, actions, causes' and specifying 'expenses related to inaccuracies in advertising content created by the Individual' narrows the scope of indemnification, potentially conflicting with a broader interpretation elsewhere in the contract related to 'Marketing Materials'. This also could be interpreted as no legal duty to 'defend'.",

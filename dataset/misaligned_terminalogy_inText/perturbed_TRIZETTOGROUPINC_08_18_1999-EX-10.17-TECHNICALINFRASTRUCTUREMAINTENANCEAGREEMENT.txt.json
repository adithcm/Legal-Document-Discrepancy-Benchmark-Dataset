If the Cap           of Hours is met before the end of the 12 Month period, Customer may           choose to purchase an additional Retainer Support Plan at the same           rates. This Support Plan is to include all necessary labor in a repair           situation, but Customer is to incur the cost of components to replace           broken or faulty equipment. Customer is to incur reasonable cost of           travel time/expenses of MMMW personal. MMMW accepts the responsibility           for payment of shipping and handling costs of the components. Customer           is to incur the cost for any swap equipment. Fee for swap equipment is           a flat-rate, one time fee as follows (not applicable from the central           site): terminal $[*], color terminal $[*], [*] printer $[*], [*]           printer $[*], personal computer $[*].

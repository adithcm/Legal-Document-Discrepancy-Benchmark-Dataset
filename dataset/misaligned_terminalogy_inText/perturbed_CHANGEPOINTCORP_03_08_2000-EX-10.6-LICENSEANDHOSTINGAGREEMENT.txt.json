                "explanation": "Changing 'CUSTOMER(S)' to 'END-USER(S)' without defining 'END-USER(S)' creates confusion as the term 'Customer' is already defined and widely used throughout the agreement, while 'END-USER' is introduced without context. This creates ambiguity and contradiction in enforcement.",

The identification number and password used by a Software User          is reusable and reassignable and may be used and transferred by Corio,          in accordance with the licenses granted below, between Customers as one          Customer discontinues the Corio Services and another Customer          subscribes.",

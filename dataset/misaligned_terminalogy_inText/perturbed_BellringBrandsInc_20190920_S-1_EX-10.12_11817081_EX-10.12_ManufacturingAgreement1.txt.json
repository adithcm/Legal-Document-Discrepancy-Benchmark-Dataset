                "original_text": "(a) Heritage shall produce the products described on Schedule A attached hereto, as may be amended by the Parties hereafter from time to time (the \"Products\"), for Premier at [***] Heritage's or Heritage's wholly owned subsidiary, Jasper's, [***] (the \"Facilities\"). [***] For the purposes of this paragraph, [***] facilities located at [***] are considered one Facility. Any facility that Heritage wishes to use, other than [***] to manufacture the Products must be approved by Premier in writing, in advance. For the avoidance of doubt, Heritage's [***] facility must be approved by Premier before it may be used to manufacture the Products. Such facility approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Premier's facility approval will be based, in part, on the successful completion of a trial production run that is sufficient in meeting finished product specifications, and an evaluation of the stability and specifications of trial production product within [***] of the trial production run.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Heritage shall produce the goods described on Schedule A attached hereto, as may be amended by the Parties hereafter from time to time (the \"Products\"), for Premier at [***] Heritage's or Heritage's wholly owned subsidiary, Jasper's, [***] (the \"Manufacturing Locations\"). [***] For the purposes of this paragraph, [***] facilities located at [***] are considered one Plant. Any location that Heritage wishes to use, other than [***] to manufacture the Products must be approved by Premier in writing, in advance. For the avoidance of doubt, Heritage's [***] location must be approved by Premier before it may be used to manufacture the Products. Such location approvals shall be subject to Premier's discretion. Premier's location approval will be based, in its sole determination, on any criteria Premier deems relevant.",
                "explanation": "The terms “products” is replaced with “goods”, “Facilities” is replaced with “Manufacturing Locations”, “Facility” with “Plant” and “location”, and “shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed” is replaced with “subject to Premier’s discretion” and “any criteria Premier deems relevant”. This creates an internal contradiction, as the original text implies a reasonable standard for approval, while the modified text gives Premier complete discretion, which will lead to conflicting interpretation of the term.",

                "original_text": "(o) Heritage represents and warrants that:\n\n(i) All Products manufactured, packaged and delivered by Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement shall conform to the specifications supplied to Heritage by Premier as listed on Schedule A, which Schedule may from time to time be modified by Premier in writing (the \"Specifications\"), shall conform to Post Holdings' Quality Expectations Manual attached hereto as Schedule E, and shall conform in all material respects to samples previously supplied to Premier by Heritage. No change in Specifications shall be binding on Heritage until Premier has provided written Specifications for each SKU, and each Specification is signed and dated by the Parties. Any additional net cost increases or decreases associated with any modifications to Premier's Specifications shall be borne by or credited to Premier.\n\n(ii) Heritage and Jasper will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to production of the Products, including without limitation, the laws and regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), United States Public Health Service (\"PHS\"), and any and all other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. Heritage warrants that the Products shall be released free from defects in workmanship and shall be manufactured in accordance with this Agreement and 21 C.F.R. Part 110 which is entitled \"Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing or Holding Human Food\" and as it may be amended from time-to-time.",
                "changed_text": "(o) Heritage represents and warrants that:\n\n(i) All items manufactured, packaged and delivered by Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement must adhere to the guidelines given to Heritage by Premier as listed on Schedule A, which Schedule may from time to time be updated by Premier at its discretion (the \"Specifications\"), must follow Post Holdings' Quality Guidance attached hereto as Schedule E, and must in general be similar to examples previously supplied to Premier by Heritage. Any Specification change is binding on Heritage upon notification, and Premier has no obligation to compensate Heritage for cost increases or decreases associated with any modifications to Premier's Specifications.\n\n(ii) Heritage and Jasper will strive to align with laws and regulations applicable to production of the Products, including the guidelines of the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), United States Public Health Service (\"PHS\"), and all other advisory opinions. Heritage hopes that the Products will be released free from defects in workmanship and will try to manufacture in accordance with this Agreement and 21 C.F.R. Part 110 which is entitled \"Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing or Holding Human Food\" and as it may be amended from time-to-time.",
                "explanation": "Several critical changes introduce inconsistencies: 'shall conform to the specifications' becomes 'must adhere to the guidelines'; 'Schedule may from time to time be modified by Premier in writing' becomes 'updated by Premier at its discretion'; 'shall conform to Post Holdings' Quality Expectations Manual' becomes 'must follow Post Holdings' Quality Guidance'; 'conform in all material respects to samples' becomes 'in general be similar to examples'; 'No change in Specifications shall be binding on Heritage until Premier has provided written Specifications for each SKU, and each Specification is signed and dated by the Parties. Any additional net cost increases or decreases associated with any modifications to Premier's Specifications shall be borne by or credited to Premier' becomes 'Any Specification change is binding on Heritage upon notification, and Premier has no obligation to compensate Heritage for cost increases or decreases associated with any modifications to Premier's Specifications'; 'comply with all laws and regulations' becomes 'strive to align with laws and regulations'; 'Heritage warrants that the Products shall be released free from defects in workmanship and shall be manufactured in accordance with this Agreement' becomes 'Heritage hopes that the Products will be released free from defects in workmanship and will try to manufacture in accordance with this Agreement'. These changes dilute the obligations and warranties, leading to conflicting interpretations and enforcement issues.",

                "original_text": "21. PRODUCT RECALLS\n\nPremier shall have the sole right, exercisable in its discretion, to initiate and direct the content and scope of a recall, market withdrawal, stock recovery, product correction and/or advisory safety communication (any one or more referred to as a \"Recall Action\") regarding the Products. At Premier's option, Premier can direct Heritage to, and upon such direction Heritage shall, conduct such Recall Action (and Heritage shall ensure Jasper's cooperation). Premier shall determine, in its sole discretion, the manner, text and timing of any publicity to be given such matters upon prior consultation with Heritage. In the event a Recall Action is initiated or directed by Premier, Heritage agrees to fully cooperate and take all such steps as are reasonably requested to implement the Recall Action in a timely and complete manner. Any and all action to be taken in connection with a Recall Action shall be in accordance with FDA policies and other applicable laws and regulations. Heritage shall bear all costs, fees and out-of-pocket expenses associated with any Recall Action which results from (i) Heritage's or Jasper's negligence or willful misconduct, (ii) Heritage's or Jasper's failure to comply with Product Specifications or the Post Holdings Quality Expectations Manual set forth on Schedule A, (iii) any breach of this Agreement by Heritage or (iv) ingredients or packaging materials purchased by Heritage or Jasper. In all other cases, Premier shall bear all costs associated with any Recall Action.",
                "changed_text": "21. PRODUCT ALERTS\n\nPremier will generally lead any needed recall, market withdrawal, stock recovery, product correction or safety notification (each called a \"Product Alert\") regarding the Products, using its best judgment. Premier may ask Heritage to assist, and Heritage will consider such a request in good faith (and Heritage will encourage Jasper's cooperation). Premier will generally decide on publicity after talking with Heritage. If a Product Alert happens, Heritage will try to cooperate. Actions for Product Alerts will follow general FDA advice. Heritage will pay recall costs if the Product Alert is due to Heritage's or Jasper's clear errors, if Heritage or Jasper do not generally follow the Product Specs or Quality Manual, if Heritage breaks this deal in a big way, or if there are issues with materials Heritage or Jasper buy. Otherwise, Premier pays.",
                "explanation": "The section title is changed to 'PRODUCT ALERTS.' The language becomes less definitive and more advisory. 'Premier shall have the sole right, exercisable in its discretion, to initiate and direct' becomes 'Premier will generally lead.' 'Premier can direct Heritage to, and upon such direction Heritage shall, conduct such Recall Action' becomes 'Premier may ask Heritage to assist, and Heritage will consider such a request in good faith.' 'Heritage agrees to fully cooperate and take all such steps as are reasonably requested' becomes 'Heritage will try to cooperate.' 'Any and all action to be taken...shall be in accordance with FDA policies and other applicable laws and regulations' becomes 'Actions for Product Alerts will follow general FDA advice.' These changes weaken the defined obligations, creating ambiguity.",

                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing with each of the Reporting Persons (as such term is defined in the Schedule 13D referred to below) on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13D (including amendments thereto and statements on Schedule 13G) with respect to the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Macy's, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and that this agreement may be included as an exhibit to such joint filing.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing with each of the Filing Parties (as such term may be interpreted) on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13D (including amendments thereto and statements on Schedule 13G) with respect to the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Macy's, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and that this agreement may be included as an exhibit to such joint filing.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Reporting Persons' with 'Filing Parties' and adding 'as such term may be interpreted' introduces ambiguity. The original text clearly defines 'Reporting Persons' within the context of Schedule 13D. The modified text makes the definition of 'Filing Parties' uncertain and potentially open to different interpretations, contradicting the original intent of clear designation.",

                "explanation": "The original states that each party is *not* responsible for the accuracy of information about other parties. The modified version states that each party *may* be responsible for the veracity of information concerning the other signatories. This creates a direct contradiction and introduces uncertainty about liability for inaccurate information.",

                "explanation": "The original text consistently uses \"Authorized Signatory.\" The modified text introduces multiple alternative titles such as 'Designated Representative', 'Agent', 'Person in Charge' and 'Signatory'. These are used interchangeably without defining whether they hold the same legal authority as an Authorized Signatory. This creates confusion regarding who has the power to bind the entities to the agreement.",

Box 910091, San Diego, CA 92191-0091 (\"MP3.com\"). MP3.com owns and operates the website located at www.mp3.com (the \"Website\").",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Agreement\" to \"Arrangement\", \"Effective Date\" to \"Commencement Date\" and \"MP3.com\" to \"MP3\" and \"Website\" to \"Site\" introduces inconsistency and potential ambiguity, especially if other sections still refer to the original terms. This makes it unclear which terms are legally binding or how they should be interpreted, creating a contradiction and uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "MP3 agrees to provide approximately 3,000,000 Views monthly during the contract. A \"View\" means showing the Tickets space to a visitor on the stated pages.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"MP3.com\" to \"MP3\", \"Impressions\" to \"Views\", \"Tickets Portal\" to \"Tickets Space\", \"term of this Agreement\" to \"contract\" makes it ambiguous whether the new terms carry the same obligations as the original ones. The change from \"guaranteed minimum\" to \"approximately\" creates a quantifiable contradiction, making it difficult to enforce the original guaranteed amount. It is uncertain whether 'visitor' is the same as 'user'.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Agreement\" to \"Arrangement\", \"Effective Date\" to \"Commencement Date\" and \"MP3.com\" to \"MP3\" and rephrasing of the sentence leads to inconsistency with the first changed term in the 'Preamble' section and ambiguity. If the earlier sections are not modified to reflect these changes, then there exists an in-text contradiction.",

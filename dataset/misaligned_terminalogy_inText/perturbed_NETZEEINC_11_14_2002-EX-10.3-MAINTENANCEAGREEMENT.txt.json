                "explanation": "This alteration introduces confusion by using both “Maintenance” and “Support,” terms of similar intent, without clarifying that those concepts are referring to the same thing. Additionally, “off-peak prescheduled maintenance” is changed to “off-peak prescheduled system downtime.” The failure to align terminology on those occasions can result in an incorrect interpretation of what constitutes compliance with the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Purchase Customers' is replaced with 'Subscribers'. Throughout the agreement, it is now unclear whether 'Purchase Customers' and 'Subscribers' refer to the same group, potentially leading to confusion regarding eligibility for the promotion and related obligations. This introduces a discrepancy that may lead to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The term 'pay' is interchanged with the term 'remit'. This introduces confusion regarding the mode and timing of payments from PageMaster Corporation to Go Call. The term 'pay' can entail the standard meaning, whereas the term 'remit' carries a connotation of deferring a payment. The interchange can lead to ambiguity and financial disagreements.",

The address for notice set out above may be changed at any time by giving thirty (30) days prior written notice in the manner above.",
                "explanation": "The term 'deemed' is interchanged with the term 'considered'. The substitution creates an inconsistency that could be used to argue that 'deemed' is a legal definition and therefore final while 'considered' leaves more room for interpretation. The term 'deemed' implies a legal assumption regardless of actual facts, while the term 'considered' suggests a more discretionary assessment. This can create uncertainty when determining the effective date of notices and demands under the agreement, leading to potential disputes over compliance deadlines.",

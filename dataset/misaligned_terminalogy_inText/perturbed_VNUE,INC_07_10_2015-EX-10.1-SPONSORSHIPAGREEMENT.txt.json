                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, the Sponsor may identify itself as a sponsor of the Event in any and all of its advertising for the Sponsor's products and or services in the Category. ANTHEMIC will provide the Sponsor with a suite of official logos and images for the Event to use on advertising, web site and other avenues as approved by ANTHEMIC. Any use by the Sponsor of the Event's name or logo must be approved in advance by ANTHEMIC.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, the Co-presenter may identify itself as a sponsor of the Event in any and all of its advertising for its offerings in the Category. ANTHEMIC will provide the Sponsor with a suite of official logos and images for the Event to use on advertising, web site and other avenues as approved by ANTHEMIC. Any use by the Sponsor of the Event's name or logo requires no approval.",
                "explanation": "The contract uses 'Sponsor' and 'Co-presenter' interchangeably, causing confusion and changing obligations. Here the requirement for approval of usage rights is revoked.",

If ANTHEMIC produces the Event in 2016 and seeks a sponsor in the category, ANTHEMIC will first contact the Sponsor and provide the Sponsor with written notice (the \"Notice) of the terms under which the Sponsor can be the category sponsor for the 2016 Event.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Sponsor' is replaced with 'VNUE' and the term 'sponsor' is replaced with 'advertiser', but the term 'Sponsor' is left in the second sentence, introducing ambiguity about which entity holds the right of first refusal and if VNUE would also be seen as an 'advertiser.'",

The insurance mentioned in the preceding sentence will name ANTHEMIC as additional insured.",
                "explanation": "The change from “Sponsor’s” to “VNUE’s” in the first clause creates contradiction as the “Sponsor” is mentioned afterwards. Also, by stating that the Sponsor “may” obtain the insurance at “VNUE’s discretion” causes confusion, as it is uncertain who is responsible for getting the insurance",

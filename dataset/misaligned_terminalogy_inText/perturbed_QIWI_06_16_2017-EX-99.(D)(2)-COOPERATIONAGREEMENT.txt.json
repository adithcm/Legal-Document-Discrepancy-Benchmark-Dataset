                "original_text": "The Parties shall form a steering committee (the \"Steering Committee\"), which shall analyse and develop potential areas of strategic cooperation between the Parties and oversee the Parties' cooperation in these areas.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties shall form a steering committee (the \"Advisory Group\"), which shall analyse and develop potential areas of strategic cooperation between the Parties and oversee the Parties' cooperation in these areas.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Steering Committee' is replaced with 'Advisory Group.' While seemingly innocuous, this introduces confusion as the contract continues to reference 'Steering Committee' in subsequent clauses, creating uncertainty about whether the 'Advisory Group' is the same entity. This could lead to disputes about the committee's composition, responsibilities, and decision-making processes.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Committee Member' is replaced with 'Representative.' This change, when combined with the renaming of the committee itself, creates doubt about whether 'Representative' is equivalent to 'Committee Member.' Later clauses refer to 'Committee Member,' leading to contradiction.",

                "original_text": "For two (2) years following the Effective Time, QIWI covenants that at least one half of the total transactions processed by the Contact money transfer system during such two-year period shall be settled through PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie, provided that QIWI may terminate its obligation under this Clause 4.1 at any time, in which case it shall pay to Otkritie a fee equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Otkritie for such period starting from 1 September 2014, until the date of termination of QIWI's obligations under this Clause 4.1 in connection with (i) the transfer of settlement bank function to PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie ; and (ii) supporting the settlement bank functionality for the Contact money transfer system, provided further that such fee shall in no event exceed RUB 50 000 000 (fifty million roubles).",
                "changed_text": "For two (2) years following the Effective Time, QIWI covenants that at least one half of the total transactions processed by the Contact money transfer system during such two-year period shall be settled through PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie, provided that QIWI may terminate its obligation under this Clause 4.1 at any time, in which case it shall pay to Otkritie a sum equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Otkritie for such period starting from 1 September 2014, until the date of termination of QIWI's obligations under this Clause 4.1 in connection with (i) the transfer of settlement bank function to PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie ; and (ii) supporting the settlement bank functionality for the Contact money transfer system, provided further that such sum shall in no event be more than RUB 50 000 000 (fifty million roubles).",
                "explanation": "The term 'fee' has been replaced with 'sum'. The replaced term may imply a degree of formal documentation or procedural requirement for payment or waiving, while a `sum` may encompass any amount of monetary value. Therefore the changed text introduces a degree of ambivalence about the conditions that the payment needs to satify, making enforcement ambigious.",

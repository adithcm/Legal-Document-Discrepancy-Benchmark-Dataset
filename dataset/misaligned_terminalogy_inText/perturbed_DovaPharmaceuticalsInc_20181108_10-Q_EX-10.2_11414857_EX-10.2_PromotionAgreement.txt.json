                "explanation": "Changing 'employed and compensated' to 'contracted' creates ambiguity. The agreement hinges on the behavior of Sales Representatives. Changing their employment status affects liability. This change creates uncertainty in enforcement because the type of employment relationship between Valeant and the Sales Representatives is not consistent.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"Sales Representatives\" to \"Sales Representatives or Marketing Personnel,\" Valeant could fulfill its obligation by using marketing personnel who may not be trained or equipped to perform the detailing activities required by the agreement, contradicting the specific requirements for 'Sales Representatives' elsewhere in the contract. It is not clear if 'Marketing Personnel' has the same constraints and definition. This undermines the intent of having dedicated and trained sales representatives.",

                "explanation": "Changing “Field Force Personnel” to “Sales Representatives” restricts the applicability of training to only Sales Representatives, while other personnel involved in promoting the product, such as institutional account managers mentioned in Section 4.1.5, may not receive the necessary training. This undermines the quality and consistency of product promotion, making enforcement of training obligations uncertain.",

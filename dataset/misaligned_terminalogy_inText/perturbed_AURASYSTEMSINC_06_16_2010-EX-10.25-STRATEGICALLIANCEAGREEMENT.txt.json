                "original_text": "Aura shall remit payment to Zanotti for the invoiced price of any given Product within the earlier of: (i) fifteen (15) business days following Aura's receipt and acceptance of payment from its customer for such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated; or (ii) forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of Aura's shipment to a customer of such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated. Aura shall have no obligation to remit payment for any Product before fifteen (15) days following sale to a third-party of such Product nor shall Aura have any obligation to remit payment for any Product not sold by Aura.",
                "changed_text": "Aura shall remit payment to Zanotti for the invoiced price of any given Product within the earlier of: (i) fifteen (15) business days following Aura's receipt and acceptance of payment from its client for such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated; or (ii) forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of Aura's dispatch to a client of such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated. Aura is expected to remit payment for all Product within fifteen (15) days of sale to a third-party of such Product even if the product has not been sold by Aura.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'customer' and 'client' are used interchangeably, creating ambiguity regarding who qualifies as the entity triggering the payment obligation. Additionally, 'shipment' is replaced with 'dispatch', potentially altering the agreed-upon trigger. The requirement that Aura is expected to remit payments for Products sold to third parties even if Aura did not sell them introduces a contradiction.",

                "changed_text": "Zanotti agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Aura, including its personnel, representatives and subsidiaries, harmless from and against only direct payments, direct damages, direct demands, direct claims, direct losses, direct expenses, direct costs, direct obligations and direct liabilities (excluding attorney's fees and costs), which arise exclusively out of: (i) any gross breach by Zanotti of any express term contained in this agreement; (ii) any occupational injury or illness sustained by any direct employee of Zanotti; (iii) sales taxes actually legally determined to be due from Zanotti and that Zanotti does not challenge the assessment (iv) any egregious act or egregious omission or criminal violation of any official contractual arrangement of Zanotti, and then only if Zanotti's CEO and CFO are direct participants; or (v) Zanotti's direct written and legally-binding agreements with third parties.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'employees, agents and affiliates' with 'personnel, representatives and subsidiaries' limits the scope of coverage. Inserting 'only direct' before payment terms and excluding attorney fees limits the type of liability Zanotti must cover. Changing 'breach' to 'gross breach of any express term' increases the threshold for indemnification. Limiting coverage to 'direct employee' further narrows this coverage. Changing 'negligent or willful act' to 'egregious act or egregious omission or criminal violation' increases the burden to trigger indemnification.",

Any such agreement reached between Zanotti and Aura regarding such worldwide sales and marketing shall prohibit competition among Zanotti and Aura with regard to AETRU Systems and shall be memorized in a separate agreement between the Parties.",
                "changed_text": "Within thirty (30) days following the Commencement Date of this Agreement, Aura and Zanotti shall develop both a joint marketing plan and a joint sales directive for cooperative worldwide marketing and sales of AETRU Systems. Any such understanding reached between Zanotti and Aura regarding such worldwide sales and marketing must encourage competition between Zanotti and Aura with regard to AETRU Systems and shall be documented, but not necessarily formalized in a separate agreement between the Parties.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Effective Date' with 'Commencement Date' and potentially leading to disputes over when the 30-day period begins. Changing 'joint sales plan' to 'joint sales directive' alters the nature of the agreement. Replacing 'prohibit competition' with 'encourage competition' directly contradicts the original intent and creates business uncertainty. Changing 'memorized in a separate agreement' to 'documented, but not necessarily formalized in a separate agreement' weakens the obligation to create a formal, binding agreement.",

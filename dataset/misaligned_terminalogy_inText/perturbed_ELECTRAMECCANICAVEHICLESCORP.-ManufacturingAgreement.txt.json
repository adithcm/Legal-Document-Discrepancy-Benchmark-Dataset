                "explanation": "Here, I am using the terms \"factory\" instead of \"Manufacturer\" and \"taking possession\" instead of \"receipt of the goods\". While the general understanding of \"Lead-time\" will be the same, legal interpretation may be different given that \"Manufacturer\" has been defined elsewhere. Given that the \"factory\" has not been defined as \"Manufacturer\", this will make enforcement harder, especially if the court does not see these terms as the same.",

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, subject to Manufacturer meeting EMV's requirements for quality, price and lead- time, EMV hereby grants Manufacturer an exclusive, non-transferable, license (without the right to sublicense) under EMV's Proprietary Rights in the Territory, during the term of this Agreement, to use the Specifications solely for the purpose of manufacturing the Products to fulfil Purchase Orders for EMV.",

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, subject to the Builder meeting EMV's requirements for quality, price and lead- time, EMV hereby grants Manufacturer an exclusive, non-transferable, license (without the right to sublicense) under EMV's Proprietary Rights in the Territory, during the term of this Agreement, to use the Specifications solely for the purpose of manufacturing the Products to fulfil Purchase Orders for EMV.",
                "explanation": "The terms \"Manufacturer\" and \"Builder\" may refer to the same entity or different ones. Since the contract does not define them, there is a chance the court may see them differently. This creates conflict within the obligation.",

                "explanation": "I have used \"Builder\" instead of \"Manufacturer\" and \"assembling company\" instead of \"Manufacturer\" when it comes to notifying EMV of any delays. Given these terms have not been defined and the fact there are multiple parties now, this may cause some confusion on who has the obligation to notify. It is also possible the assembling company and Builder are different.",

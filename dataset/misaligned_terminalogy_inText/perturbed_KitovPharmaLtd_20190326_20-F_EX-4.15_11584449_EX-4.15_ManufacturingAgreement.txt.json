                "original_text": "1.11 \"Delivery\" shall mean the time when the Product is placed at the disposal of Kitov at Dexcel's Facility based on an **** (Incoterms® 2010).",
                "changed_text": "1.11 \"Delivery\" shall mean the time when the Product is transferred to Kitov's ownership, irrespective of its location or physical state.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies 'Delivery' as occurring at Dexcel's Facility using Incoterms® 2010, implying a clear point of transfer. The modified definition broadens 'Delivery' to mean when ownership transfers, creating ambiguity and potential conflict if ownership changes occur before the physical handover at Dexcel's facility.",

                "changed_text": "1.35 \"Specifications\" shall mean the general guidelines for a Product defined in the initial agreement between the Parties, and are fixed and cannot be altered unless both parties agree by signing a written document.",
                "explanation": "The original 'Specifications' definition allows for changes based on Health Authorities' requirements. The modified version makes them static and require mutual agreement. This contradiction can lead to disputes if a Regulatory Authority mandates a change, but one party refuses to agree.",

                "changed_text": "4.3 Kitov shall have the option (with no need of intervals, prior written notice or business hours, and more often than annually) to audit Dexcel's manufacturing facilities used in the manufacture of the Product, whenever it needs to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines inspection parameters, like reasonable notice and intervals, not more often than annually. The changed text makes inspection flexible without considering any parameters. This can bring disputes on what is considered a normal audit.",

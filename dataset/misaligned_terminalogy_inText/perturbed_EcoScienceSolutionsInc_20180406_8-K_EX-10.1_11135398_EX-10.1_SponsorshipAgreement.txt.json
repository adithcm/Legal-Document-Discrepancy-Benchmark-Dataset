                "explanation": "The term 'Promoter' has been replaced with 'Partner,' implying a different level of involvement or responsibility without defining the distinction. Additionally, changing the payment terms from 'paid in full upon signing' to 'payment schedule outlined in Exhibit A' introduces ambiguity if Exhibit A does not exist or contradicts the initial payment requirement.",

                "explanation": "The original text refers to the 'Promoter' as the counterparty, which is consistent with the beginning of the document. The modified text explicitly states 'Fruit of Life Productions LLC', introducing potential confusion as to whether 'Promoter' and 'Fruit of Life Productions LLC' are consistently interchangeable throughout the document. Furthermore, 'Terms and Conditions of Sponsorship agreement' is replaced with 'Event Participation Policy', a different and undefined term, causing further ambiguity.",

(iv) any changes in company value or brand value.",
                "explanation": "The original text refers to 'Sponsor' for indemnification. The modified text replaces 'Sponsor' with 'Eco Science Solutions, Inc.' at the beginning of the section, but uses the term 'Organization' in clause (i). It remains 'Sponsor' in other sections. Without defining 'Organization', it's unclear whether Eco Science Solutions, Inc. and the 'Organization' are the same entity, potentially limiting the scope of indemnification, and making enforcement uncertain.",

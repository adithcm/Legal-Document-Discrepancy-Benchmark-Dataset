Diligent Efforts requires that: (i) each Party promptly assign responsibility for such obligations to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) each Party set and consistently seek to achieve specific and meaningful objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) each Party consistently make and implement decisions and allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",
                "changed_text": "1.25 \"Diligent Efforts\" means the carrying out of obligations in a sustained manner consistent with the efforts a Party deems appropriate, irrespective of market potential, profit potential or strategic value resulting from its own research efforts, based on conditions then prevailing and as if there were Competing Product owned by such Party, with the objective of launching a single agent Collaboration Product and a combination agent Collaboration Product in accordance with the Development principles more specifically outlined in Section 4.2.4. Appropriate Efforts requires that: (i) each Party may assign responsibility for such obligations to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) each Party set and consistently seek to achieve specific and meaningful objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) each Party may make and implement decisions and allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Diligent Efforts' is modified to 'Appropriate Efforts', contradicting the intended meaning of sustained, dedicated efforts. The original enforces dedicated resource allocation, whereas the altered version replaces it with discretionary allocation, causing uncertainty in enforcing development and commercialization obligations.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Product Supplier\" to \"Product Vendor\" creates ambiguity on whether these are interchangeable terms. While both refer to entities involved in manufacturing, packaging, or processing, the legal obligations and responsibilities associated with suppliers versus vendors can differ, leading to uncertainty in contract enforcement regarding supply chain management and product liability.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Theravance Invention\" to \"Theravance Discovery\" introduces inconsistent terminology for intellectual property, potentially leading to confusion about ownership and rights. Invention is typically associated with patentable subject matter, while discovery can encompass broader concepts that may not be patentable. This change creates ambiguity around intellectual property rights.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'license' to 'permit' introduces ambiguity. While both terms relate to granting permission, 'license' generally implies a more formal and regulated agreement, especially regarding intellectual property. Replacing it with 'permit' introduces uncertainty about the scope and enforceability of the right to use the Association Marks.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Insurance coverage' with 'Protection' in the context of 'Commercial General Liability' creates confusion. 'Insurance coverage' has a specific legal and industry meaning, implying a contractual obligation for the insurer to cover defined risks. 'Protection' is a broader, less legally defined term, potentially weakening the enforceability of the insurance requirement. It is no longer clear that a true insurance policy is required, but instead a more vague 'protection'.",

                "explanation": "Using 'Cancellation' as a heading while the term 'terminate' is used in the body creates internal inconsistency. These terms are not fully interchangeable in legal drafting; 'termination' usually implies ending the agreement according to its terms, while 'cancellation' might imply ending it outside those defined terms, potentially due to a breach, misrepresentation, or illegality. This difference can impact the remedies available to each party.",

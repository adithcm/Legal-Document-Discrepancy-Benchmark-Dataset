                "explanation": "The term 'Company' is replaced with 'Insurer' in the beginning of the paragraph. This creates confusion as to whether the whole text applies to only one entity or two. As 'Company' is clearly defined at the beginning of the legal text, changing this word to another creates confusion. This introduces uncertainty around the capital contribution obligations.",

                "explanation": "The text mentions 'Company' twice in the paragraph, and 'Insurer' is introduced once, creating confusion if they are the same entity or not, creating uncertainty to which entity AIG will contribute.

                "explanation": "By removing the word 'law', it is unclear if the definition of Law in this agreement includes all common laws or not, leading to potential disputes on the interpretation of which laws apply.",

Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement, Owner hereby authorizes and empowers Operator, and Operator agrees, in the name of and on behalf of Owner, to, at its sole cost and expense, keep and maintain the Rail Facility in a condition and repair similar to, but not less than, its condition and repair on the Effective Date hereof.",

                "explanation": "The definition states that Operator maintains the Rail Facility at its sole cost and expense, while the modified version changes that to the cost being solely on the Operator but the expense being on the Owner, creating a contradiction. This causes a problem in enforcement because it is unclear who is ultimately responsible for the expenses of maintenance.",

Operator shall maintain statutory worker's  compensation insurance, covering all of its and its Affiliates' employees and statutory employees, in accordance with the benefits afforded by the statutory Worker's Compensation Acts applicable to the state, territory, or district of hire, supervision, or place of accident. In addition, Operator shall maintain employer's liability insurance with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each accident, one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease each employee, and one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease policy limit.

Operator may choose to maintain statutory worker's compensation insurance, covering all of its and its Affiliates' employees and statutory employees, in accordance with the benefits afforded by the statutory Worker's Compensation Acts applicable to the state, territory, or district of hire, supervision, or place of accident. In addition, Operator may maintain employer's liability insurance with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each accident, one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease each employee, and one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease policy limit. Where not prohibited by law, Operator shall waive its right of subrogation against Owner.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires Operator to maintain insurance coverage for worker's compensation. The modified version allows Operator to *choose* to maintain such insurance coverage. This causes a contradiction because the contract now contains a mandatory insurance requirement and a permissive one for the same coverage.",

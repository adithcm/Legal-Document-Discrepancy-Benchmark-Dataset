                "explanation": "Changing 'Company' to 'Provider' and 'Customer' to 'Client' introduces uncertainty. Later sections refer to 'Company' and 'Customer,' creating confusion about which entity is bound by those obligations. This is further amplified as it fails to define that 'Provider' and 'Client' replace the original terms, thus making any enforcement dubious.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Company' is replaced by 'Provider' at the start, but then 'Firm' is used later in the paragraph. This creates further confusion as 'Firm' is not defined anywhere, so it is not clear if the client is paying 'Provider' or 'Firm', making the payment obligations of the contract unclear.",

The same happens when 'Company' is changed to 'Organization'. This creates an internal contradiction, making it unclear which entity is bound by the warranties and obligations, which will cause major interpretational issues later on.",

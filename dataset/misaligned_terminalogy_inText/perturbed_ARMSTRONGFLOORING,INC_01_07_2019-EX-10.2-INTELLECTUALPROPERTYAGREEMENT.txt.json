                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"and/or as of the Effective Date\" from the definition of 'Arizona Assigned Copyrights', we create a contradiction. Initially, the copyrights had to be used exclusively in the Company Field on either the SPA Signing Date or the Effective Date. The modified version omits the 'Effective Date', implying the copyright must now be used exclusively in the Company Field on the SPA Signing Date.",

                "explanation": "Changing the term 'perpetual' to 'temporary' creates a direct contradiction. The original text grants a never-ending license, while the modified text implies a limited duration. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the license's term and enforceability.",

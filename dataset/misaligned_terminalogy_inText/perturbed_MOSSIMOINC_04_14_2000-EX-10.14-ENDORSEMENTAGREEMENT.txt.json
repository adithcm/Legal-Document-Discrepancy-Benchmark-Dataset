                "original_text": "WHEREAS, Company desires to obtain the rights to use the name, fame, image and athletic renown of Duval in connection with the advertisement and promotion of its products as provided herein;\n\n         WHEREAS, Duval has licensed all such rights to Licensor, along with the right to sublicense such rights to third parties.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Licensor' to 'Agent' in the second 'WHEREAS' clause creates ambiguity. The agreement is between 'Company' and 'Licensor', but now an undefined 'Agent' is mentioned as holding Duval's rights. It is unclear if Licensor and Agent refer to the same entity. This affects the enforceability of the rights granted to the Company.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Contract Year' to 'Year of Agreement' introduces a contradiction because the term \"Contract Year\" is used in other sections of the contract, like section 4(a), section 4(c), and section 7. Those sections will now reference a term that is not consistently defined, rendering them ambiguous.",

                "original_text": "         8. SERVICES OF DUVAL. (a) If Company desires to utilize the services of Duval as a model in connection with Company advertising to promote its products or for personal appearances to promote Company, Licensor agrees, at the request of Company to provide the services of Duval upon a reasonable number&bbsp;of days as mutually agreed upon and at places reasonably convenient to his schedule. Company agrees that it will reimburse Licensor for all reasonable travel, lodging and meal expenses incurred by Licensor or Duval in connection with such services.",
                "changed_text": "         8. SERVICES OF DUVAL. (a) If Company desires to utilize the services of Duval as a model in connection with Company advertising to promote its products or for personal appearances to promote Company, International Management, Inc. agrees, at the request of Company to provide the services of Duval upon a reasonable number&bbsp;of days as mutually agreed upon and at places reasonably convenient to his schedule. Company agrees that it will reimburse International Management, Inc. for all reasonable travel, lodging and meal expenses incurred by International Management, Inc. or Duval in connection with such services.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"Licensor\" to \"International Management, Inc.\" (Duval's agency) in Section 8 introduces ambiguity.  While Section 10 designates International Management, Inc. as the Licensor's authorized agent, implying they act on Licensor's behalf, Section 8(a) originally specifies that *Licensor* agrees to provide Duval's services.  Substituting the agent's name for the principle creates potential confusion about *who* is ultimately obligated to provide Duval's services. Reimbursement obligation is also changed, further confusing the entity entitled to the reimbursement.",

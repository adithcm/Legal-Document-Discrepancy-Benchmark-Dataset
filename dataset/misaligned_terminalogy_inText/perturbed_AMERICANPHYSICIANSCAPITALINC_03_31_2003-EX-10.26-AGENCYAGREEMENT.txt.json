                "explanation": "The term \"Agency\" is changed to \"Agent\" in the introduction, while the rest of the agreement refers to \"Agency\". This creates confusion as to whether \"Agency\" and \"Agent\" refer to the same entity throughout the document and might create disputes about their role.",

Provided that, if a particular risk has been                   submitted to MICOA and MICOA has declined that risk, then                   Agency may search appropriate markets for placement of that                   risk, and may place that risk with another insurance company.",

                "explanation": "Within the same paragraph, both \"Agency\" and \"Agent\" are used seemingly interchangeably, but without a clear definition that they are indeed the same. The change from \"Agency\" to \"Agent\" in only one instance introduces ambiguity regarding which entity is bound by the non-compete clause and who is allowed to search for other insurance options upon denial.",

The                   purchase price shall be two times Agency's commissions on                   business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full                   months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be                   completed within 60 calendar days after the termination date.                   In return for this payment, for a two-year period following                   the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly                   sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals                   or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of                   termination of this Agreement.",

The purchase shall be completed within 60 calendar days after the termination date. In return for this payment, for a two-year period following the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"Agency's\" to \"Agent's\" within the same section regarding the purchase of expirations creates a contradiction. It is unclear if MICOA is purchasing the expirations based on the commissions earned by the \"Agent\" or the \"Agency,\" potentially leading to disputes over the valuation and payment for these expirations upon termination.",

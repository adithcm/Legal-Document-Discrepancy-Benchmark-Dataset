In the event that Company sells a LICENSED PRODUCT(S) in combination with other ingredients or substances or as part of a kit, the NET SALES for purposes of royalty payments shall be based on the sales revenues and fees received from the entire combination or kit.",

In the event that Company sells a LICENSED PRODUCT(S) in combination with other ingredients or substances or as part of a kit, the NET SALES for purposes of royalty payments shall be based on the incremental cost of the LICENSED PRODUCT(S) versus the cost of the entire combination or kit.",
                "explanation": "The original text bases royalties on the entire combination or kit's sales revenue. The modified text changes the basis to the incremental cost, potentially significantly reducing the royalty amount. This creates an internal contradiction on how NET SALES are calculated, impacting royalty payments.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"all Intellectual Property Rights\" to \"certain Intellectual Property Rights,\" the definition of Honeywell IP becomes vague and undefined. It creates ambiguity regarding which specific Intellectual Property Rights are included in Honeywell IP, leading to potential disputes.",

Hence, as of the Distribution Date, Honeywell hereby grants, and agrees to cause the members of the Honeywell Group to hereby grant, to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, sublicenseable (solely to Subsidiaries and suppliers for \"have-made\" purposes), worldwide license to use and exercise rights under the Honeywell Shared IP (excluding Trademarks, the Honeywell Content and the subject matter of any other Ancillary Agreement), said license being limited to use of a similar type, scope and extent as used in the SpinCo Business prior to the Distribution Date and the natural growth and development thereof.",
                "changed_text": "With regard to the Honeywell Shared IP, the Parties seek to ensure that SpinCo may consider using such Honeywell Shared IP sometime in the future. Hence, as of the Distribution Date, Honeywell hereby offers, but does not guarantee, to cause the members of the Honeywell Group to potentially grant, to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a non-exclusive, royalty-based, partially-paid, temporary, non-sublicenseable, geographically-limited license to contemplate the possibility of use and exercise of speculative rights under the Honeywell Shared IP (including Trademarks, the Honeywell Content and the subject matter of any other Ancillary Agreement), said license being limited to dissimilar use of a different type, scope and extent as not used in the SpinCo Business post to the Distribution Date and no development thereof.",
                "explanation": "The original text enforces Honeywell to allow SpinCo use of their Honeywell Shared IP as a guarantee, whereas the modified version replaces the wording to be ambiguous such as 'may consider,' 'offers but does not guarantee,' and 'to contemplate the possibility of use.' This also makes it more limited by making it a dissimilar, different, and no development from their original purpose. This leads to a contradiction because it doesn't establish what is actually given to SpinCo by Honeywell, creating an uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"All Trade Secrets\" to \"Some Trade Secrets\" and \"shall be deemed confidential\" to \"can be considered confidential\", along with \"proprietary information\" to \"unowned information\", the clause loses its strength. The original text protects Trade Secrets and Confidential information but the modified text offers no protection. By changing \"express purpose of effecting the licenses granted herein\" to \"any implied purpose of avoiding the licenses potentially granted herein\", it suggests the agreement is potentially contradictory with license enforcement.",

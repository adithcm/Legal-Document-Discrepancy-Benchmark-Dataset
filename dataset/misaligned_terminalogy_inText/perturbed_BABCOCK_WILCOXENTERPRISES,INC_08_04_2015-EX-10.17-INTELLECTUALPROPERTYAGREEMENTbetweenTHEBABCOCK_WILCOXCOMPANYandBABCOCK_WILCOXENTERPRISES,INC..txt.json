                "changed_text": "\"Shared Library Materials\" means (i) proprietary research reports, letter reports, photographs, micrographs or other materials recorded in a tangible, microfilm, microfiche, and/or electronic form or media, or a combination thereof, which may contain trade secrets, know-how, methods, techniques, formulas, drawings, sketches or other proprietary materials reduced to tangible form, and which were developed by and/or contained in the Research & Development Division library at the former Alliance Research Center in Alliance, Ohio (\"Research Documents\") and (ii) certain documents as designated by RemainCo, located at various locations deemed relevant by RemainCo (\"Reference Materials\"), in each case which are presently stored in certain identified vaults and storage accounts maintained with Third Party vendor document retention vendor Iron Mountain.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly defines Shared Library Materials as those located at a specific location (Alliance Research Center). The modified text redefines 'Reference Materials', a component of Shared Library Materials, to be designated by RemainCo and located at locations deemed relevant by RemainCo. This creates an internal contradiction because the Shared Library Materials definition is no longer fixed to the Alliance Research Center, introducing ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides RemainCo with a 'right of first refusal' to collaborate on nuclear content, guaranteeing them an opportunity to participate. The modified text changes 'sole right to determine' to 'sole discretion regarding the content' and replaces the right of first refusal with a discretionary right for RemainCo to contribute, subject to collaboration terms determined by 'the Company', a vaguely defined entity. This introduces a contradiction: sole discretion implies no obligation to consider RemainCo's input, while the latter statement suggests a possibility of contribution subject to undisclosed terms. The term 'Company' is vague.",

However, if either Party becomes aware of any actual confusion or mistake occurring as a result of their uses of their respective marks, the Parties agree to communicate all details of each such instance to each other, and to cooperate reasonably to take steps to abate the cause of confusion or mistake, and to prevent any such confusion or mistake from arising again.",

The modified text starts with the term 'belief' is changed into 'there may not be confusion', which creates uncertainty. This creates a contradiction: the agreement acknowledges the *possibility* of confusion, whereas previously it was being discounted.",

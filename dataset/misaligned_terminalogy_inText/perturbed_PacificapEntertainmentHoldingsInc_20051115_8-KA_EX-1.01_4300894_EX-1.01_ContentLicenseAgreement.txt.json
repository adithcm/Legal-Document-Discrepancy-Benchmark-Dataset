                "explanation": "Replaced 'Agreement' with 'Understanding', 'property rights' with 'ownership' and 'confidentiality' with 'secrecy'. 'Understanding' implies a less formal, less legally binding arrangement than 'Agreement', undermining the enforceability of the termination terms. 'Ownership' is more related to who owns the brand features and other similar aspects, and replaced the 'property rights' which has a broader meaning. Similarly, replaced confidentiality with 'secrecy' which has a narrower and more casual connotation.",

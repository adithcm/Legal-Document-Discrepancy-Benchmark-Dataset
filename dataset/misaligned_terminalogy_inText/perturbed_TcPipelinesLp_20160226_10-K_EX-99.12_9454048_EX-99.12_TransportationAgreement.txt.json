                "explanation": "The contract initially defines ANR PIPELINE COMPANY as 'Shipper.' By changing this to 'Customer' in the introduction, without defining Customer, creates confusion as to whether these terms are interchangeable or if they have different obligations throughout the agreement.",

Provisions governing a Rate other than the maximum shall be set forth in this Paragraph 9 and/or on Appendix B hereto.",

Provisions governing a Rate other than the maximum shall be set forth in this Paragraph 9 and/or on Appendix B hereto.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation further uses the term 'Customer' instead of 'Shipper'. Since these terms are used interchangeably it is unclear what entity is actually bound to the terms of the agreement. This creates uncertainty and potential dispute over the agreed upon rates.",

                "explanation": "By introducing 'Client' in place of 'Shipper,' the contract further muddies the waters. It is now unclear if Shipper, Customer, and Client are the same entity, and who is actually subject to the obligations after termination of the agreement. This contradiction impacts the enforceability of post-termination obligations.",

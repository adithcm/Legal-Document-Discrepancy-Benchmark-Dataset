                "explanation": "The original definition in section 1.01 defines 'Company' as 'Twin Cities Power Generation'. However, the opening paragraph of the contract states it is between 'Twin Cities Power Holdings, LLC' and 'Redwater LLC'. Changing 'Generation' to 'Holdings, LLC' creates a contradiction. The agreement never defines Twin Cities Power Generation.",

                "explanation": "The opening paragraph and the definition of Contractor are inconsistent. The initial paragraph names 'Redwater LLC', whereas the definition names 'Redwater Inc.'. This creates confusion on whether the legal parties are correctly referenced.",

                "explanation": "By using the term 'Service Provider' in place of 'Contractor', there is an inconsistency of who is receiving compensation, the 'Contractor' or the undefined 'Service Provider'. Additionally, this clause includes a fixed monthly amount for contractor's service fees of 10,000 in contradiction to per note minimum fee of 2,500 and 7.50 per note",

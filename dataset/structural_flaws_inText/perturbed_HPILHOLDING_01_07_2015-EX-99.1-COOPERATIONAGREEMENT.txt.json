                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be one (1) year unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the \"Term\").",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be one (1) year unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the \"Term\"). This agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a one-year term. The added sentence introduces an auto-renewal clause, creating a conflict. While the first sentence establishes a defined term, the second implies indefinite continuation unless actively canceled, making the actual term uncertain and leading to potential disagreements about the agreement's duration.",

                "changed_text": "Each of the Parties shall pay their own expenses associated with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein. However, HPIL ET shall reimburse GINARES for all reasonable travel and accommodation expenses incurred by GINARES' representatives when visiting HPIL ET's offices for meetings related to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that each party bears its own expenses. The added sentence contradicts this by requiring HPIL ET to reimburse GINARES' travel and accommodation costs. This directly contradicts the earlier statement that both parties are responsible for their own expenses, creating confusion about who is responsible for covering which costs.  This creates uncertainty in expense allocation.",

The rights and obligations provided by this Agreement shall not be assignable by any Party.",
                "changed_text": "All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement by or for the benefit of the Parties shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of their successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives. The rights and obligations provided by this Agreement shall not be assignable by any Party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, HPIL ET may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its affiliates without the prior written consent of GINARES.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that the rights and obligations under the agreement are not assignable by any party. The added sentence introduces an exception allowing HPIL ET to assign its rights and obligations to its affiliates without GINARES' consent. This creates a direct contradiction. It creates uncertainty about assignment rights.",

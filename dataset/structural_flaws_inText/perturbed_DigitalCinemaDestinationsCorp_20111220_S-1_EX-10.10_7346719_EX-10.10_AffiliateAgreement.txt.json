The parties agree that, as part of the set-up services NCM will establish one or more connections between the Software and Network Affiliate's point-of-sale software and such other software of Network Affiliate as is required to deliver the Service. The parties agree that NCM will have \"real-time\" access through the connections to Network Affiliate's point-of-sale software to Network Affiliate's ratings, show-time, and attendance information, as shall be mutually determined by the parties (the \"Point-of-Sale Information\"). The Point-of-Sale Information shall be deemed the Confidential Information of Network Affiliate for all purposes of this Agreement. The parties will cooperate to ensure that NCM does not receive access through Network Affiliate's point-of- sale software to any information of Network Affiliate other than the Point-of-Sale Information.",

The parties agree that NCM will have \"real-time\" access through the connections to Network Affiliate's point-of-sale software to all of Network Affiliate's business data, including but not limited to ratings, show-time, and attendance information (the \"Point-of-Sale Information\"). The Point-of-Sale Information shall be used by NCM to provide the Service. The parties will cooperate to ensure that NCM receives access through Network Affiliate's point-of-sale software to all information of Network Affiliate that can optimize the service.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that NCM only has access to specific data and that the parties will cooperate to limit access to other data. The modified text gives NCM access to ALL business data and states the parties will cooperate to allow full access, contradicting the original limited access provision and removes the confidentiality of that information in the next sentence.",

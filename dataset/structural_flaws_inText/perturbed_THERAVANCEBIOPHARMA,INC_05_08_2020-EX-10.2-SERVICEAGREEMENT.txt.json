Holidays 12.1 The Executive shall be entitled to 28 days' paid holiday in each holiday year (which includes public holidays) to be taken at times convenient to the Company and authorised in advance. 12.2 The Company's holiday year runs from 1 January to 31 December. If the Executive's employment commences or terminates part way through a holiday year, the Executive's entitlement during that holiday year shall be calculated on a pro rata basis rounded up to the nearest whole day. 12.3 The Executive shall have no entitlement to any payment in lieu of accrued but untaken holiday except on Termination. The amount of such payment in lieu shall be 1/260 of the Executive's salary for each untaken day of entitlement.",

The amount of such payment in lieu shall be determined at the Company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Clause 12.3 originally states that payment in lieu of accrued holiday is provided upon termination. The modified version contradicts this by stating there is no entitlement to payment in lieu of holiday, including upon termination. This conflicts with the prior statement. The amount of such payment in lieu will be determined at the Company's discretion, which conflicts with stating there is no entitlement.",

                "original_text": "In return for the exclusive appointment of Agency by MICOA to sell its professional liability products listed on the\n&sbsp;attached Commission Schedule\n\nin Nevada, Agency agrees not to sell any competing\nprofessional liability products in Nevada, without the written\nconsent of MICOA. Provided that, if a particular risk has been\nsubmitted to MICOA and MICOA has declined that risk, then\nAgency may search appropriate markets for placement of that\nrisk, and may place that risk with another insurance company.",
                "changed_text": "In return for the exclusive appointment of Agency by MICOA to sell its professional liability products listed on the\n&sbsp;attached Commission Schedule\n\nin Nevada, Agency agrees not to sell any competing\nprofessional liability products in Nevada, without the written\nconsent of MICOA. Agency is strictly prohibited from placing any risk with another insurance company, even if MICOA declines that risk.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original clause. Initially, the Agency could place a declined risk with another company. Now, they are prohibited, creating uncertainty about their options if MICOA declines a risk and potentially hindering their ability to serve clients.",

                "explanation": "This edit directly contradicts the idea that law dictates the agreement's renewal/extension, which is stated in the beginning of the sentence. The changed section creates immediate contradiction with the original text, thus making the statement unclear and unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The original text states MICOA *will* share costs under certain conditions (approved budget). The changed text now states MICOA *will not* share costs regardless of approval, creating a direct conflict that obscures whether MICOA will contribute to these expenses.",

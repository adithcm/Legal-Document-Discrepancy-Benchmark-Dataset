On delivery by Medica of a shipment of Cartridges in accordance with Section 3.3, Medica shall issue to Vapotherm an invoice for that shipment stating a price consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Vapotherm shall pay each such invoice in full within [* * *] Calendar Days from the date of invoice, unless Vapotherm has rejected the shipment in question in accordance with Section 4.2.",

On delivery by Medica of a shipment of Cartridges in accordance with Section 3.3, Medica shall issue to Vapotherm an invoice for that shipment stating a price consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Vapotherm shall endeavor to pay each such invoice within [* * *] Calendar Days from the date of invoice, unless Vapotherm has rejected the shipment in question in accordance with Section 4.2. Vapotherm's payment schedule is subject to internal auditing processes and cash flow availability, which may extend payment terms at Vapotherm's discretion. In such cases where payment exceeds [* * *] Calendar Days, Vapotherm shall inform Medica of the expected revised payment date.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates Vapotherm to pay within a specific timeframe. The changed text introduces ambiguity by stating Vapotherm will 'endeavor' to pay within the timeframe, which makes the deadline non-binding. Further, Vapotherm can unilaterally extend payment terms, contradicting the initial fixed timeframe.",

During the Term and notwithstanding Section 6.2 below, Medica shall not make any material change to the Specifications or Medica's Quality System without Vapotherm's prior written approval. For purposes of this Section 6.1, a material change to either the Specifications or Medica's Quality System shall mean any change that could have a material adverse effect on the safety or efficacy of the Cartridges or System, or that would be reasonably likely to have a material effect on the proper integration of the Cartridges or System.",

During the Term, Medica reserves the right to make changes to the Specifications or Medica's Quality System at its discretion to improve efficiency or maintain compliance with evolving regulatory standards. Medica will notify Vapotherm of such changes in a timely manner. For purposes of this Section 6.1, Vapotherm acknowledges that minor adjustments to Specifications or Medica's Quality System may occur without prior approval, but Medica will make best effort to keep Vapotherm notified.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly requires Vapotherm's approval for any material changes to specifications or the quality system. The revised text provides Medica with the authority to alter specifications/quality as they see fit, which could be against the original contract. Medica is supposed to notify, but if Vapotherm doesn't consent, it is unclear what will happen, and because Medica can do this without approval, this breaks the requirements of quality control.",

                "explanation": "The original text specified that the contract auto-renews unless the other party disapproves, which implies an automatic renewal. The revised contract changes the automatic renewal with 'subject to market conditions and mutual agreement'. Market conditions are not definitive and can be argued. This clause can prevent auto-renewal and cause legal disputes about the intention of the parties.",

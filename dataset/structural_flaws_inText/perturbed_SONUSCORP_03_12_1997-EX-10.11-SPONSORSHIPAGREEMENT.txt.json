However, the Sponsor's right to terminate is subject to good faith negotiations with the Issuer to resolve any issues. The Sponsor can only terminate this agreement if:\n\n                  (a)      any representation or warranty made by or on behalf of the Issuer herein or in any certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement proves to have been incorrect in any material respect when made, and the Issuer fails to provide a reasonable explanation within 10 business days;\n\n                  (b)      any material adverse change occurs in the business or financial condition of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, and the Sponsor has made reasonable efforts to mitigate the change in writing to the issuer;\n\n                  (c)      the Issuer breaches or fails to perform or observe any of the covenants or agreements to be performed or observed by it hereunder, provided that the breach is not curable within 30 days of written notice from the Sponsor;\n\n                  (d)      any order operating to restrict, prevent or cease trading in the Securities is made under the Securities Law, unless the Issuer successfully appeals the order within 60 days;\n\n                  (e)      any inquiry or investigation, whether formal or informal, is commenced or threatened by a securities commission against the Issuer or its directors, officers or agents, if the Issuer fails to fully cooperate with the Sponsor's investigation into the matter; or\n\n                  (f)      any of the conditions set forth in section 5 are not satisfied, and the Sponsor has provided written notice of the deficiency to the Issuer.",
                "explanation": "The original section 6.2 provides the Sponsor with broad discretion to terminate the agreement. The modified section introduces limitations to this discretion by requiring good faith negotiations, allowing the Issuer opportunities to rectify breaches, and imposing conditions on the Sponsor's right to terminate. This creates a contradiction because the original text implies the Sponsor can terminate at its sole discretion, while the modified text introduces constraints on that discretion. This could lead to disputes about the Sponsor's ability to terminate the agreement.",

However, the Sponsor shall be responsible for legal fees related to a dispute arising from legal actions taken by the Issuer, or due to circumstances where the Sponsor declines to sign the certificate after requesting modifications to the contract:\n\n                  (a)      the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for the Sponsor with respect thereto (which fees, not including expenses and taxes, are not expected to exceed $15,000 but may after consultation with and receipt of the prior approval of the Issuer) and with respect to advising the Sponsor as to its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement;\n\n                  (b)      fees and costs of preparing and reproducing the Prospectus, any amendments thereto and any other Marketing Materials prepared by the Issuer;\n\n                  (c)      filing fees in connection with compliance with the Securities Law;\n\n                  (d)      all costs and expenses associated with obtaining an assessment report in compliance with Interim Local Policy Statement 3-17 of the British Columbia Securities Commission, if required; and\n\n                  (e)      all costs and expenses, if any (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses), in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, and the other documents to be delivered hereunder.",
                "explanation": "The original section states the issuer bears all costs and expenses. The modified version adds an exception where the Sponsor is responsible for their own legal fees in specific circumstances (disputes arising from legal actions taken by the Issuer or the Sponsor declining to sign the certificate after requested modification to the contract). This creates a contradiction because the original implies the issuer always pays, while the modified text introduces an exception. This could lead to disagreements about who is responsible for certain legal costs.",

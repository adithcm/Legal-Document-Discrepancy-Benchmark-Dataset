                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof, and will be automatically renewed for one (1) additional twelve month period unless either party shall notify the other in writing of its intention not to renew. Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof, and will be automatically renewed for one (1) additional twelve month period unless either party shall notify the other in writing of its intention not to renew. Such notice must be given thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the original term.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement auto-renews unless notice is given 90 days prior to expiration. The modified text changes this to 30 days, contradicting the original renewal terms and creating uncertainty as to the actual notice period required to prevent auto-renewal. This could lead to disputes if one party believes they provided sufficient notice based on one interpretation, while the other party disagrees based on the other.",

                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be determined at COMPANY's sole discretion, up to a maximum of 20% of project revenue, payable NET 90 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the lead-finder fee will be 'mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY' within a range of 10-20%. The modified text removes the 'mutually discussed' element and gives COMPANY 'sole discretion,' which contradicts the original intent of mutual agreement. Furthermore, the payment terms are changed from NET 30 to NET 90, contradicting the original timeline.",

                "changed_text": "For a period of one (1) year after termination of this Agreement, the parties shall treat as confidential all information; however, such confidentiality is only applicable to information explicitly marked as 'Confidential' by the disclosing party.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a 5-year confidentiality period for all information. The modified text reduces this to 1 year and adds a condition that the information must be explicitly marked 'Confidential.' This directly contradicts the original clause, potentially leading to disputes over what information remains confidential after termination. The addition of a marking requirement introduces ambiguity and weakens the protection afforded by the original agreement.",

This Agreement will extend automatically for monthly periods unless either party to this Agreement notifies the other party in writing at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the then current term. 1.3 Termination of Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may terminate this Agreement at any time without liability by providing one hundred eighty (180) days written notice to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "1.2. Extension of Term. This Agreement will extend automatically for monthly periods unless either party to this Agreement notifies the other party in writing at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the then current term. 1.3 Termination of Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may terminate this Agreement only within the first year, with written notice of thirty (30) days to the other party.",
                "explanation": "Section 1.2 says the contract extends automatically unless one party notifies the other 30 days before expiration. The original Section 1.3 states that either party can terminate the agreement at any time with 180 days written notice, making the renewal section contradictory. By limiting termination to only within the first year and a 30 day notice, this directly conflicts with 1.2's monthly renewal clause that states unless there is a 30 day notice before expiration, it will be automatically renewed, the new change contradicts the renewal condition.",

                "explanation": "The initial clause in section 5.3 establishes conditions under which each party may be held liable. This change introduces a direct contradiction by stating that 'NO LIABILITY SHALL EXIST' in subsections (a) and (c), which involve bodily injury/death and willful misconduct, respectively. Initially, the original agreement stated that direct damages proven would be the limit, but in the changed condition, this is removed entirely, creating a contradiction. This could cause great disputes and legal issues in court.",

                "explanation": "This alteration in section 5.5 introduces a significant contradiction regarding the binding nature of the agreement's obligations. The original clause states clearly that 'All rights and obligations under this Agreement shall be binding upon any and all successors or assigns.' The modified version reverses this, stating that these rights and obligations 'shall not be binding.' This creates direct uncertainty and potential disputes.",

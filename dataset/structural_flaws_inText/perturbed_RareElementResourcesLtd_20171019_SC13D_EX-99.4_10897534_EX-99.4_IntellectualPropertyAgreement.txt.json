                "explanation": "By removing the word \"irrevocable,\" the license grant is no longer guaranteed for the Option Period, introducing uncertainty. This contradicts the overall intention of providing secure rights to the investor during that period.",

Investor hereby agrees to grant to Company a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license under any Investor Improvement and any patent claiming such Investor Improvement, solely for use in rare earth mineral processing and rare earth separation, to make and have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import products made using the Investor Improvements.",

Investor hereby agrees to grant to Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free license under any Investor Improvement and any patent claiming such Investor Improvement, solely for use in rare earth mineral processing and rare earth separation, to make and have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import products made using the Investor Improvements. Investor can revoke the license at any point during the contract term.",
                "explanation": "By removing the word \"irrevocable\" and adding that \"Investor can revoke the license at any point during the contract term,\" the license grant becomes revocable, creating uncertainty about Company's long-term rights to use Investor Improvements. This directly contradicts the original intent and creates potential for dispute.",

                "explanation": "By changing the term to a fixed 10-year period with the possibility of extension only at the investorâ€™s discretion, the contract's duration is no longer tied to the life of the patents. This creates a contradiction because the original text implies a potentially much longer term based on patent life and enforceability, favoring the Company. The modified text creates uncertainty about the actual duration, potentially disadvantaging the Company.",

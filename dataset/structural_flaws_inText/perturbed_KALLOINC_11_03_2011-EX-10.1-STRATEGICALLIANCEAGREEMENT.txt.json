The duration and ownership of the Book of Business will be determined at Kallo's sole discretion on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as market conditions and Agent performance.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that all sales create a 'Book of Business' owned by the Agent, with a fixed 36-month duration. The modified version introduces uncertainty by making the creation of a Book of Business conditional upon Kallo's approval and removing the fixed term, thus creating a direct contradiction with the prior statement.",

Kallo reserves the right to appoint additional agents or directly engage in sales activities within Nigeria at any time, regardless of the Agent's fulfillment of Schedule D commitments.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants exclusivity for Nigeria, contingent upon meeting Schedule D targets. The modified text directly contradicts this by stating that exclusivity 'may be granted' and reserving Kallo's right to appoint other agents or sell directly, regardless of the Agent's performance. This creates uncertainty about the Agent's exclusive rights.",

                "explanation": "The original text protects the Agent's book of business, allowing solicitation by another agent only if the end-user client desires the transfer. The modified version gives Kallo discretion to allow solicitation irrespective of the client's desires. Additionally, the original text mandates 'best reasonable efforts' to protect the Agent, while the modified text reduces this obligation to 'actions Kallo deems appropriate,' thereby weakening protection and creating ambiguity.",

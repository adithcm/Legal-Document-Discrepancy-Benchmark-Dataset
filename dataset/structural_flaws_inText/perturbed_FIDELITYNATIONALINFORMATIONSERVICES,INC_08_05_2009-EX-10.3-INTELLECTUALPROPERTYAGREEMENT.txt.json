                "explanation": "By removing 'perpetual' and introducing a 10-year limit, the text now contradicts itself. Initially, the license seems perpetual but is then restricted, creating uncertainty about the actual license duration.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'Equifax may use such marks indefinitely, regardless of commercial practicality' directly contradicts the earlier statement requiring Equifax to terminate use within 12 months. This creates ambiguity about the permitted duration of mark usage.",

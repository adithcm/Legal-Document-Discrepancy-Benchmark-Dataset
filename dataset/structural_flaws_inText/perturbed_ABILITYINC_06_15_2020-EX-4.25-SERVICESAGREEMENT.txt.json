                "original_text": "2. Compensation. 2.1 Responsibility for Wages and Fees. For such time as any employees of Provider are providing the Services to Recipient under this Agreement, (a) such employees will remain employees of Provider and shall not be deemed to be employees of Recipient for any purpose, and (b) Provider shall be solely responsible for the payment and provision of all wages, bonuses and commissions, employee benefits, including severance and worker's compensation, and the withholding and payment of applicable taxes relating to such employment.",
                "changed_text": "2. Compensation. 2.1 Responsibility for Wages and Fees. For such time as any employees of Provider are providing the Services to Recipient under this Agreement, (a) such employees will remain employees of Provider unless otherwise agreed upon in writing, and may under certain circumstances, be deemed employees of Recipient for specific purposes as determined by Recipient, and (b) while Provider generally remains responsible for the payment of wages, Recipient may, at its discretion, contribute to or assume responsibility for certain wages, bonuses, commissions, or employee benefits, with terms to be negotiated separately for each individual case. The responsibility for withholding and payment of applicable taxes will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly stated Provider is responsible for all wages and that Provider's employees would not be considered Recipient's employees. The modified version introduces uncertainty by suggesting that Provider's employees can be deemed Recipient's employees and Recipient might contribute to payments. This introduces ambiguity and contradicts the original intent, creating potential disputes over employment status and financial responsibility.",

                "changed_text": "3.2 Each of the Recipient and the Provider may, in their sole discretion, terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time without cause. However, termination by either party is subject to a termination fee of [ * * * ], and liability may arise based on a review of outstanding commitments. To do so, providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that either party can terminate the agreement 'without liability.' However, the modified clause introduces a 'termination fee' and potential liability based on 'outstanding commitments', which directly contradicts the original statement. This creates confusion and potential legal disputes about the financial consequences of termination.",

All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (receipt requested); (c) on the date sent by facsimile or e-mail of a PDF document (with confirmation of transmission) if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, and on the next Business Day if sent after normal business hours of the recipient or (d) on the third day after the date mailed, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.",
                "changed_text": "7. Notices. All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers and other communications hereunder shall be in writing but may sometimes be given orally if agreed upon. Communications are deemed given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (receipt requested); (c) communications via facsimile or email are only considered valid if the recipient confirms receipt within 72 hours, otherwise they are deemed not received. (d) Notices sent via mail are deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery or return receipt.",
                "explanation": "The original clause dictates that notices must be in writing and establishes specific methods for determining when a notice is deemed to have been given. The modified version introduces the possibility of oral notices, which directly contradicts the requirement for written notices. Furthermore, it adds a condition that email/fax communications are invalid unless confirmed within 72 hours and that mail is deemed delivered upon dispatch, regardless of receipt. This creates ambiguity about valid communication methods and timelines, potentially leading to disputes over whether proper notice was given.",

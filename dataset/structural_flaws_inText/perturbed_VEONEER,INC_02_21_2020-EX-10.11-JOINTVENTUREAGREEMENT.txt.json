However, the JV Agreement may still apply to VNBJ at the discretion of the Nissin Parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the JV Agreement ceases to have any application to VNBJ, but the addition grants discretion to the Nissin Parties to still apply the agreement. This creates uncertainty.",

However, the release from liability is subject to the sole discretion of the governing court.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that termination does not release parties from prior liabilities. The added clause that this is 'subject to the sole discretion of the governing court' directly contradicts this. It introduces ambiguity as to whether parties remain liable for prior breaches post-termination.",

However, the amendment will remain in effect indefinitely if Honda approves the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the MG Capital Parties must vote in favor of all directors nominated by the board and against the removal of any member of the Board, this is contradicted by the change that now provides them with the option to remove any member of the Board as they see fit. The original text also specifies the MG Capital Parties shall not participate or vote in any solicitation of written consents, this is contradicted by the changed text that now gives them permission to vote in any solicitation. Also, the text explicitly states that the MG Capital Parties are permitted to vote in accordance with the recommendation of ISS and Glass Lewis, the changed text removes Glass Lewis, which implies that the MG Capital parties are not required to vote in accordance with ISS now. This creates uncertainty and could cause disputes.",

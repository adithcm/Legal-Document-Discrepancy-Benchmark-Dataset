                "explanation": "The original text grants the distributor 'exclusive' rights. The modified text adds that the company 'reserves the right to grant additional distribution rights to other parties', which directly contradicts the exclusivity clause. This creates uncertainty about the distributor's actual rights within the territory.",

                "explanation": "The original text warrants the product 'to be free from defects in material or workmanship', and outlines replacement terms. The modified text says 'no explicit warranty' but includes the original's clause that 'THIS CONSTITUTES THE SOLE WARRANTY'. This contradicts itself, because it negates all warranty, but then states this absence is the warranty. The enforceability of product replacement then becomes vague.",

                "explanation": "The original termination clause requires a 'substantial breach of any material provision'. The modified clause allows termination 'for any reason with 30 days' written notice', without requiring any specific cause. This contradicts the clause requiring 'substantial breach', and undermines the grounds for termination. The term that 'Such obligations remain applicable as determined by the company' also gives all the advantage to the company to decide the payments from the distributor, which is contradictory from what it means to 'due'.",

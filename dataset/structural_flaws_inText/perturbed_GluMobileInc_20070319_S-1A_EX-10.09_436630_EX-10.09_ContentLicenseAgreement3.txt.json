                "original_text": "From the first unit sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee's Gross Receipts (as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee's sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products. (\"IA2 Audio and Video Royalty\"). For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may not recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "changed_text": "From the first unit sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at a rate to be determined later, based on performance metrics of IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products. Licensee may recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products. The specifics will be mutually agreed upon in writing within 30 days of this amendment.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed royalty rate and prohibits recouping the Ice Age 2 Guarantee. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating the royalty rate will be determined later, and that the Ice Age 2 Guarantee CAN be recouped, directly contradicting the original clause. Enforcement is now uncertain because the critical element of royalty percentage is undefined and contradicts the initial agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement is ratified except for the parts expressly amended. The modified text introduces a clause that Fox can unilaterally change any clause. This directly contradicts the ratification, and makes the entire agreement uncertain, as anything can be changed with only 30 days notice. It causes uncertainty about which original clauses are still valid.",

These circumstances could include, but are not limited to, changes in market conditions, rights conflicts, or the content owner's requests.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants a clear right to distribute specified content. The added sentence allows Fox to withdraw the content at any time, effectively negating the granted right and creating uncertainty about what content can actually be distributed. This is a direct contradiction because the original grant is undermined by Fox's ability to unilaterally remove the content.",

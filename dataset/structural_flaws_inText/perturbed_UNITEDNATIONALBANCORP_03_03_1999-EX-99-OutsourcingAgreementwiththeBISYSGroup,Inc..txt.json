Gregor,  chairman and chief executive officer of United National.  \"During the past year we completed an assessment of our  information  processing  needs going forward into the next  century.  After evaluating a number of different options, we initially determined that the flexibility and quality of BISYS'  TOTALPLUS (R) system would best serve our needs today and for years to come. However, this initial determination is subject to ongoing review and may be revised based on future technological advancements and market conditions.\"",
                "explanation": "The original text presents the selection of BISYS' TOTALPLUS (R) system as a definitive and long-term decision. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that this determination is subject to ongoing review and revision. This creates a contradiction regarding the commitment to the BISYS system and the duration of the agreement's core technology.",

As a result of its planned move to BISYS,  United  National anticipates liquidating its interest  in United  Financial  Services  during the first half of 1999 after it goes live with BISYS. However, the liquidation of United Financial Services is not guaranteed and remains subject to board approval and market conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that United National *will* liquidate its interest in United Financial Services. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that the liquidation is only *anticipated* and is subject to board approval and market conditions. This contradicts the original firm statement and creates ambiguity about the future of United National's involvement with United Financial Services, potentially affecting the outsourcing agreement with BISYS.",

                "explanation": "The original text conveys a firm belief that BISYS' capabilities are better matched to the bank's future direction. The modified text weakens this statement by adding 'may potentially' and stating that the determination 'is not conclusive and requires further evaluation'. This introduces uncertainty and contradicts the original confident assessment of BISYS' suitability, potentially raising doubts about the rationale for the outsourcing agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Term\" specifies an indefinite duration, continuing until termination under Section 10. The modified definition limits the term to one year initially, contradicting the indefinite continuation.",

                "explanation": "Original Section 10.1 states that Inktomi must provide one year's notice for termination without cause, and that such notice can't be given prior to the second anniversary of launch. The new text changes the termination notice to thirty days and removes the 2-year restriction, thus the clause implies Inktomi may terminate as early as 30 days after Effective Date.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows the prevailing party to recover attorneys' fees and costs. The changed text mandates that each party bears their own costs regardless of who wins, directly contradicting the original provision.",

It is understood        and agreed that Dynamex, from time to time and upon request, may provide        pick-up and/or delivery services for other next-day or multiple day        courier service providers, as part of their next-day and multiple day        service commitment, provided Dynamex' services will not result in the        provision of same day service to the customer of the provider of        next-day or multiple day courier service.",

Dynamex, from time to time and upon request, will provide        pick-up and delivery services for other next-day or multiple day        courier service providers, even if it results in the provision of same day service to the customer of the provider of next-day or multiple day courier service.",
                "explanation": "This is a contradiction of the main point that Dynamex cannot provide same day delivery services for any other provider of next day or multiple day courier services. By omitting a key qualifier in the second sentence ('provided Dynamex' services will not result in the provision of same day service to the customer of the provider of next-day or multiple day courier service') while maintaining the first sentence creates contradictory obligations. The original agreement specifies Dynamex may perform delivery only when it does not result in sameday delivery services to customers of Purolator.",

By stating that the agreement continues 'until terminated by either Party for any reason' we are eliminating the need to have a cause to terminate the contract, going against many parts of the contract in which certain events cause termination, as well as making certain events be subject to cause, or without it (19.1)",

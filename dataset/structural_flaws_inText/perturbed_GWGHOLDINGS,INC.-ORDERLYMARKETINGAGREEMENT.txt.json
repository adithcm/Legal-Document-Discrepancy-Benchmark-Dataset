                "original_text": "1.2 It is the goal of the Seller Trusts to have all of the Shares sold, on a pro-rata basis, in three or more tranches (each a \"Tranche\") commencing not earlier than six (6) months after the Effective Date with the resale of all of the shares of Stock completed as soon as practicable after the Effective Date.",
                "changed_text": "1.2 It is the goal of the Seller Trusts to have all of the Shares sold; however, the Seller Trusts reserve the right to not sell any or all of the Shares at their sole discretion, and the timing and number of tranches are subject to change without notice. The resale of shares of Stock should be completed when the Trust Advisors deem it appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original intent to sell *all* shares. The modified version introduces uncertainty by allowing the Seller Trusts to choose not to sell any shares and gives them sole discretion over the timing, contradicting the original goal of completing the resale as soon as practicable after the Effective Date.",

(a) This OMA shall expire upon the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the Effective Date and (ii) the date that all Shares of Stock of the Seller Trusts as set forth on Schedule A hereto have been sold (the \"Term\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this OMA may be terminated with or without cause at any time after the Effective Date and without liability or continuing obligation by any of the Parties hereto (i) by mutual written agreement of all of the Parties; and (ii) in writing by the Trust Advisors in their sole discretion.",
                "changed_text": "4.1 Term; Termination; Withdrawal of Bank. (a) This OMA shall expire at the sole discretion of the Trust Advisors, regardless of whether all Shares of Stock of the Seller Trusts as set forth on Schedule A hereto have been sold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this OMA may only be terminated with cause by GWG but may be terminated without cause at any time after the Effective Date and without liability or continuing obligation by the Trust Advisors in their sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the termination of the OMA. The original clause specified two conditions for expiration: the first anniversary of the Effective Date or the sale of all shares. It also allowed termination by mutual agreement or the Trust Advisors' discretion. The modified clause states the OMA expires solely at the Trust Advisors' discretion, removing the objective criteria. Additionally, it limits GWG's ability to terminate to cases 'with cause,' while maintaining the Trust Advisors' right to terminate 'without cause,' creating an imbalance and contradiction in termination rights.",

                "original_text": "1.5 After the Parties have agreed on the strategy for the marketing, sale and distribution of a Tranche, the Seller Trusts shall offer the Bank the right to serve as the lead left joint-book-running manager in connection with a best efforts distribution. GWG shall be entitled to appoint, in its discretion, an additional bank as joint book-running manager to participate in the distribution.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 The Seller Trusts may, but are not obligated to, consult with GWG regarding the strategy for the marketing, sale, and distribution of a Tranche. The selection of the lead left joint-book-running manager and any additional joint book-running managers will be at the sole discretion of the Seller Trusts, with no obligation to offer the Bank any role in the distribution. GWG's entitlement to appoint a bank is revoked.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly stated that after the parties agreed on a strategy, the bank would be offered the lead role, and GWG could appoint an additional bank. The modified text removes the obligation to even consult with GWG on strategy. It further eliminates GWG's right to appoint a bank, giving sole discretion to the Seller Trusts. This directly contradicts the previously established rights and collaborative approach, causing potential conflict and uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The modification to the \"Allscripts Customer\" definition introduces ambiguity by stating that customers in a trial period or those using a freemium version of a product 'may or may not be considered Allscripts Customers at Allscripts's sole discretion.' This contradicts the initial definition, which clearly states that an Allscripts Customer is one 'that has contracted for or receiving any of Allscripts' products or services,' regardless of payment status. The ambiguity creates uncertainty about which customers are entitled to certain rights and privileges under the agreement.",

                "explanation": "While the original text grants Allscripts the right to 'modify' and 'create derivative works' of the Installed Software and Subscription Software Services for internal use, the modified text adds a contradictory statement that 'the right to modify and create derivative works is strictly prohibited without express written consent from the Company, which may be withheld for any reason.' This creates a direct conflict, as one clause allows for modification and derivative work creation, while the other prohibits it without consent. This uncertainty undermines the scope of the license granted to Allscripts and could lead to disputes over their ability to customize or adapt the software for their internal needs.",

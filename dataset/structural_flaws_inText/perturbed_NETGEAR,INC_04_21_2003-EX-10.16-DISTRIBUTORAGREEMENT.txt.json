This Agreement will be in effect for one year from the Effective Date and will automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods unless terminated as provided below.\n\nB.       TERMINATION. This Agreement may be canceled at any time without cause, by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice to the other party. Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately if (i) the other party becomes insolvent, files or has filed against it a petition in bankruptcy, or ceases doing business; or (ii) the other party fails to cure a material breach of the Agreement within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of such breach from the party not in default. Upon termination of the Agreement by NETGEAR for Distributor's breach, NETGEAR may cancel all of Distributor's unfulfilled orders without further obligation. This Agreement may be terminated at any time without cause by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "A.       TERM. This Agreement will be in effect for one year from the Effective Date. There is no automatic renewal, and any continuation beyond the initial term requires a written agreement signed by both parties.\n\nB.       TERMINATION. This Agreement may be canceled at any time with cause, by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice to the other party, but only if a material breach has occurred. Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately if (i) the other party becomes insolvent, files or has filed against it a petition in bankruptcy, or ceases doing business; or (ii) the other party fails to cure a material breach of the Agreement within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of such breach from the party not in default. Upon termination of the Agreement by NETGEAR for Distributor's breach, NETGEAR may cancel all of Distributor's unfulfilled orders without further obligation. This Agreement cannot be terminated at any time without cause by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "Section A originally stated the agreement automatically renews unless terminated. The revision explicitly states there is no auto-renewal, requiring a written agreement. Section B initially allowed termination without cause; the revision now states termination requires cause, contradicting the original allowance for termination at any time. This creates uncertainty about the contract's duration and termination conditions.",

NETGEAR reserves the right to change the discount schedule, policy or program, whether referred to in the Agreement or set forth in an Exhibit to the Agreement. For changes which, in NETGEAR's opinion, may adversely affect Distributor, NETGEAR will provide thirty (30) days notice, or such longer period as NETGEAR deems appropriate, prior to the effective date of such change.",

NETGEAR reserves the right to change the discount schedule, policy or program, whether referred to in the Agreement or set forth in an Exhibit to the Agreement. NETGEAR will not provide any notice for changes, even if they adversely affect the Distributor. The new discount schedule goes into effect immediately.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that NETGEAR will provide thirty days' notice for changes that adversely affect the distributor. The modified clause states that NETGEAR will not provide any notice for changes, even if they adversely affect the distributor, and that the new discount schedule goes into effect immediately. This creates a clear contradiction about the notice period for changes to the discount schedule, thus creating uncertainty.",

Distributor should return the product to NETGEAR, [*]. NETGEAR will not accept collect shipments. Any Product returned to NETGEAR, which is not returned in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, may be rejected.",

Any Product returned to NETGEAR, must be accepted, regardless of whether it is returned in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text required RMA authorization before returns and stated non-conforming returns could be rejected. The modified text eliminates the RMA requirement, allows returns at any time, accepts collect shipments if prepaid, and mandates acceptance of all returns, contradicting the original terms and creating uncertainty about the return process.",

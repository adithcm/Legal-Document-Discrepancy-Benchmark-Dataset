                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall begin on January 1, 2000 and continue for an initial period of five (5) years unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section 7 hereof, and may be renewed under Section 8 hereof (the initial period plus any renewal period, the \"Term\").",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a five-year term, while the modified version states the agreement continues 'indefinitely'. This contradicts the renewal clause in Section 8 and creates uncertainty about the agreement's duration.",

However, the Company will have the right to dispose of its inventory of Products existing at the time of termination or expiration of this Agreement and the right to use the name, likeness, image and personal identification of the Professional in connection with the disposition of such inventory. The right granted in this section shall expire six (6) months after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.",

However, the Company will have the right to dispose of its inventory of Products existing at the time of termination or expiration of this Agreement and the right to use the name, likeness, image and personal identification of the Professional in connection with the disposition of such inventory. The right granted in this section shall not expire.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the right to use the Professional's likeness for inventory disposal expires six months after termination. The modified version removes the expiry, now stating that the company may use the professionalâ€™s likeness indefinitely. This contradicts the agreement's intended end, potentially leading to disputes after contract end.",

The Professional agrees (i) to use no golf bag bearing any identification of a competitor of the Company and (ii) to wear no apparel bearing any identification of a competitor of the Company, and will prohibit any caddy of hers from bearing any such identification.",

                "explanation": "The original text strictly forbids the use of competitor's equipment. The revised text states the Professional is encouraged, and that they are allowed to wear/use competitors apparel and golf bags, creating a contradiction in requirements.",

Distributor shall limit its activities with respect to the Products to Customers located within the Territory and refrain from selling or otherwise transferring, directly or indirectly, the Products to any person outside the Territory, without the express written consent of Company. Company shall not sell or otherwise supply, directly or indirectly, the Products to any Distributor's Customer's, except by sale through the Distributor. The Company shall not contact any of Distributor's Customer's for any reason, without the prior written approval of Distributor.",

Distributor shall limit its activities with respect to the Products to Customers located within the Territory and refrain from selling or otherwise transferring, directly or indirectly, the Products to any person outside the Territory, without the express written consent of Company. Company reserves the right to sell or otherwise supply, directly or indirectly, the Products to any Distributor's Customer's, bypassing the Distributor at its own discretion. The Company shall freely contact any of Distributor's Customer's for any reason, without needing any approval from Distributor.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants the distributor an exclusive right and protects their customers. The changed text completely reverses this, allowing the company to directly sell to the distributor's customers and contact them without approval, thus contradicting the exclusive arrangement previously established. This introduces uncertainty about the actual exclusivity of the distributorship.",

Company shall have no control over or any liability in connection with the price at which Distributor resells the Products, and Distributor shall hold Company harmless and indemnify and defend Company from and against any liability resulting therefrom.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall resell the Products for prices within a range dictated by the Company, as well as the terms and conditions dictated by Company. Company shall have full control over the price at which Distributor resells the Products, and Distributor shall hold Company harmless and indemnify and defend Company from and against any liability resulting therefrom.",
                "explanation": "The original clause gives the distributor complete freedom over pricing. The modified clause states the company dictates the price range and terms, directly contradicting the distributor's pricing autonomy. The distributor still must indemnify the company against liabilities, making their independence illusory.",

Distributor shall execute any documents or do any acts that may be required to accomplish the intent of this Section.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly prohibits the distributor from contesting the Company's trademarks. The modified text allows the distributor to dispute trademarks under certain conditions and institute proceedings with the Company's prior consent, directly contradicting the original, absolute prohibition. This makes the distributor's rights regarding trademark challenges unclear and dependent on the Company's approval, creating potential conflict.",

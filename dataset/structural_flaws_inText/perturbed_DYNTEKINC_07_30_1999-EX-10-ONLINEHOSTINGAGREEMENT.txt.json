The changed text adds that extension requires renegotiation of the service level agreement. This is contradictory because it is unclear whether the original service level will be used or a new agreement will be in effect. This introduces uncertainty.",

The modified version adds the phrase \"for routine matters.\" This creates a contradiction. It is unclear whether the Tadeo employees are or aren't Diplomat's agents/employees in non-routine matters, creating ambiguity. It creates uncertainty because it's ambiguous when and if agency can exist.",

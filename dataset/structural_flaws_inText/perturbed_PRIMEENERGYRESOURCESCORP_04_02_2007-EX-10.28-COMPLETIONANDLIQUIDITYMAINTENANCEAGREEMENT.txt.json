The determination of the minimum liquidity required will be at the sole discretion of Prime. To the extent that shareholder repayment has occurred, Prime may consider funding additional shareholder loans as it deems necessary.",

The modified text replaces this with a conditional and discretionary commitment, significantly weakening Prime's obligation and contradicting the original absolute guarantee.

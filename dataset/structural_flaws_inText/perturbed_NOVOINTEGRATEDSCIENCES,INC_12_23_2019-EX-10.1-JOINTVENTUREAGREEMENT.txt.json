                "original_text": "8.1 The initial term of this Agreement shall, unless sooner terminated by consent of all parties, expires in five (5) years from the date of Effective Date. NVOS and HGF may renew the Agreement within two (2) years of the expiry of the initial term upon mutual understanding. 8.2 It is understood that a subsequent renewal of a five (5) year term will be negotiated in good faith and shall carry terms very close to the original Agreement.",

NVOS and HGF may renew the Agreement within two (2) years of the expiry of the initial term upon mutual understanding. 8.2 It is understood that a subsequent renewal of a five (5) year term is not guaranteed and shall carry terms that may differ significantly from the original Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Article 8.2 originally states that a subsequent renewal will be negotiated in good faith and carry terms very close to the original Agreement. The modified text now states that renewal is not guaranteed and may differ significantly, creating uncertainty about the renewal terms and contradicting the original intention of good-faith negotiation and similar terms.",

                "changed_text": "9.3 To remunerate HGF on the basis of a discretionary percentage, up to thirty percent (30%), of net Company income basis on an annual basis, subject to NVOS board approval, commencing at a time determined by NVOS at least 12 months after the first full 12-month revenue period.",
                "explanation": "The original clause guarantees HGF a 30% share of net income. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by stating that the percentage is discretionary (up to 30%) and subject to NVOS board approval. Furthermore, the payment commencement is no longer guaranteed after 12 months but subject to NVOS determination, which contradicts the original commitment.",

                "explanation": "Article 18.1 gives NVOS the right to assign its interests with prior written notice to HGF. The updated article adds a condition where HGF consent is now needed which contradicts the original freedom NVOS had in assigning its interests in the contract. The consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, creates a new point of negotiation and risk to NVOS ability to assign its interest in the contract.",

The modified text directly contradicts this by stating that the terms of the Agreement are NOT considered Confidential Information of both parties. This creates a direct in-text contradiction regarding the confidentiality of the agreement itself, which creates uncertainty and could lead to disputes regarding disclosure.",

                "explanation": "The original text affirms Valeant ownership, the modified version introduces doubt by changing the phrase 'owns or is licensed to use certain know-how' to 'may own or be licensed to use certain know-how', in addition to changing 'shall be deemed Valeant Property' to 'may or may not be deemed Valeant Property at Dova's sole discretion'. This change conflicts with the initial statement establishing Valeant's ownership and introduces ambiguity over ownership of improvements to Valeant's pre-existing IP, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This changes the clause about termination. Initially, it states either party can terminate with written notice. The modified version adds that Valeant's termination requires Dova's consent, making Valeant's termination right discretionary. This creates a conflict because while the clause initially allows either party to terminate, it now restricts Valeant's right to do so, thus making the termination terms unequal and creating uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text specified an automatic renewal unless a party objects in writing, creating an expectation of continued service. The modified text states the agreement may be renewed at the sole discretion of the contractor. The original text allows the customer to expect renewal unless they are notified, while the changed text gives the contractor unilateral power, contradicting the initial understanding of renewal conditions.",

Contractor represents and warrants that, for the Warranty Period, the Products (i) will be free from defects in workmanship, material (only to the same extent as the original manufacturer of the material warrants the Contractor), and manufacture; (ii) will comply the Specifications IPC610.B standard (in all material respects and unless otherwise was instructed by Customer). Contractor further represents and warrants that the Product will consist of new materials.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Contractor offers no warranty on products sold under this agreement. Products are provided 'as is'.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a 12-month warranty period for products delivered. The modified text completely negates this by stating 'Contractor offers no warranty,' creating a direct contradiction.

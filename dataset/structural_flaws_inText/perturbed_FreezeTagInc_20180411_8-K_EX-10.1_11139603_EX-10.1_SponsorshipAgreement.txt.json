Purpose: The purpose of this Agreement is to benefit the Association and advance its not-for-profit mission through a National Sponsorship of Get Fit Don't Sit DayT M. Company desires to assist the Association to carry out its mission and agrees to provide the support described in this Agreement. Company understands that as a not-for-profit charitable organization Association cannot promote or endorse Company's products or services, either explicitly or implicitly. The Association may require that a disclaimer stating that Company's participation in this Agreement does not convey or imply the Association's approval, endorsement, certification, acceptance, or referral of any product or service of Company.",
                "changed_text": "1. Purpose: The purpose of this Agreement is to benefit both the Association and the Company, leveraging the National Sponsorship of Get Fit Don't Sit DayT M to mutually advance both organizations' goals. Company desires to assist the Association to carry out its mission and agrees to provide the support described in this Agreement. While the Association cannot explicitly endorse Company's products or services, it is understood that the agreement aims to implicitly benefit the Company through enhanced brand awareness and goodwill. The Association may, at its discretion, choose not to enforce a disclaimer regarding Company's participation, allowing for implied endorsement if deemed beneficial.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement's purpose is solely to benefit the Association and explicitly prohibits endorsements. The modified text introduces the idea of mutual benefit and suggests implicit endorsement is acceptable, contradicting the initial purpose and restrictions.",

Termination: Before expiration of the Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon: (i) any material breach of the Agreement by the other Party, if such breach is not remedied to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party within ten (10) business days after written notice; (ii) ten (10) business days written notice to the other Party whenever the notifying Party in its sole discretion determines that the continuation of the Agreement will damage its reputation or good will; or (iii) written notice in the event one Party (a) becomes or is declared insolvent or bankrupt or is subject to the appointment of a trustee or receiver or any equivalent thereof, (b) is the subject of any proceeding related to its liquidation or insolvency (whether voluntary or involuntary) which is not dismissed within ninety (90) days, (c) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (d) is subject to any sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to any entity; or (e) is subject to a change of control (whether by merger, stock transfer or otherwise), except in the case of an initial public offering.",
                "changed_text": "14. Termination: Before expiration of the Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon: (i) any material breach of the Agreement by the other Party, if such breach is not remedied within a timeframe deemed reasonable by the breaching party, with no obligation for the non-breaching Party's satisfaction; (ii) thirty (30) business days written notice to the other Party whenever the notifying Party subjectively feels that the continuation of the Agreement is no longer in their best interest with no proof or reason required; or (iii) written notice in the event one Party (a) experiences financial difficulties, as determined solely by that party, (b) is involved in any proceeding related to its liquidation or insolvency, even if dismissed promptly, (c) contemplates an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (d) considers any sale, lease or other transfer of its assets to another entity; or (e) considers a change of control. ",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines specific, objective conditions for termination, including a reasonable remedy period for breaches and objective events like insolvency. The modified version introduces subjective standards, such as a breach remedy timeframe determined by the breaching party, a party's 'subjective feeling' as grounds for termination, and merely 'considering' certain actions as trigger events. This contradicts the original objective termination conditions, creating uncertainty.",

Governing Law: This Agreement is subject to and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia with jurisdiction and venue in federal and Virginia courts in Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia. If any terms of this Agreement are invalid or unenforceable under any statute, regulation, ordinance, executive order or other rule or law, such term shall be deemed reformed or deleted only to the extent necessary to comply with such statute, regulation, ordinance order or rule, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.",
                "changed_text": "27. Governing Law: This Agreement is subject to and shall be construed in accordance with the laws most favorable to Freeze Tag, Inc., as determined by Freeze Tag, Inc. with jurisdiction and venue in any court selected by Freeze Tag, Inc. If any terms of this Agreement are invalid or unenforceable under any statute, regulation, ordinance, executive order or other rule or law, such term shall be interpreted in a manner most beneficial to Freeze Tag, Inc., regardless of the original intent, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be adjusted accordingly to maintain consistency with that interpretation.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Virginia law as governing law and sets forth a neutral approach to invalid terms. The change makes the governing law and interpretation of invalid terms subjective and unilaterally beneficial to Freeze Tag, Inc. This conflicts with the principle of a mutually agreed-upon jurisdiction and creates an imbalance in the agreement, making it unclear which laws and interpretations will genuinely apply.",

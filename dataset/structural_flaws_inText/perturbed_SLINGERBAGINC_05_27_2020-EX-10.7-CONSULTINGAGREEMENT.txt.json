The Consultant will be entitled to participate in any bonus plan or incentive compensation plans (including, without limitation, equity or option plans) for consultants or outside service-providers adopted by the Company. The Consultant's bonus payment level will be set at a minimum of 25% of the annual gross Base Consulting Fee. It is agreed that any such plans will be retroactive to the Effective Date.",

Participation in any bonus plan or incentive compensation plans (including, without limitation, equity or option plans) for consultants or outside service-providers adopted by the Company is at the sole discretion of the Company. The Consultant's bonus payment level, if any, will be determined by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. Any decision regarding such plans will be made at the company's discretion and may not be retroactive.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states the Consultant is *entitled* to participate in bonus plans and defines a minimum bonus level. The modified text makes participation discretionary and removes the guaranteed minimum, thus directly contradicting the original.",

The Company may terminate the Consultant's engagement for Cause. (ii) Without Cause. The Company may terminate Consultant's engagement at any time by giving Consultant 60 days prior written Notice of the termination. In such case, 100% of the Consultant's unvested stock and, if applicable, option or warrant compensation of any nature will vest without any further action required on the part of the Consultant or the Company and the Company will deliver to the order of the Consultant promptly upon receipt of a written demand of the Consultant such shares of common stock or options at its sole expense as become due to Consultant hereunder. The Consultant's right to receive compensation whether in cash or securities shall survive any termination of this Agreement Without Cause.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates 60 days' notice for termination without cause and requires full vesting of unvested equity and that the Consultantâ€™s right to receive compensation in the cash and equity will survive. The modified version removes the notice period and states the company has no obligation to compensation, directly conflicting with the explicit vesting and compensation provisions for termination without cause.",

(a) The Consultant acknowledges that, in the course of performing his obligations hereunder, the Consultant will, either directly or indirectly, have access to and be entrusted with confidential information (whether oral, written or by inspection) relating to the Company or its respective affiliates, associates or customers (the \"Confidential Information\"). (b) The Consultant acknowledges that the Company's Confidential Information constitutes a proprietary right, which the Company is entitled to protect. Accordingly, the Consultant covenants and agrees that, as long as he works for the Company, the Consultant will keep in strict confidence the Company's Confidential Information and will not, without prior written consent of the Company, disclose, use or otherwise disseminate the Company's Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, to any third party. (c) The Consultant agrees that, upon termination of his services for the Company, he will immediately surrender to the Company all Company Confidential Information then in his possession or under his control. 3.2 Exceptions. The general prohibition contained in Section 4.1 against the unauthorized disclosure, use or dissemination of the Company's Confidential Information will not apply in respect of any Company Confidential Information that: (a) is available to the public generally; (b) becomes part of the public domain through no fault of the Consultant; (c) is already in the lawful possession of the Consultant at the time of receipt of the Company's Confidential Information; or (d) is compelled by applicable law or regulation to be disclosed, provided that the Consultant gives the Company prompt written notice of such requirement prior to such disclosure and provides commercially reasonable assistance at the request and expense of the Company, in obtaining an order protecting the Company's Confidential Information from public disclosure.",

                "explanation": "The original text says Consultant has an obligation to keep information confidential. The modified text creates a direct contradiction by stating that the consultant is permitted to disclose information and that keeping it confidential is optional, reversing the original intention and creating uncertainty about confidentiality obligations. It also contradicts the point about returning the confidential information.",

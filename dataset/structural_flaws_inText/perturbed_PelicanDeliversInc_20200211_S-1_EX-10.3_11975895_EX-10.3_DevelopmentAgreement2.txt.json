Accordingly, Client will be the copyright author and owner of all of the Works. To the extent permissible, Developer hereby assigns and transfers to Client all copyright and other intellectual property ownership in the Works. Developer agrees to assist Client, as well as execute any documents reasonably necessary, to perfect the assignment of such rights to Client. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the payment of Fees and a Bonus (if any), as referenced in Section 5 of this Agreement, shall be the full consideration to Developer for the assignment of rights herein. Upon payment in full of all obligations hereunder, Developer unconditionally and irrevocably grants to Client all software, improvements, code and other work produce produced by the Developer during the course of this agreement.

Developer agrees to assist Client, as well as execute any documents reasonably necessary, to perfect the assignment of such rights to Client. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the payment of Fees and a Bonus (if any), as referenced in Section 5 of this Agreement, shall be partial consideration to Developer for the assignment of rights herein.

                "explanation": "The original clause states that Fees and Bonus are \"full consideration\" for IP assignment, and the grant of rights is \"unconditional and irrevocable.\" The modified clause makes the consideration \"partial\", the grant \"conditional and revocable\", and removes Client's exclusive ownership, creating uncertainty about the extent of IP ownership and rights transfer. It is now unclear whether the client truly owns the IP, and under what conditions the rights could revert to the developer.",

                "explanation": "Section 11.1(c) originally mandated the transfer of 'all Works' to the Client upon termination. The addition of 'unless otherwise agreed in a separate written agreement' introduces an exception that contradicts the initial requirement. Now, it's uncertain whether the Client is guaranteed to receive the Works upon termination, as a separate agreement could override this provision. This creates uncertainty about the client's rights upon termination.",

XLI and/or WCC may renegotiate and/or cancel this Agreement at any time during its term, in the event any of the following conditions occur: \n\n1.  Any significant changes to the Benefits Schedule which cannot be cured as stated in Section 2.2 (Termination upon Breach)\n\n2.  By mutual consent of WCC and XLI to pursue other arrangements.\n\n3.  In the event either party becomes bankrupt or insolvent.",

                "explanation": "The original text states a clear expiration date of November 30, 2016. The modified text introduces an automatic renewal clause unless a 30-day termination notice is provided, contradicting the initial expiration date. This creates uncertainty regarding the contract's duration and the obligations of both parties.",

Confidential information shall not include information which: (i) was known to a party without confidentiality restrictions prior to receipt hereunder, (ii) was or becomes generally publicly known through no fault of the WCC, or (iii) subsequent to receipt hereunder, is made available to a party without confidentiality restrictions by a third party who is legally entitled to do so and who is under no obligation to either party hereunder to maintain the confidentiality of such information.",

This is a contradiction, and introduces ambiguity as the information disclosed to the public due to breach of confidentiality would be considered unconfidential, creating uncertainty about confidentiality obligations.",

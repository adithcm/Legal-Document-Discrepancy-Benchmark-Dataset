                "original_text": "The Company agrees that, during the Standstill Period (as defined below), if any of the New Directors is unable to serve as a director for any reason, resigns as a director, or is removed as a director prior to the end of the term of office, and at such time the Investor Group beneficially owns in the aggregate at least three percent (3.0%) of the Company's then outstanding Common Stock (subject to adjustment for share issuances, stock splits, reclassifications, combinations and similar actions by the Company that increase the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock), then the Company and the Investor Group shall work together in good faith to identify and select a replacement director candidate to be appointed to the Board which shall only be appointed to the Board after having been mutually agreed upon by both the Company and the Investor Group. Any such mutually agreed upon replacement director candidate shall qualify as \"independent\" pursuant to NASDAQ's listing standards and have the relevant financial and business experience to fill the resulting vacancy. Each of the Investor Group and the Company shall determine, and inform the other party of its determination, whether any proposed replacement director candidate is acceptable and meets the foregoing criteria, within ten (10) business days after such party has conducted interview(s) of such proposed replacement director candidate.",
                "changed_text": "The Company may, at its sole discretion, decide whether to replace any director who is unable to serve during the Standstill Period. If the Investor Group owns at least three percent (3.0%) of the Company's Common Stock, the Company and the Investor Group will consider working together to identify a replacement director. However, the final decision on whether to appoint a replacement director rests solely with the Company. The appointment of any replacement director candidate is not guaranteed, even if the candidate is deemed \"independent\" and possesses relevant experience. The Company is not obligated to accept a candidate proposed by the Investor Group. Each of the Investor Group and the Company may, or may not, determine whether any proposed replacement director candidate is acceptable and meets the foregoing criteria.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a collaborative process to replace directors. The modified text introduces ambiguity, giving the Company sole discretion and potentially nullifying the collaborative intent. This creates a conflict in enforcement, as it's unclear if the Company must genuinely cooperate or can unilaterally decide against replacement.",

(\"ISS\") issues a recommendation with respect to any matter (other than with respect to the election of nominees as directors to the Board or the removal of directors from the Board) that is different from the recommendation of the Board, each of the Investors shall have the right to vote on the Company's proxy card or voting instruction form in accordance with the ISS recommendation (the \"Other Voting Recommendation\");",

While it is expected that Investors will generally follow Board recommendations, they retain the right to vote according to their own assessment of what is in the best interest of their investment. Even in the absence of an ISS recommendation, Investors can deviate from the Board's recommendations if they deem it necessary.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates investors to vote in line with board, while the new one leaves it to their discretion. The original imposes a specific voting obligation, and the modified text introduces the right to vote according to their own assessment, making the original obligation uncertain and hard to enforce.",

However, this shall not prevent any Investor from expressing concerns or criticisms regarding the Company's performance, strategy, or governance where such expressions are made in good faith and with a reasonable belief that they are accurate and not misleading. The Investors retain the right to communicate with the Company's directors, officers, and employees to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement. It is understood that factual statements or opinions offered in such communications are not considered disparaging if they are made without malice and in the genuine pursuit of enhancing the Company's value.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposed a strict non-disparagement clause. The modified text allows for criticism under certain conditions ('good faith,' 'reasonable belief,' 'without malice'), contradicting the original's absolute prohibition. This creates a conflict because it becomes subjective and uncertain whether a communication constitutes a breach, weakening the clause's enforceability.",

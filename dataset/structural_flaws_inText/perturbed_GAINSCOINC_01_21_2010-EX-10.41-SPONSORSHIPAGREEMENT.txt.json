The Sponsor shall pay to Racing a sponsorship fee in the amount of $750,000.00 for the term of this Agreement, payable  in an initial installment payable on or before February 1, 2010 in the amount of $350,000.00 and ten installments of $40,000.00 on or before the first  day of each month commencing March 1, 2010 and ending with the installment due on December 1, 2010 (unless this Agreement is sooner  terminated pursuant to Section 14 hereof, in which case Sponsor shall have no obligation to make any payments after the date of termination).",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that if the agreement is terminated, the sponsor has no further obligation to make payments after the date of termination. By removing the clause \"in which case Sponsor shall have no obligation to make any payments after the date of termination\", it creates an ambiguity about the sponsor's payment obligation upon termination. This directly contradicts the termination clause (Section 14) which outlines Sponsor obligations. It is now unclear if sponsor needs to continue payments or not.",

Racing represents to the Sponsor that the Sponsor's aggregate obligation hereunder  will not exceed the amount of the sponsorship fee set forth in Section 3 hereof (or such lesser amount as is payable by the Sponsor in the event  that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 14 hereof), plus, if applicable, collection costs that may be reasonably incurred by Racing in  a legal proceeding to collect all or any part thereof (the \"Maximum Obligation\"). Racing agrees to indemnify the Sponsor and its officers, directors,  agents and employees and to hold them harmless from any loss, claim, cost, damage or liability in excess of the Maximum Obligation which (i) the  Sponsor shall incur as a result of this Agreement, or (ii) arises from any failure by Racing to perform any of its obligations hereunder.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"(or such lesser amount as is payable by the Sponsor in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 14 hereof)\", it contradicts the Sponsor's termination rights in Section 14. The original text clarifies that the 'Maximum Obligation' can be reduced upon termination, but the edited text implies that the sponsor is always liable for the full sponsorship fee regardless of termination. It contradicts Section 14's clause on termination where sponsor has no further obligation.",

                "explanation": "Removing \"(i) the Sponsor shall have no further obligation to make payments toward the sponsorship fee contemplated in Section 3 hereof,\" contradicts Section 3's original payment terms and creates uncertainty around the sponsor's payment obligations upon termination. This directly opposes the idea that Sponsor doesn't have payment obligations. With this removal, it's not clear if Sponsor needs to pay for the full term, or if there are prorated payments.",

                "changed_text": "Oceanic Time Warner Cable may, at its sole discretion, edit or modify the above content to align with its brand standards. Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to not edit or modify the above content if it does not violate brand guidelines.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding Oceanic Time Warner Cable's right to edit or modify Watchit's content. The original text strictly prohibits any modifications. The modified text first grants Oceanic Time Warner Cable the discretion to modify the content, while also stating that it may not edit or modify the content if it does not violate brand guidelines, creating uncertainty about the permissibility of edits and undermining the original clause's intent.",

                "original_text": "In the event that Oceanic Time Warner Cable removes the above content and or terminates this agreement prior to December 31, 2006, Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to pay a cancellation fee of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) per month multiplied by the number of months remain on the agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that Oceanic Time Warner Cable removes the above content and or terminates this agreement prior to December 31, 2006, Oceanic Time Warner Cable may be required to pay a cancellation fee. The amount of the cancellation fee, if any, will be determined by mutual agreement between Watchit and Oceanic Time Warner Cable at the time of termination. If no mutual agreement, Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to pay a cancellation fee of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) per month multiplied by the number of months remain on the agreement.",
                "explanation": "This creates uncertainty around the cancellation fee. The original text mandates a specific fee. The modified text first introduces the possibility of no cancellation fee or an amount determined by 'mutual agreement,' directly contradicting the original fixed fee and creating ambiguity about the financial obligations upon termination, unless no mutual agreement.",
                "location": "Section 5"

                "changed_text": "This agreement will be in effect until the end of 2006 and will be evaluated at that time. However, Watchit reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any point during the effective period.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies the agreement lasts until the end of 2006. The changed text adds that Watchit can terminate at any point. This contradicts the first sentence by giving Watchit unilateral termination rights, which creates uncertainty regarding the actual duration of the contract for Oceanic Time Warner Cable. The agreement duration now is uncertain.",

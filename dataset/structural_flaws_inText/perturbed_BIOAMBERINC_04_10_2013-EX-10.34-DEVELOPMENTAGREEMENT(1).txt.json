Cargill will own any Improvement in all fields other than the field of succinic acid and salts thereof, subject to the rights provided in Section 5.2.1 below, and such Improvement shall be designated \"Cargill Improvements\". In the event it is not clear as to ownership of any Improvement as described in this Section 5.2, in other words, if it is not clear whether an invention or discovery is either a Bioamber Improvement or a Cargill Improvement, such Improvement shall be [***] and such Improvement shall be designated \"Joint Improvements\". For purposes of clarity, as examples, Cargill Improvements are those inventions relating to fumaric acid and malic acid. Additionally, where an Improvement has applications both in the Field and outside the Field, then such Improvement, as it applies to the Field, shall be a Bioamber Improvement and, as it applies outside the Field, such Improvement shall be a Cargill Improvement.",
                "changed_text": "Bioamber will tentatively own any Improvement in the field of succinic acid and salts thereof and such Improvement may be designated \"Bioamber Improvements\", subject to Cargill's review and potential claim of ownership. Cargill will tentatively own any Improvement in all fields other than the field of succinic acid and salts thereof, subject to the rights provided in Section 5.2.1 below, but Bioamber may contest this ownership. In the event it is not clear as to ownership of any Improvement as described in this Section 5.2, in other words, if it is not clear whether an invention or discovery is either a Bioamber Improvement or a Cargill Improvement, such Improvement shall be [***] and such Improvement shall be designated \"Joint Improvements\". For purposes of clarity, as examples, Cargill Improvements are those inventions relating to fumaric acid and malic acid. Additionally, where an Improvement has applications both in the Field and outside the Field, then such Improvement, as it applies to the Field, shall be a Cargill Improvement only if Bioamber agrees, and, as it applies outside the Field, such Improvement shall be a Cargill Improvement unless Bioamber contests.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the ownership of improvements based on the field of application. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating 'tentatively own,' 'subject to Cargill's review,' 'Bioamber may contest,' and 'only if Bioamber agrees,' blurring the lines of ownership and creating a potential conflict. The original text clearly demarcated ownership based on the field, while the edited version introduces ambiguity and allows for dispute.",

                "original_text": "This Development Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and continue for four (4) years unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 10.2, or unless the parties extend the term by mutual written Development Agreement (\"Term\").",
                "changed_text": "This Development Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and continue for four (4) years unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 10.2. The agreement may be terminated by either party at any time with 30 days written notice, superseding the four year duration. The term can also be extended by mutual written Development Agreement (\"Term\").",
                "explanation": "The original clause states the agreement lasts four years unless terminated under specific conditions or extended by agreement. The modified clause adds a contradictory statement allowing either party to terminate at any time with 30 days' notice, thus negating the guaranteed four-year term. This creates ambiguity about the true duration of the contract. The added statement overrides the previously established four-year duration.",

The Receiving Party agrees to disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only to employees or agents of the Receiving Party who are directly involved with the Work Plan contemplated by this Development Agreement, and even then only to such extent as is necessary and essential to perform the Work Plan. The Receiving Party agrees to inform such employees and agents of the confidential nature of the information disclosed hereunder and to cause all such employees and agents to abide by the terms of this Development Agreement.",

The Receiving Party agrees to disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to anyone deemed necessary for business development. The Receiving Party does not have to inform their employees and agents of the confidential nature of information disclosed hereunder.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a strict standard for protecting confidential information and limits disclosure to only necessary personnel involved in the work plan. The modified text drastically undermines this by allowing the Receiving Party to disclose confidential information to anyone deemed necessary for business development, regardless of their involvement in the work plan or confidentiality agreements. The caveat 'unless such information is deemed strategically important by the Receiving Party, in which case the Receiving Party can use their discretion' directly contradicts the initial agreement to protect Confidential Information and essentially nullifies the clause's protective intent. This creates significant ambiguity about what information is truly protected and opens the door for potential misuse.",

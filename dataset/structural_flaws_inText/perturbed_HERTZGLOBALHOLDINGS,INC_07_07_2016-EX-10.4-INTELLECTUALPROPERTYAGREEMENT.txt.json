                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Interim Period\" clearly states a duration of four years. The added sentence gives HSI the unilateral right to extend this period indefinitely, directly contradicting the defined term and creating uncertainty about the actual duration of the agreement's key provisions.",

HERC shall immediately discontinue use of the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks upon expiration of the Interim Period, or the earlier termination of this Agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement.",

HERC shall immediately discontinue use of the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks upon expiration of the Interim Period, or the earlier termination of this Agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement. However, HSI may, at its sole discretion, permit HERC to continue using the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks even after the Interim Period, subject to renegotiated terms.",
                "explanation": "This section initially dictates that HERC must cease using HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks immediately after the Interim Period. The addition introduces a contradiction by granting HSI the option to allow continued use under renegotiated terms. This creates ambiguity regarding HERC's rights and obligations after the Interim Period, contradicting the original clear cut-off.",

The Parties shall cooperate to protect, maintain and enforce all relevant trademark and related rights subject to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, HERC's acknowledgment of HSI's rights does not preclude HERC from contesting the validity of HSI's trademarks in a future legal proceeding after the Interim Period.",
                "explanation": "The original Section 4 explicitly prohibits either party from challenging the other's trademark rights at any time. The added sentence introduces a contradiction by allowing HERC to contest HSI's trademarks in future legal proceedings after the Interim Period. This creates uncertainty as to the enforceability of the initial promise not to challenge trademark rights, potentially leading to litigation and disputes.",

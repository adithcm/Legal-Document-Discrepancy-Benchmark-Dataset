The Company and MBE shall jointly own (without -------------------- duty to account) all customer lists and related customer data gathered through the use of the Service by customers of MBE and MBE Centers (\"Customer Data\"). ------------- During the term of this Agreement, neither party shall provide any Customer Data to any third party (other than MBE Centers or an affiliate of MBE or the Company) without the prior written consent of the other party The Company shall initially provide the Customer Data to MBE in acceptable electronic format as soon as practicable following the reasonable request of MBE, and, once MBE (at its sole cost and expense) has implemented an appropriate means to warehouse the Customer Data, the parties shall take reasonable steps to transfer all existing Customer Data to MBE and implement a system whereby the Customer Data is automatically downloaded and provided to MBE on a periodic basis. The Company agrees to retain the Customer Data in accordance with the Company's own data retention policies, and in any case for no less than 13 months from the creation of such Customer Data. The Company, MBE, affiliates of the Company and MBE, and the MBE Centers may each use the Customer Data for marketing and other purposes in accordance with a mutually agreed upon privacy policy and in accordance with any mutually agreed upon privacy policy displayed to customers in connection with the Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company agrees not to use any Customer Data to solicit any MBE-Generated Customers with respect to any services offered by the Company; provided, however, that the Company may use Customer Data to solicit such customers who have a shipping account with a carrier or with respect to services not offered by MBE and the MBE Centers.

                "changed_text": "(d) Customer Information. The Company shall retain sole ownership of all customer lists and related customer data gathered through the use of the Service by customers of MBE and MBE Centers (“Customer Data”). During the term of this Agreement, the Company may, at its discretion, share portions of Customer Data with select third parties, with or without the consent of MBE. The Company is not obligated to provide Customer Data to MBE in any format, and MBE acknowledges that the Company's data warehousing practices are proprietary. The Company may retain the Customer Data according to internal policies, with no guaranteed minimum retention period. The Company has the exclusive right to use Customer Data for any purpose, including soliciting MBE-Generated Customers with services offered by the Company, even those directly competitive with MBE and MBE Centers. MBE is prohibited from using any Customer Data without the explicit prior written consent of the Company.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stated that the Company and MBE jointly own customer data, restricted third-party sharing without consent, and outlined data provision to MBE. It also prohibited the Company from soliciting MBE-generated customers with identical services. The modified version gives the Company sole ownership of customer data, allows sharing with third parties without MBE's consent, removes the obligation to provide data to MBE, provides no guaranteed data retention period, and permits the Company to solicit MBE-generated customers, directly contradicting the original clause.",

                "explanation": "The original text grants MBE a renewal option, with a mechanism for negotiating fees and potentially arbitrating disagreements. The modified version eliminates the renewal option, specifying a single-year term and automatic termination, thus directly contradicting the original renewal provisions and generating uncertainty about the duration of the agreement.",

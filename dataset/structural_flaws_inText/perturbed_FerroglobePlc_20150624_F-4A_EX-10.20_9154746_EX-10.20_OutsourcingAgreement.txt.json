The Agreement rests, for all that, cancellable at any time by any of the parties before the expiry date of the Agreement or any of itsrenewals, upon three months prior written notice.",

This agreement can only be terminated at the end of the calendar year.\n\n  13.2. The Agreement rests, for all that, cancellable at any time by any of the parties before the expiry date of the Agreement or any of itsrenewals, upon three months prior written notice.",
                "explanation": "The modification to section 13.1 introducing the additional clause `This agreement can only be terminated at the end of the calendar year.` directly contradicts section 13.2 which allows cancellation 'at any time' with a three-month notice. This creates uncertainty about when the contract can actually be terminated.",

                "explanation": "By modifying section 7.1.2 to state that the reduction in amount due if a factory closes down is 'at the sole discretion of the EIT', it creates a contradiction with the original text, which states the amount 'will be reduced pro rata'. This generates uncertainty about the final amount due if one factory shuts down.",

                "explanation": "By adding the clause `EIT will also have shared responsibilities in maintaining workstations and printers.` to section 3.4.1, it contradicts the prior clause that `The Customer is responsible for the purchase and maintenance of the workstations and printers.`. This creates an in-text contradiction because it is unclear what the level of responsibility the customer has, versus what level of responsibility EIT has. The wording is intentionally vague.",

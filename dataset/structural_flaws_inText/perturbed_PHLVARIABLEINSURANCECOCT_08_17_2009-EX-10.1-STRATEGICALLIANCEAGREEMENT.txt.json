Except as set forth in Section 10.01, PHLVIC and its Affiliates, as applicable, are the exclusive legal and beneficial owner of and have good and marketable title in and to the GIE and all intellectual property rights therein, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or character, including any claims for infringement of intellectual property rights. For the purposes of this Section, intellectual property includes GIE forms, specimen forms, the features of the GIE, materials filed by any of the PHL Parties with State insurance regulators, and any other forms prepared by any of the PHL Parties or any of their Affiliates in connection with the GIE. There are no claims, actions, suits, investigations or proceedings (arbitration or otherwise) pending against, or to the knowledge of PHLVIC, threatened against or affecting, all or any part of the GIE",

Except as set forth in Section 10.01, PHLVIC and its Affiliates, as applicable, may be considered the owner of and have title in and to a portion of the GIE and certain intellectual property rights therein, subject to potential claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests. For the purposes of this Section, intellectual property potentially includes GIE forms, specimen forms, the features of the GIE, materials filed by any of the PHL Parties with State insurance regulators, and any other forms prepared by any of the PHL Parties or any of their Affiliates in connection with the GIE. There may be claims, actions, suits, investigations or proceedings (arbitration or otherwise) pending against, or to the knowledge of PHLVIC, threatened against or affecting, all or any part of the GIE",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that PHLVIC and its affiliates are the exclusive owners of the GIE and all related intellectual property. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating they 'may be considered the owner' and that ownership is 'subject to potential claims,' creating a contradiction that could impact the enforcement of intellectual property rights.",

The modified version contradicts this by stating the parties should perform their duties 'without strict compliance with all applicable Law.'

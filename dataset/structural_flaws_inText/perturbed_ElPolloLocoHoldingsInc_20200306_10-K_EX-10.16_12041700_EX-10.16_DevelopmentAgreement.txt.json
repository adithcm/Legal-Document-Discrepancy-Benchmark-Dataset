Franchisor hereby grants to Developer, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (if Section 2.20 is applicable add \", and specifically Section 2.20 hereof,\") and as long as Developer shall not be in default of this Agreement or any other development, franchise or other agreement between Developer and Franchisor, (non-exclusive/exclusive) development rights to establish and operate ____ franchised restaurant(s), and to use the El Pollo Loco® System solely in connection therewith, at specific locations to be designated in separate Franchise Agreement(s) (the \"Franchise Agreements\"). (If exclusive agreement, add \"Developer expressly acknowledges that the exclusive rights granted herein apply only to the right to develop new restaurants in the Territory, and no exclusive territory or radius protection for the term of any Franchise Agreement is granted herein and any such protection shall be set forth in the particular Franchise Agreement to be signed.\") The Franchise Agreements (and all ancillary documents attached as Exhibits to the Franchise Agreement, including the Personal Guarantee) executed in accordance with this Agreement shall be in the form currently in use by Franchisor at the time of execution of the Franchise Agreement and shall be executed individually by each person, partner, member or shareholder.",

Franchisor hereby grants to Developer, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (if Section 2.20 is applicable add \", and specifically Section 2.20 hereof,\") and as long as Developer shall not be in default of this Agreement or any other development, franchise or other agreement between Developer and Franchisor, (non-exclusive/exclusive) development rights to establish and operate ____ franchised restaurant(s), and to use the El Pollo Loco® System solely in connection therewith, at specific locations to be designated in separate Franchise Agreement(s) (the \"Franchise Agreements\").

                "explanation": "The original text states that the Franchisor grants development rights to the Developer. By adding 'The granting of these development rights is at the sole discretion of the Franchisor and may be revoked at any time with written notice' directly contradicts the initial grant, creating uncertainty about whether the developer truly has assured rights or if they can be revoked at any time. This change introduces contradiction in section 1.1 itself.",

In the event of third party claims of the right to develop the Territory, it is the sole responsibility of El Pollo Loco, where the right granted herein is exclusive, to protect and maintain Developer's right to the development of the Territory. However, if it appears to El Pollo Loco, as its sole and absolute right to determine, that protection of the Territory by legal action is not advisable, whether due to the anticipation of, or the actual protracted nature of the action, the costs involved, the uncertainty of outcome, or otherwise, Franchisor has the right to terminate this Agreement, provided that it refunds to Developer the balance, if any, of the Development Fee made pursuant to Section 3, which has not been applied against the initial franchise fees for Franchise Agreement(s) to be acquired under this Agreement.",

In the event of third party claims of the right to develop the Territory, it is the sole responsibility of El Pollo Loco, where the right granted herein is exclusive, to protect and maintain Developer's right to the development of the Territory.  However, the developer is required to pay the legal fees to protect the sole right in the event of legal issues between El Pollo Loco, developer and the third party.

                "explanation": "The original section places the responsibility on El Pollo Loco to protect the developer's rights in the case of a third-party claim. The modification inserts a conflicting statement that the developer is required to pay the legal fees of the dispute. By transferring responsibility to the developer with respect to payment of legal fees, it contradicts the initial sentence stating the responsibility of El Pollo Loco and places an unfair burden on the developer.",

In such event, the Development Fee may be partially refunded to Developer, at the discretion of El Pollo Loco, in consideration of the rights granted in the Territory up to the time of termination. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, unless earlier terminated by either party, this Agreement shall expire on ______, 20___, and all rights of Developer herein shall cease and all unapplied or unused Development Fees paid pursuant to Section 3 hereof may be partially refunded to the Franchisor depending on remaining fees.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Development Fee shall be forfeited to Franchisor if the developer terminates the contract. The changed text introduces the possibility of a partial refund but at the Franchisor's discretion. It is also contradictory since both developer and franchisor may or may not receive a partial refund depending on remaining fees. This creates uncertainty by making the refund dependent on an ambiguous 'discretion' and could lead to disputes about the amount or even possibility of any refund.",

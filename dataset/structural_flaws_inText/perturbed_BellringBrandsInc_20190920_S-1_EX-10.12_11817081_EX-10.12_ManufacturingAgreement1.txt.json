At Premier's option, Premier can direct Heritage to, and upon such direction Heritage shall, conduct such Recall Action (and Heritage shall ensure Jasper's cooperation).",

At Heritage's option, Heritage can direct Premier to, and upon such direction Premier shall, conduct such Recall Action (and Heritage shall ensure Jasper's cooperation).",
                "explanation": "The original text grants Premier the sole right to initiate and direct recall actions. The modified text gives Heritage the same right, creating a contradiction as to who controls recall decisions. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes over recall management.",

In all other cases, Premier shall bear all costs associated with any Recall Action.",

Heritage shall bear a fixed fee of $1000 for their participation in the recalling process. In all other cases, Premier shall bear all costs associated with any Recall Action.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that Heritage bears recall costs only when the recall results from their negligence, failure to comply with specifications, breach of agreement, or faulty materials. The modified text mandates that Premier always bears all costs irrespective of cause. This creates a contradiction regarding the financial responsibility for recall actions. Then the addition of the fixed fee of $1000 creates further conflict with the text saying \"In all other cases, Premier shall bear all costs associated with any Recall Action.\"",

                "explanation": "The original text requires both parties to agree in writing to extend the contract. The modified text says that either party alone has the power to extend the contract by up to 2 years. This gives unilateral power to extend the contract term to each party which is contradictory.",

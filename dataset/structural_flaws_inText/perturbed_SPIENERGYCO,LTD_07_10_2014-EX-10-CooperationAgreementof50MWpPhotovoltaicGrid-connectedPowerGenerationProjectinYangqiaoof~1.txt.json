                "original_text": "I. Party A supports and guarantees the project construction and development of Party B, and will provide the most preferential policies and all- round service in the aspects of preliminary work, construction and grid-connected of the project, and actively coordinate relevant departments and units to help Party B accelerate project construction progress. Party B will give full play to the advantages in funds, talents, technologies, and etc. to accelerate the preliminary work progress of the project, ensure the early commencement of the project and produce benefits upon early completion.",
                "changed_text": "I. Party A supports and guarantees the project construction and development of Party B, but the extent of support will be subject to periodic review and may be adjusted based on prevailing economic conditions. Party A will strive to provide preferential policies and all-round service but cannot guarantee specific outcomes in preliminary work, construction, and grid-connected aspects. While Party A will coordinate with relevant departments and units, its ability to accelerate project construction progress is not assured. Party B will make efforts to give full play to its advantages, but its ability to accelerate preliminary work and ensure early project commencement depends on unforeseen circumstances. ",
                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty and contradiction. The original text guarantees support and preferential policies. The modified text weakens these guarantees by making them subject to review, economic conditions, and unforeseen circumstances. This contradicts the original unconditional support commitment, creating uncertainty about Party A's obligations. It is no longer clear to what extent Party A will support the project.",

                "original_text": "IV. Party B promises that land nature will not be changed for building large-scale PV grid-connected power generation project in the plot; comprehensive development will be carried out according to relevant national stipulations, such commercial crops will be interplanted as agriculture and forestry as well as medicinal materials; local employees will enjoy the priority to be employed; local building materials will be adopted and relevant expenses will be paid on schedule.",
                "changed_text": "IV. Party B intends to avoid changing the land nature for the PV project but reserves the right to request modifications subject to government approval. Comprehensive development will be attempted, but specific implementation is contingent on feasibility studies. Local employees will be considered for employment opportunities, but Party B makes no guarantees regarding the number of positions or priority in hiring. Party B will explore using local building materials when economically viable. Payment of relevant expenses will be prioritized, but delays may occur depending on unforeseen circumstances and cash flow.",
                "explanation": "The original text states definitive promises by Party B regarding land use, development, employment, materials, and payments. The modified text weakens these promises by introducing conditions, reservations, and contingencies. For example, changing 'promises that land nature will not be changed' to 'intends to avoid changing the land nature' but reserves the right to request modifications, introduces direct contradiction about the promises made in the original statement.",

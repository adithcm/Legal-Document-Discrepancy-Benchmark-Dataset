                "original_text": "2.       During the initial one year period beginning on the Amendment Date,          Distributor shall be the only distributor appointed by NETGEAR in [*],          subject to Distributor conducting mutually agreed to marketing          activities as described in the Marketing Plan for [*] to be developed          and agreed to by and between the parties and which shall be attached to          and made a part of this Agreement as Exhibit 4a. For the purposes of          this provision, distributor shall mean a company acquiring products          directly from NETGEAR for resale or license to dealers or other second          tier resellers which in turn resell or license the products to end use          customers. The foregoing notwithstanding, during the [*] and any          subsequent period, NETGEAR reserves the right to sell or license          Products in [*] to customers other than distributors such as, but not          limited to resellers who procure Products at centralized locations for          resale to end-use customers solely through their wholly or majority          owned retail outlets, both store-front and catalog. Following the [*],          for any extension or renewal term, Distributor's appointment as          Distributor shall be non-exclusive and NETGEAR may appoint other          distributors in [*] at its sole discretion.",
                "changed_text": "2.       During the initial one year period beginning on the Amendment Date, Distributor shall be the exclusive distributor appointed by NETGEAR in [*], subject to Distributor conducting mutually agreed to marketing activities as described in the Marketing Plan for [*] to be developed and agreed to by and between the parties and which shall be attached to and made a part of this Agreement as Exhibit 4a. For the purposes of this provision, distributor shall mean any company acquiring products from NETGEAR, regardless of whether it is directly or indirectly, for resale or license to any party. The foregoing notwithstanding, during the [*] and any subsequent period, NETGEAR may, at its sole discretion, appoint additional distributors in [*], even if they operate within the same channels as the Distributor, and may sell or license Products in [*] to customers other than distributors such as, but not limited to resellers who procure Products at centralized locations for resale to end-use customers solely through their wholly or majority owned retail outlets, both store-front and catalog. Following the [*], for any extension or renewal term, Distributor's appointment as Distributor shall remain exclusive unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by both parties, but NETGEAR retains the sole right to determine what constitutes exclusivity.",
                "explanation": "The original clause defines 'distributor' narrowly and grants exclusivity to Ingram Micro initially. The revised clause broadens the definition of 'distributor' significantly to include any company indirectly acquiring products, and simultaneously states that NETGEAR may appoint additional distributors. While there's a claim of exclusivity, NETGEAR has sole discretion on what that even means, effectively nullifying Ingram Micro's exclusivity. This creates a contradiction regarding distribution rights and introduces ambiguity about what 'exclusivity' entails.",

                "changed_text": "3.       The terms and conditions of this Amendment are intended to clarify and supplement the original Agreement and should not be interpreted to supersede any terms of the original Agreement unless explicitly stated. In cases where conflicts arise, the interpretation that favors NETGEAR's interests shall prevail. All other terms of the original Agreement shall be subject to change at NETGEAR's discretion with 30 days' notice.",
                "explanation": "The original states the amendment supersedes conflicting terms. The modification asserts it only clarifies and supplements, not supersedes, unless explicit. By adding 'interpretation that favors NETGEAR's interests shall prevail' creates a contradiction about the governing terms. It also creates uncertainty by stating that the original terms will be 'subject to change at NETGEAR's discretion', allowing them to change at will without negotiation, completely undermining the original agreement's stability.",

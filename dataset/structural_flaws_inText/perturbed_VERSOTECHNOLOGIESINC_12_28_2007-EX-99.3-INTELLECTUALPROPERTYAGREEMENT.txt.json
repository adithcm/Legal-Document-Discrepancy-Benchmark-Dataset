                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Buyer has designated Backhaul as a Buyer Designee for purposes of the Asset Purchase Agreement, and Buyer has assigned to Backhaul the right to potentially receive some of the Purchased Assets pursuant to that certain Assignment of Asset Purchase Agreement between Buyer and Backhaul dated as of the date hereof.\n\nASSIGNMENT:\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, Seller may transfer, sell, assign, convey and deliver to Backhaul some right, title and interest in, to and under the Assigned Intellectual Property, potentially including the Trademarks and Patents set forth on Schedules A and B hereof, respectively, and potentially some goodwill of the Purchased Business associated therewith.",
                "explanation": "The original text definitively states that Backhaul has the right to receive Purchased Assets and that Seller transfers all right, title, and interest in the Assigned Intellectual Property. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating Backhaul might receive 'some' assets and the seller 'may' transfer 'some' rights, thereby contradicting the initial definitive statements and creating ambiguity about the extent of the assignment.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the seller 'will' take actions to transfer all rights to the intellectual property. The modified text replaces 'will' with 'may' and changes 'all right, title, and interest' to 'some title to some right,' creating a contradiction. This makes the obligation to transfer uncertain and introduces ambiguity as to what extent the intellectual property rights are actually being transferred.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the IP agreement is subject to the Asset Purchase Agreement and doesn't supersede it, fully documenting the assignment. The changed text contradicts this by saying the IP agreement is subject in 'certain respects,' 'potentially intended' to document only 'some' of the IP, and 'may supersede' some of the obligations of the original agreement. This creates uncertainty about the relationship between the agreements and the completeness of the assignment.",

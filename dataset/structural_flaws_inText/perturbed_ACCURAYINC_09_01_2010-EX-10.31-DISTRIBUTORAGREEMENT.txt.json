The  following terms, as used herein, have the following meaning:\n     1.1. \"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions (as of the Effective Date) of the Americas (North America and South America),  APAC (Asia Pacific, including Australia and other than India and Japan), EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East, and Africa), and  Japan.",

For the avoidance of doubt, 'Accuray Regions' shall only refer to North America.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by first defining 'Accuray Regions' to include multiple geographic areas and then immediately restricting the definition to only North America. This creates ambiguity about the scope of the regions, impacting obligations tied to specific regions within the contract.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Accuray retains the right to appoint additional exclusive distributors within specific geographic territories, even if those territories overlap with the Distributor's existing customer base. By way of clarification, this Agreement  does not relate to any Cayman Product, including, without limitation, the distribution or sale thereof or any services related thereto.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation creates a contradiction by stating the distributor is a 'non-exclusive, worldwide distributor' and then adding that Accuray can appoint exclusive distributors that may overlap with the distributor's territory. This introduces uncertainty regarding the distributor's rights and market access.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradiction in the warranty terms. It starts by defining a specific warranty period (1 year following installation, up to 18 months after shipment), and then adds a statement guaranteeing the system will be free from defects for the product's 'expected lifetime.' This contradicts the defined warranty period, creating confusion about the duration of the warranty coverage.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive one year periods unless either party gives written notice of termination to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of expiration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall be earlier terminated (x) by mutual agreement of the parties, or (y) at any time upon sixty (60) days advance written notice to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be renewed for successive one year periods as determined by COOL TECH unless either party gives written notice of termination to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of expiration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall be earlier terminated (x) by mutual agreement of the parties, or (y) at any time upon sixty (60) days advance written notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement 'shall be automatically renewed,' but the revised version introduces uncertainty by stating it 'may be renewed... as determined by COOL TECH,' effectively giving COOL TECH unilateral control over renewal, contradicting the initial implication of automatic renewal and potentially harming VET TECH's expectations.",

                "original_text": "COOL TECH and VET TECH agree not to engage in any attempt whatsoever, to hire, or to engage as independent contractors, the other's employees or independent contractors during the term of this Agreement and for a period of six (6) months following expiration or termination of this Agreement except as may be mutually agreed in writing.",
                "changed_text": "COOL TECH and VET TECH may engage in attempts to hire the other's employees or independent contractors during the term of this agreement and for a period of six months following the expiration or termination of this agreement. Should either party wish to engage with the other parties' employees then it may be permissible with 30 days notification. This would be considered on a case by case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly prohibits soliciting the other party's employees. The change directly contradicts this by stating that COOL TECH and VET TECH 'may engage in attempts to hire' employees. This creates ambiguity and allows for actions that were previously forbidden.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may assign this Agreement or any rights, duties or obligations hereunder to any other person and/or entity. The assigning party will endeavor to seek written approval from the other party; however, the assignment may proceed at the assigning party's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly restricts assignment without prior express written approval. The change directly contradicts this by stating that either party may assign the agreement or any rights, duties or obligations hereunder. The new text only 'endeavors' to seek written approval, but allows the assignment to proceed anyway, rendering the need for approval meaningless and creating conflict.",

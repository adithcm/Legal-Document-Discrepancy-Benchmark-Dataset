                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "XIMAGE will maintain a 24 hour a day reporting facility to accept calls from MORPHO. XIMAGE agrees to respond to any telephone call made, within 30 minutes.",
                "changed_text": "XIMAGE will maintain a reporting facility to accept calls from MORPHO during regular business hours. XIMAGE will attempt to respond to any telephone call made, within a reasonable timeframe.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 24/7 reporting facility with a 30-minute response time. The modified text changes this to a reporting facility during business hours and removes the guaranteed 30-minute response, creating uncertainty about the level of support provided.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall automatically renew for consecutive one (1) year terms      at XIMAGE's then prevailing rates at the end of each one (1) year term      unless either party gives at least sixty (60) days prior written notice      of the non-renewal of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may renew for consecutive one (1) year terms at rates to be determined. Renewal shall depend on performance and ongoing needs. Either party may provide notice regarding renewal expectations.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly stated that the agreement automatically renews unless canceled with 60 days notice. The modified version removes the certainty of auto-renewal, making it discretionary and dependent on unspecified factors (performance and ongoing needs). This weakens the clause, introduces ambiguity regarding renewal terms, and contradicts the implied guarantee of continuation in the original version.",

            {

                "original_text": "MORPHO shall pay all charges under this Agreement, including the total Annual Maintenance Charge, within thirty (30) days after receipt of a valid invoice from XIMAGE. Thereafter, the then      applicable Annual Maintenance Charge shall be invoiced to, and paid by MORPHO prior to the beginning of the next annual maintenance period. All other charges under this Agreement shall be invoiced by XIMAGE and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after receipt of the invoice.",
                "changed_text": "MORPHO shall make reasonable efforts to remit payment within a customary timeframe. MORPHO's payment schedule will be influenced by its financial circumstances. XIMAGE shall offer standard payment options for invoices. These will be subject to revision.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes clear payment terms of 30 days after invoicing. The modified version contradicts these terms. It replaces a strict payment deadline with vague language ('reasonable efforts,' 'customary timeframe,' 'financial circumstances'), undermining the payment obligation. XIMAGE's commitment to offering payment options is also weakened by reserving the right of 'revision.'",

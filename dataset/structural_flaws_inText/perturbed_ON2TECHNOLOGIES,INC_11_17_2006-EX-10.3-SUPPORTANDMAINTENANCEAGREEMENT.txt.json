Receiving Party shall protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure by exercising the same degree of care that Receiving Party uses with respect to information of its own of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care, until five (5) years from the later of the Effective Date or the date of receipt of such Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, with respect to Receiving Party's employees, Receiving Party shall only disclose Confidential Information to a Receiving Party employee who has a need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement or any customer sublicense and is informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information. The foregoing notwithstanding, each Party shall be liable for any failure by such Party's employees, agents or representatives to comply with the provisions of this Section 5 as fully as if such employees, agents or representatives were a party to this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states a five-year confidentiality period, while the modified version reduces it to one year, creating a contradiction about the duration of confidentiality. Additionally, while the original text holds parties strictly liable for employee breaches, the modified text removes strict liability by introducing a 'gross negligence' standard, and removes 'as fully as if such employees, agents or representatives were a party to this Agreement' contradicting the previous, stricter enforcement terms.",

Each of the Deliverables shall be deemed accepted by On2 unless On2 delivers to Wildform a Nonconformance Notice within thirty (30) business days of the delivery of such Deliverable. In the event that Wildform receives such Nonconformance Notice from On2, Wildform shall make commercially reasonable efforts to modify such Deliverable and re-deliver it to On2 after any such modification is completed.

                "explanation": "Several contradictions are introduced: First, the original text requires On2 to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate, while the modified version states On2 has no obligation to cooperate. Second, the acceptance period is reduced from 30 to 5 business days. Third, the notice required is changed from non-conformance in writing to conformance orally, creating ambiguity. Fourth, the original texts states 'Each of the Deliverables shall be deemed accepted by On2 unless On2 delivers to Wildform a Nonconformance Notice within thirty (30) business days of the delivery of such Deliverable' to  'Each of the Deliverables shall be deemed not accepted by On2 unless On2 delivers to Wildform a Conformance Notice within five (5) business days of the delivery of such Deliverable.'

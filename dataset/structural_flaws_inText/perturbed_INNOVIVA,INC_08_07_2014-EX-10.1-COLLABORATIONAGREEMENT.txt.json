                "original_text": "11.2.4 Having carried out and completed diligent searches in relation to the GSK Patents, and other than as disclosed to Theravance's counsel by GSK's counsel, GSK is not aware, nor has been made aware, of any conflict or likely future conflict with the intellectual property rights of any Third Party with respect to GSK Patents.",
                "changed_text": "11.2.4 Having carried out preliminary searches in relation to the GSK Patents, and other than as disclosed to Theravance's counsel by GSK's counsel, GSK may be aware of potential future conflicts with the intellectual property rights of Third Parties with respect to GSK Patents. The extent and impact of these conflicts are currently under review.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that GSK is 'not aware' of any likely future conflict. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by stating that GSK 'may be aware of potential future conflicts,' which contradicts the original statement and creates uncertainty about the patent landscape.",

Except as specified in Section 3.1.5(b), all decisions of the Joint Steering Committee shall be made by consensus, with the representatives from each Party presenting a unified position on behalf of such Party. The Joint Steering Committee shall use Diligent Efforts to resolve the matters within its roles and functions or otherwise referred to it.",

Final decisions on all matters, including those listed in Section 3.1.3, remain at the sole discretion of GSK, informed by the Joint Steering Committee's input. The Joint Steering Committee should aim to provide useful advice, but its role is advisory only.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates that decisions are made by consensus. The modified version gives GSK sole decision-making power, contradicting the consensus-based approach outlined earlier. This creates confusion over the actual decision-making process.",

GSK shall bear all costs and expenses associated with the Development of Collaboration Products for Commercialization including those incurred by Theravance (or to which it has become obligated) after the signature date of this Agreement and which previously have been discussed with and agreed to by GSK and, so far as the aforementioned Theravance costs are concerned, for the avoidance of doubt, the maximum amount shall not exceed U.S. $2,940,000.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that GSK will bear *all* costs. The modified clause introduces the possibility of Theravance contributing to these costs 'at GSK's discretion,' which contradicts the original agreement and makes it unclear who is financially responsible for the development.",

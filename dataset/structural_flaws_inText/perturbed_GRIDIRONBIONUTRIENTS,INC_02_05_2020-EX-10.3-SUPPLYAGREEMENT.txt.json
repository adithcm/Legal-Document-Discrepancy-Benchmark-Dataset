                "explanation": "The original text allows either party to terminate the agreement before delivery. The modified text contradicts this by requiring mutual written consent for termination and introducing a penalty for unilateral termination, creating uncertainty about the conditions under which the agreement can be terminated.",

Biomass must contain a minimum of six percent (6%) total Cannabidiol (CBD/and or CBDA) and all Biomass must have less than three percent (3%) total TCH content.",

While the intended purchase volume is approximately 30,000 lbs, the actual purchased quantity may vary based on Shi Farms production. Biomass must contain a minimum of six percent (6%) total Cannabidiol (CBD/and or CBDA); however, Gridiron may accept biomass with lower CBD content, subject to price negotiation. All Biomass must have less than three percent (3%) total TCH content.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed quantity of 30,000 lbs and a minimum CBD content of 6%. The modified text contradicts this by stating the quantity may vary based on production and that Gridiron may accept lower CBD content subject to negotiation. This makes the agreement's key terms (quantity and CBD content) uncertain and subject to change, creating potential disputes.",

The initial payment will be 10% of the total cost. The remainder of the total cost will be due in 30 days following Gridiron's satisfaction with the final product. If the delivered product does not meet the requirements, a partial or no payment shall be made.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment upon execution of the agreement. The modified text contradicts this by introducing a payment schedule with initial payment followed by final payment dependent on Gridiron's satisfaction with the product, creating a different payment term. If the product is not up to standard, it contradicts the prior requirement for full payment upon execution.",

Allied's License to Newegg 5.1 Allied grants Newegg a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-transferable, and non- sublicensable worldwide license to use, publicly display, transmit, broadcast, stream, distribute and reproduce the Allied Marks in all approved forms and in manners for the purposes of this Agreement during the Term. Allied acknowledges and agrees that Newegg shall not pay any fees or royalties for the license of the Allied Marks, except the Sponsorship Fee specified in Schedule 3. 5.2 Without limitation of any other provision of this Agreement, failure by Allied to comply with the provisions of Sections 5.1 shall be deemed as a material breach of this Agreement and Newegg has the right to terminate this Agreement subject first to the cure provisions in Section 14.1 and be discharged from any further obligation to pay the Sponsorship Fee. If any portion of the Sponsorship Fee shall have previously been paid for any period following such termination by Newegg, the Sponsorship Fee shall be prorated and Allied shall immediately refund the portion corresponding to the unused period of the Term.",

Allied acknowledges and agrees that Newegg shall pay royalties for the license of the Allied Marks, in addition to the Sponsorship Fee specified in Schedule 3. The royalty amount and payment schedule for these licenses will be mutually agreed upon by both parties in writing at least 30 days prior to each calendar quarter. 5.2 Without limitation of any other provision of this Agreement, failure by Allied to comply with the provisions of Sections 5.1 shall be deemed as a material breach of this Agreement and Newegg has the right to terminate this Agreement subject first to the cure provisions in Section 14.1 and be discharged from any further obligation to pay the Sponsorship Fee.

                "explanation": "The original text states that Newegg shall not pay any fees or royalties for the license of the Allied Marks, except the Sponsorship Fee. The modified version introduces a direct contradiction by stating that Newegg *shall* pay royalties in *addition* to the Sponsorship Fee. Furthermore, it removes the refund provision upon termination, directly contradicting what was initially agreed upon.",

Exclusivity of Sponsorship Rights for Newegg 7.1 In all of Allied's actions and publications (in all media and formats) in connection with the marketing and conducting of the Events, where possible and appropriate, Allied shall where reasonably practicable communicate that Newegg is the exclusive sponsor of the Arena for the technology e-commerce and online retailer categories. 7.2 Allied shall not endorse, or permit the marketing of any other company whose principal business is as an e-commerce provider at or in connection with the Arena. For purposes of clarity, this is not meant to prohibit incidental third-party endorsements not controlled by Allied such as individual player and team sponsorships of participants in events at the Arena.",

For purposes of clarity, this now includes any third-party endorsements controlled by Allied such as individual player and team sponsorships of participants in events at the Arena.",
                "explanation": "The original text promises exclusivity to Newegg as the sponsor. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that Newegg's exclusive sponsor status is at Allied's discretion, thus removing any guarantees of exclusivity. Also, it changes the second part to permit endorsement and marketing from other competitors which opposes the premise of exclusivity.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that Party A 'shall' charge Party B a fee based on income. The modified text introduces uncertainty by saying Party A 'may' charge a fee, and the amount is at Party A's discretion. This contradicts the initial mandatory charging of the fee based on income, thus creating confusion.",

                "explanation": "The original text makes it mandatory for Party B to pay service fees based on power generated. The modified text makes this payment discretionary, contradicting the original obligation and creating uncertainty regarding payment terms. This can lead to disputes over when and how much Party B should pay. Also it states that Party B 'might' pay for power generated, while the original text states that Party B 'shall' pay.",

Party A makes no guarantees as to the operation, steady or otherwise, of the CDQ and CDQ waste heat power generating systems.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Party B 'shall provide steady qualified coal coke' and Party A 'guarantees steady operation'. The modified text removes the certainty by only requiring 'commercially reasonable efforts' from Party B and negates any guarantees from Party A. This creates a contradiction regarding both Party B's obligation to provide qualified coke and Party A's assurance for steady system operation.",

The term \"Credit Data\" means data of any borrower or loan applicant of Client or BNC Mortgage, Inc., or any of their affiliates, or any of their customers or brokers, provided that such data (i) consists only of raw credit data regarding the creditworthiness of such a borrower or loan applicant provided by third party credit repositories which currently consists of TransUnion Credit Information Services, Equifax Credit Information Services or Experien Information Services that is submitted, transmitted or in any way sent through the Interface and is the later of (I) the later of 31 days old from that date of receipt thereof by TrueLink or that date on which such data is \"archived\" pursuant to TrueLink's internal operating procedures consistently applied or (II) such date as may be agreed to between Client and Keith Guy provided that the parties acknowledge that such parties will discuss a date on which such data is similarly \"archived\" third party credit repositories as referred in this subparagraph (d) and (ii) is not combined, compared with or against, integrated or presented in any way with any Client Proprietary Information.",

The term \"Credit Data\" means data of any borrower or loan applicant of Client or BNC Mortgage, Inc., or any of their affiliates, or any of their customers or brokers. All credit data must be scrubbed of personal identifiers.  Notwithstanding the above, Credit Data may also include data derived from Client Proprietary Information when deemed necessary for system optimization at TrueLink's sole discretion. The age and archival status of Credit Data will be determined solely by TrueLink's internal policies, overriding any prior or future agreements.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Credit Data' imposes restrictions on its composition and archival period. The modified definition broadens the scope to include potentially integrated Client Proprietary Information and removes the prior age restrictions, granting TrueLink sole discretion. This contradicts the original, leading to uncertainty about what constitutes 'Credit Data' and how it can be used.",

                "explanation": "The original text states ordering credit reports is mandatory and TrueLink is not liable for data accuracy. The modified version makes ordering discretionary and states that TrueLink is liable for the accuracy of the data. This contradiction creates uncertainty around both Client's obligation to order and TrueLink's responsibility regarding data accuracy.",

This Agreement will take effect on the Effective Date and remain in effect for a period of 1 year; provided, that Sections 2 and 3 level shall terminate promptly upon (a) any action or omission by Client or any of its customers which constitutes a breach of or default by TrueLink under any System Agreement or Credit Repository Agreement, which breach or default has either not been cured or cannot be cured within the applicable cure period and the consequences of which is that TrueLink will lose material rights it had pursuant to said Agreements or (b) any violations or breach by Client of Sections 8a - 8c. This Agreement shall renew automatically thereafter for successive one year periods until terminated pursuant to Section 12 herein or unless either Client or TrueLink deliver to the other written notice of intent not to renew no later than thirty (30) days prior to the end of said year. If Client decides to discontinue its Hosting Service, Client is responsible for arranging for a new name server within 30 days. In case of discontinued Service, Client shall retain full ownership of all domains associated with Client and Client Content. If Client decides to discontinue Hosting Service, Client is responsible for arranging for a new hosting environment within 60 days.",

This agreement shall automatically renew indefinitely unless TrueLink unilaterally decides to terminate the agreement without cause, which can occur at any time.  Upon termination, all client domains and client content immediately become the property of TrueLink without recourse or compensation. Client has no responsibility to arrange anything related to hosting. If Client decides to discontinue its Hosting Service, TrueLink is fully responsible for everything.",
                "explanation": "Original text details a 1-year term with automatic renewal and conditions for early termination, requiring notice for non-renewal and setting responsibility with client. The modified version says termination can occur at any time by either party, then contradicts itself saying TrueLink can unilaterally terminate without cause. It also states upon termination client assets become TrueLink's, and contradicts prior responsibilities for client related to hosting.",

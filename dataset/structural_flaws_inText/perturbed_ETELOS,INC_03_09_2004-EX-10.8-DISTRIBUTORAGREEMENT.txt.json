                "changed_text": "2.5 Distributor's appointment is for a term of one year from the Effective Date, and will not be automatically renewed. Renewal is subject to mutual agreement by both parties one month prior to the expiration of the initial or any renewal terms.",
                "explanation": "Section 2.5 originally stated the agreement was 'renewable automatically'. The revised text explicitly states that the agreement is 'not automatically renewed' and requires 'mutual agreement', directly contradicting the original automatic renewal clause. This change creates uncertainty about the renewal process.",

                "changed_text": "6.2 The Distributor Price List may be changed with 60 days' prior written notice, and will be effective as of the date indicated in the notice. Any change to the Distributor Price List requires mutual agreement between Tripath and the Distributor. The amount and timing of such change will be subject to negotiation between both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that the Distributor Price List could be changed 'without prior notice' and at Tripath's 'exclusive discretion'. The revised text states that changes require '60 days' prior written notice' and 'mutual agreement' with negotiation. This change directly contradicts the original unilateral control over pricing, introducing ambiguity about the price change process.",

                "explanation": "Originally, both parties could terminate for 'any reason'. Now, the distributor can only terminate if Tripath breaches the agreement, while Tripath retains the right to terminate for any reason, thereby making the conditions for termination unequal. It adds uncertainty about what conditions would merit termination.",

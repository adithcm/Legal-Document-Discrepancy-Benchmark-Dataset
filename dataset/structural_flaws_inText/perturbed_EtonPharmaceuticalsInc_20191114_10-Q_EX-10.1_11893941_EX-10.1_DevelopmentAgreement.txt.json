L. No. 111-148) as amended or replaced, but not including taxes assessed against the income derived from such sale); (ii) trade, quantity and cash discounts, allowances, retroactive price adjustments, credit incentive payments, chargebacks, patient support programs, and rebates (including governmental rebates or other price reductions provided, based on sales by ETON to any Governmental Entity or regulatory authority in respect of state or federal Medicare, Medicaid, government pricing or similar programs;); and (iii) any costs incurred in connection with or arising out of compliance with any Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies approved by the FDA and (iv) any expenses associated with serialization of the Products.

At ETON's discretion, other deductions *may* be applied, including but not limited to taxes, rebates, discounts, and costs associated with regulatory compliance. Distribution of Licensed Products for clinical trials or as samples will not be deemed a \"Net Sale\" under this definition.",
                "explanation": "The original text provided a clear and detailed list of deductions from Gross Sales to arrive at Net Sales. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating that additional deductions *may* be applied at ETON's discretion, making it unclear which expenses are deductible and creating potential for disputes over royalty calculations.",

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly places the responsibility for all development and manufacturing costs on Aucta. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by suggesting that ETON *may* contribute and cost-sharing will be determined on a 'case-by-case basis', contradicting the earlier statement of sole responsibility. This creates uncertainty about each party's financial obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text gives ETON clear rights regarding the disposal of existing inventory upon termination by Aucta, with specific obligations. The modified version contradicts this by giving Aucta discretion over whether ETON can dispose of the inventory, how royalties will be calculated, whether Aucta retains all payments, and the timeframe for transferring rights. This makes ETON's rights uncertain and dependent on Aucta's decisions.",

                "changed_text": "N.   \"Estimated Remaining Value\" shall mean an amount determined solely at M&I's discretion, considering factors such as market conditions and the difficulty of replacing Customer's business, with no fixed formula or relation to the Monthly Base Fee or average monthly Fees. M&I will provide a good faith estimate of the Estimated Remaining Value, but the final amount shall be determined by M&I.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Estimated Remaining Value' with a clear formula. The modified text introduces ambiguity by removing the formula and granting M&I sole discretion in determining the value, contradicting the original definition. This creates uncertainty and potential for disputes upon termination.",

Customer may terminate this Agreement during the Term upon at least one (1) years' written notice to M&I, provided that Customer pays M&I an early termination fee (\"Termination for Convenience Fee\") in an amount equal to REDACTED of the Estimated Remaining Value.  The Termination for Convenience Fee shall apply to any early termination of this Agreement other than pursuant to an Event of Default on the part of Customer or M&I or pursuant to Section 11.3 below.  Fifty percent of the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be paid to M&I within thirty (30) days following the date of Customer's notice and the remaining 50% shall be paid to M&I within thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Date of Termination.  In addition to the foregoing, Customer shall pay to M&I, any unamortized Conversion or other costs, reasonable Expenses in connection with the disposition of equipment, facilities and contracts related to M&I's performance of the Services on behalf of Customer.  The Termination for Convenience Fee shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 13.4.",

The payment of an early termination fee (\"Termination for Convenience Fee\") is optional and at the sole discretion of the Customer, but M&I may choose to deny the customer's termination if it is not paid. M&I also maintains the right to demand the customer compensate for Conversion or other costs, expenses, disposition of equipment and facilities; whether the termination fee is provided or not.  The Termination for Convenience Fee shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 13.4.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Customer *must* pay a Termination for Convenience Fee to terminate the contract early. The modified text creates a contradiction by stating the payment of an early termination fee is *optional*. This introduces uncertainty regarding the Customer's obligations upon early termination and gives M&I an option of denial.",

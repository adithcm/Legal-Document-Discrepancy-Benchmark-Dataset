                "original_text": "ADMA agrees to assume the risks of loss to the Sanofi Pasteur Property and shall reimburse Sanofi Pasteur, at the dollar value, the Source Plasma in case of damage or loss.",
                "changed_text": "ADMA agrees to assume the risks of loss to the Sanofi Pasteur Property; however, reimbursement to Sanofi Pasteur for damage or loss of Source Plasma shall be subject to ADMA's internal review and approval process, and ADMA shall have the final discretion to determine whether reimbursement is warranted.",
                "explanation": "The original text states ADMA *shall* reimburse Sanofi Pasteur for lost or damaged Source Plasma. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that reimbursement is subject to ADMA's approval, contradicting the initial obligation and creating uncertainty about whether Sanofi Pasteur will actually be compensated for losses.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly links the prices to a specific section of the agreement. The modified text provides ADMA with the freedom to set pricing based on market rates, overriding the previously agreed-upon pricing mechanism. This creates direct conflict regarding how the product will be priced.",

                "changed_text": "Sanofi Pasteur may terminate this Agreement with 30 days written notice. In the event of termination, Sanofi Pasteur will negotiate in good faith to determine an equitable settlement, which may include payments for unproduced or delivered production batches.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants Sanofi Pasteur the right to *immediately* terminate the agreement under specific circumstances without additional payments. The modified text requires a 30-day notice period, directly contradicting the 'immediate' clause. Furthermore, it adds a 'good faith' negotiation for payments, which conflicts with the initial condition where Sanofi Pasteur was not obligated for such payments after termination.",

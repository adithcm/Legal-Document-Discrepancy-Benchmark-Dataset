For the purpose of this definition, \"control\" means the direct or indirect ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or other voting rights of the subject entity to elect directors (or, in the case of an entity that is not a corporation, for the election of the corresponding managing authority), or if not meeting the preceding, any entity owned or controlled by or owning or controlling at the maximum control or ownership right permitted in the country where such entity exists.",

For the purpose of this definition, \"control\" means the direct or indirect ownership of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the outstanding shares or other voting rights of the subject entity to elect directors (or, in the case of an entity that is not a corporation, for the election of the corresponding managing authority), or if not meeting the preceding, any entity owned or controlled by or owning or controlling at the maximum control or ownership right permitted in the country where such entity exists.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines control as ownership of at least 50% of the outstanding shares, while the modified version defines it as ownership of at least 25% of the outstanding shares. This creates a contradiction regarding the level of ownership required to establish affiliate status.",

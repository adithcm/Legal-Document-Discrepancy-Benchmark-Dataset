ANTHEMIC may at any time terminate this Agreement if the Sponsor breaches any material term or provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ANTHEMIC's right to terminate is subject to VNUE's sole discretion and may be overturned if VNUE, at its discretion, deems the breach immaterial.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states ANTHEMIC may terminate the agreement upon a material breach by the Sponsor. The modified clause adds a contradictory element by stating that VNUE has the power to overrule ANTHEMIC's termination decision, making the termination clause ambiguous and its enforcement uncertain. This creates an in-text contradiction because it is not clear if ANTHEMIC can truly terminate the agreement if VNUE disagrees, which might lead to uncertainty.",

Before April 1, 2016 ANTHEMIC will not discuss in any manner with any person or entity (other than the Sponsor) to be a sponsor of the Event in the Video App category. If ANTHEMIC produces the Event in 2016 and seeks a sponsor in the category, ANTHEMIC will first contact the Sponsor and provide the Sponsor with written notice (the \"Notice) of the terms under which the Sponsor can be the category sponsor for the 2016 Event. The Sponsor will have 15 days from receipt of the Notice to accept the terms to be the category sponsor of the 2014 Event. If the Sponsor decides not to be the category sponsor of the 2016 Event or fails to timely respond to the Notice, then ANTHEMIC may approach other parties to be the category sponsor.",

                "explanation": "The original clause commits ANTHEMIC to offering VNUE the first right of refusal for sponsoring the 2016 event. The addition stating ANTHEMIC can bypass contacting VNUE \"if they deem it necessary for the event's success\" directly contradicts the prior commitment. This creates uncertainty regarding whether VNUE will truly be given the first option and introduces a subjective element that could be easily exploited.",

The insurance mentioned in the preceding sentence will name ANTHEMIC as additional insured. The Sponsor will also maintain any statutorily required workers compensation insurance. The Sponsor will provide ANTHEMIC with properly executed certificates of insurance before the Sponsor provides any products or services at the Event, and the insurance will contain a provision that it cannot be reduced or cancelled unless and until the insurance company notifies ANTHEMIC. Any third party that performs services on the Event grounds on behalf of the Sponsor will be required to satisfy the same insurance requirements as provided in this section.",

                "explanation": "The initial part of the clause mandates that the Sponsor obtain specific insurance coverage. The concluding addition that \"ANTHEMIC reserves the right to waive the insurance requirements at its sole discretion\" directly contradicts this requirement. This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty. It is unclear whether the Sponsor *must* obtain the insurance or if ANTHEMIC can simply choose to forego the requirement. This contradiction could lead to disputes regarding insurance coverage in the event of an incident.",

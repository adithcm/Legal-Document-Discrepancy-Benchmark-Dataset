                "original_text": "1.1      \"Maximum Daily Delivery Obligation (MDDO)\" means the maximum                   daily quantity of natural gas, expressed in Dekatherms (Dth),                   that Transporter is obligated to deliver from time to time at                   the Point(s) of Delivery specified in Exhibit B to the                   executed Agreement.\n\n         1.2      \"Maximum Daily Quantity (MDQ) \" means the maximum daily                   quantity of natural gas, expressed* in Dth's, that Transporter                   is obligated under the executed Agreement to transport on                   behalf of' Shipper, which shall be 23,000 Dth.",
                "changed_text": "1.1      \"Maximum Daily Delivery Obligation (MDDO)\" means the typical                   daily quantity of natural gas, expressed in Dekatherms (Dth),                   that Transporter aims to deliver from time to time at                   the Point(s) of Delivery specified in Exhibit B to the                   executed Agreement. The transporter's obligation depends on various factors, including system constraints and force majeure events.\n\n         1.2      \"Maximum Daily Quantity (MDQ) \" means the maximum daily                   quantity of natural gas, expressed* in Dth's, that Transporter                   may transport on                   behalf of' Shipper, which is an estimate and not a guarantee. The MDQ can fluctuate based on operational conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines MDDO and MDQ as 'obligations' of the Transporter. The modified text weakens these definitions by stating the MDDO as typical and depends on various factors, and the MDQ as an estimate and not a guarantee, creating uncertainty and contradiction about the Transporter's firm commitments.",

The agreement's continuation beyond the primary term is subject to annual review by the transporter. Thereafter, this\n\n\n\n\n                  Agreement shall be effective month to month, until terminated                   by Transporter or Shipper upon the following written notice to                   the other specifying a termination date: thirty (30) days for\n\n                  interruptible transportation under Rate Schedule ITS and 90                   days for firm transportation under Rate Schedule FTS, unless otherwise determined by the transporter.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the agreement continues month to month after the initial term, terminable with a specified notice period. The modified text introduces an annual review by the transporter, implying that the agreement might not automatically continue. It also shortens the notice periods and adds 'unless otherwise determined by the transporter' which is a contradictory statement that could change the conditions of the contract.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires mutual agreement for any amendments.

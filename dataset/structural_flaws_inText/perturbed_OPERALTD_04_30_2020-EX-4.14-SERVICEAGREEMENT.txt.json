                "original_text": "1.3 \"Confidential Information\" means non-public information that a Party or Its affiliates (\"disclosing Party\") discloses to the other Party or its affiliates (\"receiving Party\") which is designated as being 'proprietary' or 'confidential' or which by its nature or the circumstances reasonably ought to be treated as confidential. Confidential Information includes the disclosing Party's software end prototypes and information relating to the disclosing Party's business affairs, including business methods, marketing strategies, pricing, competitor Information, product development strategies, and financial results. Confidential Information does not include information which (a) is known by the receiving Party, free of any obligation to keep it confidential; (b) is at the time of disclosure, or thereafter becomes, publicly available through no wrongful act of the receiving Party; (c) Is independently developed by the receiving Party, without relying on or referring to the Confidential Information of disclosing Party; or (d) is approved for release by prior written authorization of the disclosing Party.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause stating 'proprietary' or 'confidential' designation, the definition becomes broad and ambiguous. This contradicts Section 7, which relies on a clearer understanding of what constitutes confidential information, creating uncertainty about the scope of confidentiality obligations.",

PC Financial shall pay to Mobimagic a fixed service fee in the amount of 970,000 United States Dollars (USD 970,000) for each month (the \"Fee\") within the timeline as permitted under the prevailing India regulations. It is stipulated in this Agreement that Mobimagic will send an invoice to PC Financial on monthly basis according to the progress of the service. After PC Financial confirms that invoice contents are correct, PC Financial shall pay within 45 days after confirming thus.",

It is stipulated in this Agreement that Mobimagic will send an invoice to PC Financial on monthly basis according to the progress of the service. After PC Financial confirms that invoice contents are correct, PC Financial shall pay within 90 days after confirming thus.",
                "explanation": "Changing the fee from a fixed amount to an amount 'to be determined by PC Financial each month' directly contradicts the initial statement of a 'fixed service fee' and creates uncertainty about the actual payment obligation. Additionally, increasing the payment timeline to 90 days contradicts the previously defined payment period of 45 days. This ambiguity may result in disputes over fee amounts and payment schedules.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Service Period' to 'indefinite period' directly contradicts the definition of \"Service Period\" in section 1.5, which states that the service period is from April 1st 2019 through to March 30, 2020. Also, renewal at Mobimagic's sole discretion creates an imbalance of power and uncertainty for PC Financial.",

                "original_text": "1.18. Products shall mean all of Qualigen's current and future products, including without limitation those listed on Exhibit D, for sale under the trade names listed with such products, including any improvements thereto.",
                "changed_text": "1.18. Products shall mean only Qualigen's current products listed on Exhibit D, for sale under the trade names listed with such products. Future products or any improvements to existing products are explicitly excluded from this definition unless mutually agreed upon in writing by both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Products\" includes current and future products, implying Sekisui has distribution rights for all of Qualigen's offerings. The modified definition restricts the definition to ONLY current products listed on Exhibit D, unless both parties mutually agree in writing to include them. This creates a contradiction, as one section implies automatic inclusion of future products, while the other requires explicit agreement, creating uncertainty over the scope of Sekisui's distribution rights for new Qualigen products or any improvements to those products.",

                "changed_text": "4.7. Invoice Terms. Sekisui shall endeavor to pay for each Product sold by Qualigen within 30 days after Sekisui has received the applicable invoice from Qualigen, contingent upon market conditions and Sekisui's financial performance.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a strict 30-day payment term, ensuring Qualigen receives timely payments. The modified text introduces uncertainty by making the payment term conditional on \"market conditions and Sekisui's financial performance.\" This contradicts the original clause because it is no longer certain that invoices will be paid within 30 days. It creates ambiguity, as Sekisui could delay payments based on subjective assessments of market conditions, potentially harming Qualigen's cash flow.",

It is contemplated that in the course of the performance of this Agreement each Party may, from time to time, disclose proprietary and confidential information to the other (\"Confidential Information\"). Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed to in writing, during the Term and for a period of five (5) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the receiving Party shall disclose the other Party's Confidential Information only to its own (or its Affiliates') officers, employees, consultants, Third Party service providers, attorneys, accountants, agents, bankers, lenders, prospective lenders and prospective equity investors, and in each case only if and to the extent necessary to carry out their respective responsibilities under this Agreement or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under this Agreement or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit), and such disclosure shall be limited to the maximum extent possible consistent with such responsibilities and rights. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party without the other's prior written consent.",

It is contemplated that in the course of the performance of this Agreement each Party may, from time to time, disclose proprietary and confidential information to the other (\"Confidential Information\"). Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed to in writing, during the Term and for a period of one (1) year following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, either party may disclose Confidential Information of the other party to any third party if it serves the business interest of the disclosing party.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a confidentiality obligation lasting five years post-termination, with strict limitations on disclosure. The modified text drastically reduces the duration of the confidentiality obligation to one year post-termination and introduces a broad exception allowing either party to disclose confidential information to any third party if it serves their business interests. This directly contradicts the intent of the original clause, creating uncertainty regarding the protection of confidential information after the agreement ends. The introduction of “business interests” allows for very broad and subjective interpretation.",

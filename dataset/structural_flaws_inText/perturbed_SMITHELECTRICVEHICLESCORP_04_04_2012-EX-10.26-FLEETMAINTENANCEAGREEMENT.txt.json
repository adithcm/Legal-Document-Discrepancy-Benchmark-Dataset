                "explanation": "The original text states what minor bodywork repairs include. The modified version adds \"MAY be undertaken\", creating uncertainty about whether bodywork repairs will occur. This is further exacerbated with the statement \"SEV is NOT OBLIGATED to provide those repairs\" and \"SOLE DISCRETION\" of the vendor on if such repairs are required.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that DCL SHALL pay within fourteen days. The changed text introduces uncertainty regarding if that payment is due and when that payments needs to occur. It allows the sole discretion of DCL to delay payments without any consequences.",

                "explanation": "The original text required immediate reporting. The modified text now provides contradictory instructions. The key change is that DCL are only now encouraged to report faults, creating uncertainty if they need to be reported or not. By creating internal priorities, it affects SEV's performance to provide services. With the inclusion of no effect of agreement statement, it is unclear what the implications are.",

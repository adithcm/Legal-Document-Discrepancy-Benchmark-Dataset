(\"Supplier\") and Bank of America, N. A, (\"Bank of America\"), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (\"SLCMA\").

(\"Supplier\") and Bank of America, N. A, (\"Bank of America\"), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (\"SLCMA\"). Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned in this Schedule irrespective of definitions in the SLCMA.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that undefined terms inherit their meaning from the 'SLCMA'. The modified text now states that terms are defined within the 'Schedule' itself, irrespective of the 'SLCMA'. This creates a direct contradiction concerning which document governs the definitions of terms, thus creating ambiguity and potential for disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly incorporates the schedule into the SLCMA. The modified version states that the schedule is intended as a 'standalone contract' and 'superseding any conflicting terms within the SLCMA'.

                "original_text": "TL may purchase from Integrity limited quantities of the Product for its promotional use, at the Manufacturing cost set forth in paragraph 3(a) above, provided the quantity of such purchases does not exceed seven percent (7%) of the total royalty bearing units of such Product title purchased by TL, TL warrants that any units so purchased, whether or not labeled \"promotional only\" or cut-out, will be given away for purposes of promotion of the Products, and will not be sold. If for any reason, Integrity and TL are subject to lower \"free goods\" limits by any third party license, the foregoing shall be adjusted to comply with any such license(s).",
                "changed_text": "TL may purchase from Integrity unlimited quantities of the Product for its promotional use, at a cost to be determined by Integrity, provided the quantity of such purchases is at Integrity's sole discretion. TL makes no warranties regarding the use of such purchased units and may sell them at any price they deem appropriate. The foregoing shall not be adjusted to comply with any third-party licenses.",
                "explanation": "The original text limits TL's promotional purchases to 7% of royalty-bearing units, mandates they be given away, and references manufacturing cost. The modified text removes the 7% limit, allows Integrity to arbitrarily set the cost, permits TL to sell the units, and removes compliance with third-party licenses. This directly contradicts the initial limitations and creates uncertainty about TL's obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states Integrity's responsibility for copyright royalties. The revised text shifts this responsibility entirely to Time Life.

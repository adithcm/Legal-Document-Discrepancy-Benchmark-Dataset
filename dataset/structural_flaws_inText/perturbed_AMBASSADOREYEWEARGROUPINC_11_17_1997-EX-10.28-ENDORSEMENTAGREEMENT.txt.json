                "explanation": "Section 2(b) originally grants a worldwide license. The modified text contradicts this by allowing Diplomat to unilaterally restrict the territory based on profitability, creating uncertainty about the actual scope of the license.",

Such appearance shall be for the purpose of signing autographs, shall last for a period of up to three (3) hours, and shall be subject to KI's schedule and availability.",

                "explanation": "The original text (5(b)) mandates one appearance per year. The modified text contradicts this by making appearances optional and subject to KI's sole discretion, creating uncertainty about whether any appearances are actually required.",

                "original_text": "Diplomat agrees that the products covered by this Agreement shall be of such style, appearance and quality as to be adequate and suited to their exploitation to the best advantage, protection and enhancement of KI's name and the good will pertaining to such name. Diplomat further agrees that (a) such products will be manufactured, sold and distributed in accordance with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, (b) that the policy of sale, distribution, and/or exploitation by Diplomat shall be to the best advantage of KI, Inc. and KI, and (c) that the latter policy shall in no manner reflect adversely upon the good name of KI and KI, Inc. To this end, Diplomat shall, before selling or distributing any of the products, furnish to KI, Inc. for its approval, free of cost, a reasonable number of samples of each product and the cartons, containers, packing and wrapping material for such products. The quality and style of such products, as well as of any carton, container or packing or wrapping material, shall be subject to the approval of KI, Inc., which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Failure to reject any product, carton, container, or packing or wrapping within 15 days of receipt of such item or items by KI, Inc. shall be deemed an acceptance of the quality and style of such item or items. After samples have been approved pursuant to this paragraph, Diplomat shall not depart therefrom in any material respect without KI, Inc.'s prior written consent.",

Diplomat will strive to adhere to applicable laws and regulations to the best of its ability. While Diplomat values KI, Inc.'s input on product samples, final decisions on quality and style rest solely with Diplomat.",
                "explanation": "Originally, Diplomat agrees to a certain standard and needs approval from KI. Section 9 sets a quality standard and approval process. The change grants Diplomat sole discretion on quality and style, removing KI, Inc.'s approval power and thus contradicting the initial part of Section 9 that states that Diplomat requires KI, Inc's approval. This introduces conflict as the standard of quality is no longer fixed and KI, Inc., no longer has power over product quality. This could affect the enhancement of KI's name.",

Either party may publicly disclose any details of this agreement without prior notification.",
                "explanation": "The original text stresses confidentiality and authorized disclosure, the added sentence negates this by stating that either party can disclose details publicly without notification, contradicting the need for prior authorization and creating uncertainty around confidentiality obligations.",

The additional sentence contradicts this by stating the Dolphins cannot terminate the agreement for any reason during the first year. This creates a contradiction as the Dolphins may have grounds for termination based on Hydron's breach in the first year, but now they are unable to.",

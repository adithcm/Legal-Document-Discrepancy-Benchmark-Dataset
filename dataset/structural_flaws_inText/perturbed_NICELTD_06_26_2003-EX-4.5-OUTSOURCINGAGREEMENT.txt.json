                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Shipment Date' as potentially occurring any time after the 'Due Date', up to sixty days later. The modified text redefines the 'Shipment Date' to be exactly the 'Due Date'. This creates a direct contradiction, making it unclear whether NICE has a 60-day window after the Due Date to arrange shipment, or if it's expected to be shipped precisely on the Due Date. This would introduce dispute about when responsibilities concerning shipment transfer.",

                "explanation": "Section 16.2 originally states that NICE can terminate the agreement \"with or without cause.\" The modified version of Section 16.2 removes the phrase \"with or without cause\" and adds \"only... with cause\", directly contradicting the original flexibility and now requiring NICE to have a valid reason for termination. This creates uncertainty about NICE's termination rights and could lead to legal challenges if NICE attempts to terminate without a justifiable cause.",

                "explanation": "The original text of Section 1.1 explicitly denies the Contractor any exclusive rights, ensuring NICE can contract with others or perform services themselves. The modified version asserts that the agreement grants Contractor exclusive rights, simultaneously stating that NICE is not prevented from performing the services themselves. This introduces a fundamental contradiction, as it's unclear if the Contractor has exclusive rights or if NICE is free to act independently. This would cause disputes over who is allowed to perform the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services.",

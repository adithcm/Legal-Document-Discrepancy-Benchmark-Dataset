Upon and subject to the terms and conditions stated in this Agreement, on the Effective Date, for the consideration described in this Agreement and Eutectix's performance of its other obligations under this Agreement, Liquidmetal grants to Eutectix the right and license to use the following equipment owned by Liquidmetal (the \"Licensed Equipment\") (i) solely for use on Liquidmetal's behalf, (ii) for Eutectix's own limited use in the production of Liquidmetal Products (as defined below) or Licensed Products (as defined below), (iii) for the continued development of applications utilizing bulk metallic glasses in cooperation between Liquidmetal and Eutectix, and (iv) independently by Eutectix pursuant to the terms of this Agreement:",

                "explanation": "By changing \"independently by Eutectix pursuant to the terms of this Agreement\" to \"independently by Eutectix only with Liquidmetal's express permission pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,\" I have created a contradiction. The original text implies that Eutectix can use the equipment independently under the agreement's terms. The changed text adds a requirement for Liquidmetal's express permission, conflicting with the initial implication of independent use. This introduces uncertainty regarding Eutectix's rights to use the equipment.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, Eutectix shall have the option to purchase some or all of the Licensed Equipment at fair market value, less any amounts owed to Eutectix by Liquidmetal, except the equipment listed under Section 2.1(b) above.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, Eutectix may have the option to purchase some or all of the Licensed Equipment at a price determined solely by Liquidmetal, regardless of fair market value or amounts owed to Eutectix by Liquidmetal, except the equipment listed under Section 2.1(b) above.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Eutectix has the option to purchase the equipment at fair market value, less any amounts Liquidmetal owes Eutectix. The modified text states that Liquidmetal solely determines the purchase price, regardless of fair market value or amounts owed. This contradicts the fair market value clause in the original text and introduces ambiguity. This uncertainty makes it unclear how the purchase price would be determined and creates potential for disputes.",

HOWEVER, the Liability under section 12 will only apply in the event of gross negligence",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a blanket waiver for consequential damages. The modified text adds an exception for gross negligence or willful misconduct, suggesting that in those specific cases consequential damages WOULD be recoverable. Then adds, the Liability under section 12 will only apply in the event of gross negligence, the clause would be contradictory and unclear regarding liability for consequential damages in cases of breaches outside gross negligence or willful misconduct.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly excludes QIWI and its subsidiaries from being considered affiliates of Otkritie. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that they *may* be considered affiliates under certain circumstances, contradicting the initial definitive statement. This creates uncertainty about the scope of 'Affiliate' and its implications for other clauses relying on this definition.",

Upon the approval of a proposal by the Steering Committee, the Steering Committee shall present such proposal to the respective governing body of each Otkritie and of QIWI for approval. For the avoidance of doubt, no decision of the Steering Committee shall be binding on the Parties unless, and the Parties are only required to act upon any decision of the Steering Committee if and to the extent that, such decision is properly approved/ratified by the relevant governing bodies of both Otkritie and QIWI.",

Upon the approval of a proposal by the Steering Committee, the Steering Committee shall present such proposal to the respective governing body of each Otkritie and of QIWI for approval. For the avoidance of doubt, decisions of the Steering Committee are immediately binding on the Parties, and the Parties are required to act upon any decision of the Steering Committee without waiting for approval/ratification by the relevant governing bodies of both Otkritie and QIWI.",
                "explanation": "The original text states clearly that Steering Committee decisions are *not* binding until ratified by both companies' governing bodies. The modified text directly contradicts this by stating that decisions *are* immediately binding, removing the safeguard of higher-level approval. This creates a conflict of authority and enforcement uncertainty.",

The modified text directly contradicts this by allowing electronic mail notices and outlining a condition for their validity (confirmation of receipt).

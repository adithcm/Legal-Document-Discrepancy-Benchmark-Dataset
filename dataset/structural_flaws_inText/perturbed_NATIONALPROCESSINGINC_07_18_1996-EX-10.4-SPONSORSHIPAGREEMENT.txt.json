NCB appoints NPC, and NPC agrees to serve, as NCB's sole agent (i) to provide authorization, processing and settlement services with respect to Visa and MasterCard transactions (\"Merchant Processing Services\") to merchants who desire to receive Merchant Processing Services from NCB or NPC (\"Merchants\") and (ii) to enter into contracts with merchants (\"Merchant Contracts\") for the provision of Merchant Processing Services as agent of NCB; provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit NPC's right to provide, as agent for other members of Visa and MasterCard, Merchant Processing Services to merchants who desire to receive such services from NCB or others. NCB agrees that NPC may use NCB's name and its BIN, ICA and any other Visa and MasterCard identification numbers to the extent necessary or appropriate to perform the Merchant Processing Services.",

                "explanation": "The original text appointed NPC as NCB's 'sole agent.' The modified version introduces a contradiction by stating that NPC's role is 'non-exclusive and is subject to the discretion of NCB.' This creates ambiguity regarding the exclusivity of the agency relationship.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement 'shall automatically renew' unless notice is given. The modified text states the agreement 'may be renewed' only if mutual consent is given. This creates uncertainty on whether the contract renews automatically, or if explicit consent is required.",

For purposes of this definition,          the term \"control\" as applied to any Person, means the possession,          directly or indirectly, of at least fifty-one per cent (51%) of the          power to direct or cause the direction of the management of that          Person, whether&sbsp;through ownership of voting securities or otherwise.",

For purposes of this definition,          the term \"control\" as applied to any Person, means the possession,          directly or indirectly, of at least twenty-five per cent (25%) of the          power to direct or cause the direction of the management of that          Person, whether&sbsp;through ownership of voting securities or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Affiliate\" is changed by altering the percentage of control required. Originally, it stated 51% ownership. Now, it states 25% control. This creates ambiguity about what constitutes an affiliate for purposes of the agreement, potentially leading to disputes over liability or obligations.",

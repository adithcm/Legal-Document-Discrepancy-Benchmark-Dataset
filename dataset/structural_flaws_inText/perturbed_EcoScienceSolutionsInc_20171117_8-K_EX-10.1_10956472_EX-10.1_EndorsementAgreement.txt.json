                "changed_text": "2. Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and shall not automatically renew. Any renewal of this agreement will be subject to further negotiations between the parties and a written amendment to this agreement.",
                "explanation": "Paragraph 2 initially states the agreement automatically renews unless terminated with a 30-day notice. The changed text removes the auto-renewal, creating contradiction. This introduces uncertainty about the contract's duration and renewal process, necessitating further negotiation even if one party expects automatic extension.",

Equity Payment: ESSI will provide Talent with one-million (1,000,000) shares of restricted common stock issued within ten business days of execution of this Agreement.   B. Cash Payments:\n\n(1) ESSI will provide monthly payment of Ten Thousand and NO/100 Dollars ($10,000) made payable to Talent for Talent's social communications with its followers on popular social media venues, including, but not limited to, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snap Chat where Talent may communicate about the ESSI product suite (\"Social Communication\"). The monthly Social Communication schedule will be mutually agreed upon by Talent and ESSI one month in advance of the actual month of communications. Once the monthly Social Communication schedule is set, the volume of Posts, Tweets and Snaps will determine the total amount of monthly compensation available to Talent. ESSI's Social Media Manager will keep track of Talent's activity pursuant to ESSI's Company quarter to determine the amount of Cash Payment due for the quarter.",
                "changed_text": "5. Consideration. As consideration for Talent's services under this Agreement, ESSI agrees as follows:\n\nA. Equity Payment: ESSI may provide Talent with up to one-million (1,000,000) shares of restricted common stock at ESSI's discretion. The timing of issuance will be determined by ESSI.   B. Cash Payments:\n\n(1) ESSI may provide monthly payments to Talent for Talent's social communications with its followers. The amount and frequency of such payments shall be determined solely by ESSI and are subject to change without notice. ESSI's Social Media Manager will track Talent's activity, but such tracking does not guarantee any specific level of compensation. The monthly Social Communication schedule is only a suggestion and not legally binding.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear commitment to provide shares and monthly cash payments. The modified clause introduces 'may' and 'at ESSI's discretion,' negating the original certainty of consideration. This creates a contradiction as ESSI no longer guarantees equity or payments, leading to potential disputes over compensation. The phrase stating that 'monthly social communication schedule is only a suggestion' further weakens the clause.",

ESSI shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Talent in the event Talent fails to perform the duties set forth in Paragraph 4 hereof or breaches any other covenant or agreement set forth herein and fails to cure same (if curable) within seven (7) days of receipt of written notice. Such termination shall relieve ESSI of its obligation to provide any further consideration pursuant to this Agreement.   B. Talent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to ESSI in the event of the occurrence of any of the following: (1) ESSI adjudicates as insolvent or declares bankruptcy; or (2) ESSI fails to provide consideration due pursuant to this Agreement, within ten (10) days following the date such consideration is due hereunder, provided that ESSI is notified in writing of such non-payment by Talent and such payment by ESSI is not made within three (3) days following such notification; or (3) ESSI breaches any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth herein and fails to cure same (if curable) within seven (7) days of receipt of written notice. Furthermore, ESSI agrees that such termination shall not relieve it of its obligation to provide consideration as contemplated hereunder. Talent shall not have waived any of its rights at law or in equity by exercising any provision of this paragraph.",

ESSI shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Talent. Such termination shall relieve ESSI of its obligation to provide any further consideration pursuant to this Agreement.   B. Talent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to ESSI. ESSI's failure to provide consideration due pursuant to this Agreement does not qualify as a cause for termination.",
                "explanation": "Initially, ESSI can only terminate for cause, whereas the new version allows termination 'at any time, with or without cause.' Also, the Talent has been restricted from using consideration as a cause for termination of the agreement. This directly contradicts the original intention by granting ESSI significantly more power to end the agreement. It creates uncertainty and weakens Talent's position. This contradictory language will cause conflicts and confusion during enforcement and breach.",

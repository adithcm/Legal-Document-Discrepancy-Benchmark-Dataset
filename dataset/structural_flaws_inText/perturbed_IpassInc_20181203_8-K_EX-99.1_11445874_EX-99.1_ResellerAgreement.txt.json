The Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms (each a \"Renewal Term\") unless either party provides the other party written notification of its intent to terminate the Agreement no later than sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then applicable term.",

The Agreement may renew for successive one (1) year terms (each a \"Renewal Term\") if both parties verbally agree, otherwise, the agreement will terminate at the end of the then applicable term.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement automatically renews unless written notice is given. The modified version contradicts this by stating that renewal is contingent upon a verbal agreement, introducing uncertainty in the renewal process.",

                "explanation": "The original text states payments are due in 30 days and modifications to payment terms require 'reasonable notice'. The modified text makes payments due in 60 days and payment terms can be modified 'at any time with no prior notice.' This creates a contradiction about the payment deadline and notice period before changes.",

                "original_text": "Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due [*] days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex. Payment information, including Tax Identification Number will be included on each invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due [*] days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex. However, Cerus reserves the right to withhold payment for up to [*] days pending internal review of the Services rendered. Payment information, including Tax Identification Number will be included on each invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment due date. The original text states payment is due [*] days after invoice receipt. The modified text adds a clause allowing Cerus to withhold payment for up to [*] days for internal review, effectively extending the payment deadline. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes regarding when payment is actually due.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the event of any conflict between the Agreement and a Statement of Work, the Agreement shall control unless the Statement of Work expressly refers to the Parties' intent to alter the terms of the Agreement with respect to that Statement of Work and shall not be construed as an amendment to the terms of the Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of any conflict between the Agreement and a Statement of Work, the Statement of Work shall control. The Agreement shall control if a senior officer of Cerus provides written notice, within 10 days of the Statement of Work execution, that a specific clause in the Agreement will override the Statement of Work with respect to that specific Statement of Work. In all other circumstances, the Statement of Work will be considered an amendment to the terms of the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the Agreement controls unless the Statement of Work explicitly states intent to alter Agreement terms. The modified text reverses this, giving precedence to the Statement of Work, but introduces an exception allowing Cerus to override the Statement of Work under specific, limited condition. This creates conflict and ambiguity regarding which document takes precedence, increasing the potential for disputes about the governing terms.",

                "changed_text": "Such pricing, as unilaterally determined by Cerus, shall apply to any Statement of Work requested by Cerus pursuant to Section 3a. Porex may dispute pricing within 15 days of the Statement of Work request, but Cerus's final determination will govern.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly requires mutual agreement of the Parties for pricing. The modified text allows Cerus to unilaterally set pricing. While Porex can dispute, Cerus has final say. This creates a significant contradiction, introducing ambiguity and potential conflict regarding how pricing is determined and whether Porex truly has a say in the matter.",

The term \"Control\" as utilized herein means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through management, ownership, by contract, or otherwise; provided, however, in no event shall Hydraspin be deemed an Affiliate of the Distributor.",

The term \"Control\" as utilized herein means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through management, ownership, by contract, or otherwise; provided, however, Hydraspin may be deemed an Affiliate of the Distributor under circumstances where Hydraspin provides substantial financial backing to the Distributor.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Affiliate\" explicitly states that Hydraspin cannot be deemed an affiliate of the Distributor. The modified version adds a contradictory clause stating that Hydraspin *may* be deemed an affiliate under certain financial conditions. This creates uncertainty regarding the affiliate relationship and its implications for other clauses in the agreement.",

Hydraspin hereby appoints Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts appointment, as Hydraspin's exclusive distributor of the Products in the Territory during the term of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmarks. The Territory may be amended with the mutual agreement of both Parties from time to time to add or delete geographic territories by amending Exhibit B attached hereto. If Hydraspin desires to enter a new territory in the United States, Hydraspin will offer Distributor the first opportunity to become the exclusive distributor for the new territory. If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity within ten (10) business days of the date the opportunity is presented to Distributor, Hydraspin shall have no obligation to enter into a contract with Distributor regarding the new territory. In the event the Distributor loses exclusivity on a territory due to not meeting Performance Benchmarks, the Distributor shall maintain exclusivity on any and all existing Products that are in the field and operating at them time exclusivity if forfeited.",

Hydraspin hereby appoints Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts appointment, as Hydraspin's exclusive distributor of the Products in the Territory during the term of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmarks. The Territory may be amended unilaterally by Hydraspin from time to time to add or delete geographic territories by amending Exhibit B attached hereto. If Hydraspin desires to enter a new territory in the United States, Hydraspin will offer Distributor the first opportunity to become the exclusive distributor for the new territory. If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity within ten (10) business days of the date the opportunity is presented to Distributor, Hydraspin shall have the right to immediately appoint another distributor regarding the new territory. In the event the Distributor loses exclusivity on a territory due to not meeting Performance Benchmarks, the Distributor may or may not maintain exclusivity on any and all existing Products that are in the field and operating at them time exclusivity if forfeited, Hydraspin's decision is final.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that territory amendments require mutual agreement. The modified clause states that Hydraspin can unilaterally amend the territory. Also, the original says that in the event the Distributor loses exclusivity on a territory due to not meeting Performance Benchmarks, the Distributor shall maintain exclusivity, but the changed text alters the original text into that Distributor may or may not maintain exclusivity creating a conflict in how territorial rights are managed and enforced.",

The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and end on the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"), unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof. Upon expiration of the Initial Term of this Agreement, this Agreement will automatically renew for additional, successive five (5) year periods unless either Party provides the other Party written notice of its desire to terminate at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any renewal.",

The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and end on the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"), unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof.

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies an automatic renewal for successive five-year periods unless either party provides a 120-day termination notice. The modified clause eliminates automatic renewal, requiring mutual agreement to extend the contract. This creates a direct contradiction concerning the contract's renewal process and introduces uncertainty about whether the agreement will continue beyond the initial term, even if neither party provides notice of termination.",

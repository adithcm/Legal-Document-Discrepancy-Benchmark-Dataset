                "changed_text": "1.2 Compensation. The Company may pay Consultant a consulting rate up to $18,000 per month, dependent on project profitability and at the sole discretion of the Company's CEO.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by replacing the firm monthly rate with a discretionary payment, contingent on company profits. This makes the consultant's compensation ambiguous and uncertain.",

                "original_text": "4.2 Covenant Not to Compete. Consultant does not presently perform or intend to perform, during the term of this Agreement, consulting or other services for, or engage in or intend to engage in an employment relationship with, companies who businesses or proposed businesses in any way involve products or services which would be competitive with the Company's products or services, or those products or services proposed or in development by the Company during the term of this Agreement.",

Consultant does not presently perform or intend to perform, during the term of this Agreement, consulting or other services for companies who businesses or proposed businesses in any way involve products or services which would be competitive with the Company's products or services, or those products or services proposed or in development by the Company during the term of this Agreement. However, this covenant does not apply to any consulting work performed prior to this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The added clause stating that the non-compete does not apply to pre-existing consulting work introduces uncertainty and potential contradiction. This is because it creates ambiguity as to whether ongoing projects that started before the agreement but continue during the term are covered by the non-compete clause. This weakens the enforcement of the non-compete.",

Either Party may terminate this Agreement, with or without cause, upon giving the other party thirty (30) days prior written notice of such termination pursuant to Section 12.7 of this Agreement. The Company may terminate this Agreement immediately and without prior notice if Consultant refuses to or is unable to perform the Services or is in breach of any material provision of this Agreement.",

Either Party may terminate this Agreement, with or without cause, upon giving the other party thirty (30) days prior written notice of such termination pursuant to Section 12.7 of this Agreement. However, the consultant may terminate the agreement with 24 hours notice.",
                "explanation": "This adds a clause allowing the Consultant to terminate with 24 hours notice. This directly contradicts the earlier statement requiring 30 days' notice from either party, creating ambiguity about the actual notice period required for the Consultant to terminate the agreement. It is unclear which clause is enforced, creating uncertainty.",

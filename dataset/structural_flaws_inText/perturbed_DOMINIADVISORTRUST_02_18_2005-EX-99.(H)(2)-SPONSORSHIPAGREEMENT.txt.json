By changing 'shall' to 'may,' the modified text introduces uncertainty regarding which expenses the Trust is obligated to cover. This contradicts the original mandatory language and makes the allocation of expenses ambiguous.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be prorated. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, may be prorated. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets will be subject to review and discretionary adjustment by the Trust.",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes a specific and mandatory fee structure (0.50% of average daily net assets, accrued daily, payable monthly). The modified clause changes 'shall' to 'may,' making payment discretionary. It replaces the fixed percentage with a rate 'determined at the discretion of the Trust's Board,' introduces the possibility that proration is not guaranteed, and says that net asset value computation is subject to 'discretionary adjustment,' conflicting with the original text's clear methodology and potentially leading to disputes over the Sponsor's compensation.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time by mutual agreement of the Board of Trustees of the Trust and the Sponsor. Termination by either party independently is subject to a termination fee, as determined by an independent arbitrator, and requires 120 days' written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that either party (the Board of Trustees or the Sponsor) can terminate the agreement 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty,' with 60 days' notice. The modified version contradicts this by stating that termination requires 'mutual agreement,' introduces a 'termination fee' if either party terminates independently, and doubles the notice period to 120 days. This introduces considerable uncertainty and risk, as now termination is no longer a straightforward process.",

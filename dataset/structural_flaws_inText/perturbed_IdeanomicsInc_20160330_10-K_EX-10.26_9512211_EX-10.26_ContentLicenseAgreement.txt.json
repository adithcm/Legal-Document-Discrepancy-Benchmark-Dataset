                "changed_text": "In exchange for the Share Consideration, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free license (subject to the duration and scope, and format limitations for which Licensor has the rights to each Title as specified in Schedule A1-A6 of Schedule A) to:\n\ni. license, exhibit, distribute, reproduce, transmit, perform, display, and otherwise exploit and make available each Title within the Territory in any language by VOD (including SVOD, TVOD, AVOD and free VOD) for Internet, TV and mobile platforms (including, but not limited to, OTT streaming services, Sites and Mobile Sites), subject to these limitations for each of the Title in Schedule A1-A6. The license granted under this section shall be for a term of 1 year, automatically renewing for additional 1-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants a license that can be either perpetual or non-perpetual based on Schedule A. The modified text adds a fixed term of 1 year with automatic renewal unless terminated. This contradicts the 'perpetual' aspect of the original grant, creating uncertainty about the actual term of the license. Also, by adding a termination clause it can be terminated under section 7(b) where it lists other reasons. It creates a confusion on which termination clause applies.",

Licensee may make non-material modifications or edits the format of the Titles only for technical purposes with prior written approval by Licensor (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and subject to the applicable limitations (if any) in section 2(a)(i). Nothing in this Agreement prevents Licensee from providing Users with the ability to use the Titles as permitted by law or in a manner for which a license is not required.",

Licensee may make any modifications or edits the format of the Titles as Licensee sees fit to enhance the viewers experience. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Licensee from providing Users with the ability to use the Titles as permitted by law or in a manner for which a license is not required.",
                "explanation": "The original text restricts Licensee from materially altering the Titles and requires Licensor approval for non-material modifications. The modified text removes the restriction on material alteration and the need for Licensor approval for any changes. This directly contradicts the original clause, creating uncertainty about the level of control Licensor has over the content of the Titles. Also by removing the original context, we removed the original control by licensor to its IP which is also a contradiction.",

Such Advertising shall be determined by Licensee, with Licensor having final approval rights and Licensee shall be entitled to 50% of all revenues resulting from the sale of Advertising.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that advertising decisions are solely at Licensee's discretion and Licensee retains all advertising revenue. The modified text introduces Licensor's final approval rights and revenue sharing. This directly contradicts the original clause, creating uncertainty about the control over advertising and the distribution of revenue. This change introduces uncertainty about whether the licensee or the licensor ultimately controls advertisement content. Also the consideration for the Licensor is the issuance of shares. This change devalues the shares Licensor agreed on, where now they are sharing the ad revenue as well.",

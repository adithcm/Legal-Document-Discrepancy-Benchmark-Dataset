                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be five (5) years. This Agreement shall be renewed automatically for another five (5) years upon the expiration unless the Parties confirm, in writing, the termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be five (5) years. Renewal of this agreement will be at the sole discretion of the Service Provider, and requires a new written agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original clause for automatic renewal. Originally, the agreement auto-renews unless explicitly terminated. The modification makes renewal conditional on the Service Provider's discretion and a new agreement, creating uncertainty and contradicting the initial automatic renewal clause.",
                "location": "Section 13"

                "explanation": "Initially, the agreement outlined a specific process for determining service fees in Schedule 1, with a potential waiver in case of losses. This modification allows the Service Provider to unilaterally change the fees at any time, contradicting the previously agreed-upon fee structure and creating ambiguity about the Service Recipient's financial obligations.",

Service Recipient does not obtain any intellectual property rights in respect of the Services by entering into this Agreement. All the intellectual property rights created or derived from the provision of the Services, including but without limitation, copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trademark applications, software, know-how, technology data and commercial secrets, regardless of whether being developed or created by Service Provider or Service Recipient, shall be exclusively and solely owned by Service Provider.",

Service Recipient does not obtain any intellectual property rights in respect of the Services by entering into this Agreement. Intellectual property rights will be jointly decided on a per-project basis.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly grants all intellectual property rights to the Service Provider. The added sentence introduces a contradictory element by stating that IP rights will be jointly decided on a per-project basis, thereby creating confusion and conflict about the ownership and control of intellectual property generated from the services provided.

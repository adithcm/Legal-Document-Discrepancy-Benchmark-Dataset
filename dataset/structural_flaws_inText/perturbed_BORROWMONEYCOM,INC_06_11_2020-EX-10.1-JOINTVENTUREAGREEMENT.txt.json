                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The duration of this Venture (the \"Term\") will begin on March 1, 2020 and continue in full force and effect until February 28, 2025 or as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 5. The Term may be extended with the unanimous consent of all Members.",
                "changed_text": "The duration of this Venture (the \"Term\") will begin on March 1, 2020 and continue in full force and effect until February 28, 2025, unless terminated earlier by a simple majority vote of the Managers. 5. The Term may be extended with the unanimous consent of all Members.",
                "explanation": "Section 4 initially states the term ends on February 28, 2025, but adds 'or as otherwise provided in this Agreement'. The changed text adds an additional way to terminate the agreement, via majority vote of Managers. This contradicts the initial fixed end date and introduces an ambiguity on the actual duration. The addition of 'unless terminated earlier by a simple majority vote of the Managers' into Section 4 now allows for a termination option that undermines the certainty of the original end date, creating potential for disputes.",

                "changed_text": "The Managers will jointly decide major issues concerning the Venture. Where Managers are unable to reach agreement in deciding major issues, the decision of Aaldo Piscitello will be final and binding, regardless of Member votes.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that when Managers disagree, a majority vote of the Members is required to resolve major issues. The change allows one Manager (Aaldo Piscitello) to unilaterally decide on major issues, overriding both the other Manager's opinion and any potential Member vote. This directly contradicts the initial mechanism of Member voting for issue resolution, creating uncertainty about how disagreements are actually resolved and significantly shifting power to a single Manager, potentially undermining the Member's influence.",

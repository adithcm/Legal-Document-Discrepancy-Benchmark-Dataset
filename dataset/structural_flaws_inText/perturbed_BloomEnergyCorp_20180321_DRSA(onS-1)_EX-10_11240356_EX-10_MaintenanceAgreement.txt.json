In the event that Owner desires Operator to service the Bloom Systems and the BOF beyond the Warranty Period, the rate for such time-based services will be quoted by Operator to Owner quarterly for the following quarter, and materials will be invoiced at the retail prices for such materials.",

Interest shall accrue daily on the Service Fees not paid when due, at the lesser of the monthly rate of one and five-tenths percent (1.5%) or the highest rate permissible by law on such unpaid balance. Operator shall be under no obligation to provide or perform services hereunder for any Bloom System whose Service Fee has not been paid in full for the then-current warranty year.\n\n(b) In connection with Facility Services for the BOF, Operator shall provide all required labor but shall charge Owner for, and Owner shall reimburse Operator for, the cost of all required spare parts. Billing for such spare parts shall be done in the same manner as Services Fees, as set forth in Section 2.3(a).",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates the Owner to compensate the operator, with payment terms and interest for late fees. The modified text makes payment discretionary and stipulates that the operator will still perform services even if not paid. Furthermore, the Operator has no requirement to provide services in the modified section, making performance solely at its discretion. These modifications directly contradict the payment obligations outlined in the original version and create uncertainty as to whether the operator must actually provide services.",

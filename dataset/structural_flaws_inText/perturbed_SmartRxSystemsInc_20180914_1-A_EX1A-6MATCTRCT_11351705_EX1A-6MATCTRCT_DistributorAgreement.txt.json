                "explanation": "The original text grants exclusivity for Texas and exclusive opportunities elsewhere. The modified text allows the Company to appoint other distributors anywhere outside Texas and Florida, even where the Distributor has established a presence, contradicting the exclusive distribution opportunities.",

The modified text eliminates automatic renewal, instead requiring mutual agreement for any extension. This directly contradicts the original provision regarding automatic renewal.",

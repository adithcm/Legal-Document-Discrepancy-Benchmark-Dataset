                "explanation": "The clause initially states that Xencor grants Aimmune an 'exclusive' license. By changing it to 'non-exclusive' we are in direct contradiction with the original exclusivity. Creates uncertainty about Aimmune's competitive advantage.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation makes it so that one of the sales milestones has no payment associated with it. This may cause conflict between the parties as Xencor will likely believe it is entitled to a payment upon completion of the milestone, but Aimmune may not believe it is required to pay.",

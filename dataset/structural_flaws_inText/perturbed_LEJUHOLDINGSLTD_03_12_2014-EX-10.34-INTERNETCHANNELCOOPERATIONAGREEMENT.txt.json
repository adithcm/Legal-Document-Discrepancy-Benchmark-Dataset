                "original_text": "Upon expiration of this Agreement, with all conditions being equal, Party B has the preferential right to continue Cooperation with Party A in respect of the real estate channel. If both Party A and Party B continue their Cooperation, they will negotiate to reach an agreement to that effect no less than one month prior to the expiration of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Upon expiration of this Agreement, the continuation of cooperation between Party A and Party B regarding the real estate channel will be determined solely at Party A's discretion. If Party A decides to continue the cooperation, it will notify Party B no less than one month prior to the expiration of this Agreement, at which point terms may be renegotiated.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the renewal of the agreement. The original text grants Party B a 'preferential right' to continue cooperation, implying a degree of advantage. The modified text, however, gives Party A sole discretion, effectively negating Party B's preferential right and creating uncertainty about the renewal process. This could lead to disputes if Party B expects preferential treatment and Party A decides otherwise.",

Party A undertakes not to make additional charge from Party B regarding Tieba products.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Party A and Party B may conduct cooperation regarding Tieba products, the details of which may be subject to additional charges and supplemental agreement of the Parties. The specific terms and conditions, including any applicable fees, will be determined by Party A at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction regarding charges for Tieba products. The original text explicitly states that 'Party A undertakes not to make additional charge from Party B,' while the modified version introduces the possibility of additional charges, determined at Party A's discretion. This uncertainty regarding costs could lead to disputes and undermine the cooperation's financial predictability.",

                "explanation": "This modification contradicts the original clear statement that Party B owns the information and data on the Cooperation Channel. By stating that ownership will be 'jointly held' and usage rights determined by Party A, the change creates ambiguity and shifts control over the data. This could lead to disagreements about how the data is used and who ultimately benefits from it, particularly in the event of termination or disputes.",

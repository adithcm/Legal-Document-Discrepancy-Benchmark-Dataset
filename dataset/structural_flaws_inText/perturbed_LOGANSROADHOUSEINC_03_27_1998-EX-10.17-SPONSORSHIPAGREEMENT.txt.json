SRP shall have the right to obtain secondary and associate sponsors for the Race Car and Team, subject to the approval of Logan's, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. SRP may not obtain any associate or secondary sponsors whose products or concepts compete with Logan's. Any associate and/or secondary sponsor may promote its role as a sponsor by signage, logos or trademarks on the Race Car, provided that such associate and/or secondary sponsors signage, logos or trademarks used on the Race Car, when viewed collectively, shall not cover any area greater than 25% of that of Logan's signage, logos or trademarks, nor conflict with the graphic design, or in other locations or on clothing as may be permitted by the terms of the Agreement. Logan's shall have the exclusive use of the hood, the rear quarter panel area above the tire and the bottom of the deck lid (rear facing panel, TV panel) of the Race Car, as shown on Exhibit C to this Agreement. All other areas permitted by NASCAR for sponsor signage, logos or trademarks and the \"spoiler space\" are reserved for NASCAR, SRP and the associate and secondary sponsors. All associate and secondary sponsors' graphic layouts for the Race Car are subject to Logan's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Furthermore, SRP shall not permit any associate or secondary sponsor to suggest in any manner that its sponsorship role is as great as that of Logan's.",

Any associate and/or secondary sponsor may promote its role as a sponsor by signage, logos or trademarks on the Race Car. There are no restrictions on the amount of area that associate and/or secondary sponsors signage, logos, or trademarks may occupy on the race car.

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original text by stating that SRP does not need Logan's approval for secondary sponsors, including competitors, which was previously prohibited. It also removes restrictions on signage size and layout, and the statement that secondary sponsors cannot suggest their role is as great as Logan's.",

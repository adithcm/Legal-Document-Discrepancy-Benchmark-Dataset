                "original_text": "Term: twelve (12) months from the date of the Agreement which term shall automatically renew for an additional twelve (12) months on such date if the Agreement is not otherwise terminated according to Section 8 of the Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Term: twelve (12) months from the date of the Agreement which term may be renewed for an additional twelve (12) months on such date if both parties agree in writing. If the agreement is not otherwise terminated according to Section 8 of the Agreement, the renewal is at the discretion of the Company's Chief Executive Officer.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the term automatically renews unless terminated per Section 8. The modified text introduces a contradiction by stating renewal depends on mutual written agreement, but then adds that if not terminated, renewal is at the CEO's discretion, making it unclear if mutual agreement is truly required or if the CEO's decision prevails. This creates uncertainty about the renewal process.",

This Agreement shall terminate immediately upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) upon the death or bankruptcy of CONSULTANT; or (b) upon the close of business on the date the Company gives CONSULTANT written notice of Termination for Cause (as defined below); (c) ninety (90) days following the date the Company gives CONSULTANT written notice of termination for any or no reason; or (d) CONSULTANT may terminate this Agreement by giving ninety (90) days' written notice to REIT.",

This Agreement shall terminate immediately upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) upon the death or bankruptcy of CONSULTANT; or (b) upon the close of business on the date the Company gives CONSULTANT written notice of Termination for Cause (as defined below); (c) ninety (90) days following the date the Company gives CONSULTANT written notice of termination for any or no reason; or (d) CONSULTANT may terminate this Agreement by giving thirty (30) days' written notice to REIT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect to waive the 90-day notice period at its sole discretion and terminate this Agreement immediately.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the CONSULTANT must give 90 days' notice for termination. The modified version introduces a contradiction by also stating the CONSULTANT may terminate this Agreement by giving thirty (30) days' written notice to REIT. The modified version then gives the Company the right to waive the 90-day notice, while the CONSULTANT must provide a notice of thirty (30) days.",

CONSULTANT further agrees that it will not directly or indirectly defame, disparage, or publicly criticize the services, business, integrity, veracity or reputation of the Company or its owners, officers, directors, or employees in any forum or through any medium of communication.

CONSULTANT further agrees that it will not directly or indirectly defame, disparage, or publicly criticize the services, business, integrity, veracity or reputation of the Company or its owners, officers, directors, or employees in any forum or through any medium of communication. However, nothing in this section prevents the CONSULTANT from expressing concerns about the Company's practices internally to the Company's officers or directors, or if such concerns are not addressed, to regulatory bodies.",
                "explanation": "The original clause prohibits disparagement of the company in any forum. The added sentence allows the consultant to express concerns internally and to regulatory bodies, which could be interpreted as a form of criticism, potentially conflicting with the broad prohibition against disparagement. This creates ambiguity regarding what constitutes permissible and impermissible criticism.",

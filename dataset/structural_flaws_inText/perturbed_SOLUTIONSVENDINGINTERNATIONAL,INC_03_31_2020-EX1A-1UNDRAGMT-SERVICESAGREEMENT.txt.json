                "explanation": "The original clause allows either party to terminate by providing 30-day notice. Appending 'and automatically renews for successive one-year terms' creates a direct contradiction, as the agreement now implies automatic renewal despite the termination option. This creates uncertainty around the agreement's duration.",

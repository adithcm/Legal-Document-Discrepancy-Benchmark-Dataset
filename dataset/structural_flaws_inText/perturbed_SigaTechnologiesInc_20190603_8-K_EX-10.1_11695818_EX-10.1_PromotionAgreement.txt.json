MMT or its Affiliates will reasonably cooperate with SIGA to meet applicable pharmacovigilance and safety reporting requirements and in the event of a Product recall. To facilitate pharmacovigilance and safety reporting, the Parties agree that they will follow the procedures described in Schedule 3 Safety Reporting Requirements, which may be amended from time-to-time, to ensure that adverse event and other safety information is identified, reviewed, and reported in a manner that will permit SIGA to comply with applicable Laws, including any reporting requirements with any applicable Regulatory Authority.",

MMT or its Affiliates will cooperate with SIGA to meet applicable pharmacovigilance and safety reporting requirements at SIGA's sole discretion. To facilitate pharmacovigilance and safety reporting, MMT may, but is not required to, follow the procedures described in Schedule 3 Safety Reporting Requirements, which may be amended from time-to-time, to ensure that adverse event and other safety information is identified, reviewed, and reported in a manner that will permit SIGA to comply with applicable Laws, including any reporting requirements with any applicable Regulatory Authority.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandated MMT's cooperation and adherence to the procedures in Schedule 3. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating MMT's cooperation will be based 'at SIGA's sole discretion' and that MMT is not required to follow the procedures from Schedule 3. This creates uncertainty about MMT's responsibility in adverse event reporting.",

The modified text states SIGA 'may, at its discretion', defend and indemnify MMT which means SIGA can choose whether to or not defend and indemnify MMT. This contradicts the previous part of the statement that is is required. It also adds that SIGA is not obligated to indemnify MMT for product liability claims, despite previously stating that they were.",

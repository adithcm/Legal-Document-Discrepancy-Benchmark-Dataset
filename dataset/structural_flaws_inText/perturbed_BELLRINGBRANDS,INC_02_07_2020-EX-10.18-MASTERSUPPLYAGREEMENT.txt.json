Such Master Purchase Commitments and any Purchase Orders issued against such Commitments shall be subject exclusively to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event the terms of any Master Purchase Commitment conflicts with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of the Master Purchase Commitment shall control.",

In the event the terms of this Agreement conflicts with the terms of the Master Purchase Commitment, the terms of *this Agreement* shall control.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Master Purchase Commitment will control in case of conflict with the main agreement. This change gives precedence to the main agreement, which creates contradictory instructions about which document takes precedence, leading to potential disputes.",

Renewal for additional periods will be at the sole discretion of Supplier and requires written confirmation to Buyer at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term, unless terminated as permitted under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the agreement automatically renews unless a party opts out. The modified version gives sole discretion to the Supplier to decide on the renewal, contradicting the implied automatic renewal. The 30-day notice period further exacerbates the conflict with the original 12-month period, creating confusion regarding renewal conditions.",

If Ingredients provided by Supplier under this Agreement are misbranded, contaminated, or otherwise unfit for human consumption at the time they are delivered to PNC or its TPM (\"Defect\"), PNC in its sole discretion will make a determination of the necessity of a recall, market withdrawal, inventory retrieval, or other action designed to prevent the distribution or sale of the affected Finished Products, plus the type, extent, method of handling, disposition of the Finished Products as well as any affected work in progress, and all other particulars involved in such an action (a \"Recall\"), and PNC will execute any Recall. Supplier, in its sole discretion, will make a determination of the necessity of a recall, market withdrawal, inventory retrieval or other action designed to prevent the distribution or sale of the Ingredients. Subject to Section 9.1, Supplier shall bear the complete responsibility for a Recall occasioned by a Defect in the Ingredient and shall indemnify PNC for [***] resulting from or related to the Recall. Any Recall occasioned by PNC labels or by tampering with the Ingredients after they have left Supplier's control, or by improper storing or handling by PNC, will not be considered a Defect.",
                "changed_text": "8 Recall. If Ingredients provided by Supplier under this Agreement are misbranded, contaminated, or otherwise unfit for human consumption at the time they are delivered to PNC or its TPM (\"Defect\"), the need for a recall will be jointly determined by PNC and Supplier, with PNC having final say. The type, extent, method of handling, disposition of the Finished Products as well as any affected work in progress, and all other particulars involved in such an action (a \"Recall\"), will be mutually agreed upon. However, Supplier retains the right to contest PNC's decision. Subject to Section 9.1, responsibility for a Recall occasioned by a Defect in the Ingredient will be determined based on a fault assessment to be conducted jointly by the Parties. Recall costs will be shared equally by PNC and Supplier. Any Recall occasioned by PNC labels or by tampering with the Ingredients after they have left Supplier's control, or by improper storing or handling by PNC, will be considered a Defect for which Supplier will not be responsible.",
                "explanation": "The original text placed the determination of a recall solely on PNC. It also made the Supplier bear the complete responsibility. The modified version introduces elements of mutual agreement and shared responsibility, but retains PNC's final say. The introduction of a fault assessment and equal sharing of costs contradicts the initial assignment of complete responsibility to the Supplier, thus creating uncertainty about financial obligations.",

This  Agreement  shall  be effective upon the              ------------------- Effective Date and shall remain in force for a period of one (1) year, and shall be automatically renewed for successive periods of one (1) year unless otherwise terminated  as provided  herein.",

This  Agreement  shall  be effective upon the              ------------------- Effective Date and shall remain in force for a period of one (1) year, and may be renewed for successive periods of one (1) year by mutual written consent of both parties. If no written consent is provided, the agreement will terminate after the initial year.",

This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue in full force and effect until the end of the fifteenth (15th) Contract Year, and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter until terminated by either Party by providing thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice of termination to the other Party (such fifteen (15) Contract Year period, as may be further extended as provided herein is referred to as the \"Term\").",

                "explanation": "The original text specified the initial term and renewal process that includes a 30-day written notice. The modified version contradicts this by allowing either party to terminate the agreement at any time without any prior notice, creating uncertainty about the duration and termination conditions of the contract.",

The modified version completely removes any restriction on communication either verbally or in writing and does not include any addresses.

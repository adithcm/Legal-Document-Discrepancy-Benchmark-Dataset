                "original_text": "Theismann agrees that any material submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Theismann shall advise Bizzingo in writing of the specific grounds therefor at the time of disapproval and provide Bizzingo with specific changes or alterations to such materials. Bizzingo thereafter shall have the right and privileged to use such Property as provided in this Agreement subject to such changes or alterations.",
                "changed_text": "Theismann agrees that any material submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved. Bizzingo thereafter shall have the right and privileged to use such Property as provided in this Agreement, even if Theismann disapproves of changes or alterations. Theismann's disapproval will be considered, but not necessarily followed.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Bizzingo can use the Property subject to Theismann's changes or alterations. The changed text allows Bizzingo to use the Property even if Theismann disapproves, creating a contradiction about the extent of Theismann's control over the use of his Property and causes uncertainty about the approval process.",

                "changed_text": "Unless sooner terminated under the provisions hereof, this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for a period of one (1) year (\"Term\"). provided however, that Bizzingo may extend the Term for an additional year period unilaterally, without the need for a written addendum or agreement from Theismann.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a written addendum agreed upon by both parties to extend the term. The changed text gives Bizzingo the unilateral right to extend the term, contradicting the need for mutual agreement. This creates uncertainty about the duration of the agreement and Theismann's rights regarding renewal.",

                "original_text": "In addition to as stated in (a) or (b) above, either party may terminate this Agreement in the event of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other by providing thirty (30) days* prior written notice to the breaching party, provided that, during the 30- day period, the breaching party fails to cure such breach.",
                "changed_text": "In addition to as stated in (a) or (b) above, either party may terminate this Agreement in the event of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other; however, Bizzingo reserves the right to terminate the agreement immediately for any breach by Theismann, without providing a 30-day cure period.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a 30-day cure period for breaches. The modified text allows Bizzingo to terminate immediately for Theismann's breach without any cure period. This creates an imbalance of power and a contradiction in the termination rights of each party.",

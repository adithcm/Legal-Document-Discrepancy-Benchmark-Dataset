                "original_text": "4.4 Annual Performance Bonuses:\n\nYou will be eligible to participate in the Company's discretionary annual performance related bonus scheme to a maximum value of 35% of your Earned Salary in relation to your performance against agreed annual corporate and personal performance objectives as set out below (the \"Annual Performance Bonus\"). That is, if the compensation committee (the \"Compensation Committee\") of the board of directors (the \"Board\") of the Company's parent company, Bicycle Therapeutics plc (\"BTL\") determines that you have completed all such corporate and personal objectives to its satisfaction in a given year, your bonus would be 35% of your Earned Salary in that year, excluding any other bonuses in this offer. Such bonus may be payable in cash or, in whole or in part, in share options in BTL, as agreed by you and the Compensation Committee following notification by you of your preference at least 90 days prior to the normal payment date (and in the case of share options with the appropriate HMRC valuation process (if required by the Compensation Committee) and Board approval so as to be compliant with BTL's share option plan rules), with due consideration for the operational requirements of the Company at that time in your role as CBO.\n\nAny Annual Performance Bonus paid will not be pensionable and are subject to statutory applicable tax and National Insurance deductions. Performance will be assessed by the Compensation Committee at the end of each calendar year, against annual corporate and personal performance objectives agreed between you and the Board at the start of each calendar year, with any such bonus being payable in the first quarter of the following year. Qualification for your Annual Performance Bonus will require that you are employed by the Company (and have not served notice of termination of your employment to the Company) on 31 December of the year to which your bonus entitlement applies.",

The specific details of the bonus, including the maximum value, performance objectives, and payout structure, will be determined annually by the Compensation Committee (the \"Compensation Committee\") of the board of directors (the \"Board\") of the Company's parent company, Bicycle Therapeutics plc (\"BTL\") at its sole discretion. Any bonus, if awarded, may be payable in cash or, in whole or in part, in share options in BTL, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The Committee may consider your preferences, but the final decision rests with them.\n\nAny bonus paid will not be pensionable and are subject to statutory applicable tax and National Insurance deductions.

Qualification for any bonus will require that you are employed by the Company (and have not served notice of termination of your employment to the Company) at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the employee 'will be eligible' for a bonus 'to a maximum value of 35% of your Earned Salary' if certain objectives are met. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating 'may be eligible' and that 'specific details...will be determined annually by the Compensation Committee at its sole discretion.' This contradicts the original assurance of a defined bonus structure. The condition that the bonus is paid 'at a time determined by the Compensation Committee' also contradicts the original clause that the bonus would be payable in the first quarter of the following year. The added discretion about employment status also introduces uncertainty.",

The exact number of holiday days, and whether or not they will accrue on a pro rata basis, will be determined by the Company's policy in effect at the time, which may change from time to time.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly grants '25 working days paid holiday.' The modified clause introduces uncertainty by changing 'will be entitled to 25 working days' to 'may be entitled to a certain number,' making the holiday entitlement discretionary. The caveat that accrual and number of days 'will be determined by the Company's policy' creates a contradiction to the initial entitlement and injects uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "By adding \"if any, as determined solely by Honeywell\", the definition of Honeywell Trade Secrets and Honeywell Trademarks becomes subjective and controlled by Honeywell. This introduces uncertainty and contradicts the original definitions, making it unclear which Trade Secrets and Trademarks are actually considered Honeywell's.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"shall ensure\" to \"may, but is not required to, ensure\", it introduces a contradiction and ambiguity about the obligations if Honeywell were to merge or consolidate. Previously, it was mandatory for the assigning party to ensure the assignee assumed obligations. Now, it's discretionary, creating uncertainty about whether the contract remains enforceable after such a transaction.",

                "explanation": "By introducing \"may or may not be deemed to be\", the protection granted by Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code becomes uncertain. Previously, it was explicitly stated that the licenses were intended to be treated as intellectual property under the Bankruptcy Code. The change removes this certainty, creating ambiguity about the treatment of these licenses in the event of bankruptcy.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding whether capital contribution is mandatory or optional for each participant. The original text implies a mandatory contribution ('will contribute'), while the modified text suggests it is discretionary ('may contribute') creating uncertainty about the financial obligations of the participants.",

The revised text makes the meetings optional and contingent ('may be held'), creating a contradiction regarding the frequency and obligation to hold regular meetings. This uncertainty can impact the governance and operational effectiveness of the joint venture.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of the dissolution of the Joint Venture, the distribution of any remaining assets or liabilities will be determined at the discretion of a designated liquidator, taking into account factors such as the initial capital contributions, subsequent contributions, and any outstanding debts or obligations of each Participant. The liquidator's decision will be final and binding.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear proportional distribution based on capital contributions. The modified text introduces subjective factors to determine asset distribution, contradicting the proportional approach described above. The liquidator's discretion and final decision authority creates ambiguity and potential conflict, as it moves away from the previously agreed-upon method.",

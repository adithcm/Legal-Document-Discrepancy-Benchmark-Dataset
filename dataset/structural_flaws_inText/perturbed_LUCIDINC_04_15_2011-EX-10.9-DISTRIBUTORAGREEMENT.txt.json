                "original_text": "A) The initial term of this Agreement shall be three (3) calendar years from the Agreement date. After the initial term, unless terminated, this  Agreement will automatically renew for periods of one (1) calendar year each.",
                "changed_text": "A) The initial term of this Agreement shall be three (3) calendar years from the Agreement date. After the initial term, renewal for subsequent one (1) calendar year terms is subject to mutual written agreement by both Lucid and the Distributor, and no renewal shall be automatic.",
                "explanation": "Section 2A originally states the agreement auto-renews. This change now makes renewal contingent on mutual agreement, creating a contradiction and uncertainty regarding the renewal process.",

                "original_text": "The Distributor agrees to abide by Lucid's standard payment terms, which are as follows; One Hundred (100) per cent of order value by sixty ( 90 )  day irrevocable letter of credit when order is placed on Lucid.",
                "changed_text": "The Distributor agrees to abide by Lucid's standard payment terms, which are as follows; Payment terms are subject to negotiation on a case-by-case basis and may include a deposit, milestone payments, or a letter of credit. The standard payment term is thirty (30) days from invoice date, unless otherwise agreed in writing.",
                "explanation": "Section 15 originally specified payment via 60/90-day irrevocable letter of credit. The modified version introduces negotiable payment terms and a standard 30-day term, directly contradicting the original, mandatory letter of credit requirement and creates uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "A) Lucid does not guarantee delivery of Product by any particular date. If Lucid accepts Distributor's order and fails to deliver ordered products,  Distributors sole remedy will be limited to refund of money paid to Lucid for any undelivered products.",
                "changed_text": "A) Lucid will use reasonable efforts to meet requested delivery dates. If Lucid accepts Distributor's order and fails to deliver ordered products, Distributorâ€™s sole remedy will be limited to either a refund of money paid to Lucid for any undelivered products or a credit towards future purchases, at Lucid's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Section 19A initially states Lucid does not guarantee the delivery date. This is still true. However, the original clause specified that the distributor's sole remedy for failure to deliver is a refund. The modification introduces an alternative remedy of 'a credit towards future purchases, at Lucid's discretion'. This contradicts the 'sole remedy' provision by adding another, discretionary, option, creating uncertainty about the distributor's rights.",

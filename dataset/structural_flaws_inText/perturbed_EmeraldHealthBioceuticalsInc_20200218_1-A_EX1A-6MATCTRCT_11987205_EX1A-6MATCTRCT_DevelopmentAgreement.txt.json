                "original_text": "The Services Term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive two-year terms thereafter unless written notice is given by either party to the other, indicating that party's intention not to renew the Services Term of this Agreement, at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the initial Services Term or any renewed Services Term.",
                "changed_text": "The Services Term of this Agreement may be renewed for successive two-year terms thereafter only upon mutual written agreement of both parties, provided that any such renewal agreement is executed at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the initial Services Term or any renewed Services Term. The Services term may also be renewed without any notification.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates automatic renewal unless notice is given. The modified text requires mutual agreement for renewal, contradicting the automatic renewal clause. The addition of 'The Services term may also be renewed without any notification.' provides another conflicting implication.",

Dr. Murray shall not directly assist in the development of any product competitive to products developed by EHS or EHN.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states Dr. Murray will not assist in developing competing products. The modification contradicts this by stating he *may* assist, subject to certain conditions which creates ambiguity around the exclusivity agreement. It ends with the original, thus creating contradiction.",

EHS or EHN agrees to reimburse Dr. Murray for all reasonable expenses (air travel, hotel, car rental, meals, materials, etc.) relating to EHS or EHN directed activities, subject to prior approval in each case.",
                "changed_text": "Any pre-approved expenses incurred by Dr. Murray on behalf of EHS or EHN during any Services Term *may* be reimbursed, including but not limited to travel expenses incurred for air travel, car rental, hotels and meals, subject to prior approval in each case. Reimbursement of Dr. Murrayâ€™s expenses will be subject to EHS and EHN budget concerns and Dr. Murray expenses may not be fully reimbursed even if pre-approved. EHS or EHN agrees to reimburse Dr. Murray for all reasonable expenses (air travel, hotel, car rental, meals, materials, etc.) relating to EHS or EHN directed activities, subject to prior approval in each case.",
                "explanation": "The original text says expenses 'will be reimbursed' if pre-approved. The modification changes this to 'may be reimbursed', adding uncertainty. The statement about budget concerns and potentially not fully reimbursing, despite pre-approval, directly contradicts the initial promise of reimbursement. It ends with the original section, which contradicts again the first statement in the change. These contradictory statements create confusion over expense reimbursement obligations.",

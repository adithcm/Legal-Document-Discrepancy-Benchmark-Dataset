For the avoidance of doubt, after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Village Media Company and its permitted licensees shall continue to have the right to fully exploit, use, and Exploit the HOFV Works for the length of the term of the license granted by PFHOF in connection with such HOFV Work pursuant to Section 2.3; provided that the length of the term of such license shall be a minimum of five (5) years. Any HOFV Works created pursuant to this Agreement shall exclusively be owned by the Village Media Company; provided, however, that, (i) PFHOF shall own all right, title, interest, and copyright in and to the underlying PFHOF Work(s) as further set forth in Section 2.5 and (ii) the Village Media Company's ownership is subject in all events to any Rights Restrictions and the terms of the license (including the term of such license) granted by PFHOF in connection with such HOFV Work pursuant to Section 2.3.",

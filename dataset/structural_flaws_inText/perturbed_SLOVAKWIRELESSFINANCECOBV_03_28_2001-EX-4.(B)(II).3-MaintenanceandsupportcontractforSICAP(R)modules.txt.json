                "original_text": "After the initial period of two years, the maintenance and support contract shall be automatically renewed for a period of one year on each renewal date, unless one of the parties terminates the maintenance and support contract through written notification to the other party in the form of a registered letter with proof of receipt, at least six (6) weeks prior to the renewal date. There shall be no reimbursement of any paid fee.",
                "changed_text": "After the initial period of two years, the maintenance and support contract may be renewed for a period of one year on each renewal date, subject to mutual written agreement by both parties.  Renewal terms, including the method of termination, shall be renegotiated at the time of renewal. There shall be no reimbursement of any paid fee.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states the contract auto-renews unless terminated. The modified clause now states renewal is 'subject to mutual written agreement,' directly contradicting the auto-renewal and creating uncertainty about the process. The modification removes the explicit termination requirements, further muddying the waters.",

                "original_text": "All payments due under this Maintenance and Support contract shall be due and payable 30 days after the invoice date, with the first invoice to be issued on the date this Maintenance and Support contract comes into full force and effect.",
                "changed_text": "Payments due under this Maintenance and Support contract will typically be due 30 days after the invoice date. However, the exact payment terms, including potential discounts for early payment or penalties for late payment, will be specified on each invoice. The first invoice will be issued at the company's earliest convenience after the contract's start date.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear 30-day payment term. The modified version introduces ambiguity by using 'typically' and stating that the 'exact payment terms will be specified on each invoice.' This contradicts the initial 30-day term and causes uncertainty because the payment deadline is no longer fixed. The delay in issuing the first invoice is also now vague, contradicting the original text.",

                "original_text": "Sicap Ltd's liability for indirect loss, including consequential loss, loss of profit, lost savings and loss caused by interruption of operations is excluded.",
                "changed_text": "Sicap Ltd's liability for indirect loss may be limited, depending on the specific circumstances.  While consequential loss, loss of profit, and lost savings are generally excluded, claims for interruption of operations will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, considering the degree of negligence and the foreseeability of the damage.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly excludes Sicap Ltd's liability for indirect loss. The modified version creates a contradiction by stating that liability 'may be limited' and that claims for interruption of operations will be assessed 'on a case-by-case basis.' This directly contradicts the previous exclusion and creates uncertainty about the extent of Sicap Ltd's liability.",

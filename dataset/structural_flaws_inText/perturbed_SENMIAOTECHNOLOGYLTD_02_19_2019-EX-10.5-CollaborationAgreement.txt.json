                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that a refund is provided in both circumstances with or without a Vehicle Lease Agreement, the modified text makes the refund discretionary in the first instance and removes it completely in the second, creating contradiction and uncertainty about the deposit return.",

In the event of any losses incurred to the observing party, in addition to the corresponding liability for breach under the Agreement, the breaching party shall also be liable for the compensation for such losses (including, but not limited to, the losses incurred to the counterParty By such breach, the legal costs, notarial fees, appraisal fees, the attorney's fee, the travel expenses, etc., arising from the investigation and affixation of the liabilities of the breaching Party By the counterparty) . Unless any party is in violation of the confidentiality clause, in any case, neither party shall be liable for any indirect, punitive claims, or claims for losses of commercial profits, or damages for business losses of the company or any third Party Arising from this Agreement, or for any loss or inaccuracy of data of any form, whether based on Agreement, tort or any other legal principle, even though the party has been informed of the possibility of such damage.",

This modified version contradicts that by stating that the breaching party is not required to remedy the breach nor liable for any losses incurred.

By adding 'the term of the validity of this Agreement may be subject to change by Party B,' we create uncertainty.

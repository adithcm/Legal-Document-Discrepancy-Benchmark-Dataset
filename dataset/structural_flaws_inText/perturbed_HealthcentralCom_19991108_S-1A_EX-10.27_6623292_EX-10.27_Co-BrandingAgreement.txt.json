                "original_text": "During the Term of the Agreement, and subject to the following requirements respecting Canadian content levels as set out in paragraphs 3(f), (g) and (h), HCI shall be the exclusive health content partner in the health section of the Sympatico web site, provided however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent MediaLinx from entering into an agreement with other parties for: i) a health based web directory; or ii) other health related content whose content does not compete with the content contained on the Co-Branded Site; which in no event shall receive no more than one fifth (1/5th) of the promotion and which shall constitute no more than one fifth (1/5th) of the total health related content which resides on the home page of the Sympatico Health section.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of the Agreement, and subject to the following requirements respecting Canadian content levels as set out in paragraphs 3(f), (g) and (h), HCI may be considered for the role of health content partner in the health section of the Sympatico web site, at MediaLinx's sole discretion. MediaLinx reserves the right to enter into agreements with other parties for any health-related content, regardless of competition with the Co-Branded Site, with no limitations on promotion or the proportion of health-related content on the Sympatico Health section's homepage.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants HCI exclusivity as a health content partner, with limited exceptions. The modified version removes this exclusivity, stating HCI's partnership is at MediaLinx's discretion and removing all restrictions on MediaLinx's ability to partner with competitors and promote their content. This creates a direct contradiction regarding HCI's exclusivity, introducing uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "changed_text": "HCI may pay MLX a sum, to be determined later, during the Initial Term of this Agreement, potentially paid out as a monthly payment (the \"Potential Payment\"). The terms of the Potential Payment, including the amount, schedule, and whether it will be paid at all, are subject to further negotiation and may be revised or eliminated at any time.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states a guaranteed fixed payment from HCI to MLX. The modified version introduces uncertainty by replacing the guaranteed payment with a \"Potential Payment\" whose amount, schedule, and even existence are subject to future negotiation and revision. This directly contradicts the original guarantee, creating ambiguity and potential disputes over payment obligations.",

                "changed_text": "MediaLinx may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, upon 30 days prior written notice to HCI. HCI may only terminate this agreement if MediaLinx agrees to it.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows either party to terminate the agreement with 30 days notice if the other breaches the agreement or if mutually approved terms cannot be agreed upon. The changed clause heavily favors MediaLinx, allowing them to terminate at any time for any reason, while restricting HCI's termination rights significantly. This creates an imbalance and contradicts the original, more equitable, termination clause.",

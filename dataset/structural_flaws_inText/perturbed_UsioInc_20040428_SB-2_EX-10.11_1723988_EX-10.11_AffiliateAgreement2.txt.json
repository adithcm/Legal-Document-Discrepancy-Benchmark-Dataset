Affiliate agrees to submit  all  Merchant  Agreements  procured by Affiliate in accordance with this Agreement  to  Network 1.  Network 1 agrees to review and approve or decline all Merchant  Agreements  submitted  by  Affiliate  to  Network 1 in accordance with Network 1's approval policy.  Affiliate acknowledges that approval of a Merchant creates  a  customer relationship between Bank and the Merchant, which involves, among  other  things,  the  collection  and disbursement of funds to process and settle Merchant Transactions.  Bank and Network 1 shall, in its sole discretion, make  the  final  decision  as to whether or not approve or decline any Merchant Agreement submitted to Bank in accordance with this Agreement.  Network 1 agrees to  make  reasonable  efforts  to  review  and  approve  or decline all Merchant Agreements  submitted  to  Network  1.",

Affiliate agrees to submit  all  Merchant  Agreements  procured by Affiliate in accordance with this Agreement  to  Network 1. Network 1 will automatically approve all Merchant Agreements submitted by Affiliate. Affiliate acknowledges that approval of a Merchant creates  a  customer relationship between Bank and the Merchant, which involves, among  other  things,  the  collection  and disbursement of funds to process and settle Merchant Transactions. Bank and Network 1 shall abide by this automatic approval of merchant agreements. Network 1 is not required to review or approve merchant agreements.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Network 1 will review and either approve or decline the Merchant Agreements. The changed text introduces a contradiction by stating that Network 1 will automatically approve all Merchant Agreements, while also saying Network 1 is not required to review or approve them, thus creating uncertainty as to the actual procedure. The text creates a contradiction about whether or not Network 1 has approval discretion and whether or not Network 1 needs to review the agreements.",

Upon termination due to an uncured default  by  Affiliate,  or  termination for cause pursuant to Section 5.02  [TERMINATION]D all Affiliates  fees  shall  cease  to  be  accrued  and  paid  immediately upon the occurrence  of  said  event.",

Network 1 is not obligated to provide payments if this agreement is terminated.",
                "explanation": "The original text specified that Network 1 'shall' continue to pay Affiliate fees after termination, except under specific default circumstances. The revised text uses 'may, at its sole discretion' removing the obligation and introducing uncertainty. It contradicts the original requirement that payments shall continue, by stating Network 1 is not obligated to make payments.",

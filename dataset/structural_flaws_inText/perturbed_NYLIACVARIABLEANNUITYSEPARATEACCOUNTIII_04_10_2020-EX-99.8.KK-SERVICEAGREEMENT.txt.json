This Agreement shall terminate immediately and automatically upon the termination of Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, and in such event no notice need be given hereunder.",

This Agreement shall terminate immediately and automatically upon the termination of Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, and in such event no notice need be given hereunder. However, FIIOC is required to provide a 90-day written notice before termination, regardless of the grounds for termination.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows immediate termination by FIIOC under specific circumstances (law, board action, or breach). The modified text adds a contradictory requirement for 90-day notice 'regardless of the grounds,' negating the 'immediate' termination clause and creating uncertainty about the actual termination process.",

In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC, FIIOC agrees to pay Company a quarterly fee computed as follows:\n\nAt the close of each calendar quarter, FIIOC will determine the Average Daily Assets held in the Funds by the Company. Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter divided by the number of calendar days in the quarter. The Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that sum shall be divided by four.

For such a stub quarter, Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter through and including the date of termination of the Participation Agreement(s), divided by the number of calendar days in that quarter for which the Participation Agreement was in effect. Such Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that number shall be multiplied by the number of days in such quarter that the Participation Agreement was in effect, then divided by three hundred sixty-five.

                "explanation": "The original section defines a clear formula for calculating the quarterly fee. The addition of 'FIIOC reserves the right to adjust the compensation retroactively based on its assessment of the quality' introduces an arbitrary element that contradicts the formula and creates uncertainty regarding the actual amount of compensation. This discretionary adjustment can negate the defined calculation.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows for automatic assignment to FIIOC's successor. The modified text contradicts this by stating assignments to a successor can be denied for any reason, creating uncertainty about whether the agreement will transfer. Adding the 180-day review period also contradicts the lack of required consent from the Company as the first statement allows, creating another enforcement challenge.",

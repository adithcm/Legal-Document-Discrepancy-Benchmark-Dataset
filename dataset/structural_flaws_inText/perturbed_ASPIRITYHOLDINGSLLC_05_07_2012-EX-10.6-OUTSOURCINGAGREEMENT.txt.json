The Company or the Contractor may terminate this Agreement at any time in whole or in part as more specifically provided below, and in such case, the Contractor will be paid fees incurred up to the date of such termination plus its expenses accrued as of such date within 30 days of such termination. The Company will have the ability to terminate this Agreement by giving 60 days' prior written notice to the Contractor. The Contractor will have the ability to terminate this Agreement by giving 90 days' prior written notice to the Company.",

In such case, the Contractor will only be paid for services properly invoiced and approved, if any, up to the date of such termination. The Contractor will not have the ability to terminate this agreement unless explicitly agreed upon in writing by the company.",

The modified version allows the Company to terminate the agreement without notice and limits the Contractor's compensation, while removing the Contractor's ability to terminate, creating a contradiction and uncertainty.",

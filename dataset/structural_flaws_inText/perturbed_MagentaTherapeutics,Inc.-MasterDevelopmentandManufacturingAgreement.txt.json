Unless specifically agreed otherwise in writing by the Parties, including as agreed in a Project Plan, (i) all invoices and payments hereunder shall be in U.S. Dollars, (ii) payments will be made payable to Bachem at the address set forth in applicable Project Plan(s), and (iii) all undisputed payments shall be made within [***] of receipt of invoice by Magenta.",

Unless specifically agreed otherwise in writing by the Parties, including as agreed in a Project Plan, (i) all invoices and payments hereunder may be in any currency deemed suitable by Bachem, (ii) payments will be made payable to Bachem at an address communicated verbally, and (iii) all undisputed payments shall be made within 180 days of receipt of invoice by Magenta.",
                "explanation": "The original text states payments must be in US dollars and made within a certain period. The change introduces the possibility of payment in any currency and extends the payment timeframe dramatically. This contradicts the original intent and creates uncertainty and potential financial strain.",

                "explanation": "The original text guarantees that Services will be provided professionally, on time, and to high standards. The changed text removes these guarantees. This creates a contradiction by implying that Bachem does not commit to consistently high performance levels in every situation.",

This Agreement or any Project Plan may be terminated:\n\n(a) by Magenta for any reason upon [***] written notice to Bachem;\n\n(b) by either Party if the other Party materially breaches a provision of this Agreement or a Project Plan, and fails to cure such breach within [***] following receipt of written notification of such breach from the non-breaching Party;\n\n(c) by either Party, immediately, if the other Party becomes insolvent, is dissolved or liquidated, makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or files or has filed against it, a petition in bankruptcy that is not dismissed within sixty days after filing, or has a receiver appointed for a substantial part of its assets; and\n\n(d) by a Party or the Parties pursuant to Section 13.\n\nIn the event of termination pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or a termination by Bachem pursuant to Section 7.2(b), Bachem shall be compensated for Services rendered up to the date of termination. In the event of any other termination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the appropriate amount to be paid by Magenta to Bachem (or refunded to Magenta by Bachem, as the case may be), in light of the circumstances of such termination, in compensation for all Services rendered in accordance with this Agreement. In the event of Bachem's inability to supply the Product or a material breach by Bachem pursuant to Section 7.2(b), Bachem shall provide, without additional charge to Magenta, sufficient information and technology pertaining to its Services to Magenta and/or its technically competent designee, such that Magenta and/or its technically competent designee are enabled to continue Development Work and manufacture of the Product. The termination of any Project Plan may be independent of the termination of this Agreement.",

This Agreement or any Project Plan may be terminated:\n\n(a) by Magenta for any reason upon [***] written notice to Bachem, provided such termination is solely for Magenta's convenience and not due to any deficiency in Bachem's performance. If Magenta terminates for any other reason, this termination right shall be void;\n\n(b) by either Party if the other Party materially breaches a provision of this Agreement or a Project Plan, and fails to cure such breach within [***] following receipt of written notification of such breach from the non-breaching Party; HOWEVER, if the alleged breach is related to failure to meet SPECIFICATIONS, it will be determined in Bachem's sole discretion whether the specifications were realistically achievable and whether to cure such breach;\n\n(c) by either Party, immediately, if the other Party becomes insolvent, is dissolved or liquidated, makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or files or has filed against it, a petition in bankruptcy that is not dismissed within sixty days after filing, or has a receiver appointed for a substantial part of its assets; and\n\n(d) by a Party or the Parties pursuant to Section 13.\n\nIn the event of termination pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or a termination by Bachem pursuant to Section 7.2(b), Bachem shall be compensated for Services rendered up to the date of termination.

The termination of any Project Plan may be independent of the termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The amendment to Section 7.2(a) severely restricts Magenta's right to terminate for any reason. Previously, Magenta could terminate for *any* reason with proper notice; now, it's limited to convenience only. Also, Bachem can unilaterally decide whether it breached the contract or should cure that. This directly contradicts the broad right to terminate and creates an imbalance of power.",

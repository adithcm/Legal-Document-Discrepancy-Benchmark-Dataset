Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement on the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof. <*$p$*>B. Guarantors shall guarantee performance by Master Franchisee of the obligations under the Master Franchise Agreement. However, the extent of the guarantee is limited to 50% of the total obligations, and is further contingent upon Master Franchisee maintaining good standing with local business regulatory organizations.<*$p$*> C. Guarantors shall indemnify and save harmless Franchisor and its affiliates against and from all losses, damages, costs, and expenses which Franchisor and its affiliates may sustain, incur, or become liable for by reason of: (1) the failure for any reason whatsoever of Master Franchisee to pay the monies payable pursuant to the Master Franchise Agreement or to do and perform any other act, matter or thing pursuant to the provisions of the Master Franchise Agreement; or (2) any act, action, or proceeding of or by Franchisor for or in connection with the recovery of monies or the obtaining of performance by Master Franchisee of any other act, matter or thing pursuant to the provisions of the Master Franchise Agreement. D. Franchisor shall not be obligated to proceed against Master Franchisee or exhaust any security from Master Franchisee or pursue or exhaust any remedy, including any legal or equitable relief against Master Franchisee, before proceeding to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee, and the enforcement of such obligations may take place before, after, or contemporaneously with, enforcement of any debt or obligation of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement. <*$p$*>E. The Franchisor may not extend, modify, or release any indebtedness or obligation of Master Franchisee without prior written consent from the Guarantors. If such a modification is undertaken without the Guarantors' explicit consent, the Guarantors' obligations under this guarantee may be terminated at their discretion. Any action taken by Franchisor that impacts Master Franchisee must be communicated to Guarantors within three business days. Guarantors reserve the right to seek legal remedies if any change is enacted without explicit approval.<*$p$*> <*$p$*>F. Guarantors' obligations under this Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect, unless the Master Franchise Agreement becomes unenforceable against Master Franchisee due to circumstances beyond the Master Franchisee's control, such as changes in local laws or regulations. In the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, or other liquidation of Master Franchisee, the Guarantors' obligations may be reviewed and potentially reduced based on the assessed financial impact. If the Franchisor consents or acquiesces to any bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency, or any other creditor's proceedings of or against Master Franchisee without first seeking consent from the Guarantors, then the Guarantors' obligations will be automatically terminated.<*$p$*> Source: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015 G.

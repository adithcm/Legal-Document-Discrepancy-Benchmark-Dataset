Exhibit 10.17(b) ---------------- FIRST AMENDMENT TO SAGEBRUSH MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO SAGEBRUSH MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT ("Amendment") is made and entered into as of December 1, 1990 by and among Sagebrush, a California general partnership ("Partnership"), the undersigned partners of the Partnership, being all of the Sagebrush partners ("Partners"), and ToyoWest Management Inc., a California corporation ("Manager"), with respect to the following facts and circumstances: R E C I T A L S --------------- A. The Partnership, all of the Partners except Alpha Mariah (Prime), Inc. and Beta Mariah (Prime) Inc., and Manager entered into that certain Sagebrush Management and Maintenance Agreement, dated as of September 1, 1989 (the "Agreement"). B. Concurrently herewith, all of the Partners are entering into a First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Sagebrush General Co-Ownership Partnership Agreement, by which the Partners agree, among other things, that Alpha Mariah (Prime), Inc. and Beta Mariah (Prime), Inc. are admitted to the Partnership. C. The Partnership, the Partners and Manager desire to amend the Agreement to extend the term of the Agreement and to add a new section concerning curtailment of the LIFO Partners (as defined below), all as set forth in this Amendment. NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the foregoing premises, the parties hereby agree as follows: 1. Amendment. --------- (a) Section 6.1 of the Agreement shall be, and hereby is, amended by deleting the date "September 30, 2003" where it appears therein, and inserting in its place the date "July 20, 2006". (b) A new Section 7.4 is hereby added to the Agreement, as follows: "7.4 Disconnection of LIFO Partners. <*$p$*>In addition to the other rights provided to Manager hereunder to disconnect the Projects of the Partners (or their Partner Affiliates), the Manager may, at its sole discretion, disconnect the Projects of Alpha Willow, SP11, SP12, SP13, SP14 and SP21 (together with their Partner Affiliates, the "LIFO Partners") in the following circumstances. If at any time, and for any reason, the Manager deems it necessary, (i) the Transmission Line is operating sub-optimally, or (ii) the Transmission Line line losses exceed acceptable limits, or (iii) the Transmission Line line losses exceed historical norms, then the Manager may curtail the Projects of the LIFO Partners.<*$p$*> Nothing contained in the preceding sentence shall affect the rights of the Manager to curtail or disconnect the Project of a Partner under Section 4 of that Partner's Technical Use Agreement. <*$p$*>Any curtailment under this provision may be in any amount deemed appropriate by the Manager, and may or may not improve the Transmission Line. Such curtailment may continue indefinitely, at the Manager's discretion, regardless of whether the conditions giving rise to the curtailment have been resolved.<*$p$*> <*$p$*>Even if the LIFO Partners inform the Manager in writing of an agreement among them concerning the priority of the curtailment of their respective Projects, the Manager may disregard such agreement and curtail projects in any order it deems appropriate. If the LIFO Partners fail to inform the Manager, the Manager will select projects to curtail at random.<*$p$*> The Manager shall cooperate with the LIFO Partners to attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment under this provision, provided that any expenses in connection with such cooperation shall be paid by the LIFO Partners. In connection with any attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment, no change to the Transmission Line shall be made without the prior unanimous consent of the Partners (excluding the LIFO Partners), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld." (c) Existing Section 7.4 shall be renumbered as Section 7.5. 2 (d) All references in the Agreement to Manager as "ToyoWest Management Company" shall be interpreted as referring to "ToyoWest Management Inc.," the correct name of Manager. 2. Continuing Validity. Except as expressly modified by Section 1 of this ------------------- Amendment, all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. By execution of this Amendment, Alpha Mariah (Prime), Inc. and Beta Mariah (Prime), Inc. hereby become parties to the Agreement and agree to be bound by all of the terms of the Agreement and this Amendment. 3. Miscellaneous. The provisions contained in Article 10 of the Agreement ------------- are hereby incorporated herein by this cross-reference. 3 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Partnership, the Partners, and Manager have caused this Amendment to be executed on the dates set forth below the signatures of their respective representatives.

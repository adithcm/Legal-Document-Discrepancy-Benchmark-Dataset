                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") shall commence as of April 1, 2018 (the \"Effective Date\") and shall expire upon the later of: (a) the conclusion of the 2022/23 NFL season and (b) the last day in February, 2023 (such expiration date, the \"Scheduled Expiration Date\"), unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") shall commence as of April 1, 2018 (the \"Effective Date\") and shall expire upon the later of: (a) the conclusion of the 2022/23 NFL season and (b) the last day in February, 2023 (such expiration date, the \"Scheduled Expiration Date\"), unless extended by mutual written agreement of both parties. Either party may terminate this agreement with 30 days written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a clear expiration date, but allows for early termination pursuant to other terms. The modified text introduces the possibility of extending the agreement beyond the specified date through mutual agreement. It also introduces an option to terminate with 30 day's notice, creating a direct conflict on how the contract can end. The contract now contains two separate terms regarding when the contract expires, or how it may be terminated early, which could give rise to dispute.",

The payment schedule for these installments will be determined at the sole discretion of the Club and communicated to the Sponsor no less than 30 days prior to the first payment due date.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear payment schedule (six equal installments due on the 1st of each month between June and November). The modified text removes this certainty by stating that the payment schedule will be determined at the sole discretion of the Club. This creates a contradiction because the sponsor now has no set expectation about the due dates of the payments, which could lead to disputes and potential late fees, or breaches of contract.",

The Club will determine the terms of employment, including compensation and benefits, for Sponsor Staff. Sponsor Staff must complete training programs as designated by the Club. Staffing levels at each stand will be determined at the sole discretion of the Club.",
                "explanation": "In the original text, the Sponsor is explicitly responsible for management, control, and employment terms of their staff operating the stands. The changed text gives the Club ultimate authority over Sponsor Staff operations. This creates confusion about who is responsible for Sponsor Staff, potentially leading to liability issues and disputes over staff management, pay, and other employment matters.",

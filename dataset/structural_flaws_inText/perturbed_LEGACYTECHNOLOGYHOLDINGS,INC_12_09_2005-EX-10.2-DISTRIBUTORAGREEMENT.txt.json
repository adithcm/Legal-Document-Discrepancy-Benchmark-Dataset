                "original_text": "The  term of this  Agreement  shall  be two (2)  years  from the          Effective  Date with  automatic  annual  renewals  thereafter  provided          either  party does not provide  sixty (60) days  notice of  termination          prior to the renewal date or the Agreement is not otherwise  terminated          as set forth in Section 8.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be two (2) years from the Effective Date. Following this initial term, renewal will be subject to written mutual agreement by both parties no less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the initial term. If no such agreement is reached, the agreement will expire automatically.",
                "explanation": "Section 7 originally stated the agreement auto-renews unless cancelled. The modified version makes renewal subject to mutual agreement which introduces a conflict. It creates uncertainty about whether the contract renews automatically, or requires explicit consent, making it difficult to enforce renewal terms.",

However, ENVISION reserves the right to purchase similar or identical products from alternative suppliers, at its sole discretion, should SIERRA be unable to meet ENVISION's supply demands or offer competitive pricing, as determined by ENVISION.",
                "explanation": "Section 9 originally states that ENVISION will EXCLUSIVELY purchase the product from SIERRA. The modified version allows ENVISION to purchase from other suppliers, contradicting the exclusive purchase requirement. This weakens SIERRA's guaranteed sales and creates ambiguity regarding exclusivity. This conflicting language undermines the benefits SIERRA should receive as the only supplier. It is also up to ENVISION's discretion on whether to purchase from SIERRA, creating uncertainty on enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "SIERRA grants ENVISION a non-exclusive, royalty-free sub-license of the Product's future patents and patent applications to distribute, sell, and market the Finished Product. SIERRA retains the right to grant similar licenses to other distributors within the Territory.",
                "explanation": "Section 10 states that the license is exclusive, however the modified version states that the license is non-exclusive and that SIERRA can grant similar licenses to others. This creates a contradiction about the exclusive rights of ENVISION over patents and applications.",

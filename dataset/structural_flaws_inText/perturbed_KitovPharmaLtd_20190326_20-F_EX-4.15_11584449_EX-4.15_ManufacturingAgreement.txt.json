The Batch size for the Product will be determined on a per-order basis and is subject to change at Dexcel's discretion, with no required minimum or maximum number of tablets.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines Batch size as **** tablets, while the modified text introduces uncertainty by stating it is determined on a per-order basis and subject to change at Dexcel's discretion. It is contradictory because the fixed number of tablets is replaced by a fluctuating number subject to Dexcel, which could create disputes.",

Kitov will be notified of the final Supply Price no less than 30 days prior to shipment. Prices are subject to change without notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies exact Supply Prices, while the modified text states the listed prices are estimates only and subject to change. This creates conflict because the original prices are definite, while the new statement introduces uncertainty regarding the actual price, potentially leading to billing disputes.",

Dexcel may choose not to renew the agreement at any time without providing a reason.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stated the contract would automatically renew for additional terms unless there was a written notification of non-renewal, the new version removes the automatic renewal and replaces it with discretionary renewal by Dexcel. The certainty of the renewal terms is lost, potentially enabling Dexcel to terminate the agreement unexpectedly after the Initial Term.",

The modified text introduces 'VIP may, at its discretion, return such BNL Data', creating uncertainty regarding whether the data will be returned. Additionally, the change from 'reasonable times' to 'times convenient for VIP' affects BNL's access to its data, potentially hindering its ability to transition to a new service provider if VIP delays providing the data.",

C.

The changed text allows VIP to terminate the agreement 'at any time without notice,' contradicting the original clause. This creates uncertainty regarding the length of the extended term and the security of the agreement for BNL. BNL is then penalized for doing the same as VIP is now allowed.",

                "explanation": "The original text places a specific obligation on VIP to maintain adequate property insurance and to provide BNL with evidence of that coverage upon request. The modification gives VIP sole discretion over the amount of insurance and whether or not to provide evidence of the coverage to BNL. This creates a contradiction because while it states VIP *shall* maintain the insurance, it also states that the amount is up to their discretion and BNL may not receive any proof of the policy's existence.",

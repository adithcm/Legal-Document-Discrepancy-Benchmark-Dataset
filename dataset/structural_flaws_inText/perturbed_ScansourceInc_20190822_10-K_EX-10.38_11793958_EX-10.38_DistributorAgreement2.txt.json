                "original_text": "Customer's license to use the Software shall be limited to, and Customer shall not use the Software in excess of, a single hardware chassis or card or that number of agent(s), concurrent users, sessions, IP addresses, port(s), seat(s), server(s) or site(s), as set forth in the applicable Purchase Order which has been accepted by Cisco and for which Customer has paid to Cisco the required license fee.",
                "changed_text": "Customer's license to use the Software may extend beyond the limits of a single hardware chassis or card, and the number of agents, concurrent users, sessions, IP addresses, ports, seats, servers or sites outlined in the applicable Purchase Order. Cisco reserves the right to audit and determine the appropriate license fees retroactively based on actual usage.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly limits the software license to the quantities specified in the purchase order. The modified text contradicts this by stating that the license *may* exceed those limits and Cisco can retroactively charge for excess usage, creating uncertainty about the scope and cost of the license.",

Customer may terminate this Agreement and the license at any time by destroying all copies of Software including any Documentation. Customer's rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Cisco if Customer fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, Customer shall destroy all copies of Software and Documentation in its possession or control.",

Customer may terminate this Agreement and the license at any time by providing written notice to Cisco, subject to Cisco's approval, which may be withheld at Cisco's sole discretion. Customer's rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Cisco if Customer fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, Customer may, at Cisco's discretion, be required to return or destroy all copies of Software and Documentation in its possession or control.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that customer may terminate at any time, and all they have to do is destroy all copies of the software. The new version requires Cisco's permission to terminate, which Cisco may withhold, and whether they have to destroy all copies of the software upon termination is now at Cisco's discretion, contradicting the original simple termination clause.",

The date of shipment of a Product by Cisco is set forth on the packaging material in which the Product is shipped. Except for the foregoing, the Software is provided AS IS.",

Cisco provides the Software \"AS IS\" and makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding its performance or suitability for any particular purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a period of 30 days from the date of purchase, Cisco will use commercially reasonable efforts to address critical software defects, provided that the customer has properly implemented the software. The date of purchase is determined by Cisco's internal records. Except for the foregoing, the Software is provided AS IS.",
                "explanation": "The original clause includes a limited warranty for a defined period. The modified text starts by stating \"AS IS\" with no warranties, and then contradicts itself by stating they will address critical defects for 30 days if the customer properly implements the software, causing contradiction about the extent of the limited warranty.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the statement on Schedule 13G with respect to the equity securities of Q Biomed, Inc. is, and any amendment thereto signed by each of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The undersigned hereby further agree that this Joint Filing Agreement be included as an exhibit to such statement and any such amendment.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the statement on Schedule 13G with respect to the equity securities of Q Biomed, Inc. may be filed. The decision to file and any amendment thereto is at the sole discretion of Yorkville Advisors Global, LP. The undersigned hereby further agree that this Joint Filing Agreement be included as an exhibit to such statement and any such amendment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces contradiction regarding the mandatory nature of filing. Originally, the agreement states that the statement 'shall be filed,' making it a mandatory obligation for all undersigned parties. The modified text changes this to 'may be filed' and grants sole discretion to Yorkville Advisors Global, LP, creating uncertainty about the responsibility of other parties and contradicting the initial agreement.",

However, all parties contribute to the data and are responsible, jointly and severally, for any inaccuracies, regardless of who provides the information.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original allocation of responsibility. The original text states that each party is responsible only for the accuracy of their own information. The modified version introduces a 'joint and several' liability for all inaccuracies, regardless of the source, placing a significantly different burden on each party and creating conflict regarding the extent of their responsibility.",

The modified version states that only the copy held by Yorkville Advisors Global, LP is official and binding. This creates uncertainty as to which version of the agreement controls and contradicts the original intention of all counterparts being equal.",

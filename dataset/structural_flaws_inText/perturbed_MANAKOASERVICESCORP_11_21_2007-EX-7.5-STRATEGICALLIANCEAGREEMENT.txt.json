                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "G. MKOS will not seek to acquire any technologies presented to MKOS by UTEK from the technology developer directly or indirectly for a period of 24 months following the termination of this Strategic Alliance Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "G. MKOS will not seek to acquire any technologies presented to MKOS by UTEK from the technology developer directly or indirectly for a period of 24 months following the termination of this Strategic Alliance Agreement. However, this restriction does not apply if UTEK fails to actively market the technology to other potential clients during that 24-month period.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a 24-month restriction on MKOS acquiring technologies directly. The modified version introduces an exception that contradicts this restriction, dependent on UTEK's actions. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of the non-acquisition clause.",

In lieu of payment of shares, MKOS shall have the option of paying UTEK $10,000 per month for the Services described in this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated any unvested shares will be returned to MKOS.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration for providing these Services, MKOS may pay UTEK a mutually agreed upon amount, potentially including unregistered shares of common stock or cash, subject to MKOS's financial performance. The specific form and amount of payment will be determined and documented in a separate addendum to this agreement, to be executed within 30 days. If this addendum is not executed, UTEK is not obligated to perform services.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear payment structure. The modified version makes the payment terms ambiguous and dependent on a future agreement (the addendum), contradicting the initial clear consideration. This uncertainty makes the compensation clause difficult to enforce.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time with 30 days written notice, unless such termination would cause undue hardship to the other party, in which case the termination may be delayed for a mutually agreed upon period, not to exceed 90 days, pending mitigation of such hardship.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants either party the right to terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice. The modified version introduces an exception based on 'undue hardship,' creating uncertainty about the termination process and potentially negating the original 30-day notice provision. What constitutes undue hardship is not specified.",

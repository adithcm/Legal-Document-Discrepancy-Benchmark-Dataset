                "original_text": "For purposes of determining Affiliate's Commission, an \"Approved Account\" means any Chase credit card application that is: (i) submitted by any user who clicks on an e-mail, banner or any other advertising material from Affiliate's Website; (ii) is approved by Chase; and (iii) is reported as approved by Chase to Affiliate.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes of determining Affiliate's Commission, an \"Approved Account\" may include any Chase credit card application. Approval of an account is at the discretion of Chase and is not guaranteed even if the user clicks on advertising material from Affiliate's Website. Chase will determine, at its sole discretion, whether an account is reported as approved to the Affiliate.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines an \"Approved Account\" with specific criteria (user clicks, approval by Chase, reported as approved). The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating it \"may include\" any application, removing the guarantee based on clicks. It also makes reporting of approved accounts discretionary, contradicting the original's implication of mandatory reporting, thus creates uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "Affiliate will continue to receive Commission payments for all Approved Accounts placed during the term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Chase may   terminate this Agreement if Affiliate does not comply with the terms and conditions herein.",
                "changed_text": "Affiliate may receive Commission payments for Approved Accounts placed during the term of this Agreement, subject to Chase's ongoing review of Affiliate's compliance. Chase reserves the right to retroactively withhold Commission payments, even for previously Approved Accounts, if Affiliate is found to be in violation of the terms and conditions herein, or for any other reason at Chase's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text states Affiliate \"will continue to receive\" commission payments, implying a guarantee. The modified text changes this to \"may receive,\" making it conditional. The added clause allowing retroactive withholding introduces a direct contradiction and uncertainty by allowing Chase to revoke previously earned commissions, even if the account was initially deemed \"Approved\". This makes the whole payment structure unstable.",

                "original_text": "Chase reserves the right to change any and all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, at any time and in its sole discretion, by posting a new agreement on its Website. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the amount of Commissions, the definition of Approved Accounts, and all other provisions of this Agreement are subject to change without notice other than posting such information on the Chase Website. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO AFFILIATE, THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT. AFFILIATE'S CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM FOLLOWING CHASE'S POSTING OF A NEW AGREEMENT ON ITS WEB SITE WILL CONSTITUTE BINDING ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE.",
                "changed_text": "Chase reserves the right to change any and all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, at any time and in its sole discretion, by directly notifying Affiliate via email, and without the need to post any changes on its Website. Any objections to said changes must be lodged in writing within five business days or will be deemed accepted. Any modification is only acceptable to affiliate when both parties, Chase and Affiliate, sign the agreement, and no other method. Affiliate's continued participation in the Affiliate Program, regardless of Chase's notice of a new agreement, will not automatically constitute acceptance of the change until a written agreement is executed by both Chase and Affiliate.",
                "explanation": "The original allows modifications by posting on the Chase website, with continued participation implying acceptance, and with only recourse for the affiliate to terminate the agreement. The modified version switches the notification method to emails, and requiring objections in writing. The main contradiction is that any modification will only be acceptable when both parties sign the agreement, making 'posting' non-binding, and 'Affiliate's continued participation' is not acceptance.",

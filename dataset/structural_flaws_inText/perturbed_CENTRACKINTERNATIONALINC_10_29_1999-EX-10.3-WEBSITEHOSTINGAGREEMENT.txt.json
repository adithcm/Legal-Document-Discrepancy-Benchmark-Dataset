                "explanation": "The original text specifies that maintenance will be performed during off-peak hours. The modified text contradicts this by stating that i-on can suspend services for maintenance at any time without notice, creating uncertainty about the guaranteed uptime and predictability of service interruptions.",

The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",

The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner may or may not result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site; i-on reserves the right to determine the consequences of late payment on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a fixed payment date and a clear consequence (interruption/discontinuation) for late payment. The modified text introduces a grace period but also introduces ambiguity by saying failure to pay in a timely manner *may or may not* result in service interruption, giving i-on discretion and creating uncertainty about payment obligations and consequences.",

                "explanation": "The original text indicates automatic renewal unless either party provides notice. The modified text states the renewal is at i-on's discretion, overriding the automatic renewal clause and creating uncertainty for the Customer about whether the agreement will continue even if they don't provide notice. This makes the renewal terms one-sided and contradicts the original agreement.",

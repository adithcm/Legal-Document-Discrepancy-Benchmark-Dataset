                "explanation": "The original text implies blanket authorization for any party to file any and all amendments. The modified text introduces ambiguity and contradiction by stating that authorization is discretionary and requires written approval for each amendment, creating uncertainty about the scope and validity of amendment filings.",

The modified text directly contradicts this by mandating original signatures from all parties, making the agreement's validity uncertain if counterparts are used.

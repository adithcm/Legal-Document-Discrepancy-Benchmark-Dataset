The Investment Adviser shall have the option to recover the full amount waived, paid or reimbursed (the Expense  Waiver) by the Investment Adviser on any day on which the Fund's Net Investment Income exceeds zero. In no event, however, shall  the Expense Waiver, or any portion thereof, constitute an obligation of the Fund to the Investment Adviser on any such day unless  the Investment Adviser has expressly exercised its right to recover all or a portion of the Expense Waiver on that day, in which case  such portion of the Expense Waiver elected by the Investment Adviser for recovery that day shall then be due and payable.

The Investment Adviser may, subject to approval by the Trust, recover a portion of the amount waived, paid or reimbursed (the Expense  Waiver) by the Investment Adviser, but only if the Fund's Net Investment Income has exceeded a level determined appropriate by the Trust. The Expense Waiver, or any portion thereof, may not constitute an obligation of the Fund to the Investment Adviser under any circumstances. The Trust has the sole discretion to decide if the Net Investment Income justifies repayment and can defer payment indefinitely.

                "explanation": "The original clause granted the Investment Adviser the 'option' to recover waived expenses. The modified text introduces the requirement for 'approval by the Trust' and adds the condition that recovery is subject to the Fund's Net Investment Income exceeding a level deemed 'appropriate by the Trust'. Furthermore, it states the 'Expense Waiver, or any portion thereof, may not constitute an obligation of the Fund to the Investment Adviser under any circumstances' and that 'Trust has the sole discretion to decide if the Net Investment Income justifies repayment and can defer payment indefinitely', contradicting the original clause that implied a right to recovery under certain conditions.

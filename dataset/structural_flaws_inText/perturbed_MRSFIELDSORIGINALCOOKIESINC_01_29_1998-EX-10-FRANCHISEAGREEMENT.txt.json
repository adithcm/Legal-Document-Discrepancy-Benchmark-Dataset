Franchisee acknowledges that Franchisee  has no rights  outside of the actual store location and that Pretzel Time has the right to sell certain  frozen  products as Pretzel Time desires and Pretzel  Time may conduct  Pretzel  Time's  business as Pretzel  Time so desires without hinderance from Franchisee.",
                "changed_text": "Franchisee has no territory other than the actual store location. Franchisee acknowledges that Franchisee has the exclusive right to market, sell, and distribute Pretzel Time products within a 5-mile radius of the store location. Pretzel Time may conduct  Pretzel  Time's  business as Pretzel  Time so desires without hinderance from Franchisee.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that the franchisee had no rights outside the store location. The changed text gives the franchisee exclusive marketing rights within a 5-mile radius, directly contradicting the original text. This creates confusion as to whether the franchisee has territorial protection or not.",

Pretzel Time holds the discretion to delay the Unit's opening indefinitely based on unforeseen conditions, irrespective of Sections 8 and 9 conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly ties the opening date to meeting specific conditions and Landlord approval. The added statement introduces uncertainty by giving Pretzel Time unlimited discretion to delay the opening, regardless of whether those conditions are met. This directly contradicts the original statement and creates ambiguity.",

The changed text completely removes any obligations the franchisee may have with that section, contradicting the original text.",

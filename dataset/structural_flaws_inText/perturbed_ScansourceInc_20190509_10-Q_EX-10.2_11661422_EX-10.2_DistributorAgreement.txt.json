                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Originally, the addendum's termination was governed by the Distribution Agreement's provisions. Now, it allows termination at any time with 30 days' notice, overriding any potentially stricter or different termination clauses in the main agreement. This creates uncertainty about which termination terms apply.",

The modified text introduces uncertainty by suggesting the address may be different, contradicting the initial statement and requiring distributor to confirm. This could affect delivery of legal notices and contractual obligations, due to ambiguity.",

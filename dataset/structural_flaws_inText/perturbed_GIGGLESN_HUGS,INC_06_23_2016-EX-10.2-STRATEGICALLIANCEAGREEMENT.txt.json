                "original_text": "Consultant will not disclose or permit disclosure of any Confidential Information of the Company to third parties other than as required to perform the Services. Consultant agrees to take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information of the Company in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain or the possession of persons other than those persons authorized under this Agreement to have any such information.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant may disclose Confidential Information of the Company to third parties as reasonably necessary to perform the Services, but shall endeavor to maintain confidentiality to the extent practicable. Consultant agrees to take reasonable measures to protect Confidential Information of the Company, but shall not be liable for inadvertent disclosures.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits disclosure of Confidential Information except as explicitly required for Services. The modified text introduces ambiguity by allowing disclosure if 'reasonably necessary' and limits liability for 'inadvertent disclosures,' contradicting the initial strict confidentiality requirement and creating uncertainty about the Consultant's responsibility to maintain confidentiality.",

(a) In addition, this Agreement will terminate upon the following: (1) Completion of work or period of work provided in this agreement. (2) Termination by Company or Consultant for any material breach, which is not cured within 30 days after written notice of any such material breach from the non-breaching party, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. (3) By the Company, at its option, if at least two Milestones (excluding Milestones 1) are not achieved within 12 months from the Effective Date.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this agreement after 3 years following the effective date. (a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement will terminate upon the following: (1) Completion of work or period of work provided in this agreement. (2) Termination by Company or Consultant for any material breach, which is not cured within 30 days after written notice of any such material breach from the non-breaching party, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. (3) By the Company, at its option, if at least two Milestones (excluding Milestones 1) are not achieved within 12 months from the Effective Date; however, the Consultant retains the right to extend the milestone achievement period by an additional 12 months with written notice to the Company.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a termination clause where the Company can terminate if milestones are not met within 12 months. The modified version adds that Consultant has the right to extend this achievement period. This undermines the company's termination right and creates uncertainty. There is now an in-text contradiction over whether the company can terminate based on milestone achievement within a specific timeframe.",

                "original_text": "The parties acknowledge and agree that their remedy (ies) at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement would be inadequate, and the breach shall be per se deemed as causing irreparable harm to the non-breaching party. In recognition of this fact in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties agree that, in addition to any remedy at law available, including, but not limited to monetary damages, the Parties, without posting any bond, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available to the non-breaching Party.",
                "changed_text": "The parties acknowledge and agree that their remedy (ies) at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement would be adequate and that a breach shall not automatically be deemed to cause irreparable harm to the non-breaching party. In the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties agree that any remedy at law available, including, but not limited to monetary damages, shall be the primary recourse; equitable relief, such as specific performance or injunctive relief, shall only be available upon a showing of actual and substantial irreparable harm, and at the court's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original section asserts that legal remedies are inadequate and any breach is deemed to cause irreparable harm, thus favoring equitable relief. The modified version directly contradicts this, stating that legal remedies are adequate, a breach doesn't automatically cause irreparable harm, and equitable relief is only available under specific circumstances at the court's discretion. This weakens the ability of a party to quickly obtain injunctive relief, creating uncertainty.",

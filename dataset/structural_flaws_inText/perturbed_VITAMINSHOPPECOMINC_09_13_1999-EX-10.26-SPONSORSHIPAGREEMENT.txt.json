                "original_text": "Client will be promoted as the preferred and dominant reseller of Vitamins in the Health Channel on the WebCrawler Site during the term of this Agreement. As such, Excite may not display banner advertising and/or promotional placements for any of Client's Competitors that are, in the aggregate, of equal or greater prominence and exposure than the aggregate of Client's links, advertising banners and promotional placements on the pages of the Health Channel on the WebCrawler Site during the term of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly stated that Client will be promoted as the preferred and dominant reseller of Vitamins in the Health Channel, preventing Excite from promoting its competitors. The modified version removes the 'preferred and dominant' status, giving Excite more power at its discretion of which companies they will promote, making it unclear when the client's promotions will be put into play. This internal contradiction could lead to disputes over the promotion of vitamins.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may issue an initial press release regarding the relationship between Excite and Client, the timing and wording of which will be mutually agreed upon, and nothing herein shall preclude Client from promoting the Client Site.",
                "changed_text": "Neither party will make any public statement, press release or other announcement relating to the terms of or existence of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other, unless required by law or unless the party deems it necessary for its business interests. Either party may issue press releases at any time, without the need for mutual agreement. Client is restricted from overtly promoting the Client Site in any public announcements.",
                "explanation": "The original text prohibits public statements without approval, but allows an initial jointly agreed press release and does not prevent the client from promoting the site. The modified version allows either party to issue press releases, removing the need for mutual agreement. It then limits the client's ability to promote the site, thus, creating an internal contradiction that can create uncertainty in enforcement and obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that 'User Data will be owned by Client'. The modified version directly contradicts this by asserting that 'User Data will be owned by Excite'. This creates a clear conflict regarding ownership of the data, a key term in the agreement. It is now unclear who owns user data and to what extent user data can be used for.",

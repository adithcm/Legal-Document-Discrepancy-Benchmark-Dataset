                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "During the Term, notwithstanding the Services rendered by Nexstar, WYZZ shall retain exclusive authority, power and control over WYZZ-TV's programming, personnel, and finances.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, notwithstanding the Services rendered by Nexstar, Nexstar shall have the option to influence the direction of WYZZ-TV's programming, personnel, and finances.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by initially stating that WYZZ retains 'exclusive authority, power, and control' then modifying that by giving Nexstar influence over the same areas. This makes it uncertain who ultimately has the final decision-making power, leading to potential disputes.",

                "changed_text": "WYZZ may, at its sole discretion, choose to maintain casualty and liability insurance and property insurance on its assets and properties used in the operation of WYZZ-TV. The amounts, terms, and conditions of any insurance coverage are entirely at WYZZ's discretion and may not necessarily be reasonably acceptable to Nexstar.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states WYZZ *shall* maintain insurance that is 'reasonably acceptable to Nexstar'. This change contradicts it by stating the insurance is at WYZZ's *sole discretion* and *may not necessarily be reasonably acceptable to Nexstar*. This ambiguity affects Nexstar's risk mitigation and creates confusion about insurance obligations.",

From time to time, without further consideration, WYZZ and Nexstar shall execute and deliver such other documents and take such other actions as either Party hereto reasonably may request to effectuate such intent.",

WYZZ and Nexstar are not expected to execute and deliver such other documents and take such other actions as either Party hereto reasonably may request to effectuate such intent.",
                "explanation": "This change completely reverses the parties' obligation to cooperate and use reasonable efforts to fulfill the agreement's intent. The original text mandates a cooperative approach, while the modified text explicitly removes this requirement, leading to uncertainty about the level of commitment each party must exhibit.",

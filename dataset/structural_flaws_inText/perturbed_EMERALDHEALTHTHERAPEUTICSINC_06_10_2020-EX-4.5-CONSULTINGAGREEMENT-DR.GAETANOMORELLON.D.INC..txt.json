All Confidential Information will, during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five years thereafter, be held by the Contractor in a fiduciary capacity for Emerald, in the strictest confidence, and will be used by the Contractor solely for the benefit of Emerald, and will not be used by the Contractor, directly or indirectly, for any purpose other than for the benefit of Emerald, nor will the Contractor divulge or communicate, directly or indirectly, such verbally, in writing or otherwise to any party.",

The modified text removes this 'five years thereafter' clause, implying that confidentiality obligations cease immediately upon termination of the agreement. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the duration of confidentiality and uncertainty about what information is protected after the contract ends.",

The Contractor may terminate this Agreement and his or her engagement for any reason at any time upon providing 30 days advance notice in writing to Emerald.

                "explanation": "The original text requires the Contractor to provide 30 days notice, but the changed text allows termination immediately upon written notice. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the notice period required for the Contractor to terminate the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates the deduction of all trade, quantity, or cash discounts from the Laboratory Service Revenue calculation, offering a clear and consistent method for revenue determination. In contrast, the modified version introduces ambiguity by excluding certain discounts, such as those related to managed care agreements, price adjustments, billing errors, rejected goods, or incomplete tests and excluding gift cards. This contradiction creates uncertainty in the financial calculations. The exclusion of particular discounts and incentives offers inconsistent revenue reporting standards.",

                "changed_text": "Failure of Company to comply with the provisions of this Section 2(b) shall entitle Pey Dirt to revoke this license after providing a 30-day written notice and an opportunity to cure, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary.",
                "explanation": "Section 2(b) originally allowed immediate revocation of the license for non-compliance. Modifying this to require a 30-day written notice and cure period contradicts the 'revoke this license immediately' clause, creating uncertainty about the actual revocation procedure.",

                "changed_text": "From and after the termination of the Contract Period all of the rights of Company to the use of Manning Identification shall cease absolutely; however, Company shall have the right to use Manning Identification for a period of 180 days following the termination of this agreement to sell off any remaining inventories. It being understood by Company that Manning Identification may be used at any time by others in connection with the advertisement and promotion of Products the shipment of which is completed after the termination of the Contract Period.",
                "explanation": "Section 13 clearly stated that ALL rights cease after the contract period. By adding a right to use the likeness for 180 days to sell off inventory, there is a contradiction between 'all rights shall cease absolutely' and a specific right being given. This contradiction creates uncertainty around when these rights truly cease, as well as opens to the interpretation of what 'remaining inventories' entail.",

The rights granted Company hereunder shall be used only by it and shall not, without the prior written consent of Pey Dirt, be transferred or assigned to any other.  In the event of the merger or consolidation of Company with any other entity, Pey Dirt shall have the right to terminate the Contract Period by so notifying Company in writing on or before sixty (60) days after Pey Dirt has received notice of such merger or consolidation.",

In the event of the merger or consolidation of Company with any other entity, Pey Dirt shall have the right to terminate the Contract Period by so notifying Company in writing on or before sixty (60) days after Pey Dirt has received notice of such merger or consolidation.",
                "explanation": "The original text (Section 19) states that if Pey Dirt assigns the agreement to Manning, Pey Dirt has no further obligation. The changed text states that Pey Dirt remains ultimately responsible. This is a contradiction and uncertainty because both can not be simultaneously true.",

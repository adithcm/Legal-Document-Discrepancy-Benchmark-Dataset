                "original_text": "Affiliate(s) are the entities listed on Exhibit E to this Agreement that are either business units of Distributor (and therefore wholly-owned and a part of Distributor) or are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Distributor, but in either case, only for so long as ownership remains as defined in this provision.",
                "changed_text": "Affiliate(s) are the entities listed on Exhibit E to this Agreement that may or may not be business units of Distributor or wholly-owned subsidiaries of Distributor. The inclusion of an entity on Exhibit E does not guarantee or imply any specific ownership structure or ongoing relationship with Distributor.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty into the definition of 'Affiliate(s)'. The original definition clearly states ownership requirements. The modified version removes this clarity by stating that entities listed on Exhibit E may or may not meet those requirements, creating ambiguity and potential disputes over which entities qualify as affiliates under the agreement.",

Distributor agrees to use its best efforts to distribute Product solely to Resellers located in the Territory. Those Resellers may resell Product only to End Users who intend to use the Product in the Territory. All Resellers to which Distributor distributes Product must meet Cisco's then-current guidelines for Resellers, as amended from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 By this Agreement, Cisco makes, and Distributor accepts, the appointment of Distributor as a distributor of Products and Services. While Cisco prefers Distributor to focus on Resellers located in the Territory, the Distributor has the freedom to distribute Product and Services to whoever it deems fit. Resellers may resell Product only to End Users. It is up to the Distributor to assess guidelines for Resellers.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the Distributor is appointed as an authorized, non-exclusive distributor of products and services. It also states that the distributor should use its best efforts to distribute products only to resellers located in the Territory. The modified version contradicts these obligations by stating that while it prefers the Distributor to focus on resellers in the Territory, it has the freedom to distribute products and services to whoever it deems fit. It also says that it is up to the distributor to assess the guidelines for the resellers. This weakens Cisco's control over distribution and reseller qualifications and creates uncertainty.",

Within [*****] days following the effective date of termination or expiration, Distributor shall return to Cisco all Product held in inventory as of the effective date of termination. Distributor shall receive credit for any Product so returned in an amount equal to the original purchase price thereof, less any credits or discounts which have been previously paid or applied to Distributor. Such credits shall be first applied to any uncontested amounts due Cisco. Any remaining balance shall be payable to Distributor as soon as commercially practicable. Cisco shall have the option to select the method of return and shall bear all freight costs associated with returns of Product by Distributor under this Section 18.8.",

Within [*****] days following the effective date of termination or expiration, Distributor *may* return to Cisco all Product held in inventory as of the effective date of termination. Distributor *may* receive credit for any Product so returned in an amount equal to the original purchase price thereof, less any credits or discounts which have been previously paid or applied to Distributor. Such credits *may* be first applied to any uncontested amounts due Cisco. Any remaining balance *may* be payable to Distributor.

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that in certain termination scenarios (termination by Cisco for convenience, termination by distributor for Cisco's material breach, or expiration where Cisco doesn't renew), Cisco is obligated to repurchase the Distributor's inventory, making all the actions associated as mandatory. This provides the distributor with a guaranteed recourse for their unsold inventory. By using the word *may* instead of *shall*, the certainty and obligation associated to the scenarios are gone.",

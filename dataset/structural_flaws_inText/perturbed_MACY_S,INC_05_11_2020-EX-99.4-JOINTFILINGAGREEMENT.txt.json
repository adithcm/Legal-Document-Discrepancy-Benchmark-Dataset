                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned may agree to the joint filing with each of the Reporting Persons (as such term is defined in the Schedule 13D referred to below) on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13D (including amendments thereto and statements on Schedule 13G) with respect to the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Macy's, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and that this agreement may be included as an exhibit to such joint filing.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'hereby agree' to 'may agree' introduces uncertainty about the commitment to joint filing. The original text establishes a clear obligation, while the revised text suggests a discretionary option. This could lead to disputes about whether joint filing is actually required.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'shall endeavor to be responsible' weakens the responsibility of each party to ensure timely filing and accuracy. Also, the addendum of 'may, under certain circumstances, bear partial responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others' contradicts the original statement that each party 'shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others'.",

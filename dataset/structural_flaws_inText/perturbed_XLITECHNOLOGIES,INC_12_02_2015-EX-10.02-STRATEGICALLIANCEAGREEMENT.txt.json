                "explanation": "The original text grants the client \"Exclusive Distribution License Rights,\" but also \"un-exclusive Reserved Rights\". The modified version explicitly states that Bosch can grant other parties exclusive rights, directly contradicting the exclusivity granted to the Client. This creates uncertainty regarding the Client's actual exclusive rights and could lead to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original text grants *exclusive rights* to sell to *certain select companies* in the automotive industry, but requires *written approval from Bosch* on a case-by-case basis. The modification changes the provision by removing the 'exclusive' qualification, by removing the selection criteria, and removing the need for explicit Bosch approval. The modified version explicitly removes the prior restriction, thus directly contradicting the original text and potentially causing disputes about which companies Client is allowed to sell the Product to.",

                "explanation": "The original text prevents the Client from taking any action that would impair or compete with the rights granted. The modified text permits the Client to take actions that compete with those rights if it benefits overall sales. This creates a direct contradiction about the Client's restrictions and could lead to disagreements over whether a specific action is permitted or not, based on subjective judgment of sales impact.",

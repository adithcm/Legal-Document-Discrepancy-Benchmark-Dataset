                "original_text": "1.11  \"Complete\" or \"Completion\" or \"Completing\" means a single operation intended to complete a well as a producer of oil and/or gas in one or more Zone(s), including, but not limited to, the setting of pipe/production lining and casing tie-back, installing tubing, wellhead and tree, perforating, plugging back, well stimulation, and testing.",
                "changed_text": "1.11  \"Complete\" or \"Completion\" or \"Completing\" means, at BP's sole discretion, any work performed on a well after drilling has ceased. This may include, but is not limited to, the setting of pipe/production lining and casing tie-back, installing tubing, wellhead and tree, perforating, plugging back, well stimulation, and testing. BP's definition of Completion shall be final and binding.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Complete\" specifies that it's intended to complete a well 'as a producer of oil and/or gas'. The modified definition broadens this significantly, stating that Completion can mean 'any work performed on a well after drilling has ceased', at BP's discretion. This is contradictory as BP can define Complete to mean an action that doesn't result in production of gas/oil, as per the original agreement. This creates uncertainty about the actual obligations for Completion costs and earning rights.",

                "original_text": "5.3   The Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Well shall be under the exclusive control of BP and the operation thereof shall be conducted in a prudent and workmanlike manner. BP shall conduct all its activities under this Agreement as a reasonable prudent operator, in a good and workmanlike manner, with due diligence and dispatch, in accordance with good oilfield practice, and in compliance with applicable law and regulation, but in no event shall BP have any liability to Company for losses sustained or liabilities or obligations incurred except such as may result from BP's gross negligence or willful misconduct.",
                "changed_text": "5.3   The Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Well shall be under the exclusive control of BP and the operation thereof shall be conducted in a manner solely determined by BP. BP shall conduct all activities, and its actions are not subjected to any specific standards or legal requirements.",
                "explanation": "The original text dictates that BP operates the well in a 'prudent and workmanlike manner', in accordance with 'good oilfield practice' and 'applicable law'. The modified version eliminates these constraints, stating that BP can operate in a manner 'solely determined by BP' and is not subject to specific standards. This contradicts the initial expectation of prudent operation and creates uncertainty because it reduces BP's operational responsibility.",

If BP consents to an assignment by Company of all or part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, it is nevertheless understood and agreed that any such consent shall not relieve Company of its primary liability for the performance of and compliance with the terms and provisions hereof, and shall not have the effect nor be construed to have the effect of waiving this limitation as to future, further, or additional assignments. Any assignment of the rights and obligations under this Agreement by Company without the consent of BP shall be voidable by BP.",
                "changed_text": "7.1   The rights and obligations created by this Agreement may not be assigned by Company, in whole or in part. Any attempt to assign will void the contract. BP is permitted to transfer rights as it sees fit.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that Company needed BP's permission for assignment, but that consent would not be unreasonably withheld. The new change completely blocks Company's ability to assign rights. However, BP is still permitted to transfer rights, a contradiction that creates uncertainty. ",

                "explanation": "The original text states that Datec 'will' provide services for user logon and password administration. The modified text introduces uncertainty by saying Datec 'will only provide', 'may reset', and 'may not include' these services. This contradiction creates confusion about Datec's obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows both BSP and Datec to terminate the agreement for convenience with 6 months' notice. The modified text makes it significantly harder for Datec to terminate by requiring BSP's consent and doubling the notice period, which contradicts the original reciprocal right.",

Whether or not rebates apply to Severity Levels One (1) and Two (2) during the agreed business hours is subject to a separate agreement between BSP and Datec on a monthly basis.\n\n3.  The maximum potential rebate in any given month is 50% of the monthly base fee; however, the actual rebate amount, if any, is determined by BSP's subjective assessment of Datec's performance.\n\n4.  For the purposes of determining potential SLA achievement, the \"Time to Respond\" measurement may be considered but is not the only factor.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that rebates 'will' be applied if service levels are not met. The modified text removes this certainty by stating that rebates are 'at the sole discretion of BSP', 'subject to a separate agreement', and dependent on BSP's 'subjective assessment'. This creates a contradiction as the original implies an objective, contractual obligation to provide rebates, while the modified version makes it discretionary.",

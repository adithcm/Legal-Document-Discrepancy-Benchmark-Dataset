                "explanation": "This modification broadens the definition of 'ENDORSEMENT' to include derivative works and removes the need for prior approval. This contradicts Section 4 under SERVICES, which gives Nantz Communications the right to review and reject any advertising or promotional materials including Nantz or his image, thus creating uncertainty about the level of control Nantz Communications has over the use of his endorsement.",

                "original_text": "The Company shall furnish Nantz, at no cost, with sufficient Ashworth Products to be used by him in connection with the Services and for the personal use of Nantz and his immediate family.  The cost of said Product shall not exceed $12,000 (at wholesale) during any single Contract Year.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall furnish Nantz with Ashworth Products to be used by him in connection with the Services. The availability and cost of said products will be determined by the Company's current inventory and pricing strategies, and may be subject to change.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'at no cost' and sets a limit of '$12,000 (at wholesale)' on the Ashworth Products provided to Nantz. The changed text removes the 'at no cost' provision and the $12,000 limit, making the availability and cost of products subject to the Company's discretion. This introduces uncertainty and potentially contradicts the agreed-upon compensation structure by implying that Nantz might have to pay for products or receive less than anticipated, conflicting with the 'full compensation for Services' clause preceding it.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states that Nantz will be a 'full time Ashworth employee'. The modified version introduces uncertainty by suggesting that his employment status could change to an 'independent contractor' based on the company's needs. This directly contradicts the original statement and could create ambiguity regarding his benefits, responsibilities, and the overall nature of his relationship with Ashworth, in particular, this could affect his entitlement to stock options, causing disputes.",

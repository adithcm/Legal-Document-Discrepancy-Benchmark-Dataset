                "original_text": "4.2. All profits and losses earned or incurred by the Operating Company shall be shared by the Parties in equal shares as long as each Party has a 50% interest in the Operating Company. Upon a reduction or increase in such interest, all profits and losses shall be shared in accordance with each Party's ownership interest in the Joint Venture. To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law and accounting provisions, (a) the Operating Company shall make distributions, dividends and returns of capital equally to each of the Parties and (b) Operating Company items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated equally to each of the Parties; provided, if for any reason, such distributions, dividends, returns of capital or allocations may not be made on an equal basis, the Operating Company shall make a special distribution, dividend, return of capital or allocation to one Party to balance the required distribution, dividend, return of capital or allocation to the other Party.",
                "changed_text": "4.2. All profits and losses earned or incurred by the Operating Company shall be shared by the Parties in a manner to be determined at the discretion of the Board. Upon a reduction or increase in such interest, the distribution of profits and losses will be subject to renegotiation. To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law and accounting provisions, (a) the Operating Company may make distributions, dividends and returns of capital as deemed appropriate by the Board and (b) Operating Company items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated as the Board sees fit; provided, if for any reason, such distributions, dividends, returns of capital or allocations are deemed unfavorable by a Party, they have the right to appeal to an arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision, however, is not binding.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that profits and losses are shared equally, while the modified version introduces uncertainty by stating the Board has discretion in determining profit and loss sharing. This directly contradicts the original equal share provision, potentially leading to disputes over financial entitlements. It also makes the initial statement regarding 50% ownership interests somewhat irrelevant, as the Board's discretion can override the expected distribution based on ownership. Furthermore, the non-binding arbitration makes the resolution process even less definitive.",

In the event that either Party conveys its interest in the Operating Company to the other or a third party during the five year period commencing on the Effective Date and the Joint Venture continues to operate as a going concern thereafter, each Party shall provide the services described in Article 11.1 to the Joint Venture at a price (that shall reasonably be consistent with the methodology used for determining prices prior to such conveyance) to be agreed upon by the Parties for a transition period to allow the owner or owners of the Operating Company to obtain such services for the Joint Venture independently. Such transition period shall not exceed 24 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.1 and Article 11.1.2 and shall not exceed 36 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.4; provided, however, if T&L shall give notice to Igene that it intends to close the Selby, England facility adjacent to the Site, T&L shall be required to provide the services set forth in Article 11.1.4 for a period not to exceed 24 months from the date Igene receives such notice.",

In the event that either Party conveys its interest in the Operating Company to the other or a third party during the five year period commencing on the Effective Date and the Joint Venture continues to operate as a going concern thereafter, the provision of services described in Article 11.1 will be at the sole discretion of the providing party. There is no guarantee that such services will continue. If services are to be provided, the price will be determined by the market rate at the time of service. The transition period, if any, will be determined based on the then current business environment.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates the provision of support services for a defined transition period, while the modified version makes the provision of these services entirely discretionary. This directly contradicts the original obligation and introduces significant uncertainty for the remaining party/Joint Venture regarding continued operational support. Removing guaranteed time periods makes business continuity planning much more difficult and subject to the whim of the providing party.",

                "explanation": "The original text guarantees that the Manufacturing Facility will be capable of producing 14,000 kg per year of pure Astaxanthin. The modified version states that T&L does not guarantee the manufacturing facility's output and business viability, this language directly contradicts the original guarantee, creating uncertainty about whether the facility will actually meet its stated production capacity. The lack of guarantee on yield and business viability makes the entire venture questionable from Igene's perspective.",

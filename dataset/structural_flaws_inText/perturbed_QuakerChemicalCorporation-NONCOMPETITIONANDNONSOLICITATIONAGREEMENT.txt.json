Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",

Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to significantly influence or provide strategic guidance on the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The original text restricts Sellers from engaging in any competing business for two years, with some exceptions. The modified text introduces contradictions by stating that Sellers can engage in any business as long as they don't directly use confidential information, effectively weakening the non-compete clause. Furthermore, the removal of the net sales restriction on acquired businesses allows Sellers to acquire and control larger, competing businesses, contradicting the original intent. Finally, changing \"direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person\" to \"significantly influence or provide strategic guidance on the management and policies of a Person\" weakens the definition of 'control', blurring the line between permissible influence and prohibited control, which generates uncertainty.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former",
                "changed_text": "Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the \"Non-Solicit Period\"), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) regardless of the reason for termination prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is specifically targeted at employees or former",
                "explanation": "The original text prevents the Sellers from soliciting employees for three years. It allows for the solicitation of former employees whose employment terminated by the Buyer or company at least six months prior to solicitation, but not current employees via targeted solicitation. The change removes the 'at least six months' restriction, creating a loophole. This directly contradicts the initial non-solicitation agreement by allowing solicitation of recently terminated employees. The second modification removes the word \"not\" in the sentence \"that is not specifically targeted at employees or former,\" allowing the Sellers to solicit employees through a public medium in a way that *is* specifically targeted to the Buyer, thus nullifying the non-solicitation clause by making it unenforceable.",

However, no party is required to take any action or execute any instrument that may, in their sole determination, negatively impact their ongoing business operations or financial interests.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates cooperation between parties to fulfill the agreement's objectives. The revised clause introduces a contradiction by making cooperation discretionary ('may, at their sole discretion') and allowing parties to refuse actions that they deem detrimental to their interests. This undermines the enforceability of the original cooperation clause, as parties can now easily justify non-compliance based on subjective assessments of negative impact. Thus a requirement has been made optional. This makes the initial agreement questionable, thus creating a contradiction.",

Subject to Section 1.2, Franchisor hereby grants to Franchisee the exclusive right, (a) to establish and operate Smaaash Centres in the Territory, (b) to sub-license the right to establish and operate Smaaash Centres to third party franchisees in and for the Territory, (c) a license to use the products and other services developed by Franchisor with respect to the Smaaash Centres (including a right to authorise the use of products and services developed by the Franchisor by third party franchisees), in the Territory, and (d) to identify third party franchisees for the Smaaash Centres in the Territory. The rights granted herein include the limited license to use the Trademarks of the Franchisor (the details of which are morefully set out in Exhibit A), as set out in Section 3 of this Agreement, for the purposes of establishing and operating the Smaaash Centres in the Territory. It is clarified that if third party franchisees shall be establishing and operating Smaaash Centres in the manner contemplated under this Agreement, then the Franchisee shall ensure that such third party franchisees complies with all the obligations and duties of the Franchisee, as recorded under this Agreement, and to this extent, Franchisee may enter into relevant agreements with such third party franchisees.",

Subject to Section 1.2, Franchisor hereby grants to Franchisee a non-exclusive right, (a) to establish and operate Smaaash Centres in the Territory, (b) to sub-license the right to establish and operate Smaaash Centres to third party franchisees in and for the Territory, (c) a license to use the products and other services developed by Franchisor with respect to the Smaaash Centres (including a right to authorise the use of products and services developed by the Franchisor by third party franchisees), in the Territory, and (d) to identify third party franchisees for the Smaaash Centres in the Territory.

                "explanation": "The original text grants the Franchisee an 'exclusive right' to establish and operate Smaaash Centres. By changing 'exclusive right' to 'non-exclusive right', this clause directly contradicts Section 3.2 which defines the license as exclusive, creating uncertainty as to whether the Franchisee truly has exclusive rights. This could lead to disputes regarding the Franchisor granting rights to other parties.",

Except as provided in the next sentence, the license granted herein shall be exclusive. \"Exclusivity\" shall mean that Franchisor shall not grant any further licenses to third parties in the Trademarks for use in connection with Smaaash Centres in the Territory, and the Franchisee shall not enter into any arrangement or agreement with any third parties for establishing or operating any gaming and entertainment centres identical or similar to Smaaash Centres, in the Territory except as otherwise provided in this Agreement; provided, however, that Franchisor may continue to use the Trademarks in the Territory in connection with the operation of Franchisor's entertainment centers already set up as of the Effective Date in the Territory. The restriction contained in this Agreement shall apply on the parties throughout the Term.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the license granted is exclusive. By changing the beginning statement of the clause to 'shall not be exclusive,' it directly contradicts the definition of 'Exclusivity' which follows in the same section. This creates a direct in-text contradiction, making it unclear whether the franchisee has exclusive rights. This uncertainty could lead to disputes over market control and competition within the Territory.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the Franchisor can assign rights without the Franchisee's consent, but the Franchisee needs the Franchisor's consent. By changing 'shall not be entitled' to 'shall be entitled', it contradicts the need for the Franchisor's consent. The sentence now reads that the Franchisee can assign their rights, contradicting the rest of the sentence that says they need the Franchisor's consent. This could cause legal issues.",

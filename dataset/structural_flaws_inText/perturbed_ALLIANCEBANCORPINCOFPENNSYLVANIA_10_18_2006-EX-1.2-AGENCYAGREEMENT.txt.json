On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company hereby appoints Sandler O'Neill as its Agent to consult with and advise the Company, and to assist the Company with the solicitation of subscriptions and purchase orders for Securities, in connection with the Company's sale of Common Stock in the Offerings. On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, Sandler O'Neill accepts such appointment and agrees to use its best efforts to assist the Company with the solicitation of subscriptions and purchase orders for Securities in accordance with this Agreement; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be obligated to take any action which is inconsistent with any applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.",

On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company may consider appointing Sandler O'Neill as its Agent to consult with and advise the Company, and to assist the Company with the solicitation of subscriptions and purchase orders for Securities, in connection with the Company's sale of Common Stock in the Offerings.

                "explanation": "By changing 'hereby appoints' to 'may consider appointing' and 'accepts such appointment and agrees' to 'may accept such appointment and may agree', the text now implies that the appointment of Sandler O'Neill is not guaranteed or obligatory. This contradicts the original text's firm appointment and acceptance, introducing uncertainty.",

Sandler O'Neill will endeavor to limit the aggregate fees to be paid by the Company, the MHCs and the Bank to an amount competitive with gross underwriting discounts charged at such time for underwritings of comparable amounts of stock sold at a comparable price per share in a similar market environment; provided, however, that the aggregate fees payable to Sandler O'Neill and Selected Dealers shall not exceed 6.0% of the aggregate dollar amount of the Securities sold in the Syndicated Community Offering by such Selected Dealers. Sandler O'Neill will endeavor to distribute the Securities among the Selected Dealers in a fashion which best meets the distribution objective of the Company and the Bank, which may result in limiting the allocation of stock to certain Selected Dealers. It is understood that in no event shall Sandler O'Neill be obligated to act as a Selected Dealer or to take or purchase any Securities.",

                "explanation": "The original text outlines specific actions Sandler O'Neill will take regarding syndicate formation, fee limitations, and distribution objectives. By replacing the original text with the modified text using 'may consider', 'might not limit', 'may exceed', and 'may not endeavor', the modified text suggests that Sandler O'Neill's actions are discretionary and not guaranteed. Furthermore, stating that 'Sandler O'Neill will be obligated to act as a Selected Dealer and to take or purchase any Securities' completely contradicts the original text.",

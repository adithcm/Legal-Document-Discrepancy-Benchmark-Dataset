                "original_text": "4.2 All rights to inventions, patentable or non-patentable, made solely by employees of iBio during the term of this Agreement shall belong solely to iBio. All rights to inventions, patentable or non-patentable, made solely by employees of CC-Pharming during the term of this Agreement shall belong solely to CC-Pharming.",

All rights to inventions, patentable or non-patentable, made solely by employees of CC-Pharming during the term of this Agreement shall belong solely to iBio.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction regarding intellectual property ownership. The original text clearly states that iBio owns inventions made by its employees, and CC-Pharming owns inventions made by its employees. The modified text swaps the ownership, making it unclear which party owns the inventions made by which party's employees, causing uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "Here, we are introducing a contradiction in the duty of care required for Confidential Information. Initially, the receiving party was expected to handle the Confidential Information with the same care as it would its own highly sensitive information. With the change, the receiving party is only required to apply 'best efforts'. The uncertainty introduced pertains to the scope and adequacy of measures to be taken to protect Confidential Information, with conflicting terms and potentially weaker protections than initially agreed upon.",

                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits assignment without prior written consent, rendering any unauthorized assignment void. The modified text allows assignment simply with notification, contradicting the requirement for consent. Furthermore, it states that unauthorized assignments are valid, directly contradicting the original text and creating significant uncertainty regarding the transferability of rights and obligations under the agreement.",

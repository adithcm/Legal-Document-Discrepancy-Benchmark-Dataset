                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "PAYMENT TERMS All Parties agreed the payment listed below are fair and just for the services being provided. Payment to the following individual below within 7 days upon completion and handover on the Project to VAL.",
                "changed_text": "PAYMENT TERMS All Parties agreed the payment listed below are fair and just for the services being provided. Payment to the following individual below will be made within 30 days upon completion and handover on the Project to VAL. However, the exact timing of payment is subject to VAL's internal accounting policies.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the payment timeline. Initially, the contract specifies 'within 7 days'. By changing it to 'within 30 days' and adding 'subject to VAL's internal accounting policies', it creates uncertainty. It is now unclear if the payment will be made in 7 or 30 days, or even later depending on accounting policies, leading to potential disputes.",

All rights and title to Duesey Coffee Intellectual Property created pursuant to the Project shall belong to VAL and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP All Intellectual Property during the project is initially owned by the Developer. Upon full payment and successful completion of the project, ownership of the core Intellectual Property will be transferred to VAL, subject to the Developer retaining a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use the developed code for other projects. All other rights and title to Duesey Coffee Intellectual Property created pursuant to the Project shall belong to VAL and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction in the ownership of the intellectual property. Originally, the contract clearly states that all intellectual property during the project is owned by VAL. The modification states that the Developer initially owns the IP, which is only transferred to VAL after payment and completion, but even then the developer has non-exclusive license. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes over who owns the IP and can use it during and after the project.",

If the customer terminates the agreement, then VAL shall compensate the Developer up to the date of termination with a fee calculated on Pro-rata basis.",
                "changed_text": "TERMINATION VAL shall, in the event of Developer committing any breach of any of the terms and conditions of this agreement or for any other reason, be entitled to terminate this agreement at any time, without notice. If VAL terminates the agreement, VAL is not obligated to provide any compensation to the Developer.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows VAL to terminate with two weeks' notice and requires pro-rata compensation. The altered text allows for termination at any time without notice or compensation, directly contradicting the original terms and creating uncertainty for the developer.",

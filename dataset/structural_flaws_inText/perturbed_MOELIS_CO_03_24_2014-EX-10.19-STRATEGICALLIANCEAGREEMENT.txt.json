A \"Client\" is (i) with respect to SMBC/Nikko, a Japanese Company or any other person or entity within Covered Regions that SMBC/Nikko Introduces to Moelis Holdings pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) with respect to Moelis Holdings, a Japanese Company or any other person or entity within Covered Regions that Moelis Holdings Introduces to SMBC/Nikko pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "3.5 Client. A \"Client\" is (i) with respect to SMBC/Nikko, exclusively a Japanese Company that SMBC/Nikko Introduces to Moelis Holdings pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) with respect to Moelis Holdings, any person or entity within Covered Regions that Moelis Holdings Introduces to SMBC/Nikko pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a \"Client\" broadly for both parties as either a Japanese Company or any other entity within Covered Regions. The modified version restricts the definition of \"Client\" for SMBC/Nikko to exclusively Japanese Companies while maintaining the broader definition for Moelis Holdings. This creates an in-text contradiction and potential uncertainty, as it is unclear whether non-Japanese entities introduced by SMBC/Nikko are considered Clients under the agreement, especially concerning fee allocation and non-solicitation clauses.",

This Agreement shall be effective as of January 1, 2012 (the \"Effective Date\"), provided, however, that, ARTICLE XII and ARTICLE XIII shall not be effective until after the Closing. The initial term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for three (3) years, subject to the prior termination rights provided below. At the end of such initial term, and any renewed term, as applicable, this Agreement shall automatically renew for an additional one (1) year term, unless a party provides written notice to the other parties at least six (6) months prior to the end of the initial term. At any time during a renewed term, this Agreement may be terminated by any party on six (6) months prior notice that it wishes to terminate the Agreement.",

This Agreement shall be effective as of January 1, 2012 (the \"Effective Date\"), provided, however, that, ARTICLE XII and ARTICLE XIII shall not be effective until after the Closing. The initial term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for three (3) years, subject to the prior termination rights provided below. At the end of such initial term, this Agreement will not be renewed, unless all parties agree to renew it in writing. At any time during a renewed term, this Agreement may be terminated by any party on six (6) months prior notice that it wishes to terminate the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for automatic renewal of the agreement unless a party provides a written notice of termination at least six months prior to the end of the initial term. The modified version eliminates the automatic renewal, requiring an explicit written agreement from *all* parties for renewal. This creates a contradiction regarding the renewal process, as one version defaults to renewal unless actively stopped, while the other defaults to termination unless actively renewed. This uncertainty affects the enforceability of the agreement beyond the initial term.",

Even in the case of a subsidiary or controlled affiliate of such party which succeeds such party's conduct of Covered Businesses, no exceptions for assignment will be made.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement may not be assigned without written consent, but provides an exception for assignment to a subsidiary or controlled affiliate that succeeds the party's conduct of Covered Businesses. The modified version explicitly states that the agreement may not be assigned under *any* circumstances, including to a subsidiary or controlled affiliate, thus directly contradicting the exception outlined in the original clause. This contradiction could lead to legal disputes if a party attempts to assign the agreement to a subsidiary and the other parties disagree.",

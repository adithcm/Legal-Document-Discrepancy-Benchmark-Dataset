Upgrades shall include new programs which replace, or contain functionality similar to, the Software already licensed to Bank of America hereunder.",

Upgrades may include new programs which replace, or contain functionality similar to, the Software already licensed to Bank of America hereunder. Bank of America is not guaranteed access to any upgrades.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines upgrades as something 'Supplier makes generally available to its customers.' The modified version introduces 'Supplier *may* choose to make available,' and adding 'Bank of America is not guaranteed access to any upgrades' contradicts the original implication and creates uncertainty. This could lead to disputes over access to improved versions of the software.",

Termination of one Order shall not cause a termination of this Agreement or any other Order, unless otherwise specified by Bank of America.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Bank of America may terminate this Agreement, an Order and/or any Customization Schedule(s) for its convenience, without cause, at any time but may incur charges as a result of such termination, provided that at least forty-five (45) calendar days prior written notice is given to Supplier. Termination of one Order may cause a termination of this Agreement or any other Order, as determined at the supplier’s discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the Bank of America may terminate the agreement 'without further charge or expense'. The modified version contradicts this by stating that termination 'may incur charges'. Also, it changes termination conditions stating that termination of order ‘may cause a termination of this agreement’ giving the supplier discretion over the termination of all other orders creating a situation of uncertainty and contradicting previous terms.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the supplier *shall* provide maintenance services. By changing this to ‘may at times elect to provide’ and adding ‘The provision of maintenance services is not guaranteed’ directly contradicts the obligation previously set. This creates uncertainty regarding the supplier’s responsibility for upkeep and error correction of the software. This could lead to disputes over the level of support Bank of America can expect to receive.",

                "original_text": "1.10 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means, with respect to a Party's specific obligations under this Agreement, that level of efforts and resources, [***]. Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires that the applicable Party: (i) [***], (ii) [***], and (iii) [***].",
                "changed_text": "1.10 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means, with respect to a Party's specific obligations under this Agreement, the bare minimum effort required to avoid legal action. Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires that the applicable Party: (i) expend minimal resources, (ii) prioritize other business ventures, and (iii) only act when directly compelled to do so by a regulatory body.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" implies a significant level of dedication. The modified version drastically weakens this definition, suggesting only the least possible action is required. This could lead to disputes over whether a party has adequately fulfilled their obligations, as one section of the contract implies a higher standard than the other.",

Subject to Section 4.2(d), Zogenix shall be the marketing authorization holder for the Product in the Territory, and Zogenix shall be deemed the MAH Party and Distributor deemed the Non-MAH Party for purposes of this Agreement. Zogenix shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to [***]. In addition, Zogenix shall use Commercially Reasonable Effort to ensure [***] shall have the capabilities and obtain the necessary licenses for filing an MAA for the Product in the Territory in advance of the planned MAA submission date in the initial version of Regulatory Plan.",
                "changed_text": "4.2(c) Conduct of Regulatory Activities. Subject to Section 4.2(d), either Zogenix or Distributor can be the marketing authorization holder for the Product in the Territory, as decided by the Joint Steering Committee. Whether Zogenix or Distributor is the MAH Party or Non-MAH Party shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. There is no obligation for either party to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts. It is purely up to the discretion of both Zogenix and Distributor regarding their involvement in filing an MAA.",
                "explanation": "The original text assigns Zogenix as the marketing authorization holder, establishing a clear responsibility. The modified text creates ambiguity by stating it is up to the JSC to decide. The original version states Zogenix will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts while the modified version states there is no obligation and it's up to both parties. This contradicts the allocation of responsibilities, potentially causing disputes over which party is accountable for regulatory filings and introduces uncertainty.",

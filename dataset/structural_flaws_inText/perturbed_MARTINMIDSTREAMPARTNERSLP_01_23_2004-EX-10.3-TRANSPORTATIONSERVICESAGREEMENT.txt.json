                "original_text": "This Agreement will automatically renew for successive one year terms (each a \"Renewal Term\", and together with the Initial Term, the \"Term\"), unless either Charterer or Owner elects not to renew this Agreement by providing the other party with written notice of such election 30 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable, at which point this Agreement will automatically terminate.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement will automatically renew for successive one year terms (each a \"Renewal Term\", and together with the Initial Term, the \"Term\"). Renewal will be determined by the Owner 30 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term. The Owner has the right to decide at which point this Agreement will automatically terminate.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement automatically renews unless *either* party provides notice of non-renewal. The modification states that renewal is determined by the Owner, thus contradicting the previous statement that both parties could decide about the renewal and taking away the charter's rights to terminate.",

                "changed_text": "Charterer agrees to pay to Owner a fee of $______ per gallon of product transported. Owner will invoice such fees to Charterer on a monthly basis and Charterer will pay such invoiced amounts within 60 days of invoice date, pending Owner approval.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a payment deadline of 30 days after the invoice date. The changed text extends this deadline to 60 days, but introduces a condition: payments are 'pending Owner approval'. This contradicts the initial agreement of a fixed 30-day payment period, making it unclear when payment is truly due. It gives the owner the ability to hold payments back for potentially longer periods which is never stated in the original text, causing conflict.",

                "explanation": "The original text says neither party can assign the agreement without written concent of the other party. The changed text removes the need for consent by allowing assignment with only notification, and adds in the caveat the other party can contest the change in writing, but if the contest is unacknowledged by the assignee then the new party can still take on the agreement with little that the original party can do.",

                "original_text": "S2K agrees, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, through its Authorized S2K Representatives, to use its reasonable best efforts to market the Funds to the Intermediaries, and to identify, refer and/or introduce Intermediaries to the Funds. In connection therewith, S2K may (i) engage in seminars, conferences and media interviews for financial intermediaries; (ii) distribute sales literature and other communications (including electronic media) regarding the Funds, subject to review and approval of such material by the Distributor; and (iii) perform other services reasonably contemplated in writing by S2K and the Distributor. S2K shall not act as an underwriter in connection with S2K's wholesale activities relating to shares of the Funds where S2K receives all or substantially all of the sales load, as set forth in each Fund's then-current prospectus (\"Prospectus\").",
                "changed_text": "S2K agrees, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, through its Authorized S2K Representatives, to use its reasonable best efforts to market the Funds to the Intermediaries, and to identify, refer and/or introduce Intermediaries to the Funds. S2K's specific marketing strategies and methods are at the sole discretion of S2K, regardless of whether they align with Distributor's preferences. In connection therewith, S2K may (i) engage in seminars, conferences and media interviews for financial intermediaries; (ii) distribute sales literature and other communications (including electronic media) regarding the Funds, without needing review or approval of such material by the Distributor; and (iii) perform other services reasonably contemplated in writing by S2K and the Distributor. S2K shall not act as an underwriter in connection with S2K's wholesale activities relating to shares of the Funds where S2K receives all or substantially all of the sales load, as set forth in each Fund's then-current prospectus (\"Prospectus\").",
                "explanation": "The original text states that S2K will market the funds using reasonable best efforts and specifies that sales literature is 'subject to review and approval of such material by the Distributor.' The modified text contradicts this by stating that S2K's marketing strategies are at S2K's sole discretion and sales literature may be distributed 'without needing review or approval by the Distributor.' This creates uncertainty regarding the level of control the Distributor has over marketing materials and strategies employed by S2K.",

                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall end on the 60th day following a written notice from one party to the other of its decision to terminate this Agreement at the end of such 60-day period or upon termination of the applicable Distribution Agreement with respect to a Fund. Termination of this Agreement as to a Fund shall not terminate this Agreement with respect to any other Fund so long as such other Fund's (or Funds', as the case may be) Distribution Agreement is effective. If this Agreement is terminated by one party, it shall terminate the entire Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue indefinitely unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by both parties. Either party may initiate termination discussions at any time. In the event of irreconcilable differences, either party retains the right to terminate this agreement immediately by providing a written notice. If this Agreement is terminated by one party, it shall terminate the entire Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a specific termination clause, stating that the agreement ends 60 days after written notice or upon termination of the Distribution Agreement. The modified text states that agreement continues indefinitely unless both parties agree otherwise. The addition of being able to terminate agreement immediately contradicts with the initial statement that the agreement continues indefinitely. This contradiction introduces ambiguity regarding the termination process.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor will cover all expenses related to marketing, including FINRA advertising/filing fees (including additional fees for expedited reviews as set forth in Section 2(b) herein). The Distributor may at its discretion seek reimbursement from S2K. Any reimbursement requested will be decided on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that S2K must reimburse the Distributor for FINRA advertising/filing fees. The modified clause introduces contradiction by saying the Distributor will cover all these expenses, but then adds that they 'may at its discretion seek reimbursement from S2K.' This makes the financial responsibility unclear, as it suggests S2K might not always have to reimburse, contradicting the initial clear obligation. This adds uncertainty about cost allocation for marketing and filing fees.",

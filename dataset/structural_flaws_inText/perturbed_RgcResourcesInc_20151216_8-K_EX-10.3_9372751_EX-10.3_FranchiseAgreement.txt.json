The Franchise is granted pursuant to Grantor's Franchise Ordinance (Ordinance No. 967), adopted November 17, 2015, (\"Ordinance\"), which is incorporated by reference herein, including any applicable definitions.",

The Grantee may or may not accept the stated Franchise based on their discretion. The Franchise is granted pursuant to Grantor's Franchise Ordinance (Ordinance No. 967), adopted November 17, 2015, (\"Ordinance\"), which is not binding.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Grantor grants and the Grantee accepts the franchise. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating the Grantee may or may not accept, contradicting the initial grant, and the 'Ordinance' is not binding, which means the term is not certain. This creates doubt as to whether a valid agreement exists.",

The modified text introduces uncertainty regarding both the obligation to pay (using 'may pay') and the calculation method (using 'may be calculated'). It also questions the specific annual fee amount by suggesting it 'may be something else,' directly contradicting the fixed value of $98,196.

The modified text introduces uncertainty, using 'may or may not' contradicting the original statement. Additionally, it says the 'office shall be opened when the Grantee want it to be opened' is a contradiction to the 40 hours stated in the original.",

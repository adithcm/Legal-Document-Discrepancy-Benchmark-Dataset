This Agreement is for a term (the \"Term\") of 12 months from the Effective Date on June 1s t 2020 and expiring May 31st 2021.\n\n(a) In the case that the company would not like to extend the terms of agreement for an additional month. The company must notify the consultant within 5 days of the conclusion of the 12 month term. Without notification the contract will automatically extend for an additional month of service.",

This Agreement is for a term (the \"Term\") of 12 months from the Effective Date on June 1s t 2020 and expiring May 31st 2021.\n\n(a) In the case that the company would like to extend the terms of agreement for an additional month, both parties must agree in writing, within 5 days of the conclusion of the 12 month term. Without explicit written agreement from both parties, the contract will not extend for an additional month of service, and will expire automatically.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that without notification from the company within 5 days, the contract automatically extends for an additional month. The modified text changes this to require explicit written agreement from *both* parties for the extension to occur. This creates a contradiction, as one implies automatic extension unless actively prevented, while the other requires active consent from both sides for any extension to occur.",

                "explanation": "The original text says the shares 'shall' be issued upon execution, making it seemingly obligatory. The modified text changes 'shall' to 'may' and adds that issuance is also subject to the company's financial discretion. This introduces ambiguity and contradiction. The original implies the issuance is almost guaranteed once approved by the Board, while the modified version adds a layer of uncertainty based on the company's fluctuating financial situation.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that all confidential information 'shall' be regarded and treated as strictly confidential, with no exceptions. The modified text adds exceptions: legal/regulatory reasons and Consultant's personal/professional benefit. This directly contradicts the original, absolute confidentiality clause. The added exceptions give the Consultant leeway to disclose information, undermining the strict confidentiality originally agreed upon.",

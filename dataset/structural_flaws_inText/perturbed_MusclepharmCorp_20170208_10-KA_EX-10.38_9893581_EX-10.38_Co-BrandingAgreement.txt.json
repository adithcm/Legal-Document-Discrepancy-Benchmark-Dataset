Compensation:   (a) Cash:   (i) During the Term of this Agreement and during any sell-off period, MusclePharm shall pay Lender a royalty (the \"Royalty\") of 10% on Net Sales (as defined below) of Licensed Products sold through its wholesale Distribution Channels or retail Distribution Channels, as the case may be and 10% on Net Sales of the Training Video and any Products sold in connection with any Training Video as contemplated pursuant to the last sentence of Section 4(a)(i) above. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Net Sales\" shall mean MusclePharm's gross sales (the gross invoice amount billed customers) of the Licensed Products, less discounts and allowances actually shown on the invoice (except cash discounts, transportation costs and commissions not deductible in the calculation of Royalty) and less any bona fide returns (net of all returns actually made or allowed as supported by credit memoranda actually issued to the customers not to exceed 5% in any reporting cycle), the aggregate of which discounts and allowances shall not exceed 5% in any reporting cycle. No other costs incurred in the manufacturing, selling, advertising, and distribution of the Licensed Products shall be deducted nor shall any deduction be allowed for any uncollectible accounts, allowances or bad debt.",
                "changed_text": "7. Compensation:   (a) Cash:   (i) During the Term of this Agreement and during any sell-off period, MusclePharm may, at its sole discretion, pay Lender a royalty (the \"Royalty\") of up to 10% on Net Sales (as defined below) of Licensed Products sold through its wholesale Distribution Channels or retail Distribution Channels, as the case may be and up to 10% on Net Sales of the Training Video and any Products sold in connection with any Training Video as contemplated pursuant to the last sentence of Section 4(a)(i) above. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Net Sales\" shall mean MusclePharm's gross sales (the gross invoice amount billed customers) of the Licensed Products, less discounts and allowances at MusclePharm's discretion shown on the invoice (including cash discounts, transportation costs and commissions deductible in the calculation of Royalty) and less returns, determined at MusclePharm's sole discretion. No other costs incurred in the manufacturing, selling, advertising, and distribution of the Licensed Products shall be deducted nor shall any deduction be allowed for any uncollectible accounts, allowances or bad debt, unless MusclePharm deems it necessary.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that MusclePharm 'shall pay' a royalty of 10% on net sales. The revised text introduces ambiguity by stating that MusclePharm 'may, at its sole discretion, pay Lender a royalty of up to 10%', which contradicts the original mandatory payment and introduces uncertainty over whether the royalty will be paid, and if so, at what percentage. The original definition of 'Net Sales' provided specifics, such as excluding cash discounts and limiting return deductions. The revised definition grants MusclePharm discretion over what deductions to take, conflicting with the original constraints. These changes create significant uncertainty regarding the compensation owed to the Lender.",

All Compensation Shares will be fully vested upon issuance, and for a period of six (6) months following the date hereof, Lender may not sell in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Compensation Shares without the prior consent of MusclePharm; provided, that, the Lender shall be entitled, without the prior consent of MusclePharm, to transfer the Compensation Shares at any time to affiliates and family members so long as such transfers are in compliance with state and federal securities laws and such transferees agree to be bound by foregoing transfer restrictions for the six (6) month period following the date hereof with respect to the Compensation Shares.",

The modified text changes this to 'MusclePharm may issue up to 780,000 shares' within a 'reasonable time', introducing uncertainty about the number of shares and timing of issuance. Further, it states that vesting is 'subject to the discretion of MusclePharm's board', and introduces ambiguity around the transfer to family members, directly conflicting with the original terms that ensured full vesting and permitted transfers to affiliates and family members.",

These two sections completely contradict each other on whether the endorser is allowed to market or advertise on behalf of similar products.",

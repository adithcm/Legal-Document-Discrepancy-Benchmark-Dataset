                "original_text": "Section 7.1 This Agreement shall continue until January 18, 2022, and thereafter shall continue automatically for successive annual periods ending on January 18th of each year, provided such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (a) the Fund's Board of Trustees and (b) a vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund's Trustees who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of the Plan, in this Agreement, or any agreement related to the Plan (the \"Qualified Trustees\"), by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) on 60 days' written notice, by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or (b) on 90 days' written notice by Integrity. This Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).",
                "changed_text": "Section 7.1 This Agreement shall continue until January 18, 2022, and thereafter shall continue automatically for successive annual periods ending on January 18th of each year. The annual continuation is subject to Integrity's sole discretion and does not require approval from the Fund's Board of Trustees. This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) only with Integrity's express written consent, or (b) on 90 days' written notice by Integrity. This Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement automatically renews annually if approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees. The modified version contradicts this by stating that renewal is at Integrity's sole discretion and does not require approval. This creates uncertainty about the renewal process and the Fund's control over the agreement's continuation, and makes terminating the contract without Integrity's approval impossible.",

The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the \"Plan\") adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.7 In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive the excess, if any, of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as underwriter. Any distribution and/or service fees are subject to the Fund's performance and profitability and are determined at the Fund's sole discretion, notwithstanding any provisions in the Shareholder Services Plan. The Fund reserves the right to withhold or adjust these fees based on internal financial assessments.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that Integrity receives distribution and service fees as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan. The modified version introduces a contradiction by stating that these fees are subject to the Fund's performance and are determined at the Fund's sole discretion, potentially overriding the terms of the Shareholder Services Plan. This creates ambiguity regarding Integrity's compensation and the enforceability of the Plan.",

The Fund agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Integrity, its several officers and governors, and any person who controls Integrity within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the cost of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) which Integrity, its officers and governors, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or necessary to make the statements in any of them not misleading; provided, however, that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers or governors, and any such controlling person shall not be deemed to cover any claims, demands, liabilities, or expenses arising out of or based upon any statements or representations made by Integrity or its representatives or agents other than such statements and representations as are contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information and in such financial and other statements as are furnished to Integrity pursuant to paragraph 2.2 hereof; and further provided that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity and the Fund's representations and warranties hereinbefore set forth in paragraph 3 shall not be deemed to cover any liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which Integrity would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of Integrity's reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Section 4.1 The Fund authorizes Integrity and any dealers with whom Integrity has entered into dealer agreements to use any prospectus or statement of additional information furnished by the Fund from time to time in connection with the sale of Shares.

This indemnification applies regardless of Integrity's actions, including cases of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence. The Fund is solely responsible for any losses arising from the sale of Shares.",
                "explanation": "The original text includes a provision that the Fund does NOT indemnify Integrity for liability arising from Integrity's 'willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence'. The modified text removes this exception and states that the indemnification applies *regardless* of Integrity's actions, including cases of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence. This creates a direct contradiction in the scope of the indemnification, significantly shifting risk to the Fund and creating ambiguity as to what constitutes an indemnifiable event.",

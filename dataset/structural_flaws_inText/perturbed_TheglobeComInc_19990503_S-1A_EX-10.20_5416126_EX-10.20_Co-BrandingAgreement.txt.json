                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by granting Boxlot broader rights than initially agreed upon and simultaneously stating that theglobe can change the license at any time. The original text specifies that Boxlot has a non-exclusive license for Page Templates, whereas the altered version now allows them to utilize \"theglobe's content in any way they choose\". This creates uncertainty about the scope and limitations of content usage for Boxlot and theglobe.",

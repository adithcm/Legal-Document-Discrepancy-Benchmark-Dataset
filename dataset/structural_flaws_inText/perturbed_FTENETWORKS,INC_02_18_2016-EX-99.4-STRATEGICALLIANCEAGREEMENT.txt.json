                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A. This Agreement shall remain in effect for the duration of the Initial Term, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the provision entitled \"Termination of Agreement\". After the Initial Term, this Agreement shall continue on a month to month basis until terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other setting forth the effective date of such termination.",
                "changed_text": "A. This Agreement shall remain in effect for the duration of the Initial Term, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the provision entitled \"Termination of Agreement\". After the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless terminated by FTE Networks, Inc. with thirty (30) days prior written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the renewal of the agreement. The original text states that the agreement continues on a month-to-month basis after the initial term and can be terminated by either party. The modified text states that the agreement automatically renews for one-year terms unless FTE Networks, Inc. terminates it, removing EDGE's right to terminate and creating uncertainty about the renewal process.",

However, Subcontractor will follow subcontracting requirements and processes of EDGE and provide joint access to subcontractor database and information concerning quality control. All Work performed by a Lower-tier Subcontractor shall be deemed Work performed by Subcontractor. Subcontractor agrees not to hire any Lower-tier Subcontractor to whose employment EDGE reasonably objects.",
                "changed_text": "A. Subcontractor shall not be permitted to subcontract any part of the Work without the prior written notification and consent of EDGE. However, EDGE may, at its sole discretion, allow subcontracting without formal written consent on a case-by-case basis. All Work performed by a Lower-tier Subcontractor shall be deemed Work performed by Subcontractor. Subcontractor agrees not to hire any Lower-tier Subcontractor to whose employment EDGE reasonably objects.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that the Subcontractor *is* permitted to subcontract without EDGE's consent. The modified text says Subcontractor *is not* permitted to subcontract without consent. Additionally, allowing subcontracting without formal written consent introduces uncertainty. The original text made no exception, but the modification grants EDGE discretion.",

                "explanation": "This creates conflicting implications by weakening the warranty. The original text promises 'promptness and diligence' and 'quality manner'. The modified text introduces uncertainty by changing these to 'reasonable effort and skill' and 'attempts to meet' which makes enforcement less definitive.",

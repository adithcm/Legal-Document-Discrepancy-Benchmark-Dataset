Not stated in order content will be subject to the provisions of agreement. Any modification, supplementary, give up should been written records, only to be valid by buyers and sellers authorized representative signature and confirmation, otherwise will be deemed invalid.",

Not stated in order content will be subject to the provisions of agreement. Any modification, supplementary, give up should been written records, to be valid whether or not it has the buyers and sellers authorized representative signature and confirmation. Oral agreements may also be considered valid at the discretion of the buyer.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause requiring written confirmation for modifications. By stating that modifications can be valid without written authorization or oral agreements can be valid at the discretion of the buyer, it creates uncertainty and potential disputes over what constitutes a valid change to the contract.",

CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers. The Certificate so issued shall be accepted as the base of a claim. The Sellers, in accordance with the Buyers' claim, shall be responsible for the immediate elimination of the defect(s), complete or partial replacement of the commodity or shall devaluate the commodity according to the state of defect(s). Where necessary, the Buyers shall be at liberty to eliminate the defect(s) themselves at the Sellers' expenses. If the Sellers fail to answer the Buyers within one weeks after receipt of the aforesaid claim, the claim shall be reckoned as having been accepted by the Sellers.",

CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers may claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, however this is not guaranteed, and any decision is at the seller's discretion. All the expenses shall be decided on a case-by-case basis. The Certificate so issued may be accepted as the base of a claim at the seller's discretion. If the Sellers fail to answer the Buyers within one weeks after receipt of the aforesaid claim, it does not guarantee the claim shall be reckoned as having been accepted by the Sellers.",
                "explanation": "This change makes the claim process highly uncertain. The original clause grants the buyer the right to claim, and the seller is responsible for addressing the claim if it meets certain criteria. The modified version makes the buyer's right to claim discretionary and removes the guarantee that the seller must act upon a valid claim, introducing significant uncertainty about the recourse available to the buyer for non-conforming goods.",

This Contract is made out in three originals in both Chinese and English, each language being legally of the equal effect. Conflicts between these two languages arising there from, if any, shall be subject to Chinese version. One copy for the Sellers, two copies for the Buyers. The Contract becomes effective after signed by both parties.",
                "changed_text": "23. The Contract is valid for 5 years, beginning from and ended on . The contract may, or may not be extended by the buyer under special circumstances. This Contract is made out in three originals in both Chinese and English, each language having a different weight. In any conflict of interpretation, the English version will take precedence. One copy for the Sellers, two copies for the Buyers. The Contract becomes effective after signed by the buyer.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states a clear 5-year validity and the Chinese version prevailing. By introducing the potential for extension 'under special circumstances' without defining them, the duration of the contract becomes ambiguous. Also by stating the English version will take precedence, it directly contradicts the original statement giving precedence to the Chinese version in case of conflicts. The contract also now only becomes effective after the buyer signs which could leave the seller in limbo. This contradiction can lead to disputes about the contract's terms and duration.",

                "changed_text": "1.3  \"Control\" or \"Controlled\" means, with respect to Intellectual Property, that SpinCo or a member of the SpinCo Group owns such Intellectual Property, in whole or in part, and/or has the right to grant a license to Parent with respect to such Intellectual Property as set forth herein but may incur financial or other obligations to any other Person. Further, \"Control\" or \"Controlled\" can be subject to or irrespective of the terms of any license or other agreement to which SpinCo or any of the SpinCo Group is a party that relates to any such Intellectual Property.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Control' explicitly states the right to grant licenses without incurring financial obligations to others. The revised definition contradicts this by suggesting that financial obligations *may* be incurred and removing the adherence to existing agreements. This creates uncertainty regarding SpinCo's ability to grant licenses freely.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SpinCo hereby grants to each individual member of the Parent Group, on behalf of itself and the other members of the SpinCo Group, and shall cause the other members of the SpinCo Group to grant to each individual member of the Parent Group, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license, for use in the Parent Field, to (i) use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, make Improvements and exploit the Licensed SpinCo IP, and (ii) make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import any goods and services incorporating, embodying or utilizing the Licensed SpinCo IP.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SpinCo hereby grants to each individual member of the Parent Group, on behalf of itself and the other members of the SpinCo Group, and may or may not cause the other members of the SpinCo Group to grant to each individual member of the Parent Group, a non-exclusive, worldwide, license, for use in the Parent Field, to (i) use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, make Improvements and exploit the Licensed SpinCo IP, and (ii) make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import any goods and services incorporating, embodying or utilizing the Licensed SpinCo IP. The license granted is not guaranteed to be perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, or royalty-free, and any of these terms may be subject to change at SpinCo's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause grants a license that is explicitly 'perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free'. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by stating that the license 'may or may not' be granted by all members of SpinCo and that the license terms are 'not guaranteed'. This creates a contradiction regarding the extent and conditions of the license.",

Indemnification is not guaranteed and may be limited based on SpinCo's financial capacity and other obligations. Further, SpinCo's decision to indemnify Parent Indemnitees does not establish a precedent for future indemnification claims.",
                "explanation": "The original clause unequivocally states that SpinCo 'shall' indemnify Parent. The modified clause changes this to 'may, at its sole discretion' along with the addition that there is no guarantee. This introduction of discretion contradicts the original mandatory obligation, creating uncertainty about whether indemnification will actually occur. This will introduce uncertainty.",

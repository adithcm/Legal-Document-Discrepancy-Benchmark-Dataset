                "original_text": "3.3 Notwithstanding Customer's obligations pursuant to clauses 3.1 and 3.4, the first [Redacted - Commercially Sensitive] of each Forecast shall constitute a binding commitment of Customer to purchase the quantities of Products set forth in the relevant Forecast for such [Redacted - Commercially Sensitive] period. The Forecast for the period beyond this two (2) month period shall be non-binding except to the extent otherwise provided in clause 3.4. Only Purchase Orders as accepted by Philips, as set forth in clause 3.4 below, constitute an obligation for Philips to actually produce the so ordered Products and no quantities of Products in the Forecast provided by Customer shall constitute an accepted Purchase Order.",
                "changed_text": "3.3 Notwithstanding Customer's obligations pursuant to clauses 3.1 and 3.4, the first [Redacted - Commercially Sensitive] of each Forecast does not guarantee a binding commitment of Customer to purchase the quantities of Products set forth in the relevant Forecast for such [Redacted - Commercially Sensitive] period. The Forecast for the period beyond this two (2) month period shall remain non-binding as well. Purchase Orders, even if accepted by Philips as set forth in clause 3.4 below, do not necessarily constitute an obligation for Philips to actually produce the so ordered Products. Quantities of Products listed in the Forecast provided by Customer may be considered as accepted Purchase Orders, depending on Philips' current production capacity.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the first two months of each forecast are a binding commitment, and that only accepted Purchase Orders create an obligation for Philips to produce. The modified version directly contradicts this by saying that the forecast does not guarantee a binding commitment and that purchase orders may not necessarily constitute a production obligation. It also introduces uncertainty by stating that forecast quantities may or may not be considered accepted Purchase Orders, creating confusion about when Philips is actually obligated to produce.",

                "explanation": "The original text dictates that a Purchase Order is accepted when accepted in writing. Also, Philips only can reject if certain conditions are met. However, the modified text suggests that Philips may not always accept the purchase order and also Philips can reject a PO even if conditions are met, creating uncertainty and conflicts within the contract.",

                "explanation": "The original text dictates that products should conform to the specifications of delivery, are always new and contain no defects and are of sound workmanship.

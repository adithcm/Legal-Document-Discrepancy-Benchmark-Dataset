The fact that the Disclosing Party may have marked or identified as confidential or proprietary any specific information shall be indicative that such Disclosing Party believes such information to be confidential or proprietary, but the failure to so mark information shall not determine that such information is or is not considered confidential information by such Disclosing Party.",

The fact that the Disclosing Party may have marked or identified as confidential or proprietary any specific information shall be the sole determinant that such information is considered confidential or proprietary. Failure to mark any information means it is explicitly not confidential.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Confidential Information' broadly, including anything the disclosing party 'would consider' confidential. The modified text drastically narrows this definition, stating that only information explicitly marked as confidential qualifies, directly contradicting the original intent and creating uncertainty.",

In consequence, if the LSA to be signed by the Parties is terminated for any reason whatsoever, the present Agreement will automatically terminate and be extinguished.",

                "explanation": "Section 4.1 originally states that this agreement terminates automatically if the LSA is terminated. The modified version directly contradicts this, stating that the agreement remains in effect for five years even if the LSA is terminated, creating ambiguity about the agreement's term.",

This Agreement shall be assignable or transferable by either party hereto only with the consent in writing of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. However, Supplier shall be free to assign this Agreement along with the LSA in favor of any third party, provided that the succeeding entity assumes all of the obligations under this Agreement and the LSA, and further provided that Supplier provides CUTANEA with prior written notice of such assignment.",

Either party may freely assign the agreement and is not required to notify the other party about it. Furthermore, the original assigning party will no longer be responsible for any obligations under this agreement after such assignment.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement can only be assigned with written consent from the other party, not to be unreasonably withheld. The modified version allows assignment without consent or notification, and releases the original assigning party from all future obligations. This direct contradiction introduces significant uncertainty regarding assignment rights and responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"The trading staff either places orders electronically or contacts brokers\" to \"The trading staff may place orders electronically or contact brokers,\" the obligation to place orders is made discretionary. Furthermore, shifting the responsibility for transaction settlement from 'the transaction settlement group' to the 'affiliated adviser' creates a conflict, as it's previously implied that FASC handles the settlement, not the adviser. This creates ambiguity about who is ultimately responsible for ensuring proper settlement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that 'analysts provide independent research and analysis' implying a duty. The change to 'analysts may provide research and analysis' makes this discretionary, creating uncertainty about the level of service FASC is required to provide. Additionally, changing statements like 'Typically, analysis includes...' to 'Analysis may include...' further reduces the obligation and introduces ambiguity. Similarly, changing 'Based on this proprietary analysis, the analyst makes buy, sell or hold recommendations' to 'Based on this analysis, the analyst may make buy, sell or hold recommendations' transforms a required action to a discretionary option for the analyst. This weakens the commitment to provide analysis leading to recommendations.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'analysts develop and apply financial models' to 'analysts may develop and apply financial models' reduces the obligation to develop and apply models, creating uncertainty. The most significant contradiction is the change from 'shall be treated as \"investment advisory services\"' to 'may not be treated as \"investment advisory services\"'. This creates a direct conflict, as the original text definitively classifies these services as investment advisory, while the modified text implies they might not be, impacting the applicability of Section 5(b) and creating enforcement uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each of them may delegate the filing of such filings and any amendments thereto to a mutually agreed upon third party, and shares joint responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of the information contained therein. Each party remains individually responsible for the accuracy of information they directly provide. However, no party is ultimately responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, regardless of their knowledge or belief about its accuracy.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states individual responsibility with a limited exception. The modified text introduces delegation and joint responsibility, conflicting with the initial individual responsibility statement and the original exception, thus creating uncertainty regarding liability for inaccurate information.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect unless terminated by mutual agreement of all parties or unilaterally terminated by any party with 30 days' written notice to all other parties. Termination by one party does not automatically release that party from obligations accrued prior to termination.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows unilateral revocation effective immediately for the revoking party. The modified text introduces the concept of 'termination' requiring either mutual agreement or 30 days' notice, contradicting the immediate revocation. It also adds a clause stating that termination 'does not automatically release that party from obligations accrued prior to termination,' potentially extending liability beyond the revocation date and creating uncertainty. The terms revoke and terminate are used in a contradictory fashion.",

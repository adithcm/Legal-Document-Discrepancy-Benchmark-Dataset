                "explanation": "The original text states that the Owner can terminate the agreement without cause, but the modified version adds an exception to the without-cause termination, stating \"unless Operator can prove that the cause is not under their control.\" This introduces a contradiction because it implies that in some cases, the Owner cannot terminate without cause.

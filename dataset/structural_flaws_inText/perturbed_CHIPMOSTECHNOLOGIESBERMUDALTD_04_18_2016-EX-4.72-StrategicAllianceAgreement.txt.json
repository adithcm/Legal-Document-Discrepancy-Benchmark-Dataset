The Parties may negotiate for an extension of this Agreement six (6) months before the expiration of the Cooperation Period.",

The Parties may negotiate for an extension of this Agreement six (6) months before the expiration of the Cooperation Period. The agreement shall automatically extend for an additional three year period unless either party provides written notice of termination at least one month prior to the expiration of the initial term.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the agreement's term. The original text states a three-year term with a possibility to negotiate an extension. The added sentence introduces an automatic renewal unless a termination notice is provided. This creates uncertainty regarding the agreement's term, as it's unclear whether the extension is subject to negotiation or automatic.",

The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (\"Dispute Notice\") to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall each select one (1) arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. All language used in such proceedings shall be Mandarin Chinese. The Parties agree to keep the content of the dispute and the proceeding of the arbitration confidential. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney's fees).",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any disputes involving intellectual property rights, the parties agree that the laws of the People's Republic of China shall govern, and the exclusive jurisdiction for such disputes shall be the courts of Beijing. The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation.

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction in the governing law and jurisdiction. The original text clearly states that the laws of Taiwan govern the entire agreement, and disputes are resolved through arbitration in Hong Kong. The added language introduces an exception for intellectual property disputes, stating that the laws of the PRC apply and the courts of Beijing have jurisdiction. This creates uncertainty about which legal system and forum apply to disputes, potentially leading to legal challenges.",

The original text states that neither party can assign their rights or obligations without the other party's written consent. The added sentence provides an exception for Tsinghua Unigroup, allowing them to assign their rights and obligations to any of its affiliates without ChipMOS's consent. This creates an imbalance and uncertainty, as it's unclear whether ChipMOS has a similar right to assign without consent and could lead to disputes over assignment rights.",

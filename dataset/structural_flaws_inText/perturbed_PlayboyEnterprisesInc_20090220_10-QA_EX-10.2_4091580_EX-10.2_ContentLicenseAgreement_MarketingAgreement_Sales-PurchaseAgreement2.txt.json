By execution of this Supplier/Subcontractor Contract (\"Contract\"), _______________ (\"Supplier\")  agrees and  acknowledges that: (i) all images and/or trademarks, including, but not limited to PLAYBOY, (the \"Playboy Properties\")  applied at the request of _______________ (\"Purchaser\")  to merchandise covered by this Contract are owned by  Playboy Enterprises International, Inc. (\"Playboy\"), and when used upon merchandise means that such merchandise is  sponsored, approved, recommended or sold by Playboy or its licensees; (ii) Supplier will not sell, ship or otherwise  dispose of any such merchandise except upon the order of Purchaser or Playboy; (iii) Supplier will never make, cause others to make or assist others in making, any claim whatsoever to any or all of the Playboy Properties or any trademark,  copyright, designation, name, phrase, design or symbol similar thereto in connection with the manufacture, advertising,  promotion, sale or distribution of merchandise; and (iv) Supplier will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and Playboy and the distributors and dealers and the officers and employees of each of the foregoing against all liability  whatsoever which may be incurred by them or any of them as a result of any alleged defects in material or workmanship  in the merchandise covered by this Contract.",

By execution of this Supplier/Subcontractor Contract (\"Contract\"), _______________ (\"Supplier\")  agrees and  acknowledges that: (i) all images and/or trademarks, including, but not limited to PLAYBOY, (the \"Playboy Properties\")  applied at the request of _______________ (\"Purchaser\")  to merchandise covered by this Contract may be subject to license by the Supplier, and when used upon merchandise it shall not be implied that such merchandise is  sponsored, approved, recommended or sold by Playboy or its licensees; (ii) Supplier will sell, ship and otherwise  dispose of any such merchandise except upon the order of Purchaser, Supplier or Playboy; (iii) Supplier may make claim to the Playboy Properties with approval by Purchaser in writing, provided it is in connection with the manufacture, advertising,  promotion, sale or distribution of merchandise; and (iv) Supplier will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and Playboy and the distributors and dealers and the officers and employees of each of the foregoing against all liability  whatsoever which may be incurred by them or any of them as a result of any alleged defects in material or workmanship  in the merchandise covered by this Contract.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly assigns ownership of Playboy Properties to Playboy Enterprises International, Inc. and restricts the Supplier from making any claims to these properties. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that the Supplier may license the properties, implying a potential claim of ownership or usage rights which directly contradicts the original assertion. It also allows the supplier to dispose of the merchandise beyond the initial constraints. The supplier can now make claims about the Playboy properties with the approval of the purchaser. This contradicts the original agreement.",

This Contract, when attached to a purchase order, shall consist of the entire agreement between the parties and shall  supersede any conflicting or contrary terms and conditions of any purchase order or other order form whether supplied  by Purchaser or Supplier.",

                "explanation": "The original clause establishes that the contract is the entire agreement and supersedes any conflicting terms in purchase orders. The modified clause directly contradicts this by stating that the contract is only a component of the agreement and does not supersede conflicting terms. This introduces uncertainty about which terms govern the relationship, potentially leading to disputes over which document takes precedence.",

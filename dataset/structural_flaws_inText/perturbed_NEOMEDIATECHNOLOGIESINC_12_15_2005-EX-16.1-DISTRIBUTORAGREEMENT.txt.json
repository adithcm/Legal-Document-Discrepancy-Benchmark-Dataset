                "explanation": "The original text states that DISTRIBUTOR must prepay *all* the invoiced amount. The modified version allows for partial prepayment, contradicting the original 'full payment' requirement. Also, the 'full and due payment' is changed to 'no clear obligation even upon partial payment', contradicting the prior sentence. This creates ambiguity regarding the payment terms and PPG SHANGHAI's delivery obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly disclaims all warranties except for title and standard warranty when leaving PPG warehouse, and says distributor cannot make warranties on behalf of PPG. The modified text introduces several contradictions: (1) product may or may not adhere to any warranty statement (2) Distributor can make warranties. (3) PPG may consider other warranties and (4) Even if products are non-conforming, PPG may not compensate, which causes the original text to be contradictory.",

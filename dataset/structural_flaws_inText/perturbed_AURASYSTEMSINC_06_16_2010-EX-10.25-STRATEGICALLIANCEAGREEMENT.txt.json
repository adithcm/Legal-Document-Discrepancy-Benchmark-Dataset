                "original_text": "The term \"Confidential Information\" means all know-how, formulations, recipes, specifications, catalogs, books, price books, maintenance, parts and service manuals, data sheets, sales, service and technical bulletins, customer lists, sales and marketing programs, price lists, cost data, sales aids, such as filmstrips and recordings, and all other publications and information, whether or not reduced to writing, relating to the formulation, manufacture, use, marketing and sale of the AuraGen and/or the Products, as well as any other information which may be divulged by one party under this Agreement to the other in the course of its performance of this Agreement, which is marked as Confidential or which is disclosed under circumstances that reasonably place the recipient on notice of the confidentiality of the information. Confidential Information does not, however, include any information which the recipient can establish (i) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by the discloser; (ii) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the discloser to recipient through no fault or breach of recipient; (iii) is already in the possession of recipient without restriction on use or disclosure at the time of disclosure by discloser as shown by recipient's files and records prior to the time of the disclosure; (iv) is obtained by recipient lawfully and without restriction on use or disclosure from a third party without a breach of such third party's obligations of confidentiality; or (v) is independently developed by recipient without use of or reference to discloser's Confidential Information, as shown by recipient's files and records.",
                "changed_text": "The term \"Confidential Information\" means all know-how, formulations, recipes, specifications, catalogs, books, price books, maintenance, parts and service manuals, data sheets, sales, service and technical bulletins, customer lists, sales and marketing programs, price lists, cost data, sales aids, such as filmstrips and recordings, and all other publications and information, whether or not reduced to writing, relating to the formulation, manufacture, use, marketing and sale of the AuraGen and/or the Products, as well as any other information which may be divulged by one party under this Agreement to the other in the course of its performance of this Agreement, which is marked as Confidential or which is disclosed under circumstances that reasonably place the recipient on notice of the confidentiality of the information. Confidential Information includes all information, regardless of its source or prior knowledge by the recipient. There are no exceptions.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Confidential Information\" provides several exceptions. The modified definition explicitly states that there are no exceptions, directly contradicting the detailed exclusions previously outlined. This creates significant uncertainty about what constitutes confidential information, potentially leading to disputes over its use and protection.",

                "original_text": "Unless terminated prior to the natural expiration of the Initial Term, upon the expiry of the Initial Term this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive terms of the same duration, unless either party gives written notice to the other of such party's desire not to renew not less than ninety (90) days prior to the date of the expiration of the Initial Term or any successive term thereafter.",
                "changed_text": "Unless terminated prior to the natural expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement will not automatically renew. Renewal requires a written agreement signed by both parties at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the Initial Term or any successive term thereafter.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies automatic renewal unless written notice is given. The modified clause completely reverses this, stating that the agreement does *not* automatically renew and requires explicit written agreement for renewal. This creates a direct contradiction about renewal terms, undermining the enforceability of either provision.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Zanotti agrees that Aura shall be allowed the full benefit of any and all lower prices and/or any more favorable terms and/or conditions (\"MFN\" Terms) contained in any other agreement entered into by Zanotti for the sale of any product substantially similar to the Product in the same or lesser quantities described in this Agreement to third parties. Zanotti shall notify Aura in writing of any such MFN Terms within fifteen (15) calendar days after agreeing thereto, and shall make the MFN Terms available to Aura as of the effective date of such agreement and thereafter for the greater of (i) three (3) months or (ii) such time that the MFN Terms remain in effect.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Zanotti retains the sole discretion to offer or withhold any lower prices or more favorable terms and conditions to Aura that it may offer to third parties. Zanotti is under no obligation to disclose any terms offered to other parties or to extend such terms to Aura under any circumstances. Zanotti can review this option annually. The decision remains at Zanotti's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original \"Most Favored Nation\" clause mandates that Aura receives the best prices and terms Zanotti offers. The modified clause directly contradicts this by granting Zanotti complete discretion over pricing and terms offered to Aura, negating any obligation to match third-party benefits. This undermines the original intent of the MFN clause and creates a clear conflict.",

To the extent, if any, that provision of this Agreement conflicts with or differs from any provision of the Agreement, such provision of the original Co-Branding Agreement shall prevail and govern for all purposes and in all respects. This is intended to ensure consistency with the initial intentions of both parties.",

Now, it states the opposite, that the original agreement prevails, creating a significant contradiction about which document has precedence.",

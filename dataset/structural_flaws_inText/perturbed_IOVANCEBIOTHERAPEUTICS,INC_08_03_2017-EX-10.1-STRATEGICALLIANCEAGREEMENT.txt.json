MD Anderson further acknowledges and agrees that all original works of authorship that are made by MD Anderson (solely or jointly with others) in the performance of the Research, excluding any publication made in accordance with Section 6.4 (a \"Work\") and that are protectable by copyright are \"works made for hire,\" as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act. However, to the extent that any Work may not, by operation of any Laws, be a work made for hire, MD Anderson hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to LBIO all of MD Anderson's worldwide right, title and interest in and to such Work, including all Intellectual Property Rights therein and relating thereto, subject to MD Anderson's right to use such Work for internal research, academic, and non-commercial patient care purposes prior to publication or public disclosure.",

MD Anderson hereby acknowledges and agrees that the rights and obligations hereunder are of a personal nature and, therefore, neither this Agreement nor any right or obligation contained within shall be assignable, transferable or delegable in whole or in part by MD Anderson and MD Anderson shall not, without the prior written consent of LBIO, sub-contract or otherwise engage any consultant or other third party to perform any of MD Anderson's activities or obligations under this Agreement or any Study Order.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that LBIO can assign the agreement, but MD Anderson cannot. The modified version adds a sentence stating that MD Anderson may also assign or transfer this Agreement without the prior written consent of but with written notice to LBIO promptly following consummation of the relevant transaction. While the later sentence mentions MD Anderson acknowledges that rights and obligations are personal and requires LBIO's consent, the added sentence creates a contradiction about whether MD Anderson can assign the agreement unilaterally, creating uncertainty.",

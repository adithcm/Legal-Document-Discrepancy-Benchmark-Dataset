                "original_text": "4. Exclusivity. Wade agrees that during the Term of this Agreement, he will not represent or perform as a representative, spokesperson or provide Wade Services for, nor furnish services  or materials, or allow the use of the Wade Image to be used for the advertising,  endorsement, promotion, or sale of Innerwear in the Territory. Furthermore, Wade will not engage in any business or other transaction or have any financial or personal interest in any entity whose primary or core business is selling or  manufacturing Innerwear during the Term. Endorsement of any Innerwear other than the Naked Products or Wade Products without the express written consent of Naked will constitute a material breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "4. Exclusivity. Wade agrees that during the Term of this Agreement, he will use reasonable efforts to avoid representing or performing as a representative, spokesperson or providing Wade Services for, nor furnishing services  or materials, or allowing the use of the Wade Image to be used for the advertising,  endorsement, promotion, or sale of Innerwear in the Territory. Furthermore, Wade will not engage in any business or other transaction or have any direct financial interest in any entity whose primary or core business is selling or  manufacturing Innerwear during the Term. Endorsement of any Innerwear other than the Naked Products or Wade Products without the express written consent of Naked will only constitute a material breach of this Agreement if such endorsement is deemed detrimental to Naked's brand, at Naked's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a strict exclusivity clause, prohibiting Wade from endorsing or being involved with any competing Innerwear brands. The modified text weakens this clause by using 'reasonable efforts to avoid' instead of a hard prohibition, and by adding that endorsement of competing products only constitutes a breach if deemed detrimental to Naked's brand, which introduces subjectivity and makes the clause harder to enforce.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity regarding intellectual property ownership. The added phrase \"unless otherwise agreed in writing\" to the joint ownership clause allows for potential future conflicts over Wade Products IP. Similarly, limiting Wade's ownership of his image only to uses not directly related to Naked Products creates uncertainty. The ownership of advertising material, previously absolute for Naked, is now shared, and Wade's acknowledgement of not asserting rights is now conditional. This creates potential for disputes over IP usage and control.",

Such termination may, at Naked's discretion, relieve Naked of its obligation to provide any further consideration pursuant to this Agreement; however, Wade's vested warrants may also be subject to forfeiture depending on the specific circumstances of the breach, as determined solely by Naked.

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a significant power imbalance in the termination clauses. While the original agreement provides relatively balanced termination rights, the modified version heavily favors Naked. Specifically, it makes Naked's obligation to provide further consideration discretionary upon Wade's breach, while previously it was not. It also introduces uncertainty about warrant forfeiture, previously clear-cut, depending solely on Naked's determination. Furthermore, Wade's termination rights are severely restricted by requiring Naked's express written authorization, essentially nullifying Wade's ability to terminate based on Naked's actions. Naked can also now decide to relieve itself of obligations to provide consideration, in case Wade decided to terminate the agreement.",

                "original_text": "2.1Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall be valid for a period of five (5) years with automatic renewal of one year thereafter until terminated -2- by either party with one (1) year written notice prior to the expiration of the initial period or any extension period thereof.",
                "changed_text": "2.1Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall be valid for a period of five (5) years, renewable only upon mutual written agreement of both parties made no less than six (6) months prior to the expiration of the initial term. The term will continue for only the initial five-year period and won't be renewed after that. The initial five-year term cannot be terminated until the expiration date.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies an automatic renewal with a one-year notice period for termination. The modified text contradicts this by requiring mutual written agreement for renewal, stating the contract will not be renewed and that the initial five-year term cannot be terminated. This creates uncertainty about the contract's term and termination conditions, making it unclear whether it will automatically renew or requires explicit agreement, and whether it can be terminated before the expiration date.",

Unless otherwise agreed to by ESTABLISHMENT in writing, ESTABLISHMENT shall invoice APOLLO for Product ordered at the time of shipment and APOLLO shall pay each invoice within thirty (30) days from date of invoice. Each invoice shall set forth, in U.S. Dollars, the applicable price for the shipment properly determined in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If APOLLO disputes any portion of an invoice received from ESTABLISHMENT the Parties shall use good faith efforts to reconcile the disputed amounts as soon as practicable. Invoices should be sent to the physical and email addresses as specified in writing by APOLLO in the applicable Purchase Order.",
                "changed_text": "4.2Payment Terms. Unless otherwise agreed to by ESTABLISHMENT in writing, ESTABLISHMENT shall invoice APOLLO for Product ordered at the time of shipment and APOLLO shall pay each invoice within sixty (60) days from date of invoice. However, ESTABLISHMENT reserves the right to demand immediate payment upon delivery, regardless of the invoice date. Each invoice shall set forth, in U.S. Dollars, the applicable price for the shipment properly determined in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If APOLLO disputes any portion of an invoice received from ESTABLISHMENT the Parties shall use good faith efforts to reconcile the disputed amounts within ninety (90) days. Invoices should be sent to the physical and email addresses as specified orally by APOLLO in the applicable Purchase Order.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states invoices are due within 30 days. The modified clause states they are due in 60 days, but then contradicts itself by allowing ESTABLISHMENT to demand immediate payment upon delivery. It also modifies the reconciliation period from 'as soon as practicable' to within 90 days, creating uncertainty in the payment deadline. Finally, it introduces another contradiction by specifying addresses as 'orally' specified, while in the original contract, they are sent to the physical and email addresses as specified 'in writing'.",

Neither Party shall have the right to assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, APOLLO may assign the Agreement to and may, without the -13- prior consent of ESTABLISHMENT, assign all of its rights under this Agreement to (i) a parent or subsidiary of Apollo, (ii) a purchaser of all or substantially all the Apollo assets related to this Agreement, or (iii) a third party acquiring control of Apollo through a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or other corporate reorganization.",

Either Party shall have the right to assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, ESTABLISHMENT may assign the Agreement to and may, without the prior consent of APOLLO, assign all of its rights under this Agreement to (i) a competitor of Apollo, (ii) a purchaser of only some of the Apollo assets related to this Agreement, or (iii) a third party that Apollo does not approve of.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that neither party can assign the agreement without consent, but Apollo can assign it to specific entities like parents, subsidiaries, purchasers of *all or substantially all* assets, or third parties acquiring control of Apollo through a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or other corporate reorganization. The modified version contradicts this by stating ESTABLISHMENT may assign the agreement to a *competitor of Apollo, a purchaser of only some of Apollo’s assets* and *a third party that Apollo does not approve of*. These assignments could severely damage Apollo’s interests, rendering the assignment clause contradictory and uncertain.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"Minimum Quantity\" means [***] pounds of Terpene Product per Year, prorated for any partial Year included in the Term.\n\n\"Product Price\" means with respect to a pound of Terpene Product the Terpene Cost of that Terpene Product, plus the Margin.",
                "changed_text": "\"Minimum Quantity\" means [***] pounds of Terpene Product per Year, prorated for any partial Year included in the Term, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by both parties. \n\n\"Product Price\" means with respect to a pound of Terpene Product the Terpene Cost of that Terpene Product; the Margin is subject to annual negotiation and may be adjusted based on market conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Minimum Quantity' as a fixed amount. The modified text introduces uncertainty by allowing the quantity to be altered by written agreement. This contradicts the initial fixed definition. The original text defined 'Product Price' clearly, but the modified version adds a clause that the Margin is subject to annual negotiations. This can contradict the definition of product price and can cause disputes.",

                "changed_text": "FCC shall use its best efforts to accept all such purchase orders. FCC's acceptance of purchase orders is subject to its internal production capacity and raw material availability, and FCC reserves the right to reject any order, in its sole discretion, without any liability to Flotek.",
                "explanation": "The original clause outlines specific conditions under which FCC can reject purchase orders based on quantity limits. The modified clause grants FCC broad discretion to reject orders based on internal factors, contradicting the original, more defined acceptance obligations. This change creates uncertainty and gives FCC significant leverage.",

If Flotek disputes the invoice, the payment is due 30 days after resolution of the dispute.",
                "explanation": "Originally, payment terms are clearly stated as 60 days. By adding the clause \"unless otherwise specified in a separate agreement or unless Flotek disputes the invoice in good faith,\" this creates ambiguity. The introduction of a 'separate agreement' allows for potentially contradictory payment terms, negating the initial clarity.",

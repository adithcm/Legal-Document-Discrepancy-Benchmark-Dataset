This Agreement shall be effective as of that date (the \"Effective Date\") the Site becomes fully operational as set forth in writing and executed by both Parties and shall continue for a period of one (1) year from the Effective Date. This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for an additional one year period on each anniversary of the Effective Date, unless terminated by either Party hereto upon ninety (90) days written notice to the other. Such notice shall specify the date on which this Agreement is to be terminated (the \"Termination Date\").",
                "changed_text": "4.1 Term; Termination. This Agreement shall be effective as of that date (the \"Effective Date\") the Site becomes fully operational as set forth in writing and executed by both Parties and shall continue for a period of one (1) year from the Effective Date. This Agreement may be renewed for an additional one year period on each anniversary of the Effective Date, subject to the mutual written consent of both Parties. Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason, without prior notice, but in such cases, a termination fee may apply as detailed in Section 4.2.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states the agreement automatically renews unless terminated with 90 days' notice. The modified clause states renewal requires mutual written consent and allows termination at any time. This contradicts the auto-renewal and notice period, creating uncertainty about the contract's term and termination conditions.",

                "changed_text": "3.1 The Company shall pay HDI a percentage of Net Sales as determined by HDI, based on current market conditions. \"Net Sales\" might include revenues from the sale of Deerskin Products on the Site, but may be redefined at HDI's discretion to only include certain high-margin items. The deductions for refunds and exchanges are also subject to change based on HDI's internal accounting policies.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly defines the percentage and calculation method of Net Sales. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating the percentage is determined by HDI and can change. The definition of 'Net Sales' itself is also made uncertain, allowing HDI to redefine it. This creates a contradiction and makes the payment terms unclear and subject to HDI's discretion.",

Neither the Site nor any portion of thereof shall be deemed accepted and approved by the Company unless and until the Company accepts and approves same in writing to HDI. No portion of the Site shall be made available on the Internet without the consent of the Company.",

Content may be placed on the site at HDI's discretion, and any content approval requirements are subject to change with 30 days notification.",
                "explanation": "The original clause grants the company exclusive control over the site's content and design, requiring written approval before anything is published. The modified clause gives HDI the authority to decide content and publish without explicit approval. This fundamentally contradicts the original clause, creating uncertainty about who controls the site's appearance and content.",

                "changed_text": "Sponsor agrees that it may, at its discretion, adjust the list price to its customers of Designated Sponsor Products that form part of this promotion. However, the Sponsor will attempt to maintain price parity with its otherwise identical products that do not form part of the promotion, market conditions permitting.",
                "explanation": "Section 3 previously prohibited the Sponsor from increasing the price of products with the promotion. The modified section now allows for price adjustments at the Sponsor's discretion, potentially contradicting the original intent of the agreement and creating uncertainty.",

While the intention is to allow downloads until March 31, 2010, Charity Tunes reserves the right to modify or terminate the redemption period at any time without prior notice. Pin Codes entered for redemption may be rejected at Charity Tunes' sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "Section 7 originally specified a fixed end date for the promotion. The modified section introduces uncertainty by stating that Charity Tunes can change or end the redemption period early, creating a direct contradiction and weakening the consumer's right to redeem a Pin Code during the originally stated period.",

                "changed_text": "While Charity Tunes will endeavor to provide music downloads promptly to eligible consumers with valid Pin Codes, Charity Tunes does not guarantee immediate access or availability of all music selections. Download speeds and availability are subject to system performance and factors beyond Charity Tunes' control. Charity Tunes' sole obligation is to provide access to the platform; successful download is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "Section 11.1 initially warrants immediate access to music downloads. The modification removes this guarantee, stating only an 'endeavor' to provide downloads and disclaiming responsibility for factors affecting download success. This directly contradicts the original warranty, making the consumer's access to the promised downloads less certain.",

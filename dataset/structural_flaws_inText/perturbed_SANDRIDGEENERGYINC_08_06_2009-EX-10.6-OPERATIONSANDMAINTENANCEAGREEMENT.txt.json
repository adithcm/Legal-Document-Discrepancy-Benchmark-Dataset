                "original_text": "This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier pursuant to Section 3.2 or 3.3 of this Agreement, shall continue until the twentieth (20th) anniversary of the Effective Date; provided, however, (i) Operator shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time upon no less than 120 days prior written notice to Owner, if Operator provides a substitute operator acceptable to Owner, as determined in its reasonable discretion, who (A) has experience operating similar assets, (B) has the ability to provide at least the same quality of service as Operator, (C) has the financial ability to perform the obligations hereunder, and (D) is ready, willing and able to execute an operation and maintenance agreement substantially similar to this Agreement and acceptable to Owner, as determined in its reasonable discretion, and (ii) Owner shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time upon no less than 120 days prior written notice to Operator.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier pursuant to Section 3.2 or 3.3 of this Agreement, shall continue until the twentieth (20th) anniversary of the Effective Date; provided, however, (i) Operator may terminate this Agreement with minimal notice to Owner, not less than 1 day, if circumstances warrant, if Operator provides a substitute operator acceptable to Owner, who meets vaguely defined criteria, and (ii) Owner shall have the right to terminate this Agreement only for gross misconduct or material breach by the Operator.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear 20-year term with specific conditions for early termination by both parties with 120 days written notice. The modified text introduces ambiguity by allowing the operator to terminate with only 1 day notice under vaguely defined 'circumstances warrant' and relaxes the criteria for an acceptable substitute operator while restricting the owner's termination rights to cases of gross misconduct or material breach. This creates a contradiction regarding the agreed-upon term and each party's termination rights, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Operator shall perform its duties and obligations hereunder and its responsibilities as Operator of the Gathering System, (i) in a manner it deems appropriate, (ii) following the practices it deems best, (iii) generally in accordance with Laws, excluding Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits, (iv) without regard to the Subject Gathering Agreements, and (v) with the budget it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear standard of care for the Operator. The changed text directly contradicts this by stating Operator should work in a manner they deem appropriate, following practices they deem best, can ignore Environmental Laws and Gathering Agreements, and choose their own budget. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the standard of care, potentially creating uncertainty for both sides. ",

                "original_text": "Operator shall invoice Owner, monthly, for all costs and expenses incurred hereunder during the immediately preceding month and, without duplication, in any prior month. Owner shall pay all such amounts prior to the later of (a) 50 days after the end of the month in which the expenses were incurred or (b) 10 days after the date of receipt of each invoice. Invoices received after 1:00 pm local time will be deemed received on the next Business Day. If the day on which any payment is due is not a Business Day, then the relevant payment shall be due upon the immediately succeeding Business Day. Any amounts which remain due and owing after the due date shall bear interest at the lower of the prime rate as published in the \"Money Rates\" section of The Wall Street Journal plus two percent (2%) per annum and the maximum lawful rate of interest, compounded daily from the date such payment is due until such payment is made. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any indemnification payments required to be made by a Party hereunder shall be made to the indemnified Party upon receipt by the indemnifying Party of written demand therefor from the indemnified Party.",
                "changed_text": "Operator shall invoice Owner at its convenience, for all costs and expenses it determines. Owner shall pay all such amounts within a reasonable timeframe as determined by the Operator, and any delays in payment will incur penalties as determined by the Operator. The Operator will provide notice of the penalties after they are issued, and the Owner will have 1 day to rectify the situation to not be penalized. Penalties will be determined by the Operator's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text dictates that the operator invoices monthly, then sets forth a 50 day after expenses/10 days after receipt of invoice payment term. The modified text implies operator can invoice at any time, owner must pay within a 'reasonable' timeframe as determined by the operator and the amount of penalties is determined by the operator's sole discretion. This creates a contradiction concerning when/how much the invoices are/how long they can be paid. ",

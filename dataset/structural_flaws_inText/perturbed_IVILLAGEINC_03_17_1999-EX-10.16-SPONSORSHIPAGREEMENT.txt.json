For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"retailer\" shall refer to an entity which sells new and/or used vehicles.",

However, iVillage reserves the right to partner with other automotive manufacturers for specific, limited-time promotional campaigns at iVillage's discretion. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"retailer\" shall refer to an entity which sells new and/or used vehicles.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides Ford with exclusive sponsorship rights. The added clause contradicts this by allowing iVillage to partner with other automotive manufacturers for limited-time campaigns, creating uncertainty about the extent of Ford's exclusivity.",

                "changed_text": "Neither Party shall sell, transfer or assign this Agreement or the rights or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. However, iVillage's consent to assignment by FMM is not required if FMM assigns the agreement to an advertising agency that has a pre-existing relationship with a competing automotive manufacturer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon prior written notice by Ford Motor Company to iVillage, this Agreement may be assigned by FMM to another advertising agency, and in such event, FMM will be released from all financial and other obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that neither party can assign the agreement without the other's consent, but then provides an exception for FMM assigning to another agency. The inserted 'However' clause contradicts the initial condition by stating iVillage's consent is not required under certain circumstances. This introduces conflicting conditions on assignment.",

For providing services as set forth herein, VNUE will compensate Promoter i) Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) for each One (1) Year contract Promoter secures per venue and Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000,00) for each Two (2) Year contract Promoter secures per venue, with payment due to Promoter within Thirty (30) Days from the date on which each such contract is countersigned; and ii) through the issuance of VNUE common stock as set forth below, and for the purposes of Rule 144 such shares of stock shall be deemed to have fully earned by Promoter upon the date of each issuance of such stock certificates by VStock Transfer:\n\nThree Million (3,000,000) shares of VNUE common stock shall be awarded to Promoter for performing Promotion Services as follows:\n\n\n\nSource: VNUE, INC., 8-K, 9/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n  For every Five (5) music venues that sign a contract with VNUE, Six Hundred Thousand (600,000) shares of VNUE common stock shall be awarded to Promoter;   and   If Ten (10) music venues sign a contract with VNUE before January 16, 2016, Promoter will receive an additional bonus of Three Hundred Thousand (300,000) shares of VNUE common stock.",

For providing services as set forth herein, VNUE may compensate Promoter i) Up to Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) for each One (1) Year contract Promoter secures per venue and Up to Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000,00) for each Two (2) Year contract Promoter secures per venue, with payment due to Promoter within Sixty (60) Days from the date on which each such contract is countersigned, subject to VNUE's sole discretion and available funds; and ii) VNUE may, at its sole discretion, provide VNUE common stock as set forth below, and for the purposes of Rule 144 such shares of stock shall be deemed to vest at a time determined by VNUE.

                "explanation": "The original Section 2 specifies the exact amount of payment and stock awards for securing contracts. The modified version introduces uncertainty by using 'Up to' and 'may,' giving VNUE discretion over both monetary compensation and stock issuance. It also changes the payment date for more ambiguity, and introduces that the number of shares may vary. This contradicts the original intent of fixed compensation, leading to potential disputes.",

Promoter shall deliver to VNUE an itemized accounting of expenses incurred on a weekly basis, and VNUE shall reimburse Promoter within Thirty (30) Days of receipt of such accounting.",

VNUE may reimburse Promoter for expenses incurred by Promoter while performing the duties herein, subject to budget constraints and prior approval. Promoter shall deliver to VNUE an itemized accounting of expenses incurred, the frequency of which will be determined by VNUE, and VNUE shall endeavor to reimburse Promoter when funds are available and accounting requirements are met. VNUE is not responsible for reimbursing the promoter.",
                "explanation": "The original Section 3 clearly states VNUE 'shall reimburse' expenses, creating an obligation. The modified version uses 'may reimburse,' making reimbursement discretionary and contingent on budget and approval. It changes the reimbursement frequency and timeline to make it vague. The addition of 'VNUE is not responsible for reimbursing the promoter' directly contradicts the initial statement about reimbursement, creating significant uncertainty.",

Promoter may only extend the Agreement term with approval from VNUE. VNUE can terminate at any point.",
                "explanation": "Originally, Section 6 allowed for mutual written agreement for renewal. The modified version grants VNUE sole discretion for renewal, removing the promoter's right to agree to extensions. Additionally, the added 'VNUE can terminate at any point' directly contradicts the original term length, creating uncertainty about the agreement's duration and enforceability.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines the Joint Venture's term as ending upon specific events like Put/Call options or termination. The modified text contradicts this by stating the Joint Venture continues indefinitely even after those events, creating uncertainty about the agreement's duration and obligations.",

The added exception allows the AFSL-nominated director to unilaterally approve revisions under ¥50,000,000, directly contradicting the unanimous approval requirement and creating uncertainty about the budget revision process.",

The modified text states the opposite, giving precedence to the Japanese text. This directly contradicts the original clause and introduces ambiguity about which language version governs the agreement's interpretation.",

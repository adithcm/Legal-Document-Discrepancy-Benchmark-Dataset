This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until the four-year anniversary of the Effective Date (such period, as it may be extended, either by the mutual written agreement of the parties or automatically, or earlier terminated being referred to as the \"Consultation Period\"), unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section 4, and shall automatically renew for successive one-year periods, unless the Company provides 90 days' notice of termination before any such successive period.",

This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until the four-year anniversary of the Effective Date (such period, as it may be extended, either by the mutual written agreement of the parties or automatically, or earlier terminated being referred to as the \"Consultation Period\"), unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section 4, and may renew for successive one-year periods, subject to the Consultant's approval, unless the Company provides 90 days' notice of termination before any such successive period.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement \"shall automatically renew\" unless the company provides notice. The modified text introduces the phrase \"subject to the Consultant's approval,\" which directly contradicts the automatic renewal clause. This creates uncertainty about whether the agreement automatically renews or if the Consultant's consent is required.",

The Consultant hereby assigns to the Company all Inventions and any and all related patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, and other industrial and intellectual property rights and applications therefor, in the United States and elsewhere and appoints any officer of the Company as Consultant's duly authorized attorney to execute, file, prosecute and protect the same before any government agency, court or authority. However, this paragraph shall not apply to Inventions which do not relate to the business or research and development conducted or planned to be conducted by the Company at the time such Invention is created, made, conceived or reduced to practice and which are made and conceived by the Consultant not during normal working hours, not on the Company's premises and not using the Company's tools, devices, equipment or Proprietary Information. The Consultant further acknowledges that each original work of authorship which is made by the Consultant (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of this Agreement and which is protectable by copyright is a \"work made for hire,\" as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act.",

                "explanation": "The phrase \"shall be the sole property of the Company\" is contradicted by adding \", unless otherwise agreed in writing.\" This means the company would not have the sole property of something that was previously assigned. This allows some inventions to not become the company's if there is an agreement, and thus, contradicts the first portion of this text.",

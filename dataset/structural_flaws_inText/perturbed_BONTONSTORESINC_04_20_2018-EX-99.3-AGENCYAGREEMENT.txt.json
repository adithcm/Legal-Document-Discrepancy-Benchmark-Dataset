However, Merchant shall retain a percentage of proceeds, as determined by Merchant's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the ownership of Proceeds. The original text clearly states that Proceeds shall be the exclusive property of Purchaser, but the modified version grants the Merchant discretion to retain a percentage of Proceeds, leading to uncertainty about the division of Proceeds.",

                "explanation": "The change adds 'and Agent will retain responsibility for FF&E that is not owned by Merchant', which contradicts the original text's statement that 'Agent shall have no responsibility whatsoever with respect to FF&E that is not owned by Merchant'.

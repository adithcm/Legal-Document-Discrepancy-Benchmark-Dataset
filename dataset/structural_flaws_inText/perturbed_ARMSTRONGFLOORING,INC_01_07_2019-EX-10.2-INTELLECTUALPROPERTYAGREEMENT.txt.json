Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Arizona hereby grants to the Company a perpetual, non- exclusive, royalty-free license in, to and under the Arizona Licensed Copyrights for use in the Company Field throughout the world.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Arizona hereby grants to the Company a temporary, non- exclusive, royalty-free license in, to and under the Arizona Licensed Copyrights for use in the Company Field throughout the world. This license shall be in effect for a period of one year from the Effective Date, after which it may be renewed at Arizona's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants a 'perpetual' license, while the modified version changes it to a 'temporary' one-year license subject to renewal. This directly contradicts the 'perpetual' nature of the original grant and creates uncertainty about the duration of the copyright license.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Arizona hereby grants to the Company a limited, non- exclusive, royalty-free, non-sublicensable (except as set forth in Section 7.1), non-assignable license in, to and under the Arizona Licensed Trademarks for the Arizona Trademark License Term for use in the Company Field throughout the world only in the form and manner that such Arizona Licensed Trademarks are used in the Business as of the Closing, provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to present the Arizona Licensed Trademarks in the form set forth on Schedule 6.1.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Arizona hereby grants to the Company a limited, non- exclusive, royalty-free, fully-sublicensable and assignable license in, to and under the Arizona Licensed Trademarks for the Arizona Trademark License Term for use in the Company Field throughout the world only in any manner the Company deems appropriate, without regard to the form and manner that such Arizona Licensed Trademarks are used in the Business as of the Closing. The Company may use the Arizona Licensed Trademarks in any form it sees fit, even if it deviates from the presentation set forth on Schedule 6.1.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states that the license is 'non-sublicensable' and 'non-assignable' and that the trademarks are to be used 'only in the form and manner' as before. The modified clause directly contradicts this by making the license 'fully-sublicensable and assignable' and allowing the Company to use the trademarks in 'any manner' it deems appropriate, even if it deviates from Schedule 6.1. This contradiction undermines the control Arizona has over its trademarks.",

Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company shall not file applications to register any Arizona Licensed IP or assist any person in doing the same, or contest, challenge, or otherwise take any action adverse to Arizona's and its Affiliates' ownership of or rights in and to the Arizona Licensed IP, or assist any person in doing the same.",

The company may also take action adverse to Arizonaâ€™s ownership with expressed written permission from Arizona.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause which states that the Company will *not* acquire any ownership rights and will *not* take any action adverse to Arizona's ownership. The modified text introduces the possibility of the Company acquiring ownership rights under certain circumstances and filing applications to register the IP if Arizona fails to do so, conflicting with the initial explicit denial of such rights. It would now be very hard to determine the true owner of Arizona Licensed IP.",

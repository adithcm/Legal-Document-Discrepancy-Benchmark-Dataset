                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the Schedule 13G/A with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of The RMR Group Inc., dated as of December 31, 2019, is, and any amendments thereto (including amendments on Schedule 13D) signed by each of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of each of us pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the Schedule 13G/A with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of The RMR Group Inc., dated as of December 31, 2019, may be, and any amendments thereto (including amendments on Schedule 13D) signed by each of the undersigned may be, filed on behalf of each of us pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. However, the filing is not guaranteed and depends on legal counsel approval.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'is' and 'shall be' to 'may be' introduces uncertainty about the obligation to file. Adding that the filing 'is not guaranteed' directly contradicts the initial agreement and creates ambiguity about whether the filing will definitely occur, thereby undermining the purpose of the joint filing agreement.",

                "explanation": "This adds a clause stating the signatory authority of Adam D. Portnoy is subject to internal review and may be revoked. This contradicts the earlier section where his signature is assumed to be binding and valid, creating uncertainty about whether his signature is actually legally binding for ABP Trust at the time of signing.",

                "explanation": "By adding that Adam D. Portnoy's obligations are contingent upon his employment, this introduces uncertainty regarding his commitment. If his employment ends, it's unclear if the agreement still applies to him personally, directly contradicting the original agreement, which implies an unconditional commitment from him as an individual.",

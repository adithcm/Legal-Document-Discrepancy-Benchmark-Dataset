                "explanation": "This change contradicts the initial warranty by stating the Professional can enter agreements with other apparel companies, undermining the exclusivity granted to Sport-Haley in Section 1(a).",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text by removing the requirement for the Professional's consent for assignment in cases other than those specifically mentioned. This introduces uncertainty about the Professional's control over the agreement if the Company is acquired.",

If such association is not then in existence, an independent association of arbitrators may be utilized  which is designated by agreement of the parties. In the event the parties are unable to agree on an independent association of arbitrators, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for appointment of arbitrators.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of any dispute which arises between the parties and which relates to the subject matter of this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that any such dispute shall be resolved through litigation in the courts of Colorado, unless both parties mutually agree to binding arbitration. However, the Company retains the sole discretion to decide whether or not to pursue litigation or arbitration.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that disputes will be resolved through litigation initially, then allowing for arbitration only by mutual agreement. Then, adding that the company has the sole discretion to decide, this introduces uncertainty and favors one party, conflicting with the initial agreement to arbitrate.",

This Agreement will become effective as of the Effective Date and, unless sooner terminated pursuant to Sections 3.1  [Advertising and Promotion] or 10.2  [Termination for Breach], shall remain effective for two (2) years from and after the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). This agreement shall automatically renew for additional successive terms of twelve (12) months each at the end of the Initial Term (\"Renewal Terms\"), unless either party notifies the other in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the Initial Term.

This Agreement will become effective as of the Effective Date and, unless sooner terminated pursuant to Sections 3.1  [Advertising and Promotion] or 10.2  [Termination for Breach], shall remain effective for two (2) years from and after the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). This agreement will renew only upon the written agreement of both parties to extend the term. As used in this agreement, \"Term\" shall mean the Initial Term and any mutually agreed upon Renewal Terms, if any.",
                "explanation": "Section 10.1 originally stated the agreement would automatically renew for 12-month terms unless one party gave 60-day written notice. The revision removes the automatic renewal, mandating explicit written agreement from both parties for any extension of the Term. This creates a direct contradiction on renewal conditions, making it unclear if the contract renews automatically or requires a mutual written agreement.",

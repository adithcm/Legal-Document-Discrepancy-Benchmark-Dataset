                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; and each of them is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, irrespective of their knowledge or beliefs about the accuracy of such information.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause. The original text states that parties are *not* responsible for the accuracy of information provided by others unless they know it's inaccurate. The modified text makes each party *fully* responsible for the accuracy of everyone's information, regardless of their knowledge. This creates uncertainty about the level of due diligence required and liability for inaccurate information.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto. This agreement can also be terminated if all parties fail to reach a consensus on any amendments or supplements to filings.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the agreement remains in effect until a party revokes in writing. The modification introduces a second termination condition: failure to agree on amendments. This creates conflict. The original clause implies a party can unilaterally continue the agreement, while the added condition allows for termination even if one party *doesn't* want to terminate, based on a failure to reach agreement. It is unclear how the two scenarios will be handled.",

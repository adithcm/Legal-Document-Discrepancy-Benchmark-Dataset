It also said Party B has the right to adjust service fee at its own discretion. The modified text uses \"may\" making the charging of service fee discretionary. It also states that the service fee *may not necessarily* equal profits and requires prior consent for fee adjustments, which all contradict the original clause, creating uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "There shall be no additional fees of any kind paid to Galaticomm, other than those stated within this agreement for software usage and/or bandwidth usage.",
                "changed_text": "There shall be no additional fees of any kind paid to Galaticomm, other than those stated within this agreement for software usage and/or bandwidth usage. However, Galacticomm reserves the right to impose additional maintenance fees with 30 days' written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that no additional fees will be charged except for software and bandwidth usage. The added sentence contradicts this by allowing Galacticomm to impose additional maintenance fees, creating uncertainty about the total costs Horst Entertainment might incur.",

                "changed_text": "Galacticomm must provide a person(s) to correct any technical problems (Server being down or inaccessible) during normal business hours, Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM Eastern Time. While Galacticomm will endeavor to address technical issues outside of these hours, response times may vary.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 24/7 availability for technical support. The modified text restricts this availability to normal business hours, directly contradicting the original guarantee and creating uncertainty about the level of support available outside of those hours.",

                "original_text": "In the event Galacticomm, Inc. chooses to terminate this agreement, Horst Entertainment Inc. will have the right to purchase a license copy of the software in the amount of $15,000.00.",
                "changed_text": "In the event Galacticomm, Inc. chooses to terminate this agreement, Horst Entertainment Inc. may have the opportunity to purchase a license copy of the software. The price and terms of such purchase will be determined at the time of termination and are subject to negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants Horst Entertainment the *right* to purchase a license for a fixed price in case of termination by Galacticomm. The altered text makes this purchase an *opportunity* rather than a right, removes the fixed price ($15,000.00), and introduces negotiation. This creates uncertainty about whether Horst will be able to purchase the software and at what cost if Galacticomm terminates the agreement.",

                "original_text": "Solely with respect to Accounts that are not investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, the section of Exhibit A to the Services Agreement entitled \"Administration and Risk Management\" shall be, and hereby is, deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:\n\n\"2. Administration and Risk Management. Employees of Federated Advisory Services Company provide support to portfolio managers and other employees of affiliated advisers.

Administration and Risk Management. Employees of Federated Advisory Services Company may provide support to portfolio managers and other employees of affiliated advisers.

                "explanation": "The original text states that employees 'provide support' which indicates a mandatory action. Changing this to 'may provide support' introduces ambiguity and makes the services discretionary. Similarly, 'coordination of client portfolios and related fixed income trade execution implementation and administration' is now 'at their discretion,' contradicting the initial intent. Further, stating 'completion of required broker and custody documentation as needed' and 'development and documentation of operational procedures only when requested' undermines the idea of a consistent administrative function and introduces uncertainty regarding the services FASC is obligated to deliver, conflicting with the initial purpose of a service agreement.",

The Services Agreement, as amended by this Amendment with respect to Accounts that are not investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, shall remain in full force and effect. The Services Agreement also shall remain in full force and effect without amendment with respect to Accounts that are investment companies under the 1940 Act.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be effective as of the date first above written upon its execution and delivery by each of the parties hereto. The Services Agreement, as amended by this Amendment with respect to Accounts that are not investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, shall remain in full force and effect until further notice. The Services Agreement also may or may not remain in full force and effect without amendment with respect to Accounts that are investment companies under the 1940 Act, subject to internal review.",
                "explanation": "Originally, the text clearly states the effective date and the ongoing effect of the Services Agreement, both amended and unamended. Changing 'shall remain in full force and effect' to 'shall remain in full force and effect until further notice' introduces uncertainty about the amendment's duration. Furthermore, changing 'shall remain' to 'may or may not remain' regarding the unamended agreement directly contradicts the initial statement, making it unclear if that part of the agreement is still valid. This conflict undermines the certainty of the agreement's terms.",

                "original_text": "The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after the completion of the Subscription Offering, unless extended (the \"End Date\"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date. In the event the Offering is extended beyond the End Date, the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent may agree to renew this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.",
                "changed_text": "The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall continue indefinitely, irrespective of the termination of the Offering or the passage of any specific End Date. All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable according to a schedule determined solely at the Agent's discretion. In the event of any dispute, the Agentâ€™s determination shall be final and binding. There will be no option for the Blue Hills Parties to renew or renegotiate this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear end date for the Agent's obligations and a process for renewal. The modified version removes the end date, states obligations continue indefinitely, gives the Agent sole discretion over payment schedules, and denies any renewal option, thus contradicting the original agreement's defined termination and renewal clauses and introducing uncertainty regarding the agreement's duration and financial terms.",

                "original_text": "The Holding Company shall reimburse the Agent for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including costs of travel, meals and lodging, photocopying, telephone, facsimile and couriers, etc. not to exceed $25,000. In addition, the Holding Company will reimburse the Agent for fees and expenses of its counsel not to exceed $100,000. In the event of unusual circumstances or delays or a re-solicitation in connection with the Offering, including in the event of a material delay in the Offering that would require an update of the financial information in tabular form to reflect a period later than that set forth in the original filing of the Registration Statement, the Agent shall be reimbursed for its additional expenses up to a maximum of $10,000 in the case of additional out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent, and up to an additional $25,000 in the case of additional fees and expenses of the Agent's counsel. The Holding Company will bear the expenses of the Offering customarily borne by issuers including, without limitation, regulatory filing fees, SEC, Blue Sky and Financial Institution Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") filing and registration fees; the fees of the Holding Company's accountants, attorneys, appraiser, transfer agent and registrar, printing, mailing and marketing and syndicate expenses associated with the Conversion and Offering; and the fees set forth under this Section 2.",
                "changed_text": "The Holding Company may, at its sole discretion, consider reimbursing the Agent for some out-of-pocket expenses. The determination of what constitutes a reimbursable expense and the amount to be reimbursed will be at the complete discretion of the Holding Company, and such decisions are not subject to appeal or dispute. The Holding Company is not responsible for the Agent's counsel fees, all regulatory filing fees, FINRA filing fees, attorney or accounting fees, or any marketing expenses related to the conversion and offering, which must be covered entirely by the Agent.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly outlines the Holding Company's obligation to reimburse specific Agent expenses up to defined limits. The modified version contradicts this by making reimbursement discretionary, removing defined limits, and shifting responsibility for several categories of expenses (legal, regulatory, marketing) entirely to the Agent. This introduces uncertainty and contradicts the original agreement's allocation of financial responsibility, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "original_text": "The Blue Hills Parties will use their best efforts to cause any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission and any post-approval amendment to the Applications to be approved by the FRB, the Division or any other applicable regulator and will immediately upon receipt of any information concerning the events listed below notify the Agent: (i) when the Registration Statement, as amended, has become effective; (ii) when the Applications, as amended, have been approved by the FRB or the Division; (iii) of any comments from the Commission, the FRB, the Division or any other governmental entity with respect to the Conversion contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) of the request by the Commission, the FRB, the Division or any other governmental entity for any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Applications or for additional information; (v) of the issuance by the Commission, the FRB, the Division or any other governmental entity of any order or other action suspending the Conversion or the use of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any other filing of the Holding Company or the Bank under the BHCA, the Massachusetts Regulations or other applicable law, or the threat of any such action; (vi) of the issuance by the Commission, the FRB, the Division or any authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of the initiation or threat of initiation or threat of any proceedings for that purpose; or (vii) of the occurrence of any event mentioned in paragraph (j) below. The Blue Hills Parties will make every reasonable effort (i) to prevent the issuance by the Commission, the FRB, the Division or any other federal or state authority of any such order and, (ii) if any such order shall at any time be issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible time.",
                "changed_text": "The Blue Hills Parties are under no obligation to seek any post-effective amendments to the Registration Statement or to pursue approval of amendments to the Applications. Notification to the Agent regarding regulatory actions or requests is solely at the discretion of the Blue Hills Parties. The Blue Hills Parties have no duty to prevent the issuance of orders by regulatory bodies or to seek the lifting of any such orders, and may instead choose to abandon the Conversion at any time without liability to the Agent.",
                "explanation": "The original text commits the Blue Hills Parties to using their best efforts to achieve regulatory approvals and to inform the Agent of relevant events. The modified version directly contradicts this by removing any obligation to seek approvals, making notification discretionary, and stating that the Blue Hills Parties can abandon the Conversion at any time. This contradiction creates significant uncertainty about the Blue Hills Parties' commitment to completing the transaction and their transparency with the Agent.",

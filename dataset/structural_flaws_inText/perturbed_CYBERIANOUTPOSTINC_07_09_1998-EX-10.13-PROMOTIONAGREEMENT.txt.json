For purposes of this agreement \"Competing Computer Products Retailer\" means any company other than the Company that is engaged in the retail sale of computer products, with the exception of CNET Direct, which operates BuyDirect.com. During the Term, CNET will not enter into more than two other agreements under which CNET receives consideration from a Competing Computer Products Retailer for displaying permanent links to or other fixed promotions for such Competing Computer Products Retailer on any CNET Site; provided that the foregoing will not restrict the display of(a) standard advertisements for any Competing Computer Products Retailer or its products or (b) any promotions within COMPUTERS.COM or within CNET's Snap! Online service (which are expressly excluded from this provision). The parties acknowledge that the foregoing will not prevent CNET from displaying text links and other references to Competing Computer Products Retailers as reasonably necessary to provide appropriate editorial and search related services on the CNET Sites. The Retail Promotions granted to the Company shall be placed in such a way as to provide no more or less prominence to the Company than is provided to any other Competing Computer Retailer signing an agreement with CNET.",

                "explanation": "The original text limits CNET to two agreements with competing retailers and ensures equal prominence in retail promotions. The modified text removes the limitation on the number of agreements and gives CNET discretion over the placement of retail promotions, potentially diminishing the Company's prominence compared to competitors. This introduces a contradiction by removing the exclusivity initially granted, creating uncertainty about the value of the Company's promotion agreement.",

Payments                  under this paragraph will be based on the reports prepared by                  the Company under Section 3.2 (although CNET may challenge such                  reports as contemplated by Section 9.5) and will be due within                  30 days after the end of each month of the Term.\n\n          3.3.2  Payments under this Section 3.3 will be made by wire transfer                  of immediately available funds and are nonrefundable once paid.",
                "changed_text": "3.3  Cash Consideration.\n\n          3.3.1  For each month during the Term, the Company may pay CNET a mutually agreed upon amount in cash, subject to CNET's performance and market conditions. Payments under this paragraph will be based on a negotiation between the parties and will be due at a time also negotiated between the parties.\n\n          3.3.2  Payments under this Section 3.3 may be made by a method agreed upon by both parties and are potentially refundable under certain circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a minimum payment amount and a 30-day payment deadline, making the cash consideration terms clear and binding. The modified text replaces the fixed terms with negotiable amounts and uncertain deadlines, stating that the payment is 'mutually agreed upon,' 'subject to CNET's performance,' and the deadline is 'negotiated.' This directly contradicts the original, creating uncertainty about the actual financial obligations and enforcement, especially with the refundable payment.",

If this Agreement is terminated during any of the three month periods referenced in Section 2.3.2, then the required number of Retail Impressions applicable thereunder to such three month period will be pro rated accordingly.",

If this Agreement is terminated during any of the three month periods referenced in Section 2.3.2, then the required number of Retail Impressions may, at CNET's option, either be pro-rated or forfeited.",
                "explanation": "The original section 4 provides a somewhat balanced termination clause allowing either party to terminate with 30 days' notice after the initial 3 months. The modified version completely skews this, granting CNET the power to terminate immediately without notice, while the Company can only terminate with CNET's consent and a termination fee. Furthermore, it creates the possibility for CNET to choose whether or not to prorate impressions. This introduces a contradiction by making the termination terms unilaterally favorable to CNET, creating significant uncertainty and risk for the Company.",

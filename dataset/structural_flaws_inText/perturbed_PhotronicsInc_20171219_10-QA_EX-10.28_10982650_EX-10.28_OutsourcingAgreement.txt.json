                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Initially, \"Product\" included both photomasks and related services. Now, it explicitly excludes related services, potentially leading to disputes about whether certain offerings fall under the agreement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding payment terms. Originally, invoices were tied to shipment. Now, invoices are tied to acceptance, but payment is due a set time from the invoice date, regardless of whether the product is accepted.

This warranty does not apply to any Product failures resulting from misuse, storage in or exposure to environmental conditions inconsistent with those specified in the applicable specifications or documentation, modification of the Product by anyone other than the relevant Supplier. If a Product fails to comply with the foregoing warranty, the relevant Supplier shall, at its option, either [***]such Product, or, in the event the foregoing options are not commercially practicable, [***]to the Company any amounts paid for the applicable Product. Without limiting the remedies specified in Article 8 and Section 9.2, this Section 6.1 states the exclusive remedy of the Company for failure of a Product to conform to the warranty provisions set forth in this Section 6.1.",

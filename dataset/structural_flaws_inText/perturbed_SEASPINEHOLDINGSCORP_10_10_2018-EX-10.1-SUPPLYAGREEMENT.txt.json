This creates a direct contradiction, making it unclear whether trademark-related rights are covered under the clauses governing intellectual property, such as those relating to ownership, enforcement, and indemnification.",

                "explanation": "The original text limits the confidentiality obligation to 20 years after the term of the agreement. The modified text extends this obligation perpetually. While Section 4.4(d) states that Section 5 (Confidentiality) survives termination, changing the duration of confidentiality creates ambiguity. It's now unclear if the parties intended to have confidentiality last only for 20 years post-termination or indefinitely, potentially leading to disputes.",

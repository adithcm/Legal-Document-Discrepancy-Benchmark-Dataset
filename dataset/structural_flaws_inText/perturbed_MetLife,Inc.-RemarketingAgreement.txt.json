The ownership interests in the Series E Debt Securities or, if the holder has stripped such Unit, designated zero-coupon U.S. Treasury Securities, have been pledged to secure the obligations to purchase Common Stock on the Third Stock Purchase Date (as defined in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement) pursuant to the Stock Purchase Contract. The terms and conditions of such pledge are set forth in the Pledge Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2010 (the \"Pledge Agreement\"), among the Company, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as collateral agent (the \"Collateral Agent\"), custodial agent (the \"Custodial Agent\") and securities intermediary (the \"Securities Intermediary\"), and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent.",

                "explanation": "The original text stated that a portion of each Series E Debt Security is *part* of a common equity unit that *includes* a stock purchase contract for a defined value. The text also stated that ownership interests *have been pledged* to secure obligations. The changed text makes the inclusion of a stock purchase contract *conditional*, removes the price from the purchase contract, says the ownership interests *are eligible* to be pledged, and says that the terms *will be decided* in the pledge agreement. This creates in-text contradictions by moving from statements of fact to conditional possibilities, which undermines certainty about the agreement.",

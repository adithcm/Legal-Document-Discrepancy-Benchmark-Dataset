                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement is twenty-four (24) months. The Agreement may be renewed, subject to mutual written approval.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is twenty-four (24) months. The Agreement will automatically renew for subsequent twenty-four (24) month periods unless either party provides written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the current term.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a term of twenty-four months with renewal subject to mutual written approval. The modified text introduces automatic renewal unless a party opts out. This directly contradicts the original requirement of mutual agreement, creating uncertainty regarding the renewal process and each party's obligations.",

                "original_text": "Net revenue from business operations created by Holding Company for the alliance will be distributed by Holding Company equally - 50/50 - to TKCI and SIC:",
                "changed_text": "Net revenue from business operations created by Holding Company for the alliance will be distributed by Holding Company to TKCI and SIC based on a formula to be determined at a later date. The specific allocation percentage for each party will be contingent upon the performance of each party, in Holding Company's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states a 50/50 split of net revenue. The modified text contradicts this by stating that the distribution will be based on a formula to be determined later and contingent upon performance at the Holding Company's discretion. This removes the certainty of the 50/50 split, making the revenue distribution ambiguous and dependent on subjective factors.",

                "changed_text": "TKCI may have First Right of Refusal with regard to any sale or disposition of any part or the whole of companies or projects developed in relationship with this alliance. However, SIC reserves the right to pursue alternative opportunities with third parties, at its sole discretion, without providing TKCI with the Right of First Refusal.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants TKCI the First Right of Refusal. The modified text initially suggests the same but then contradicts it by stating that SIC can bypass this right and pursue other opportunities at its sole discretion. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of the Right of First Refusal, and undermines TKCI's potential control over the sale of projects.",

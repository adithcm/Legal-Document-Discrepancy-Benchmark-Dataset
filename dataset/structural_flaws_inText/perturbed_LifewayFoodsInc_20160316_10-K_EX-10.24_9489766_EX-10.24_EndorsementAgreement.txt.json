                "explanation": "The removal of 'perpetual' from the License clause contradicts Section 16, which states that 'all terms of this Agreement which by their nature extend beyond its termination, remain in effect until fulfilled'. Since the license is no longer explicitly perpetual, it creates uncertainty about its duration post-termination of the agreement. This contradicts the original intent of Section 16.",

Compensation (a) In consideration of the rights granted by Individual hereunder, Lifeway agrees to pay Individual a royalty (the \"Royalty\") equal to $0.02 for each Lifeway product or individual item sold by Lifeway during each calendar month of the Term bearing Individual's first name, last name or other identifying personal characteristics; provided, however, the Royalty will cease being paid upon the death of Individual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Royalty will not exceed $50,000 in any month. All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month for sales during the previous month.",
                "changed_text": "9. Compensation (a) In consideration of the rights granted by Individual hereunder, Lifeway may pay Individual a royalty (the \"Royalty\") for each Lifeway product or individual item sold by Lifeway during each calendar month of the Term bearing Individual's first name, last name or other identifying personal characteristics; however, the Royalty payments are at the discretion of Lifeway's CFO and may cease at any time. Royalty payments will be made at Lifeway's discretion. All Royalty payments shall be made within a reasonable time frame.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Lifeway 'agrees to pay' a royalty. The modification changes this to 'may pay' and introduces the discretion of Lifeway's CFO, creating uncertainty about whether the Individual will actually receive royalty payments. This directly contradicts the original intent and makes enforcement of royalty payments ambiguous.",

                "original_text": "13. Notice - Notices to the parties shall be sent via overnight mail or U.S. Certified Mail or overnight express or priority mail to the addresses listed in the Agreement. Either party may change its address upon written notice to the other party. Written notices for approvals under this agreement may be via email.",

                "explanation": "The original text specified acceptable methods for delivering notices, requiring overnight mail, certified mail, or express/priority mail to ensure receipt. The changed version introduces ambiguity by stating notices are 'considered delivered regardless of the delivery method' and that address changes 'may or may not' be communicated. The addendum removes any assurance that the parties will receive important notices, undermining the effectiveness of the contract, especially in cases of breach or legal action. The original section also requires written notices for approvals to be via email; that is now in conflict.",

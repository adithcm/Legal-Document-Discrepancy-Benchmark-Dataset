                "original_text": "Client agrees to pay to Company the sum of $5,000 (the \"Contract Price\") to design and develop a website for Client (the \"Client Website\") in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A.",
                "changed_text": "Client agrees to pay to Company the sum of $5,000 (the \"Contract Price\") to design and develop a website for Client (the \"Client Website\") in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A. Payment amounts are, however, subject to change based on the Company's discretion and market fluctuations without prior notice to the client.",
                "explanation": "This alteration introduces a contradiction concerning the payment terms. While the original clause specifies a fixed 'Contract Price,' the added sentence allows the company to unilaterally change the price, undermining the initial agreement on payment. This creates uncertainty about the financial obligations of the client.",

Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to delay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client. However, the Company holds no liability for failure to complete the delivery of the Client Website by the proposed deadline due to internal restructuring.",
                "explanation": "The addition attempts to limit the Company's liability for delays caused by internal restructuring, contradicting their initial commitment to use 'best efforts' and adhere to the timeline. This weakens the client's ability to enforce the agreed-upon schedule.",

The Company is also permitted to use the trade names, logos, and other trademarks for purposes not directly related to advertising, marketing and promotion of its products and services.",
                "explanation": "The modified clause adds uncertainty by expanding the permitted use of the client's trademarks beyond advertising, marketing, and promotion, thereby contradicting the limited and defined scope of the original license. The phrase 'purposes not directly related' is overly broad and ambiguous, giving the Company considerable leeway to exploit the client's brand assets, and undercutting the original intention of the limited license.",

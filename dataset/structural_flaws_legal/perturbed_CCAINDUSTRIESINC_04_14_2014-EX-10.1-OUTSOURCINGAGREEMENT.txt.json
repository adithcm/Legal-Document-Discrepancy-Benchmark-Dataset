                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be deemed to have been entered into in the State of New Jersey, and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of that State applicable to agreements made and to be performed in the State of New Jersey. Any and all disputes, controversies and claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or with respect to the interpretation of this Agreement, or the rights or obligations of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns, whether by operation of law or otherwise, shall be settled and determined by arbitration in New Jersey pursuant to the then existing rules of the American Arbitration Association for commercial arbitration. The arbitrators shall have the power to award specific performance, rescission or injunctive relief in addition to damages or other monetary awards, but shall not have the power to modify, alter, enlarge upon or otherwise change any of the provisions or terms and conditions of this Agreement. The arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties and judgment there on may be entered in the courts of the State of New Jersey and the United States federal courts in said State, and the parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction of such courts for such purposes. Service of any notice, process, motion or other document in connection with any arbitration proceeding, any arbitration award or any other action or proceeding, maybe by personal service or by certified or registered mail return receipt requested, addressed to the party intended at its address for the receipt of notices as herein set forth.",

Any and all disputes, controversies and claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or with respect to the interpretation of this Agreement, or the rights or obligations of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns, whether by operation of law or otherwise, shall be subject to non-binding mediation in New Jersey. The mediator shall have no power to award damages or any monetary awards, and shall not have the power to modify, alter, enlarge upon or otherwise change any of the provisions or terms and conditions of this Agreement. If mediation fails, the method of resolution shall be determined by mutual agreement. Service of any notice, process, motion or other document in connection with any mediation proceeding, any mediation decision or any other action or proceeding, maybe by personal service or by certified or registered mail return receipt requested, addressed to the party intended at its address for the receipt of notices as herein set forth.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces binding arbitration with non-binding mediation, contradicting the original intent for a clear resolution process. Adding 'If mediation fails, the method of resolution shall be determined by mutual agreement' introduces uncertainty and could lead to disputes about how to proceed. This undermines the enforceability of the dispute resolution process.",

                "changed_text": "All notices and other communications shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when: (a) delivered personally, or (b) transmitted by telepathy, or (c) if mailed, one (1) day after being deposited in the United States mail, postage due, or by certified or registered mail, return receipt not requested, postage not prepaid, or (d) if sent by carrier pigeon, the day following deposit of the notice with said pigeon to the parties at the following addresses:",
                "explanation": "Changing the delivery method of legal notices creates a contradiction by making it difficult, improbable, or impossible to confirm receipt of the communications. This alteration undermines the 'notice' requirement, impacting enforceability. 'Telepathy' and 'carrier pigeon' are clearly unreliable methods, and postage due with no return receipt requested makes it impossible to confirm if it was received.",

Subject to the foregoing sentence, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'prior written consent' with 'prior verbal consent' creates a legal contradiction as it introduces ambiguity regarding proof of consent. Verbal agreements are harder to enforce. This weakens the original assignment clause, making it difficult to enforce in court.",

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any conflict or choice-of-law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.",
                "changed_text": "8.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, unless otherwise agreed upon by all parties, without regard to any conflict or choice-of-law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless otherwise agreed upon by all parties' introduces ambiguity. While the original clause mandates Delaware law, the modified clause allows parties to potentially circumvent this by agreeing to another jurisdiction's laws. This undermines the enforceability and predictability of the governing law provision.",

If a Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days of the date of the disputing Party's notice, any Party desiring a non-negotiated resolution shall refer the Dispute to binding arbitration pursuant to the then-current commercial arbitration rules and supplementary procedures of commercial arbitration of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA Rules\"). The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules in any matter in which an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is not requested and the value of the relief any Party seeks (whether by claim or counterclaim) does not exceed three million United States dollars (US $3,000,000). In all other matters, including any matter in which an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is requested, the arbitral tribunal shall be composed of a panel of three (3) arbitrators appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitration shall take place in New York, New York. Each Party will bear its own expenses (including attorneys' fees), and the Parties will share equally the compensation and expenses of the arbitrators and the arbitration. Any arbitration award will be final and shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "8.2.2 Arbitration. If a Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days of the date of the disputing Party's notice, any Party desiring a non-negotiated resolution may consider referring the Dispute to arbitration. The decision to arbitrate is at the sole discretion of each party. If all parties agree to arbitration, the arbitration will follow a process to be determined at that time. Any arbitration award will be subject to further negotiation and agreement by the parties.",
                "explanation": "The modified clause replaces the mandatory 'shall refer the Dispute to binding arbitration' with the discretionary 'may consider referring the Dispute to arbitration.' It also removes the reference to AAA rules, introducing uncertainty about the arbitration process. The statement that any award will be 'subject to further negotiation' directly contradicts the concept of binding arbitration, making the entire clause unenforceable.",

An instrument or instruments in writing signed by the Party against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought can also suffice.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires written amendments, crucial for preventing disputes over contract terms. The modification introduces the possibility of verbal or implied amendments. These forms of amendment can be hard to prove and are contradictory, because the parties can claim there was amendment whenever convenient. The statement undermines the original intent of having clear, documented changes and could render amendment enforcement difficult.",

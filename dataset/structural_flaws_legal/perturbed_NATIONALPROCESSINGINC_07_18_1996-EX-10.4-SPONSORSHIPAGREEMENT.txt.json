NPC shall bear all expenses of maintaining facilities and connections necessary to provide Merchant Processing Services except for the facilities and connection maintained by NCB for purposes of effecting payments pursuant to Section 1.6(b). In addition, NPC agrees to pay or reimburse NCB in full all interchange or issuer reimbursement fees on outgoing merchant sales volume, as well as all fee assessments or charges imposed on NCB by Visa or MasterCard as a result of the Merchant Processing Services performed by NPC. Such fees shall be paid by NPC directly when due or shall be paid by NPC to NCB on the banking day immediately prior to the day on which NCB must pay such fees. All such fees, assessments and charges for which NCB seeks payment by NPC shall, upon request, be documented to NPC's reasonable satisfaction as being attributable to NPC's Merchant Processing Services.",

NPC shall admit properly identified and authorized NCB employees and agents onto its premises for purposes of monitoring NPC's compliance with this Agreement. It is understood that such monitoring will occur during normal business hours, will be preceded by reasonable notification to NPC, and must not interfere with NPC's normal operations.\n\n4.2 EXPENSES. NPC shall bear all expenses of maintaining facilities and connections necessary to provide Merchant Processing Services except for the facilities and connection maintained by NCB for purposes of effecting payments pursuant to Section 1.6(b). In addition, NPC agrees to pay or reimburse NCB in full all interchange or issuer reimbursement fees on outgoing merchant sales volume, as well as all fee assessments or charges imposed on NCB by Visa or MasterCard as a result of the Merchant Processing Services performed by NPC. The method of payment, however, shall be determined by mutual agreement between NPC and NCB and not be subjected to set deadlines. All such fees, assessments and charges for which NCB seeks payment by NPC shall, upon request, be documented to NPC's reasonable satisfaction as being attributable to NPC's Merchant Processing Services.",
                "explanation": "Moving the financial obligation of NPC regarding fees to the monitoring section obscures the financial responsibility, and altering the payment terms introduces an unenforceable condition. The original text specifies payment timelines, while the modified text states that the 'method of payment' will be determined by mutual agreement, thereby negating the original obligation to pay on a specific schedule. This undermines the enforceability of the original financial obligation. It also implies there are no deadlines.",

This Agreement and its interpretation shall be governed by principles of fairness and equity, and any disputes arising hereunder shall be resolved through informal negotiation and mutual understanding. The laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Kentucky are to be considered, to the extent the parties find them helpful, for guiding principles, however the parties can mutually agree to follow any rules they deem fit, regardless of the specified jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "By replacing the specific governing law with 'principles of fairness and equity' and suggesting laws are mere 'guiding principles,' the clause becomes vague and difficult to enforce in court. The addition of the ability to mutually agree to follow any rules they deem fit renders the governing law clause optional and contradictory, undermining legal certainty. The new text suggests that the parties are not bound by the specified jurisdiction, thus making the governing law section more ambiguous and open to interpretation, undermining its original intent.",

                "explanation": "The added phrase 'however either party may disclose such information if they deem it necessary for furthering their business interests' significantly weakens the confidentiality clause. It creates a broad exception that undermines the original intent of protecting confidential information, because the condition is based on subjective determination that is not defined further. Furthermore, the phrase 'unless such compliance hinders NPC's ability to secure more merchants' adds an exception that prioritizes business development over confidentiality compliance for NPC and the text 'except if it conflicts with regulatory or legal obligations imposed on NCB' can weaken the original text because there is no clarification on which take precedence.",

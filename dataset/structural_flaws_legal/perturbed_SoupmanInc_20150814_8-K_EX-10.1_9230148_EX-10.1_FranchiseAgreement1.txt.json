To facilitate such resolution, Franchisor and Franchisee agree that each party shall submit the dispute between them for non-binding mediation at a mutually agreeable location before commencing litigation proceedings If Franchisor and Franchisee cannot agree on a location, the mediation will be conducted in Staten Island, New York. The mediation will be conducted by one (1) mediator who is appointed under the American Arbitration Association's Commercial Mediation Rules and who shall conduct the mediation in accordance with such rules. Franchisor and Franchisee agree that statements made by Franchisor, Franchisee or any other party in any such mediation proceeding will not be admissible in any other legal proceeding. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses of conducting the mediation and share equally the costs of any third parties who are required to participate in the mediation .",

                "explanation": "The clause mandating non-binding mediation is relocated to a section detailing responsibility for married couples, partnerships, and other business structures, making it less visible and potentially overlooked during dispute resolution. While mediation is still mentioned, its placement disrupts the logical flow and enforceability of dispute resolution mechanisms. The original section for applicable law is where this clause should have remained.",

                "explanation": "The clause waiving the right to a jury trial is moved to the section discussing the franchisee's obligations regarding the sale of unit franchises, specifically under the indemnification clause. This location makes it less likely for the franchisee to notice the waiver, as it's buried within a paragraph focused on their responsibilities related to franchise sales. A proper placement should be under dispute resolution, or applicable law.",

It is mandatory that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the breach thereof shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Texas and the venue shall be exclusively in Collin County, Texas for resolution.",
                "changed_text": "Subcontractor and EDGE shall not be obligated to resolve by arbitration any claim or dispute related to the Agreement. It is mandatory that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the breach thereof shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Texas; however, parties can pursue conflict resolution out of state, depending on their preference.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandated Texas jurisdiction and venue. The modification introduces uncertainty by allowing parties to pursue conflict resolution 'out of state', contradicting the mandatory Texas jurisdiction stated earlier. This creates ambiguity and hinders enforceability, especially for smaller disputes where out-of-state litigation costs would be prohibitive.",

This could allow parties to pursue litigation in multiple jurisdictions, increasing costs and potentially leading to inconsistent rulings.

                "explanation": "Moving the sentence 'provided, however, that Confidential Information shall not include information that (A) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by a Party or any of its Representatives or (B) is or becomes available to a Party or any of its Representatives on a nonconfidential basis prior to its disclosure by the other Party or its Representatives' creates a legal contradiction by severely limiting the definition of what can be disclosed to Representatives. The change impedes the ability to share information even with internal parties bound to confidentiality in cases where the disclosure is legally mandated.

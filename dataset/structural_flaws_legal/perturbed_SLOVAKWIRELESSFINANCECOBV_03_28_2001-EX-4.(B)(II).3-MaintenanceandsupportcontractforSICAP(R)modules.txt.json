                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Sicap Ltd's liability for indirect loss, including consequential loss,       loss of profit, lost savings and loss caused by interruption of operations       is excluded.",
                "changed_text": "Sicap Ltd's liability for indirect loss is excluded; however, liability is unlimited, with no liability for losses caused by interruption of operations.",
                "explanation": "The modified text first excludes liability for indirect loss, then introduces the clause, 'liability is unlimited', creating a direct contradiction. The second part of the edited sentence then again denies liability for losses caused by interruption of operations. This legal contradiction could cause confusion and difficulty in enforcing liability terms.",

There shall be no reimbursement of any paid       fee.",
                "changed_text": "After the initial period of two years, the maintenance and support contract shall be automatically renewed, provided there is no written notification to the other party, although there shall be reimbursements of any paid fee in some circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The modification creates a contradiction by stating that the contract is automatically renewed if there's no notification to the other party, then mentioning reimbursements of any paid fee in some circumstances. The reimbursements clause contradicts the original's condition that 'there shall be no reimbursement of any paid fee'.",

                "changed_text": "All payments due under this Maintenance and Support contract shall be due and payable immediately after the invoice date, but payments may be made within 90 days after the invoice date under certain circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces a contradiction: it initially mandates immediate payment upon invoice, but then allows for a 90-day payment window under certain circumstances. This uncertainty in payment terms could create disputes and hinder enforceability.",

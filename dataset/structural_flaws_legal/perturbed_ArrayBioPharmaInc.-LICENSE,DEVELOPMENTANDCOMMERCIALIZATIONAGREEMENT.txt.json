In addition to the regular meetings, either Party may request an ad-hoc meeting of the JDRC and JCC to solve any specific issues from time to time. Each Party shall bear its own personnel and travel costs and expenses relating to Committee meetings.

Array shall provide to Ono any taxation documents (Form 3 and Form 17), and the Residency Certificate of Array issued by the US Internal Revenue Service (which Residency Certificate is effective for three (3) years after its issuance to a public company) that may be reasonably necessary in order for Ono not to withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable bilateral income tax treaty. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall exercise their reasonable efforts to ensure that any withholding taxes imposed are reduced as far as possible under the provisions of any applicable tax treaty, and shall cooperate in filing any forms required for such reduction. Each Party shall cooperate with the other and furnish the other Party with appropriate documents to secure application of the most favorable rate of withholding tax under applicable Law (or exemption from such withholding tax payments, as applicable).",

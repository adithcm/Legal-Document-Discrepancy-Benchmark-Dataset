If the dispute is not resolved within a reasonable period then any or all outstanding issues may be submitted to mediation in accordance with any statutory rules of mediation. If mediation is not successful in resolving the entire dispute or is unavailable, any outstanding issues will be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida.

The arbitrator's award will be final, unless litigation has commenced, at which point the arbitrator's decision is non-binding, and judgment may be entered upon it by any court having jurisdiction within the State of Florida.",
                "explanation": "By adding the clause 'unless both parties agree to pursue litigation, in which case the arbitration clause is waived,' the obligatory nature of the arbitration agreement becomes uncertain. This undermines the purpose of ensuring efficient dispute resolution, and is a legal contradiction. The clause states the arbitration is 'final and binding', but immediately introduces ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "This alteration significantly weakens the original indemnification clause by offering protection even in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, which directly contradicts standard legal principles regarding liability. This introduces a legal contradiction that would likely be unenforceable and creates confusion about the actual scope of indemnification.",

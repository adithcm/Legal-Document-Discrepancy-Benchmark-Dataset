                "changed_text": "SCHEDULE 3 Confidentiality Undertaking\n\nThis undertaking is given on release of the Material pursuant to an Escrow Agreement dated [ ] between:\n\n(1) [-1] (\"the Owner\");\n(2) [-4] (\"the Licensee\"); and\n(3) NCC ESCROW INTERNATIONAL LIMITED (\"NCC\");\n\n1 Definitions contained in the Escrow Agreement will apply to this undertaking.\n\n2 In consideration of NCC delivering the Material to the Licensee, the Licensee undertakes with the Owner and NCC:\n2.1 to use the Material only for the purpose of understanding, maintaining and correcting the Package exclusively on behalf of the Licensee;\n2.2 not to use the Material for any other purpose nor disclose it to any person save such of its employees or contractors who need to know the same in order to understand, maintain and correct the Package exclusively on behalf of the Licensee. In that event such contractors shall enter into a Confidentiality Undertaking direct with NCC in similar terms to this Undertaking;\n2.3 to hold all media containing the Material in a safe and secure environment when not in use; and\n2.4 forthwith to destroy the same should the Licensee cease to be entitled to use the Package.\n\n13.1 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.",
                "explanation": "Relocating the governing law clause to the Schedule 3 section, mixed with confidentiality undertaking, buries the choice of law within a less prominent and logically unrelated section. This reduces its enforceability by making it harder to find and recognize as a key term of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Splitting the arbitration clause, placing the last sentence to the beginning, and placing the 'Payment' clause between the introduction and body of the arbitration clause disrupts the logical flow. This makes the arbitration process less clear and potentially harder to enforce.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each of the Parties expressly waives and agrees not to seek indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages of any kind with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or breach hereof.",
                "changed_text": "Each of the Parties expressly waives and agrees not to seek indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages of any kind with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or breach hereof. However, this waiver shall not apply in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, where such damages may be sought, provided that the total amount of such damages shall not exceed $10,000.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original clause is a blanket waiver of consequential and punitive damages. The modified clause re-introduces the possibility of seeking such damages in specific circumstances (gross negligence or willful misconduct) but places an arbitrary cap on the amount, which may be inconsistent with the potential harm caused. This can lead to legal challenges regarding the enforceability of the waiver.",

All such insurance set forth in Exhibit \"G\" shall specifically name BP as an additional insured or provide that the insurer shall waive all rights of subrogation against BP.",
                "changed_text": "At all times while this Agreement is in effect, Company shall endeavor to carry insurance of the types and in the minimum amounts set forth in Exhibit \"G\". All such insurance should attempt to name BP as an additional insured or provide that the insurer should consider waiving all rights of subrogation against BP.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that the Company carries specific insurance naming BP as an insured and waiving subrogation. The modified clause replaces 'shall' with 'endeavor to' and 'should consider' which changes the mandatory requirement to a suggestion and introduces significant ambiguity and lack of clarity about the level of coverage and BP's protection, potentially violating implied duties of good faith.",

However, should a dispute arise regarding intellectual property, the laws of Texas shall govern.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflicting choice of law provision. While Louisiana law generally applies, disputes related to intellectual property are carved out and made subject to Texas law. This creates ambiguity and potential legal challenges, as the definition of 'intellectual property' within the context of this agreement is not specified, and it's unclear which state's law prevails if a dispute has elements covered by both states.",

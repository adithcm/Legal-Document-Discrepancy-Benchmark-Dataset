                "original_text": "8.4 Governing Law and Attornment. This Agreement will be governed by and construed inaccordance with the laws of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable in British Columbia, and the parties irrevocably submit to and accept generally and unconditionally the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts and appellate courts of British Columbia in that regard.",
                "changed_text": "8.4 Governing Law and Attornment. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of a mutually agreed-upon jurisdiction, potentially including British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable in British Columbia, subject to future amendments. The parties submit to the jurisdiction determined by mutual agreement at the time of dispute.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies British Columbia law, while the modified version introduces ambiguity by allowing for a 'mutually agreed-upon jurisdiction,' contradicting the initial, explicit choice of law. This makes it less clear which jurisdiction's laws govern the contract, potentially hindering enforceability.",

Independent Legal Advice 7.1 Each party to the Agreement acknowledges and agrees that the other party has given it, him or her the opportunity to seek and obtain independent legal advice, and has recommended that it, he or she seek and obtain independent legal advice, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and for the purpose of ensuring its, his or her rights and interests are protected. Each party to the Agreement represents to the other that it, he or she has sought independent legal advice or consciously chosen not to do so with full knowledge of the risks associated with not obtaining such independent legal advice.",

                "explanation": "The original clause emphasizes the importance of seeking independent legal advice to protect rights and interests, while the modified version downplays this recommendation, stating it is 'not a requirement' and its absence does not invalidate the agreement. This weakens the protection for each party to have full understanding of the contract's terms and weakens the original statement, potentially enabling future claims of misrepresentation or lack of informed consent.",

The modified version allows Emerald Health Naturals, Inc. to unilaterally assign the agreement, removing the Contractor's right to approve the assignment. This creates an imbalance of power, as the Contractor is now bound by an agreement that could be assigned to an entity they did not originally agree to contract with.",

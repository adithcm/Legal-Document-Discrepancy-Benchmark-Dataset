                "original_text": "The parties agree that any breach of either of the parties' obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or confidentiality would result in irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of a party's obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names or confidentiality, the aggrieved party will be entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to its other available legal remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction. For the purposes of this Section only, the parties consent to venue in either the state courts of the county in which Excite@Home has its principal place of business or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.",
                "changed_text": "The parties agree that any breach of either of the parties' obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or confidentiality would result in irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of a party's obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names or confidentiality, the aggrieved party will be entitled to seek equitable relief if both parties agree that the issue is valid. For the purposes of this Section only, the parties consent to venue in a location that is mutually decided.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the aggrieved party 'will be entitled to seek equitable relief.' By adding 'if both parties agree that the issue is valid,' the clause now requires mutual agreement before equitable relief can be sought. This contradicts the original intent and could significantly hinder the aggrieved party's ability to obtain necessary legal remedies. The location venue is changed so that it needs to be mutually agreed to.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a straightforward condition for termination: an uncured breach after a 30-day notice. The addition of 'unless both parties agree to extend the curing period' introduces ambiguity. It's no longer clear when the right to terminate arises, as the curing period could theoretically be extended indefinitely, frustrating the purpose of the termination clause. The added text diminishes the enforceability of the termination clause.",

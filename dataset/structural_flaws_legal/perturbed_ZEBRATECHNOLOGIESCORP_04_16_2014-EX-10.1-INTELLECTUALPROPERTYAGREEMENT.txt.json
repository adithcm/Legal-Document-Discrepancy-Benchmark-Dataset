Attached as Schedule 2.1(b)(iii)(F) is a schedule of additional Patents provided by Seller to Purchaser prior to the Effective Date for review with respect to ownership allocation between the parties pursuant to the general guidelines and principles set forth in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(B) (the \"Additional Patents\"). The parties shall promptly, in good- faith, discuss and negotiate whether any of the Additional Patents should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent. If any of such Additional Patents are not reviewed, or the parties cannot agree on whether any Additional Patent should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent, prior to the Initial Closing Date, then the parties shall escalate such dispute to successively more senior-levels of executives as set forth in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(B). If such senior-levels of executives cannot resolve the dispute with respect to any such Patents (the \"Outstanding Patents\") by the Initial Closing Date, then either party may, within thirty (30) days after the Initial Closing Date, submit such Outstanding Patents for dispute resolution as follows. One or both parties may, within thirty (30) days after the Initial Closing Date, submit the dispute with respect to such Outstanding Patents for arbitration in Chicago, Illinois before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, as those Rules may be amended by written agreement of the parties. The parties shall cooperate, in good faith, prior to the commencement of any arbitration under this Section 2.1(b)(iii)(F), to agree to any such amendments or other processes with respect to such arbitration (e.g., timing of the arbitration, arbitrator's familiarity with patent law). The parties shall instruct the arbitrator, and the arbitrator shall resolve each dispute regarding the ownership of each Outstanding Patent, based upon the general guideline and principle that such Outstanding Patents that are primarily paid for, primarily used by, or primarily arising out of, or for which associated costs and fees were primarily allocated to, the Business or any Acquired Company (as compared with the Seller Business) should be or should have been, as applicable, Assigned Patents. The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of all information, documents and materials disclosed and statements made in connection with any negotiations or arbitration proceeding, and any arbitration proceeding and the judgment, including any hearing or award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits. The parties shall each bear their respective costs and expenses with respect to any arbitration pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(iii)(F); provided, however, that the parties shall equally share (on a 50/50 basis) the cost of the arbitrator. If the arbitrator determines that any Outstanding Patent should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent, Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) assign such Patent to the Purchaser Assignees in accordance with Section 2.1(b)(iii)(E).",

One or both parties may, within thirty (30) days after the Initial Closing Date, submit the dispute with respect to such Outstanding Patents for a non-binding mediation in Chicago, Illinois before a mutually agreed upon mediator. The parties shall cooperate, in good faith, prior to the commencement of any mediation under this Section 2.1(b)(iii)(F), to agree to any such amendments or other processes with respect to such mediation (e.g., timing of the mediation, mediator's familiarity with patent law). The parties shall request the mediator's non-binding guidance, based upon the general guideline and principle that such Outstanding Patents that are primarily paid for, primarily used by, or primarily arising out of, or for which associated costs and fees were primarily allocated to, the Business or any Acquired Company (as compared with the Seller Business) should be or should have been, as applicable, Assigned Patents.

                "explanation": "Changing arbitration to mediation weakens the enforceability of the dispute resolution process. While the original clause mandated arbitration, the revised text only suggests non-binding mediation, meaning neither party is forced to accept the mediator's decision. The original text provides that the parties are bound to the result of the arbitrator, whereas, in the revision, the Seller may choose whether or not to assign the patent.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"have executed and delivered\" to \"may or may not have executed and delivered\", the contract introduces uncertainty as to whether employees are actually bound by non-disclosure and assignment agreements. This significantly weakens the Purchaser's claim to the IP, as it's no longer certain that the proper agreements are in place to secure ownership. This shift undermines the representation made by the Seller.",

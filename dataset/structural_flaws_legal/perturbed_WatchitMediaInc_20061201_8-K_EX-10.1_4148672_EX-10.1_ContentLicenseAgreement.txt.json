                "explanation": "The change introduces ambiguity and contradicts the original clause's clear financial penalty by replacing the fixed cancellation fee with a discretionary amount based on 'future revenue projections.' This shift favors Watchit Media but removes the certainty for Oceanic Time Warner Cable, making the financial penalty potentially open to dispute and less enforceable. The lack of a defined amount constitutes a structural flaw affecting enforceability.",

                "original_text": "10.2.2 If the dispute fails to be resolved within thirty (30) days by such method set forth above, either party shall submit to the court inthe location of Party B.",
                "changed_text": "10.2.2 If the dispute fails to be resolved within thirty (30) days by such method set forth above, either party may choose to submit to the court in the location of Party B, or resolve the issue through a game of chance, such as flipping a coin. The method will be determined by Party A.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty and undermines the enforceability of the dispute resolution clause. By introducing an option for a 'game of chance,' the clause deviates from established legal procedures and could be considered frivolous, thus weakening the commitment to a serious legal process. This makes the resolution arbitrary and reduces the likelihood of fair resolution.",

                "original_text": "7.  Any unit or person shall report to Baidu or service website in written timely and provide ID card, ownership certificate and detailed violation evidence if it considers the content through Baidu search service or search link may be suspected of violating its legal right. Baidu will remove such suspected search service or search link as soon as possible after its receipt of legal documents above.",
                "changed_text": "7. Any unit or person shall report to Baidu or service website if it considers the content through Baidu search service or search link may be suspected of violating its legal right. However, Baidu is not obligated to take any action. Baidu's decision is final.",
                "explanation": "The original clause outlines a process for reporting and addressing potential legal violations, with a commitment to remove suspected search services or links. The modified version removes the requirement for written reporting and the provision of evidence, and explicitly states that Baidu is not obligated to take any action. This weakens the enforcement of legal rights and creates a contradiction by suggesting a reporting mechanism without any corresponding obligation to act, making it harder for affected parties to seek redress.",

                "explanation": "The added clause 7.2.4 completely undermines the purpose of the confidentiality agreement by allowing disclosure of confidential information if a party simply 'feels like it'. This creates a significant loophole and effectively nullifies the confidentiality protections intended by the agreement, making it unenforceable. The subjective nature of this clause contradicts the objective and defined exceptions outlined in the original clauses, creating a legal contradiction that allows for arbitrary disclosure.",

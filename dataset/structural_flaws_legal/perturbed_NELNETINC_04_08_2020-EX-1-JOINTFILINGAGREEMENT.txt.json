                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned may choose to prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto regarding each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, but this is subject to individual discretion and agreement. Affirmation that Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is only applicable if all parties explicitly consent.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a clear agreement to jointly file. The modified text introduces ambiguity and makes the joint filing optional ('may choose') and contingent on individual discretion and explicit consent, contradicting the implicit agreement to joint filing required under SEC regulations. This weakens the enforceability of the joint filing agreement by allowing parties to potentially avoid their filing responsibilities.",

                "changed_text": "While it is preferred that each party is responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and the accuracy of information, no legal ramifications will arise if such information is misrepresented or filed late. Furthermore, no party is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other, irrespective of their knowledge or reason to believe such information is inaccurate.",
                "explanation": "The original text assigns responsibility for timely filing and accurate information. The modified text states that no legal ramifications will arise for misrepresentation or late filing, directly contradicting the original responsibility and weakening the legal obligation. It further absolves parties of responsibility even if they know information is inaccurate, which conflicts with principles of good faith and due diligence.",

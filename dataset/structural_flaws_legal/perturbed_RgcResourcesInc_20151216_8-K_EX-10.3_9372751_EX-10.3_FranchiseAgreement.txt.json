Grantee shall not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, or any other basis prohibited by state law relating to discrimination in employment, except where there is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the Grantee.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not discriminate' to 'shall endeavor to not discriminate, but exceptions may apply' weakens the non-discrimination clause, making it less enforceable. The original clause clearly prohibits discrimination, while the modified version introduces ambiguity and potential loopholes by suggesting that discrimination may be permissible under certain circumstances. This contradicts the spirit and intent of non-discrimination laws.",

The original clause explicitly states that all notices must be written and sent by certified mail or overnight courier, ensuring a verifiable method of delivery.

The original clause clearly states that the grantee will pay the franchise fee, specifies the method of calculation, and sets a specific due date. The modified version introduces uncertainty, stating the fee calculation is not guaranteed and can be adjusted. It also changes the due date, resulting in a potentially longer period.

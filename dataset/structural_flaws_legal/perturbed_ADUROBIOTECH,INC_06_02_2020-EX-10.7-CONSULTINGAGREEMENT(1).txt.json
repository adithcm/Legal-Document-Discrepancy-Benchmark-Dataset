                "original_text": "(e) Defend Trade Secrets Act Notice: Nothing herein shall prevent Consultant from reporting possible violations of federal or state law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal or state law or regulation. Consultant does not need the prior authorization of Aduro to make any such reports or disclosures and is not required to notify Aduro that it has made such reports or disclosures. In addition, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. ยง1833(b), Consultant shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and that is made solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or that is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding if such filing is made under seal.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and that is made solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or that is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding if such filing is made under seal.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to the Defend Trade Secrets Act Notice and the consultant's right to report violations without prior authorization or notification, the whistleblower protection is weakened. The disclosure now only mentions liability for trade secret disclosures under specific circumstances, obscuring the broader whistleblower protections.",

                "original_text": "Consultant represents as follows: (a) Consultant is not subject to any other agreement that Consultant will violate by signing this Agreement; (b) Consultant has and shall continue to have the knowledge, experience, qualifications and required skill to perform, and shall perform, the Services in a professional manner; (c) Consultant to perform the Services in accordance with all Applicable Law; and (d) During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will not, directly or indirectly (whether for compensation or without compensation) engage in or provide consulting services, or enter into any agreement either written or oral, that would present a material conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, or would preclude Consultant from complying with the terms and conditions hereof. If during the term of this Agreement any situation or circumstance arises that might reasonably be expected to present a conflict of interest, or if Consultant might be unable to render Services or otherwise participate in such work without risk of breaching an obligation of confidentiality to another party, Consultant will promptly advise the Company's General Counsel of the situation and Company and Consultant shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve any such conflicts(s). If requested by the Company's General Counsel, Consultant will recuse herself from providing Services for the duration of the conflict.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall perform' to 'agrees to make best efforts to perform' and 'will recuse' to 'may recuse', the obligation on the consultant to follow Applicable Law and avoid conflicts of interest are weakened. The original representation provided a firm assurance, whereas the modified version allows for interpretation, especially regarding the consultant's responsibility to comply with the law. This could reduce enforceability.",

There may be doubt in a legal dispute if this contract will be held up in court because the 'enforced' portion has been removed, creating a contradiction.",

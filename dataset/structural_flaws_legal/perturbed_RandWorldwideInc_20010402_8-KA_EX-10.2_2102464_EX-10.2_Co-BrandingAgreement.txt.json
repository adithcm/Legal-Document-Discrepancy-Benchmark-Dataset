                "original_text": "11.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER.",

The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.\n\n11.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER, only if both parties mutually agree to it at the time of the dispute.\n\n11.8 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'only if both parties mutually agree to it at the time of the dispute', the waiver of jury trial is now conditional and contradicts the original intent of a full waiver, making it less enforceable. Relocating to the 'Headings' section further obscures the enforceability, as it is not located where someone would normally look for an important Legal statement.",

(a) This Agreement may be assigned or otherwise transferred, by operation of law or otherwise without the express written consent of PlanetCAD and Dassault Systemes, but in such event the assigning Party shall give notice to the non-assigning Party and the non-assigning Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement within the 30-day period following receipt of such notice.\n(b) Either party may assign or otherwise transfer all or part of this Agreement to any of its Affiliates, and for as long as it remains an Affiliate; provided that no such assignment shall relieve a party of any of its obligations under this Agreement. In the event there is a change of Control of an Affiliate which terminates its status as an Affiliate of the party to this Agreement, and this Agreement has been assigned to such an Affiliate, this Agreement must be assigned back to the party within 6 months of the effective date of the change of Control.\n9.4 LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING FROM SECTION 9.3 [Intellectual Property Infringement], IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR EXPENSES.

                "explanation": "By adding 'However, the party may be liable for an amount greater than that earned if there is gross negligence on that Party's part', it directly contradicts the financial limit initially put in place.

As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, each party shall appoint a project manager to act as a liaison to oversee and ensure compliance of the respective obligations of the parties hereunder.",
                "explanation": "By adding the exception 'unless otherwise agreed. Then the cost for the Launch will be split at the discretion of the party who requests the change to the look and feel of the website', the original statement on expenses becomes conditional. By inserting the clause inside the Review of Co-Branded Site section, it creates confusion as to when the expenses are to be split and makes it harder to see when looking for financial information. This change increases the possibility of a dispute over expenses, since that is not generally where expenses are discussed.",

If any arbitration, litigation, action, suit, or other proceeding is instituted to remedy, prevent or obtain relief from a breach of this Agreement, in relation to a breach of this Agreement or pertaining to a declaration of rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will recover all such party's attorneys' fees incurred in each and every such action, suit or other proceeding, including any and all appeals or petitions there from. As used in this Agreement, attorneys' fees will be deemed to be the full and actual cost of any legal services actually performed in connection with the matters involved, including those related to any appeal to the enforcement of any judgment calculated on the basis of the usual fee charged by attorneys performing such services.",

If any arbitration, litigation, action, suit, or other proceeding is instituted to remedy, prevent or obtain relief from a breach of this Agreement, in relation to a breach of this Agreement or pertaining to a declaration of rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will recover all such party's attorneys' fees incurred only if mutually agreed upon by both parties. As used in this Agreement, attorneys' fees will be determined at the sole discretion of the judge.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates the prevailing party recovers all attorney's fees. The modified version introduces a contradiction by requiring mutual agreement for the recovery of fees and gives the judge the sole discretion to determine attorney's fees, conflicting with the initial provision.",

                "original_text": "2. (a) Carrier shall invoice Shipper for the services provided under this contract promptly upon performance.  All sums due under any invoice shall be payable without discount upon receipt of the invoice. Amounts more than 30 days past due shall bear interest from the due date to the date of payment at the lesser of 1) the rate of interest established by Chase Manhattan Bank, New York, NY, from time to time as its prime rate, plus two (2) percent, or 2) the maximum non-usurious interest rate which may be charged Shipper pursuant to applicable Texas law, Article 5069-1.04 Texas Rev. Civ. Stat., as amended.",

All sums due under any invoice shall be payable without discount upon receipt of the invoice. Amounts more than 30 days past due shall bear interest from the due date to the date of payment at a rate that will be determined based on mutual agreement between the parties.",
                "explanation": "The modification removes the specific interest rate calculation, replacing it with a vague 'mutual agreement.' This makes it more difficult to enforce the financial terms, because the absence of a clear formula or reference rate makes the interest calculation ambiguous and subject to dispute, potentially violating Texas usury laws if the agreed-upon rate exceeds legal limits without proper disclosure.",

A claim for loss, damage, injury, or delay to      cargo may be filed, but this action is optional and the Carrier will still process claims without written documentation. (b) Minimum filing requirements. A claim may be filed with Carrier at any time, and     (i) should contain some facts sufficient to identify the shipment (or shipments)     involved (ii) may assert the grounds for Carrier's liability for alleged loss,     damage, injury, or delay, and (iii) may request payment of a specified or     determinable amount of money.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity and contradiction by stating that written claims are optional, contradicting the initial requirement for claims to be in writing and filed within a specific timeframe. This weakens the enforceability of the claims process by removing a clear deadline and mandatory documentation, potentially violating standard shipping regulations requiring a clear process.",

This contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, excluding any binding conflict of laws rule which might refer such construction to the laws of another state.  Any lawsuit related to or arising out of this contract shall be brought only in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division) or in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, to which venue and non-exclusive jurisdiction each party expressly consents for itself and in respect of its property for all purposes.",

This contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas; however, in specific cases or disagreements, the contract may be subject to the laws of other states at the Carrier's discretion. Any lawsuit related to or arising out of this contract may be brought in a jurisdiction of Carrier's choosing.",
                "explanation": "This change makes the governing law ambiguous and contradictory. While stating Texas law applies, it allows the Carrier to unilaterally subject the contract to other state laws. Additionally, giving the Carrier the sole right to choose the jurisdiction for lawsuits is an unfair and potentially unenforceable term that significantly disadvantages the Shipper.",

                "explanation": "The placement of governing law within the indemnification clause creates confusion regarding the legal framework. Governing law should be in a 'Miscellaneous' or stand-alone section, not embedded within an operational clause. Furthermore, the governing law should be in a section that is relevant to the function of the contract. By placing it in an area that has no relation to the function it serves, it is harder to enforce.",

                "explanation": "The Dispute Resolution should mandate arbitration, not be subject to the agreement of the parties. The restructuring of the sentence introduces contradictionâ€”the first part states arbitration is mandatory, but the latter part allows for 'mutual agreement' on the dispute resolution method. This contradicts the original clause's strict arbitration requirement, leading to uncertainty in enforcement. The changed text removes the enforcement by a third party (Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre ('HKIAC')) and puts it in the hands of the party.",

                "explanation": "Relocating the confidentiality clause from 'Miscellaneous' to Section 4.7, which is about 'Actions Requiring Unanimous Board Approval,' disrupts the logical flow of the contract, making it less discoverable. I have also removed the line 'injunctive relief to prevent a breach' and replaced it with 'seek monetary compensation' this reduces the protection against a breach of confidentiality. If there is a breach, an injunction can stop the breach from continuing, while monetary compensation is for after the fact and might not recover all losses.",

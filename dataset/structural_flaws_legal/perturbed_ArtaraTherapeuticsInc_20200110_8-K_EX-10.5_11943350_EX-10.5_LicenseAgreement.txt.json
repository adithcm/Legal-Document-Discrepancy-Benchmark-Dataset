                "original_text": "6.3 Indemnification by ArTara. To the extent permitted by law, ArTara agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the University of Iowa Research Foundation, the University, the State of Iowa, the University's Board of Regents, their respective affiliates, trustees, officers, directors, faculty, staff, students, successors, assigns, independent contractors, agents and employees including but not limited to Principal Investigator (\"University Indemnitees\"), harmless from and against any and all liability, loss, expense, reasonable adjudicated attorneys' fees, or claims for injury or damages arising out of the use of the Program Data by ArTara and its Affiliates and subcontractors including but not limited to the CRO involved in the Project, but only in proportion to and to the extent such liability, loss, expense, attorneys' fees, or claims for injury or damages are caused by or result from the negligent or acts or omissions of ArTara, its officers, agents, employees, subcontractors, the CRO or Affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "9.12 Addendum: Indemnification. ArTara may choose, at its discretion, to partially indemnify the University of Iowa Research Foundation, the University, the State of Iowa, the University's Board of Regents, their respective affiliates, trustees, officers, directors, faculty, staff, students, successors, assigns, independent contractors, agents and employees including but not limited to Principal Investigator (\"University Indemnitees\"), harmless from and against liability, loss, expense, or claims for injury or damages arising out of the use of the Program Data by ArTara and its Affiliates and subcontractors including but not limited to the CRO involved in the Project, but only if ArTara deems it appropriate based on the circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The original indemnification clause mandates ArTara to indemnify the University. The modified clause turns this mandatory indemnification into a discretionary act by ArTara. This weakens the University's protection and contradicts the principle of mandatory indemnification.",

                "changed_text": "5.5 Governing Law. In matters of publication, the laws of the state where the University is physically located shall govern, but otherwise disputes can be resolved using mutually agreeable methods.",
                "explanation": "This moves the governing law clause to the Publication section and introduces ambiguity. The first part specifies Iowa law for publications, but the addition of 'mutually agreeable methods' contradicts the certainty provided by a specific governing law for other disputes. The original clause mandates Iowa law for all aspects of the agreement. The modified clause introduces optional dispute methods, thus contradicting the enforceability of Iowa law.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a 30-day written notice for termination by ArTara. The modified clause, placed far from the original Term section, weakens this requirement by stating a 'recommendation' rather than a legal obligation, introducing a contradiction.",

In the event of any dispute which arises between the parties          and which relates to the subject matter of this Agreement, the parties          acknowledge and agree that any such dispute shall be submitted for           binding arbitration in accordance with the arbitration procedures           established by the American arbitration Association in Denver,           Colorado.  If such association is not then in existence, an           independent association of arbitrators may be utilized  which is           designated by agreement of the parties. In the event the parties are           unable to agree on an independent association of arbitrators, either           party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for appointment          of arbitrators.",

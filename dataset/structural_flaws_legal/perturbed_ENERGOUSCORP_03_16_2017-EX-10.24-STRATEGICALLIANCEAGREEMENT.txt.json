This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, exclusive of conflict of laws principles.\n\n19.2 Dispute Resolution; Jurisdiction. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any matters regarding its existence, scope, validity, breach or termination, or any non-contractual obligations arising out of or related to it) that is not able to be resolved through negotiations will be submitted to arbitration in San Francisco, California, administered by the International Chamber of Commerce under its Rules of Arbitration. There will be one arbitrator. The language of the arbitration will be English. The award will be in writing, state the reasons for the award and be final and binding. Judgment on the award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. Except as may be required by law, the parties will preserve the confidentiality of all aspects of the arbitration. The arbitration will be the sole and exclusive forum for final resolution of any such dispute or claim, provided, however, that, because each party will have access to and become acquainted with Confidential Information of the other party, the unauthorized use or disclosure of which may cause irreparable harm and significant injury which may be difficult to ascertain and which may not be compensable by damages alone, the parties agree that the damaged party will have the right to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that it may have for such unauthorized use or disclosure. Each party irrevocably waives all rights to a jury trial in any judicial proceeding permitted hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the validity, construction, and enforceability of this Agreement and the resolution of disputes arising out of and relating to this Agreement, will be governed solely by this Section 19.",

Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. The parties agree to resolve any disputes through negotiation, and if unsuccessful, through a method mutually agreed upon, potentially including but not limited to mediation or non-binding arbitration.",
                "explanation": "The original section 19 contains the choice of law (California) and requires arbitration administered by the International Chamber of Commerce in San Francisco. This is now moved to 20, renamed, and changed to say that it will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, in conflict with the original intention. It also changes the arbitration clause, removing it, and stating that if negotiation doesn't work, they can agree on a different non-binding process. This makes the dispute resolution process unclear and unenforceable.",

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.\n\nEach party will comply with all law and regulations applicable such party's performance under this Agreement, including but not limited to U.S. Export Administration laws and regulations and any other export, import and re-export control laws applicable to such party. The parties will refrain from exporting or re-exporting the Products or Product IP or any technical data or other materials received from each other, or the direct product of any of these, to any country, individual or organization proscribed by the United States government, unless properly authorized by the appropriate agencies of the United States government. Each party will provide all information under its control which is necessary or useful for the other party to ship or receive the Products, including, but not limited to, U.S. Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), U.S. Customs Certificates of Delivery, Certificates of Origin and U.S. Federal Communications Commission identifier, if applicable. Each party agrees that it will not act in any fashion or take any action in violation of any applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption legislation in any jurisdiction in which it does business, which prohibits the offering, giving or promising to offer or give, directly or indirectly, money or anything of value to any official of a government, political party or instrumentality to assist it in obtaining or retaining business, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any comparable legislation in another country.",

PRODUCT SALES.\n\n7.4 Compliance with Laws: Each party will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to its performance under this agreement. However, neither party shall be liable for any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, provided that such failure is due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control. The parties will determine export/re-export of Products or Product IP, and each party agrees it will not act in any fashion or take any action in violation of any applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption legislation.",
                "explanation": "The original compliance with laws section is moved to Product Sales, which makes it harder to find. The language is changed to weaken the obligation to comply with laws, adding 'commercially reasonable efforts', and a limitation of liability. This contradicts the original intent of the section, which was to ensure full compliance with all laws. It also omits the U.S. Export Administration laws, and other export, import and re-export laws.",

Subject to Section 12.2, ENERGOUS agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, in the case of any third party claims, defend DIALOG and its Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, distributors and customers (collectively, \"DIALOG Indemnitees\") from and against and in respect of any and all alleged or actual demands, claims, actions, causes of action, suits or proceedings, assessments, awarded damages (including punitive damages), liabilities, interest and penalties, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal fees and disbursements in connection therewith) (each, a \"Claim\") to the extent resulting from, arising out of, relating to, or imposed upon or incurred by any DIALOG Indemnitees by reason of (a) death or bodily injury caused by or resulting from use of the Products, (b) any breach of any representation or warranty made by ENERGOUS hereunder or to any third party in relation to the Products or Product Die, (c) the infringement or misappropriation of any third party Intellectual Property Rights in relation to the Products or Product Die, (d) the infringement or misappropriation of any third party Intellectual Property Rights as a result of DIALOG's or its Affiliates' exercise of rights in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Manufacturing Subcontractors' manufacture of the Products on their behalf, provided that the Products are manufactured in strict compliance with the Product Specifications and Approved Production Specifications and only to the extent such Claims arise due to compliance with the Product Specifications and/or the Approved Production Specifications or use of the Tooling provided by ENERGOUS hereunder, (e) the infringement by DIALOG of any third party Marks rights as a result of its authorized use of the ENERGOUS Marks, (f) any failure by ENERGOUS to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, or (g) ENERGOUS' negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud.",

                "explanation": "The original Indemnification section is a comprehensive legal clause protecting DIALOG. By moving a modified version to the section on Product Development and Updates, the scope of the protection is severely limited. It removes obligations for breaches of warranty, IP infringement, and other key areas. This drastically reduces the enforceability and clarity of the indemnification, essentially turning it into a small assistance fund for specific claims.",

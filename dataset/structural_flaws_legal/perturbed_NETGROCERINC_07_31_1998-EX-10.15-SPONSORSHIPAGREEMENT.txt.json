                "original_text": "The parties agree that any breach of either of the parties' obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or confidentiality would result in irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of a party's obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names or confidentiality, the aggrieved party will be entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to its other available legal remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "The parties agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of a party's obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names or confidentiality, the aggrieved party will be entitled to seek equitable relief; however, the specific court and remedy will be at the discretion of the breaching party.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction. The original text asserts the aggrieved party's right to seek equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. The modified text adds that the 'specific court and remedy will be at the discretion of the breaching party,' effectively nullifying the aggrieved party's right to choose the forum or type of legal recourse. This drastically reduces the enforceability of the trademark and confidentiality obligations.",

                "changed_text": "In the event that disputes between the parties arising from or concerning in any manner the subject matter of this Agreement, other than disputes arising from or concerning trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or confidentiality, cannot be resolved through good faith negotiation and mediation, the parties will explore alternative dispute resolution methods, and the method of dispute resolution will be determined by the party initiating the dispute.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates binding arbitration through the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The modified text changes this to a vaguely defined 'alternative dispute resolution methods' selected by the initiating party. This weakens the enforceability of the dispute resolution mechanism, as it removes the guaranteed structure and neutrality of AAA arbitration, placing control of the dispute resolution process with the initiating party and removing the agreement to binding arbitration.",

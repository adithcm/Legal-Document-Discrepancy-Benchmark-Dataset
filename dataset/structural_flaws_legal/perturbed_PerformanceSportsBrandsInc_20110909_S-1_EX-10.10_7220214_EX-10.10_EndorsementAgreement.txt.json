                "original_text": "22. Governing Law. The Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Florida in the United States of America,  and venue for any such legal action shall be in the Circuit Court or County Court in Orlando, FL or the U.S. District Court having jurisdiction  over Orlando, FL.",
                "changed_text": "22. Governing Law. The Agreement shall be governed by the principles of good sportsmanship, and any disputes shall be resolved through a series of friendly golf matches, the specifics of which will be determined at a later date.",
                "explanation": "Moving the governing law clause from a standard legal jurisdiction (Florida) to a vague concept of 'good sportsmanship' and informal 'golf matches' makes the contract unenforceable in a court of law. This completely contradicts standard contract law requirements for a clearly defined jurisdiction.",

                "original_text": "15. Indemnification. Company shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless North and its employees, officers, agents, and representatives from  and against any and all claims, suits, assessments, losses, obligations, penalties, charges, actions, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses  including reasonable attorney's fees whether incurred at trial or in connection with any review by appeal or certiorari of both the trial and  appellate court levels (collectively referred to as \"Claims\") arising out of or in connection with:    a Any claim or action for negligent or intentional misconduct of Company in relation to the advertisement, promotion, or sale of the  Endorsed Product, or Company's use of North's Likeness or North's Endorsement to advertise, promote, distribute, or sell the  Endorsed Product; or    b. Any claim or action for personal injury, death, or property damage resulting from a customer's use of the Endorsed Product; or    c. Any claims or action for the breach by Company of any of its representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "15. Indemnification. Company shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless North; however, this clause is voided should Andy North be caught cheating at golf, regardless of the relationship to the company.",
                "explanation": "The indemnification clause now includes a condition that voids the entire clause based on an event (cheating at golf) that is irrelevant to the contract's purpose. This introduces a contradiction, making it difficult to enforce the indemnification agreement. The connection between indemnification, business relations and cheating at golf is non-existent, and is therefore difficult to prove in court.",

The compensation terms of this Agreement hereunder and any financial information collected through the review of  Company's records or statements shall be treated by the parties as confidential information. The parties hereto agree not to disclose any  such terms, amounts or information to any other person or entity whatsoever other than its attorneys, accountants, or as required by law.",

The compensation terms of this Agreement hereunder and any financial information collected through the review of Company's records or statements shall be treated by the parties as confidential information, except during televised interviews, where Andy North has full rights to disclose compensation.",
                "explanation": "The confidentiality clause is significantly weakened by explicitly allowing disclosure of compensation terms during televised interviews, contradicting the initial intent of the clause. A normal confidentiality clause has no exceptions for public disclosure.",

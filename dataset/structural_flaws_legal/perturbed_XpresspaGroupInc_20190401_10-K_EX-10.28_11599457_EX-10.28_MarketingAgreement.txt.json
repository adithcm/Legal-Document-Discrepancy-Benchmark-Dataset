                "original_text": "13. Arbitration. Without limiting Section ​16.08, any and all disputes or claims arising from either Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement shall be subject to arbitration. Any arbitration commenced with respect to a dispute or claim under this Agreement shall be conducted pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association and the Supplementary Procedures for Large, Complex Disputes then in effect (the \"Rules\"), except to the extent such rules conflict with this Section ​13. In any arbitration, New York law shall govern, except to the extent that such law conflicts with the Rules or this Section ​13. The Parties further agree that each issue submitted for arbitration be submitted to a panel of three (3) impartial arbitrators with each Party selecting one (1) arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after the commencement of the arbitration period and the two (2) selected arbitrators selecting a third arbitrator who is experienced in the commercial retail industry within thirty (30) days after the commencement of the arbitration period. Any arbitration hereunder shall commence within thirty (30) days after appointment of the third arbitrator and shall be held in New York, New York, USA. No discovery by either Party shall be permitted unless the arbitrators determine that the Party requesting such discovery has a substantial, demonstrable need. The arbitrators shall make final determinations as to any discovery disputes and all other procedural matters. If any Party fails to comply with the procedures in any arbitration in a manner deemed material by the arbitrators, then the arbitrators shall fix a reasonable time for compliance, and if the Party does not comply within such period, then a remedy deemed just by the arbitrators, including an award of default, may be imposed. The decision of the arbitrators shall be rendered no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after commencement of the arbitration period. The costs of arbitration shall be borne by the Party against whom the arbitral decision is made. Any judgment or decision rendered by the panel shall be binding upon the Parties and shall be enforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "16.09. In the event of a dispute, the parties may elect to engage in non-binding mediation, but any and all disputes or claims arising from either Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement shall be subject to arbitration only if both parties consent in writing at the time of the dispute. Should both parties agree to arbitration, any arbitration commenced with respect to a dispute or claim under this Agreement shall be conducted pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, though New York Law shall not apply. Parties will select one arbitrator, experienced or not experienced in the commercial retail industry. Any arbitration hereunder shall commence within one hundred and eighty (180) days after appointment of the arbitrator and shall be held in a location agreed to by the parties, or if no agreement, wherever the arbitrator chooses. Discovery by either Party shall be permitted at the arbitrator's discretion. The arbitrator's decision shall be rendered no later than two hundred and forty (240) days after commencement of the arbitration period. The costs of arbitration shall be split equally between the parties. Any judgment or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be non-binding upon the Parties unless both agree otherwise in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original arbitration clause mandates arbitration under specific rules (AAA, New York law), while the modified version introduces several critical changes that undermine its enforceability. First, it converts mandatory arbitration to optional, requiring mutual written consent at the time of the dispute. Secondly, it alters the rules governing the arbitration (excluding New York law), arbitrator selection (allows no industry experience), location, discovery, and timeline, and even allows the decision to be non-binding. These changes fundamentally alter the nature of the dispute resolution process, making it less predictable, more discretionary, and potentially unenforceable. The original clause intended to provide a clear, binding arbitration pathway, while the modified version introduces uncertainty and ambiguity, making it difficult to enforce a specific arbitration outcome.",

EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO EACH PARTY'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, (A) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE), SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY OR OTHER SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT; AND (B) THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED $2,000,000.00 (EXCLUDING ANY AMOUNTS DUE AND PAYABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION ​8 HEREUNDER).",

THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED $2,000,000.00 (EXCLUDING ANY AMOUNTS DUE AND PAYABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION ​8 HEREUNDER).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, and regardless of any indemnification obligations, any claim involving personal injury or property damage shall be subject to the laws of the state where the incident occurred.",
                "explanation": "The alteration removes the clear and forceful exclusion of liability for lost profits, loss of opportunity, and other special damages, and the exception for indemnification obligations, replacing it with a statement about personal injury claims. This weakens the original liability cap by introducing ambiguity about its applicability in all situations. Furthermore, introducing the concept of applying the law of the state where the incident occurred would remove the consistent application of New York law. The original clause sought to provide a predictable limit on liability, while the modified version makes this limit less certain, potentially increasing exposure to certain claims.",

This Agreement embodies and constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to subject matter hereof, and no prior agreements, understandings, representations and statements, oral or written, shall have any legal effect with respect to such subject matter. Notwithstanding the above, and due to the fast-paced and constantly shifting nature of the business, the parties agree that this agreement and any provision hereof may be waived, modified, amended, discharged or terminated orally if both parties acknowledge they are satisfied with this course of action.",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes a clear 'entire agreement' and 'no oral modification' provision. This is a standard clause intended to prevent disputes based on prior or contemporaneous oral agreements. The modification adds a caveat that allows for oral waivers, modifications, amendments, discharges, or terminations if both parties acknowledge they are satisfied. This directly contradicts the initial part of the clause and common contract law. Many jurisdictions require that modifications to written contracts be in writing, especially when the contract itself contains a clause prohibiting oral modifications. By allowing oral modifications, the modified clause creates uncertainty and opens the door to disputes over whether an oral modification actually occurred and what its terms were. This undermines the purpose of the entire agreement clause, which is to provide certainty and prevent disputes based on parol evidence.",

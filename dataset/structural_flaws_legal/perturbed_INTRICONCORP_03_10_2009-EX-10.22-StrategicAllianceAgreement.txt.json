                "original_text": "4.10 All amounts payable by IntriCon under this Agreement must be paid free and clear of and without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future withholding tax, including any interest or penalties in relation to such tax (Withholding Taxes). If IntriCon is required to make any deduction or withholding for any Withholding Tax, then IntriCon must pay to Dynamic Hearing such additional amount to ensure that Dynamic Hearing receives such amount that would have been received by it as if no such withholding or deduction had been required.",
                "changed_text": "2.13 Miscellaneous Definitions:\n\n       (a)    headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation;\n\n       (b)    the singular includes the plural and conversely;\n\n       (c)    the meaning of general words introduced by including, or for example, or similar expressions is not limited by specific  examples;\n\n       (d)    a reference to a person, corporation, trust, partnership, unincorporated body or other entity includes any of them;\n\n       (e)    a reference to a clause or Exhibit is a reference to a clause of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement;\n\n       All amounts payable by IntriCon under this Agreement must be paid free and clear of and without any deduction or withholding for  or on account of any present or future withholding tax, including any interest or penalties in relation to such tax (Withholding Taxes). If IntriCon is  required to make any deduction or withholding for any Withholding Tax, then IntriCon must pay to Dynamic Hearing such additional amount to  ensure that Dynamic Hearing receives such amount that would have been received by it as if no such withholding or deduction had been required.",
                "explanation": "Moving the tax clause to a section defining miscellaneous terms buries it where it's less likely to be noticed or understood as a critical financial obligation, thereby reducing its enforceability.",

The 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "3.16 No other exception to IntriCon's exclusive license being granted herein shall exist unless such exception is specifically identified by  a supplemental agreement between IntriCon and Dynamic Hearing.  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the state of Delaware, and the parties agree to the jurisdiction of courts of Delaware, The 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will apply to this agreement, except where superseded by Victoria, Australia law.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces a conflict of laws. It states Delaware law governs, then contradicts itself by allowing Victoria, Australia law to supersede aspects, which creates legal ambiguity as to which jurisdiction controls the agreement. It moves it to license grants where a reader may expect it to pertain to those grants only.",

                "explanation": "By severely truncating the confidentiality clause and placing it directly after the purpose section, its significance is downplayed. Removing the detailed provisions regarding permitted use, access restrictions, and employee compliance weakens the protection of confidential information, making enforcement more difficult.",

AGENCY'S ERRORS AND OMISSION, AND FIDELITY & ELECTRONIC CRIME INSURANCE The Agency will maintain valid errors and omissions insurance, with minimum limits of $1,000,000 per incident, and a fidelity and electronic crime policy through an insurer, both of which shall contain terms and limits of coverage acceptable to MICOA covering the Agency's solicitors and each of its employees. The Agency shall provide MICOA a copy of each policy; doing so on a regular and current basis shall be a precondition to all of Agency's rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the payment of all earned commissions.",

Agency and MICOA agree that Agency may be offered the opportunity to support MICOA's workers' compensation, and its other nonphysician professional liability or product programs in Nevada when MICOA proceeds with related marketing plans. Such plans may also include Agency's involvement in sales of MICOA commercial and personal products. Appropriate agreements must be negotiated separately from this agreement for each such product, and for each such territory, including but not limited to Nevada. 2. Territory. Agency and MICOA further agree to consider, subject to successful negotiation of appropriate agreements separate from this agreement, expansion of Agencies' sales territories for MICOA beyond Nevada.

                "changed_text": "17. NO PUBLIC NOTICE No public announcement of the proposed transaction will be made by either Party unless the timing and content have been agreed upon in advance by both parties, except as may otherwise be required by law. It is understood though that MediaLinx may discuss this arrangement with its Sympatico Internet service providers and affiliates to the extent necessary to meet the proposed time lines. 21. GOVERNING LAW This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and the Parties agree to abide by the jurisdiction of the Courts of Delaware.",
                "explanation": "Moving the governing law clause makes it less conspicuous. The original text clearly specified Ontario law, but relocation to the section on public notices, along with a switch to Delaware law, buries it and makes it difficult for a party to quickly ascertain the governing legal framework. This is because the governing law is typically looked for in the end, not in the middle of the agreement.",

EXCLUSIVITY During the Term of the Agreement, and subject to the following requirements respecting Canadian content levels as set out in paragraphs 3(f), (g) and (h), HCI shall be the exclusive health content partner in the health section of the Sympatico web site, provided however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent MediaLinx from entering into an agreement with other parties for: i) a health based web directory; or ii) other health related content whose content does not compete with the content contained on the Co-Branded Site; which in no event shall receive no more than one fifth (1/5th) of the promotion and which shall constitute no more than one fifth (1/5th) of the total health related content which resides on the home page of the Sympatico Health section. In the event that MediaLinx obtains a web guide from a third party, MediaLinx and HCI shall discuss how to present both web guides to the user, and make best effort to agree to the kind of experience that the user shall have when utilizing the new web guide. If, at any time during the Term of this Agreement, HCI fails to meet the content requirements set out in paragraphs 3(f), (g) and (h), HCI shall no longer be entitled to be the exclusive health content partner in the health section of the Sympatico web site. HCI shall not either directly or indirectly license or deliver content to or carry on or be engaged with any other Canadian portal web site, being a Web site which aggregates and markets a variety of content directed to multiple communities of interest and which offers products, Source: HEALTHCENTRAL COM, S-1/A, 11/8/1999 tools and services to a broad base of Canadian end users. 15.

                "explanation": "Moving the limitation of liability clause into the section on exclusivity makes it less prominent and harder to find. Parties expect to see liability clauses in their own section, or one regarding risk allocation. This obfuscation makes it more likely that the affected party will overlook or misunderstand the extent of liability limitations.",

                "explanation": "The legal fees clause has been moved to 'no additional warranties,' and has also been modified to create a significant change in enforceability. This is because legal fees are normally standard, now there is a need for seeking high-level damages for the term to become enforced, which could lead to a breach.",

LAUNCH DATE, RESPONSIBILITY FOR EXCITE NETWORK AND REPORTING\na) Client and Excite will use reasonable efforts to implement the display of the promotional placements and advertising described in the Agreement by April 15, 1998 (the \"Launch Date\").\nb) Excite will have sole responsibility for providing, hosting and maintaining, at its expense, the Excite Network. Excite will have sole control over of the \"look and feel\" of the Excite Network including, but not limited to, the display, appearance and placement of the parties' respective names and/or brands and the promotional links.\nc) Excite will in \"good faith\" ensure Client that the above mentioned banners and promotional placements will be more prominently presented than any other \"competitive retailer's\" banners or promotional placements for the term of the Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, a \"competitive retailer\" means an on-line department store comparable to Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Burdine's, Shopping.com, Chef's Catalog or iQVC.\nd) Excite will provide Client with monthly reports substantiating the number of impressions of Client's advertising banners and promotional placements displayed on the Excite Network and the resulting number of clickthroughs to the Client's site. At the time that Excite makes audited impression reports available to its advertisers, Client agrees that any breach of either of the parties' obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names, confidentiality and/or User Data would result in irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of a party's obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names or confidentiality, the aggrieved party will be entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to its other available legal remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction.

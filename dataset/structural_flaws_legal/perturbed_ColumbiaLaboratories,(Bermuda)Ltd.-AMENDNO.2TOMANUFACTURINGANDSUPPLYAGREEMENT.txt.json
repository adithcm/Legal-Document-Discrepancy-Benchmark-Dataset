                "original_text": "Each Party irrevocably agrees that the English courts shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with this Amendment or its subject matter or formation.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees that the English courts may have jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with this Amendment or its subject matter or formation but will only be applicable if both parties agree.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that English courts have 'sole and exclusive jurisdiction.' The modified version changes this to permissive jurisdiction ('may have') contingent on mutual agreement. This introduces a legal contradiction because, in the original agreement, one party could unilaterally enforce jurisdiction in English courts but now, it requires agreement by both parties to have effect. This diminishes the enforceability and legal certainty of the jurisdiction clause.",

                "original_text": "H. This Guarantee shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of the state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated. In the event of any conflict of law, the laws of such state shall prevail, without regard to the application of such state's conflict of law rules. If, however, any provision of this Guarantee would not be enforceable under the laws of the state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated, and if the Master Franchisee's franchised business is located outside of such state and such provision would be enforceable under the laws of the state in which the Master Franchisee's franchised business is located, then such provision shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of that state. Any action brought to enforce or interpret this Guarantee in any court, whether federal or state, shall be brought within the county and state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated, and Guarantors hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.",
                "changed_text": "H. This Guarantee shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of a state to be determined at the discretion of the Franchisor. In the event of any conflict of law, the laws of a state that favors the Franchisor shall prevail. Any action brought to enforce or interpret this Guarantee in any court, whether federal or state, may be brought in a location of the Franchisor's choosing, irrespective of the Guarantor's location, and Guarantors seemingly waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a clear method for determining the governing law and venue based on the Franchisor's principal place of business. The modified clause introduces ambiguity and Franchisor's discretion, making it potentially unenforceable. It also contains a term that seemingly waives jurisdiction without proper acknowledgment.",

                "original_text": "F. Guarantors' obligations under this Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect, and shall be unaffected by: (1) the unenforceability of the Master Franchise Agreement against Master Franchisee; (2) the termination of any obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement by operation of law or otherwise; (3) the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, or other liquidation of Master Franchisee, including, without limitation, any surrender or disclaimer of the Franchise Agreement by the trustee in bankruptcy of Master Franchisee; (4) Franchisor's consent or acquiescence to any bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency, or any other creditor's proceedings of or against Master Franchisee, or by the winding-up or dissolution of Master Franchisee, or any other event or occurrence which would have the effect at law of terminating the existence of Master Franchisee's obligations prior to the termination of the Master Franchise Agreement; or (5) by any other agreements or other dealings between Franchisor and Master Franchisee having the effect of amending or altering the Master Franchise Agreement or Master Franchisee's obligations under this Guarantee, or by any want of notice by Franchisor to Master Franchisee of any default of Master Franchisee or by any other matter, thing, act, or omission of Franchisor whatsoever.",
                "changed_text": "F. Guarantors' obligations under this Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect, except in cases of gross negligence by the Franchisor, in which case the obligations of the Guarantors may be reduced proportionally to the Franchisor's negligence, as determined solely by the Franchisor.",
                "explanation": "The original clause attempts to create an unconditional guarantee. The modified clause introduces an exception based on the Franchisor's gross negligence, but gives the Franchisor the sole discretion to determine the extent of their negligence and the resulting reduction in the Guarantors' obligations. This creates a conflict of interest and undermines the enforceability of the guarantee.",

                "original_text": "Eligible Pin Codes may be entered on the www.charitytunes.com website and  corresponding music downloaded from October 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010. Pin Codes entered for redemption after 11:59:59  pm PT on March 31, 2010 may be rejected as ineligible. The contents of this section are to be reflected in the Sponsor's rules  for the Promotion.",

Pin Codes entered for redemption after 11:59:59  pm PT on March 31, 2010 may be rejected as ineligible. The contents of this section may or may not be reflected in the Sponsor's rules for the Promotion.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'are' to 'may or may not', the enforceability of the promotion's terms is weakened. The mandatory aspect of reflecting the redemption period in the Sponsor's rules is now ambiguous, giving Sponsor room to argue the terms were not binding.",
                "contradicted_law": "Likely violates Canadian consumer protection laws requiring clear and unambiguous terms and conditions for promotional offers. Since the promotion applies to Canada, the change could cause issues with provincial laws related to advertising and fair trade practices.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will provide' to 'will try to provide' weakens the warranty provided by Charity Tunes. It introduces an element of uncertainty, allowing Charity Tunes to potentially avoid liability if it fails to provide the promised downloads.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially breaches Canadian contract law regarding warranties and guarantees, especially if the 'try' is interpreted as not fulfilling the basic obligation of the contract.",

                "explanation": "Changing the required consent from 'written' to 'verbal' makes it significantly harder to prove that consent was actually given, potentially leading to disputes about assignments. The addition of the phrase 'In some cases, a written consent may be needed' contradicts the initial statement by introducing ambiguity and leaving room for interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates Canadian contract law. While verbal agreements can be binding, assignment clauses typically require written consent for clarity and enforceability.",

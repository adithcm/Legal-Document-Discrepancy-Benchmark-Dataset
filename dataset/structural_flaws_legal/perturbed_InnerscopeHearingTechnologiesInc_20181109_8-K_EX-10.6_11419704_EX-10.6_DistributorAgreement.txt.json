In the event the parties are unable to resolve any such dispute to binding arbitration for settlement in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, the arbitrator will determine the manner in which the parties are to pay the costs of such arbitration, including reasonable attorneys' fees. Any arbitration shall be conducted at a time and place of mutual convenience to the parties.",
                "explanation": "By adding that arbitration should be conducted at a time and place of mutual convenience to both parties can lead to delays and difficulties in initiating the process due to differing interpretations. Making a change in the text of the arbitration clause weakens it. Arbitration clauses are legally required to be conspicuous and without ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "By adding the qualification \"If the products are purchased for personal use, warranty may not apply,\" creates uncertainty in the scope of the warranty.

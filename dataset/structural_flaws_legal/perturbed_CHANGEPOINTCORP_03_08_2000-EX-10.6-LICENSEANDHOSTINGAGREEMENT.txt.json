This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding conflict of laws provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Any disputes arising out of this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"RULES\"). The arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules in San Francisco County, California. A judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction of the parties, including without limitation the courts in San Francisco, California. The non-prevailing party in the arbitration shall pay all fees and charges of the American Arbitration Association; each party, however, shall be responsible for the payment of all fees and expenses connected with the presentation of its respective case.",

Any other services not provided for under this Agreement shall be subject to the terms of a separate agreement between the parties at a cost to Corio of twenty percent (20%) off Changepoint's standard fees for the applicable services. 14.3 CHOICE OF LAW; ARBITRATION; VENUE. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding conflict of laws provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Any disputes arising out of this Agreement may be resolved by arbitration, which arbitration process shall follow a mutually agreeable procedure and happen in a mutually agreeable venue. Each party shall be responsible for the payment of all fees and expenses connected with the presentation of its respective case.",
                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause to a location where it doesn't naturally belong (Section 13.4) creates a legal contradiction because arbitration clauses are typically found in dispute resolution sections. Additionally, weakening the wording from \"binding arbitration\" to a permissive \"may be resolved by arbitration\" and removing the reference to American Arbitration Association rules introduces ambiguity, making the clause less enforceable. Finally, removing the segment about 'non-prevailing party shall pay all fees' removes any mention of which party will incur the charges of the arbitration which makes the process less clear.",

Additionally, Changepoint agrees to provide Corio with marketing and sales presentation materials. During the term of this Agreement, Corio agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop joint customer references or testimonials. Corio and Changepoint agree that they will promote each other as a leading PSA Application vendor and a leading Enterprise ASP, respectively, as long as the preferred relationship between the parties continues in effect as set forth in Section 2.10 of this Agreement. 2.7 RESTRICTIONS. Corio may only copy, distribute, reproduce, use or allow access to the Software if explicitly permitted under this Agreement, and Corio shall, nor will it permit any third party to, modify, adapt, translate, prepare derivative works from, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive source code from the Software or any internal data files generated by the Software only if mutually agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "The placement of the restriction clause within the 'Sales and Marketing Efforts' section makes it less prominent and harder to find. By changing \"Corio may not\" to \"Corio may only\" it changes from a hard restriction to an apparent permission, requiring the reader to carefully examine the rest of the sentence to identify what conditions allow such actions to take place. Lastly, the qualification of \"only if mutually agreed upon\" after the original hard-restrictions weakens the hard legal wording which introduces a contradictory clause to the original.",

For purposes of this          Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" means the definition given to          that term in such non-disclosure agreement. The parties agree that          Changepoint's Software and Documentation (except that Documentation          which this Agreement contemplates will be provided to Customers) shall          be deemed Confidential Information subject to that non-disclosure          agreement. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall also be          deemed Confidential Information subject to that non-disclosure          agreement, but the terms of this Agreement may be disclosed by a party          in connection with a significant transaction involving the merger or          sale of all or a substantial part of the assets of the receiving party.          Further, each party represents and warrants that their respective          employees, agents, contractors or consultants that will be provided the          other party's confidential information have or will have signed          agreements with customary terms containing confidentiality provisions          and assignment of inventions (\"EMPLOYEE NDA/INVENTION AGREEMENT\"). Each          party covenants that during the term of this Agreement, it will          continue to require all of such employees, agents, contractors or          consultants to sign an Employee NDA/Invention Agreement.",

Changepoint shall provide Corio with training as reasonably requested by Corio to train Corio's technical and support personnel regarding implementation, use and operation of the Software at no charge to Corio as set forth in the Statement of Work. Upon completion of the Statement of Work, during the first year of this Agreement, Changepoint shall provide training to Corio employees at Corio's request subject to payment of Changepoint's standard training fees at a *** discount. Corio Customers may receive training directly from Changepoint at Changepoint's normal training fees. Corio shall otherwise be responsible for training its Customers regarding the Software. Throughout the term of this Agreement, Changepoint shall provide Corio with training materials and instruction manuals and the right to re-distribute these training materials and instruction manuals to its Customers of the Software solely in connection with the Corio Services. Further, the parties shall work together and cooperate to train Corio's sales force and product consultants on the Software and the alliance contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation, how to position, sell and demonstrate the Software to potential customers. 10 CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\n         Each party agrees that it may use any Confidential          Information received from the other party other than as expressly          permitted under the terms of the non-disclosure agreement in effect          between the parties dated October 29, 1999, which is incorporated          herein by reference and made a part hereof, but this shall not limit information available for sale and other uses. For purposes of this          Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" is information that is not public. The parties agree that          Changepoint's Software and Documentation (except that Documentation          which this Agreement contemplates will be provided to Customers) shall          be deemed Confidential Information subject to that non-disclosure          agreement. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall also be          deemed Confidential Information subject to that non-disclosure          agreement, but the terms of this Agreement may be disclosed by a party.          Further, each party represents and warrants that their respective          employees, agents, contractors or consultants that will be provided the          other party's confidential information have or will have signed          agreements with customary terms containing confidentiality provisions.",
                "explanation": "Moving the confidentiality clause into the training section reduces its prominence. Changing \"shall not use\" to \"may use\" contradicts the original restriction. Furthermore, the qualification of \"but this shall not limit information available for sale and other uses\" adds a massive loophole, directly undermining the purpose of the clause, making it uncertain if this section is restricting anything. Changing 'Confidential Information' to 'information that is not public' weakens the definition, making it more difficult to prove what was considered confidential, further weakening this section.",

Annual Fees; Playoff Payment.\n\n  (a) In consideration for the Benefits, during each Contract Year of the Term, Sponsor shall pay Club, in accordance with this Section 3(a) and Section 2(d) of the Terms and Conditions, the amount set forth next to the applicable Contract Year below (the \"Annual Fee\").\n\n First Contract Year (2018/19):\t$ 200,000\n Second Contract Year (2019/20):\t$ 204,000\n Third Contract Year (2020/21):\t$ 208,080\n Fourth Contract Year (2021/22):\t$ 212,240\n Fifth Contract Year (2022/23):\t$ 216,490\n\nSponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) equal installments, each due on or prior to the 1st of each month between June and November of the applicable Contract Year.",

This Agreement contains the complete understanding between the parties hereto and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous written or verbal agreements or understandings (including but not limited to all negotiations, term sheets, letters of intent, presentations, and prior drafts of this Agreement) relating to the subject matter hereof.  In consideration for the Benefits, during each Contract Year of the Term, Sponsor shall pay Club, in accordance with this Section 3(a) and Section 2(d) of the Terms and Conditions, the amount set forth next to the applicable Contract Year below (the \"Annual Fee\").\n\n First Contract Year (2018/19):\t$ 200,000\n Second Contract Year (2019/20):\t$ 204,000\n Third Contract Year (2020/21):\t$ 208,080\n Fourth Contract Year (2021/22):\t$ 212,240\n Fifth Contract Year (2022/23):\t$ 216,490\n\nSponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) equal installments, each due on or prior to the 1st of each month between June and November of the applicable Contract Year. This Agreement may not be amended or otherwise modified except in a writing specifically referring to this Agreement and signed by authorized representatives of Sponsor and Club.",
                "explanation": "The section regarding Annual Fees and Payment schedule has been moved to be embedded within the Integration and Amendment section. This obscures the key financial terms of the contract, making them harder to find and potentially increasing the risk that the sponsor will overlook them. This introduces ambiguity as financial terms are generally in its own section.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"shall be subject to, and Sponsor shall at times comply with\" to \"may, at times, be subject to terms and conditions\" significantly weakens the binding nature of the Terms and Conditions. This introduces ambiguity and contradiction, as it makes it uncertain whether the terms and conditions are always applicable. It also moves the key compliance obligation into the 'Definitions' section where it will likely be missed.",

                "explanation": "By adding \"Any notice or other communication under this Agreement may be delivered via carrier pigeon\" to a standard counterpart section, this creates an explicit allowance for an archaic and unreliable method of communication. This directly contradicts the original clear and legally sound methods specified for delivering notice. This is also placed in the wrong section.",

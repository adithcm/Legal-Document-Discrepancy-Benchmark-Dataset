(ii) Each Party (A) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery or other federal or state courts of the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (C) agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery or other federal or state courts of the State of Delaware, and each Party irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury and (D) each Party irrevocably consents to service of process by a reputable overnight mail delivery service, signature requested, to the address of such Party's principal place of business or as otherwise provided by applicable law.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury' to 'waives the right to trial by jury' and 'reputable overnight mail delivery service, signature requested,' to 'first class mail' weakens the enforceability of the jurisdiction clause. The removal of 'irrevocably' suggests the waiver might be revocable, and switching to standard mail instead of requiring signature upon receipt for service of process introduces ambiguity about proof of service.",

                "explanation": "Adding the clause 'unless both parties are in agreement' gives the breaching party an out, contradictory to the intention of protecting the other party in the event of a breach. Now, even if a breach occurred prior to termination, it can be disregarded if both parties agree, essentially nullifying the original provision's protection.",

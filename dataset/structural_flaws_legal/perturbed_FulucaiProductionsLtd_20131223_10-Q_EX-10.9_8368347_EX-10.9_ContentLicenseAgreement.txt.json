                "original_text": "15. Governing Law. All questions with respect to the construction of this Agreement, and the rights and liabilities of the Parties hereto, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida. The Parties also agree that the venue for this Agreement shall be in the County of Brevard, Florida. The Parties expressly waive any claim to jurisdiction in any federal or other state forum or venue in any other county or place. In the event of any controversy, claim or dispute between the Parties hereto, including, but not limited to, any action at law or in equity, including any action for declaratory or injunctive relief, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover from the losing Party all of his or her actual attorney's fees and costs in bringing, prosecuting, or defending said action.",
                "changed_text": "11. Monetization of Content. The Producer agrees and authorizes ConvergTV, its subsidiaries, agents and/or assigns to monetize the Producer's Program and content by traditional ad (commercial) insertion; product placement; branded programming; overlays; interactive advertising; merchandise; utilization of brand value; syndication (theatrical, televised, mobile, OTT, Internet, IPTV); social media television; interactive television; mobile app sales; cable, satellite, OTT, IPTV, mobile subscriber fees; subscription and premium distribution and any and all methods of content monetization that may now or in the future exist, by and on any and all known or future means of content distribution. All questions with respect to the construction of this Agreement, and the rights and liabilities of the Parties hereto, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida. The Parties also agree that the venue for this Agreement shall be in the County of Brevard, Florida. The Parties expressly waive any claim to jurisdiction in any federal or other state forum or venue in any other county or place.

                "explanation": "Relocating the governing law clause to the 'Monetization of Content' section makes it less prominent and harder to locate for a party reviewing the contract. Normally, governing law is located in a separate section to make it apparent. Placing it within a dense paragraph about monetization reduces its visibility, undermining its enforceability.",

Producer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless ConvergTV and its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents, and their respective successors or assigns, from all costs, expenses and damages arising from any breach or alleged breach of the warranties made by it in this Agreement.\n\nProducer shall further indemnify, defend and hold harmless ConvergTV and its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents, and their respective successors or assigns, from all costs, expenses and damages arising from any costs, errors, omissions, slander, losses, liability or for any other cause as a direct or indirect result of the Distribution, transmission or publication of the Producer's Program or content.",

Delivery.\n(a) The Program shall be delivered to ConvergTV utilizing English as the primary language unless otherwise specified or as indicated in the Deal Terms.\n(b) The Program will conform to and be delivered in accordance with Exhibit A.\n(c) The Program must be saved as executable files (NOT as playable DVD/Blu-Ray movies).\n(d) The Program materials delivered to ConvergTV shall be duplicate copies, and ConvergTV disclaims liability for any damage or loss to any original master delivered by Producer to ConvergTV.\nProducer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless ConvergTV and its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents, and their respective successors or assigns, from all costs, expenses and damages arising from any breach or alleged breach of the warranties made by it in this Agreement.\n\nProducer shall further indemnify, defend and hold harmless ConvergTV and its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents, and their respective successors or assigns, from all costs, expenses and damages arising from any costs, errors, omissions, slander, losses, liability or for any other cause as a direct or indirect result of the Distribution, transmission or publication of the Producer's Program or content.",
                "explanation": "The indemnification clause is moved to the 'Delivery' section, which is typically focused on the logistical aspects of content transfer. This misplacement makes the clause less conspicuous and harder to find, potentially reducing its enforceability as it is not where one would reasonably expect to find such a significant liability provision. Because it relates to a breach of contract it should remain in it's own section, or a section labeled liability.",

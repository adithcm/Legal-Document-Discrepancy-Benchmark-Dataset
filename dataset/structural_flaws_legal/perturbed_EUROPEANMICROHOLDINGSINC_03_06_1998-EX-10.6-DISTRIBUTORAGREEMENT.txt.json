                "explanation": "This introduces ambiguity into the governing law clause. By stating \"State of England\" the validity of the agreement is contested. The location of the contract is not in the State of England. This makes it difficult to enforce. In addition, changing to the 1980 U.N. Convention in Contracts for the International Sale of Goods contests the international aspect of the original contract.",

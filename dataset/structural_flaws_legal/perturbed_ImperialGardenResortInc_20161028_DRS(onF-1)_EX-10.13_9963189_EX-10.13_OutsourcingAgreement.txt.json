                "original_text": "Article XI. Disputes Resolving Both parties herein agree to resolve any dispute regarding interpretation of the Contract in the following methods: I. Should both Parties be unable to reach an agreement within one month through negotiation, they may apply for an arbitration in Miaoli County and the arbitration result shall be compulsory. II. Should either Party herein initiate a legal proceeding for revoking any arbitration result regarding the Contract, both Parties herein agree to take the Miaoli District Court of Taiwan as the competent court of first instance pursuant to the laws of the R.O.C..",
                "changed_text": "Article VI. Exclusions The service fee shall not include the fees for land measurement and boundary identification, geological drilling, meeting relevant land administration regulations, air pollution prevention, meeting relevant construction regulations, security system monitoring, scrivener service, deposit of soil and water conservation, review of the competent authority, attendance of concerned experts and scholars and meeting relevant administrative regulations. Both parties herein agree to resolve any dispute regarding interpretation of the Contract in the following methods: I. Should both Parties be unable to reach an agreement within one month through negotiation, they may apply for an arbitration in Miaoli County. II. Should either Party herein initiate a legal proceeding for revoking any arbitration result regarding the Contract, both Parties herein agree to take the Miaoli District Court of Taiwan as the competent court of first instance pursuant to the laws of the R.O.C..",
                "explanation": "The original section on Dispute Resolution mandates arbitration in Miaoli County. By moving the arbitration clause to the 'Exclusions' section, its prominence and enforceability are reduced. The 'Exclusions' section usually covers items not included in the service fee, making it less likely for parties to review it for dispute resolution processes. Furthermore, removing the 'compulsory' nature of the arbitration makes the sentence a suggestion rather than a mandate.",

Service Fee The fees for services mentioned in Part I to Part VI are NTD 12 million ((SAY TWELVE MILLION ONLY) in total and the fees for planning and design of the buildings and construction monitoring shall be calculated based on the ratio of 3.50% of the legal construction cost hereof.

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' introduces uncertainty regarding who is responsible for extra costs from plan modifications. This ambiguity weakens the original clear obligation on Party A and could lead to disputes over payment. It removes a clear financial obligation of one party in favor of an uncertain one.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall designate' to 'may designate' in the 'Special Terms' section introduces ambiguity regarding the payment process for professional services. Originally, the clause mandated a specific procedure. Now, it's optional, creating potential disputes over how professional fees are handled and potentially delaying project timelines due to payment uncertainties.",

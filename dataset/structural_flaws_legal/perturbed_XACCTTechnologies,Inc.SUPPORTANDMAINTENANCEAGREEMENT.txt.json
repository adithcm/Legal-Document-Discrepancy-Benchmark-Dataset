                "original_text": "THE TERMS OF THE LICENSE AGREEMENT PERTAINING TO LIMITED WARRANTY,          DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE          MAJOR AND MINOR RELEASES OF PRODUCT DELIVERED ACCORDING TO THIS          AGREEMENT.",
                "changed_text": "THE TERMS OF THE LICENSE AGREEMENT PERTAINING TO LIMITED WARRANTY SHALL APPLY IF THE LICENSEE ACCEPTS ADDITIONAL TERMS. DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER NEGOTIATION.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the applicability of the License Agreement's warranty and liability terms. The original text clearly states their applicability. The modified text introduces uncertainty by making the limited warranty conditional and suggesting that disclaimers and limitations are negotiable, contradicting the original agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - creates ambiguity regarding the enforceability of warranty disclaimers and liability limitations.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that disputes be resolved in California courts. The modified clause gives XACCT sole discretion over the dispute resolution method, potentially overriding the original jurisdiction clause and introducing uncertainty about how disputes will be handled. This contradicts the specific jurisdiction agreement.",

This introduces ambiguity and contradicts the original clause's defined liability limit, making it unclear what the actual remedy is and weakening the enforceability of the liability cap.",

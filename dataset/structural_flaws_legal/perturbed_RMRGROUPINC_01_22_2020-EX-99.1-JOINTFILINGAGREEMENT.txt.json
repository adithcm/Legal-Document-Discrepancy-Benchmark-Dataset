                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the Schedule 13G/A with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of The RMR Group Inc., dated as of December 31, 2019, is, and any amendments thereto (including amendments on Schedule 13D) signed by each of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of each of us pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the Schedule 13G/A with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of The RMR Group Inc., dated as of December 31, 2019, is, and any amendments thereto (including amendments on Schedule 13D) signed by each of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of each of us; however, this agreement is subject to change based on the discretion of the signatories and may not fully adhere to Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'however, this agreement is subject to change based on the discretion of the signatories and may not fully adhere to Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended', the obligatory nature of the agreement is undermined. This creates a contradiction where the filing is initially agreed upon according to SEC rules, but then made subject to discretionary changes that might violate those same rules, affecting enforceability.",

                "explanation": "Moving the mandatory arbitration clause to the definition of Confidentiality buries it in an unrelated section, making it more difficult for a party to find and understand the implications of this clause.

                "explanation": "By moving the \"No Third-Party Beneficiaries\" clause to Section 5.11 which is about ownership of GIE, it creates confusion. The relocation reduces its visibility and impact, especially for those who are not party to the agreement, such as Certificate Owners, thus misleading the consumers.",

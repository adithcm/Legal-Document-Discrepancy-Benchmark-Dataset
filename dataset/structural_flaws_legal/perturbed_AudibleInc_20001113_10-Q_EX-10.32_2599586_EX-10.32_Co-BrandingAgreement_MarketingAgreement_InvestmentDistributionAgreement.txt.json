                "original_text": "11.12 Venue.  Company hereby irrevocably consents to non-exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington, with respect to any claim, action or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement and agrees not to commence or prosecute any such claim, action or proceeding other than in the aforementioned courts.",
                "changed_text": "11.12 Venue.  Company hereby consents to non-exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington, with respect to any claim, action or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement and may commence or prosecute any such claim, action or proceeding in a jurisdiction of Company's choosing.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'irrevocably consents' to 'consents' and introducing 'may commence or prosecute any such claim, action or proceeding in a jurisdiction of Company's choosing,' the modified clause creates ambiguity and potential contradiction. The original clause clearly specifies King County, Washington, as the venue, but the revised clause gives Company the option to choose another jurisdiction, making the venue provision uncertain and more difficult to enforce. In case of a dispute, it is less clear where the case would be held.",

                "changed_text": "11.11 Choice of Law.  This Agreement will be interpreted, construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Washington unless it is explicitly specified that the laws of another state apply.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless it is explicitly specified that the laws of another state apply' introduces a contradiction. The original clause firmly establishes Washington law as governing the agreement. The added phrase creates uncertainty, suggesting that another state's laws could supersede Washington's, potentially weakening the enforceability and clarity of the initial choice of law provision. It introduces doubt about which jurisdiction's laws will ultimately govern.",

Any notice or other communication under this Agreement given by either Party to the other Party will be in writing and, to be effective, must be sent to the intended recipient by prepaid registered letter, receipted commercial courier, or electronically receipted facsimile transmission (acknowledged in like manner by the intended recipient) at its address specified below its signature at the end of this Agreement, and in the case of ACSI, with a copy to Amazon.com, Inc., 1200 12th Avenue South, Suite 1200, Seattle, WA 98144, USA, Facsimile: (206) 266-7010 Attn: General Counsel and in the case of Company, with a copy to Audible Inc., Facsimile 973-890-0178, Attn: Vice President, Business & Legal Affairs; provided, that no notice of  termination of this Agreement shall be deemed properly given unless sent by prepaid registered mail to such address(es) and to the attention of such officer(s).

                "explanation": "The new notice term contradicts what was previously written. The initial terms define the way notice is to be provided by the involved parties. With the changes, the effectiveness of future notices becomes uncertain and difficult to enforce. It allows a party to potentially claim that a notice was ineffective because it was not sent through registered mail or another traceable method, as the initial contract required.",

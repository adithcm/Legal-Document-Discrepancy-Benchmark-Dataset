Customer Information includes, by way of example and not limitation, name, address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth and personal financial information. The parties shall establish and maintain safeguards against the unauthorized access, destruction, loss or alteration of Customer Information in their control, which are no less rigorous than those maintained by a party for its own information of a similar nature.

The Servicing Agent represents that it has implemented and maintains a comprehensive written information security program that contains appropriate security measures to safeguard Customer Information that the Servicing Agent receives, stores, maintains, processes or otherwise accesses in connection with the provision of services hereunder, including protecting such Customer Information against cyber attack.",

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly specifies the Servicing Agent should maintain a 'comprehensive written information security program', but the modified version weakens this requirement by stating that the Servicing agent maintains a 'limited information security program'. Furthermore, it introduces ambiguity by stating 'details of such program are not specified and are subject to change', this change contradicts the intent of Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, by allowing potentially inadequate data protection measures without clearly defined security protocols.",

Such fee will be computed daily and payable monthly by Nationwide within thirty (30) days of receipt from you of a valid invoice (in excel format) that identifies, for each CUSIP of each Fund, the number of sub-accounts, participants or beneficial shareholders serviced by you and such other information as may be necessary to validate the fee payable. The fee rate stated above may be prospectively increased or decreased by the Funds and/or Nationwide, in their sole discretion, at any time upon notice to you. Further, Nationwide or a Fund may, in its sole discretion and without notice, suspend or withdraw the sale of such Shares, including the sale of such Shares to you for the account of any customer(s). Nationwide, in its sole discretion, may arrange for the payment to you of the fees under this Agreement directly by the Funds rather than through Nationwide.",

                "explanation": "The insertion of 'mutual agreement' creates a contradiction. Originally, the clause allows Nationwide or a fund to 'suspend or withdraw the sale of such shares' at their sole discretion. The change requires mutual agreement which restricts Nationwide's right and makes the term unclear.",

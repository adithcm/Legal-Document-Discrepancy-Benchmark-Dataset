                "explanation": "The reordering of these two paragraphs obfuscates the warranty disclaimer. The original placement clearly sets the disclaimer apart. The change buries the important warranty disclaimer within a clause limiting liability, reducing its prominence and making it less likely to be noticed by the Client, potentially affecting its enforceability under California law which requires clear and conspicuous disclaimers.",

Any and all disputes between the parties that cannot be settled by mutual agreement shall be resolved solely and exclusively in the state or federal courts located within San Luis Obispo County, California, and each party consents to the jurisdiction of such courts and irrevocably waives any objections thereto, including without limitation, on the basis of improper venue or forum non conveniens.",

Any and all disputes between the parties that cannot be settled by mutual agreement shall be resolved solely and exclusively in the state or federal courts located within San Luis Obispo County, California; however, either party may elect to pursue arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution method, but this decision is not binding and can be revoked at any time before a judgement is rendered.",
                "explanation": "The addition of the arbitration clause introduces contradiction—the first part states that disputes are resolved in San Luis Obispo County, but the latter part allows for arbitration. This contradicts the original clause's jurisdiction requirement, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this JSMA, including without limitation any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, that is not resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth below in Section 13.3, shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama in the City of Mobile, unless that court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction or declines jurisdiction, in which case any such dispute shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State Court for the State of Alabama, City of Mobile, as described in the following paragraphs. Any counterclaim arising out of, or in connection with, the dispute shall be brought in the same proceeding.",

The modified text reverses this order, prioritizing the State Court. This change could affect the speed and cost of litigation, as well as the specific rules of procedure that apply, which introduces doubt. It could also be read that any decision is up to the jurisdiction of Alabama, without taking into account the jurisdiction of the United States.",

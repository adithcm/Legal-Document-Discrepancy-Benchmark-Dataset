                "explanation": "Moving the essential part of the Governing Law and Dispute Resolution clause into the 'Miscellaneous' section and then making it completely toothless introduces contradiction and reduces enforceability, making it hard to enforce because it allows either party to choose any dispute resolution method, contradicting the initial arbitration clause and undermining the predictability of dispute resolution.",

                "explanation": "This alteration to Clause 8.1 effectively removes the mandatory requirement for both QIWI and OICL to maintain agents for service of process in England and Wales, thus undermining the clarity of service of process and creates a legal contradiction. By removing this mandatory step, it introduces uncertainty about how legal documents should be served, potentially leading to disputes over proper notification and making enforcement of the agreement more difficult.",

                "explanation": "By stating that 'all decisions of the Steering Committee shall be binding on the Parties regardless of whether or not such decision is properly approved/ratified', there is a clear contradiction, because it is not needed for respective approval or ratification.",

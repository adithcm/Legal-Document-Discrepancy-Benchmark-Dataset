Nothing herein shall prevent LBIO from making any reports or disclosures required under Law or by a relevant governmental or regulatory authority. Moreover, nothing herein shall prevent LBIO from disclosing any information relating to this Agreement and/or the Research for the purpose of making any regulatory or other submissions, patent applications and pursuing patent prosecution.",
                "changed_text": "MD Anderson and Principal Investigator recognize that LBIO may be required under Law to report to the relevant governmental or regulatory authorities or publicly disclose information related to this Agreement and/or the Research. However, LBIO's decision to disclose any information related to this agreement is completely at their discretion and without any obligations.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states LBIO 'may be required' to disclose certain information under laws like the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. The modified version adds a contradictory statement that LBIO's decision to disclose information is 'completely at their discretion and without any obligations,' thereby undermining the original disclosure requirement and creating ambiguity.",

The Parties agree that any dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to any interpretation, construction, performance or breach of this Agreement may be brought in a United States District Court in Texas, or if such court does not accept jurisdiction or will not accept jurisdiction, in any court of general jurisdiction in the State of Texas.",

The Parties agree that any dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be resolved through binding arbitration at a location of mutual convenience.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that disputes will be resolved in a United States District Court in Texas, or if such court does not accept jurisdiction or will not accept jurisdiction, in any court of general jurisdiction in the State of Texas. The modified version mandates 'binding arbitration,' removing the option of court resolution and potentially contradicting the original agreement regarding jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "The original representation provides a detailed assurance that MD Anderson and its representatives have not violated specific healthcare fraud, abuse, and privacy regulations. The modified version weakens this representation significantly by qualifying it with \"to the best of their current knowledge.\" This creates a contradiction, as it allows for potential violations to exist if MD Anderson or its representatives are unaware of them, thereby reducing the enforceability of the original assurance.",

This Agreement shall be governed and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed exclusively in that State without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.",
                "changed_text": "5.5 Arbitration. In the event of any dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement, the parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall take place in Carson City, Nevada.",
                "explanation": "Moving a critical clause regarding dispute resolution (arbitration) from the 'General Provisions' section to the 'Site; Site Management' section, where it is less likely to be noticed, affects its enforceability. Since the contract states governing law is New York, it is expected legal disputes will be resolved in New York under New York law, however the change imposes mandatory arbitration in Nevada. This change impacts clarity and enforceability.",

                "explanation": "Introducing a contradiction by undermining the enforceability clause (10.3 Assignment) by introducing clause 7.3 Non-binding agreement. This undermines the entire contract, as it renders the contract potentially unenforceable.",

Changing the entire agreement section to allow unilateral modification introduces contradiction and reduces the enforceability of the contract.

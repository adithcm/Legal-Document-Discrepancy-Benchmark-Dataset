                "original_text": "8.7 Dispute Resolution. Any and all disputes of whatever nature, arising between the Parties of this Agreement or the underlying business  relationship, including termination thereof and statutory claims, and which are not resolved between the parties themselves, shall be submitted to  binding and final arbitration to be conducted in English, in Los Angeles, California, before a panel of three arbitrators in accordance with the  Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association for Complex Commercial Cases in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Judgment upon the award of the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. In the event of any proceeding in arbitration  between the Parties arising in any manner out of this Agreement or the asserted breach thereof, the prevailing party shall recover court costs or  costs of arbitration, as appropriate, and reasonable attorneys' fees.",
                "changed_text": "8.7 Dispute Resolution. Any and all disputes of whatever nature, arising between the Parties of this Agreement or the underlying business relationship, including termination thereof and statutory claims, and which are not resolved between the parties themselves, shall be submitted to a method of dispute resolution to be determined at the time a dispute arises. The parties shall then mutually agree on whether to pursue arbitration, mediation, or litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own legal costs.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandated binding arbitration in Los Angeles, CA. The modified version removes the binding arbitration clause and replaces it with a vague agreement to determine a dispute resolution method later. This reduces enforceability by making the dispute resolution process uncertain and subject to mutual agreement, which may not be achievable.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct' introduces a contradiction. The original clause was a blanket waiver of consequential damages. Now, liability for consequential damages is permitted under specific circumstances, creating ambiguity and making the clause less enforceable. The initial 'IN NO EVENT' is now contradicted by the exception.",

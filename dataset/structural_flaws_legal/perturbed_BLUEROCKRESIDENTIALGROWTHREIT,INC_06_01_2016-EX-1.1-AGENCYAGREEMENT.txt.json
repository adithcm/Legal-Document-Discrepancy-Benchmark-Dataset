Each of the Transaction Entities and the Manager (on its behalf and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on behalf of its stockholders and affiliates) and the Agent hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.",

The headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of, or to affect the meaning or interpretation of, this Agreement.\n\n17. Trial by Jury. Each of the Transaction Entities and the Manager (on its behalf and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on behalf of its stockholders and affiliates) and the Agent hereby waives, to the limited extent permitted by applicable law, its right to trial by jury relating to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly waives the right to a jury trial to the fullest extent permitted by law. The modified clause significantly reduces the extent of the waiver to a 'limited extent,' creating a legal contradiction regarding the scope and enforceability of the jury trial waiver. Additionally, moving this disclosure to a section regarding headings and interpretations buries a legally important clause that deals with financial liability and potential fraud and could hinder its notice to involved parties. The alteration of the original contract alters the terms that can be enforced in court.",

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states New York law governs the agreement. The addition of 'except where the company deems another state or federal law more appropriate' introduces ambiguity and contradiction. The added phrase lets the company choose what applicable law to use, which undermines the original agreement and leads to a legal contradiction.",

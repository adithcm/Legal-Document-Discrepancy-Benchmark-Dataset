                "explanation": "The dispute resolution clause, specifically the part about seeking equitable relief for trademark breaches, has been moved to the section about trademark ownership and licenses. This disrupts the standard structure of contracts, where dispute resolution is typically a standalone section, and makes it less clear that this remedy applies to other disputes in the contract. It also introduces ambiguity by intermingling it within clauses regarding trademark usage and licenses.",

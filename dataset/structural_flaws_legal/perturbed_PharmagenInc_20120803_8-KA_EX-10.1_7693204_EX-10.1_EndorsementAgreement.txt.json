In connection with any HDS' usage of Celebrity Attributes as outlined above in Paragraphs 3(A)-(C), HDS will\nfeature the following disclaimer in close proximity to said usage: \"PAUL SILAS IS NOT A MEDICAL\nAUTHORITY. THESE STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG\nADMINISTRATION. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT INTENDED TO DIAGNOSE, TREAT, CURE OR PREVENT\nANY DISEASE.\"",

                "explanation": "The original disclaimer is mandatory due to potential claims about the product's effects. Changing this to optional, and placing the decision with the marketing department, reduces the likelihood that consumers will be properly informed that the FDA has not evaluated the product and that the celebrity is not a medical authority.",

The parties agree that the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, the Superior Court of Cobb\nCounty, the State Court of Cobb County, or any other forum in Cobb County shall have personal jurisdiction over the\nparties and that such courts shall be the exclusive venue with respect to any claims or disputes related to the\nAgreement.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a clear and agreed-upon jurisdiction (Cobb County, Georgia) for dispute resolution. The modified clause replaces this with a random selection process, potentially leading to unpredictable and inconvenient locations for resolving disputes. This uncertainty contradicts the principle of clear jurisdiction and forum selection, hindering the ability to enforce the contract predictably.",

This clause is subject to quarterly review and renegotiation at HDS' discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original indemnity clause provides clear protection for the celebrity against liabilities arising from HDS's actions. The modified version makes the indemnity discretionary and subject to change, significantly weakening the celebrity's protection.

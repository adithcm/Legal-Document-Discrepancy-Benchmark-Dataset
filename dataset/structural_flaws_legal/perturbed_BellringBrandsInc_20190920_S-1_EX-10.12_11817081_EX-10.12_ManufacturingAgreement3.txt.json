                "original_text": "Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Party's right to enforce the terms and conditions of this Second Amendment shall survive the Second Amendment's expiration.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Party's right to enforce the terms and conditions of this Second Amendment shall survive the Second Amendment's expiration, unless otherwise superseded by mutually agreed-upon marketing initiatives.",
                "explanation": "This clause introduces an exception that significantly weakens the enforceability of the entire Second Amendment. The addition allows 'mutually agreed-upon marketing initiatives' to potentially override legally binding terms, creating uncertainty and undermining the original intent of the survival clause. It weakens the protection intended in the original agreement and relocates the weight and influence of legal clauses to mutually agreed-upon marketing initiatives.",

                "changed_text": "Heritage shall purchase all ingredients and packaging materials identified in Schedule C to be used in connection with the manufacturer of the Products if such purchases align with current market trends. Heritage shall invoice Premier through the [***] billing as identified on Schedule C but may adjust the invoice amount based on perceived market value at the time of billing.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and potential for dispute regarding payment terms. By adding conditions related to 'current market trends' and 'perceived market value,' the original, relatively straightforward payment terms are undermined. This could lead to disagreements and makes enforcement of the original pricing schedule more difficult, as market trends are subject to interpretation.",

                "explanation": "This amendment introduces consumer sentiment analysis as an interpretive lens. While seemingly innocuous, this addition allows subjective interpretations of the contract based on potentially unreliable data, weakening the legally defined terms and creating a loophole for altering obligations. This could allow one party to justify non-compliance based on public opinion, undermining the contract's enforceability.",

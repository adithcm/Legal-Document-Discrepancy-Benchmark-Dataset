Any disputes between the parties to the Agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration, the location of which shall be decided at the sole discretion of JHU. Both parties agree to waive their right to a jury trial.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that disputes are to be brought in Maryland courts. The modified text introduces a contradiction by mandating binding arbitration instead. This removes the right to litigation and gives JHU control over the arbitration location, potentially creating an unfair advantage and making it difficult for the Company to enforce its rights, thus is contradicting any clear process.",

Therefore, JHU requires Company to protect JHU and Inventors from such exposure to the same manner and extent to which insurance, if available, would protect JHU and Inventors. JHU and the Inventors will not, under the provisions of this Agreement or otherwise, have control over the manner in which Company or those operating for its account or third parties who purchase LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S) from any of the foregoing entities, practice the inventions of LICENSED PRODUCT(S) and LICENSED SERVICE(S). The Company shall indemnify, defend with counsel reasonably acceptable to JHU, and hold JHU, The Johns Hopkins Health Systems, their representatives including but not limited to present and former, trustees, officers, Inventors, agents, faculty, employees and students harmless as against any judgments, fees, expenses, or other costs arising from or incidental to any product liability or other lawsuit, claim, demand or other action brought as a consequence of the practice of said inventions by any of the foregoing entities, whether or not JHU or said Inventors, either jointly or severally, is/are named as a party defendant in any such lawsuit. Practice of the inventions covered by LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S) by an agent or a third party on behalf of or for the account of the Company, or by a third party who purchases LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S) from the Company, shall be considered the Company's practice of said inventions for purposes of this Paragraph 9.7. The obligation of the Company to defend and indemnify as set out in this Paragraph 9.7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall not be limited by any other limitation of liability elsewhere in the Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original indemnification clause places unlimited liability on the Company. The modification introduces a limitation of liability, capping it at the total license fees paid to JHU. This contradicts the preceding sentences that require full indemnification regardless of any limitation of liability in the agreement. Such contradiction introduces ambiguity.",

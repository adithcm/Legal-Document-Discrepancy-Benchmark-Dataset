                "original_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES, WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT OR ITS BREACH.",
                "changed_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ONLY IF BOTH PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE IN WRITING. If such agreement is not met, normal damages would apply.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides an unconditional waiver of consequential, exemplary, special, incidental or punitive damages, which is very typical. The altered text introduces a condition of 'mutual agreement' that can be reasonably used to apply normal damages and thus weakens the enforceability of the damage waiver. This can be seen as misleading and contradictory.",

The\nparties agree that each of them hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the New York State and federal courts for the purpose of resolving any\ndispute arising under this Agreement and that the exclusive venue for resolution of such disputes shall be state or federal courts located in\nMonroe County, New York.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement is to be governed and construed according to the laws of the State of New York, but the location of resolution of disputes shall be determined through mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "While the contract initially states that it's governed by the laws of the state of New York, the changed text eliminates the specification of Monroe County as the exclusive venue and instead introduces a new condition that the location of resolution of disputes shall be determined through mutual agreement. This adds uncertainty and potential complications to the jurisdiction agreement, making it harder to enforce",

                "explanation": "The original text has a clause regarding the entire agreement, stating the contract is everything that's agreed upon between both parties. The changed text then goes on to introduce contradiction, by saying both parties can agree to terms outside of this agreement for promotional purposes. This introduces a potential contradiction in which it can be unclear how to fully abide to the contract.",

ASSIGNMENT\n17.1 SHBV acknowledges and agrees that W2E may from time to time establish or nominate a separate entity for the purpose of entering into agreements with\n14 SHBV, in which case W2E shall have the right to require that SHBV's obligations under the Manufacturing Agreement (including warranties and indemnities) and any project schedules to be given in favour of both W2E and such entity. If a Dispute arises it shall first be referred to the Managing Director (or equivalent) of SHBV and the Managing Director (or equivalent) of W2E for resolution. If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute within ten (10) Working Days of its referral to the Managing Director (or equivalent) of SHBV and the Managing Director (or equivalent) of W2E referred to in Clause 19.2 above, then the Parties will attempt to settle it by mediation in accordance with the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (\"CEDR\")'s Model Mediation Procedure. Nothing in this Clause shall prejudice the right of either Party to bring proceedings intended to result in the enforcement of a settlement agreement or of a binding determination of a dispute between the Parties.",
                "explanation": "Moving the dispute resolution clause to the 'Assignment' section, which concerns the transfer of rights and obligations, makes it less conspicuous. Dispute resolution clauses are generally expected to be under their own dedicated section. Hiding it within assignment clauses makes it harder to find and enforce, thus resulting in a Structural Flaw and Legal Contradiction.",

Third Party Rights A person who is not a party to this Agreement may not enforce any of its provisions under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.",
                "explanation": "The 'Third Party Rights' clause is relocated to follow clauses about 'Publicity.' This is irregular because third-party rights are pertinent legal considerations for parties in the agreement. Since it is hidden, this makes it difficult for the parties in the agreement to know their liabilities under the act.",

                "explanation": "The governing law clause is critical for determining which jurisdiction's laws will be used to interpret and enforce the contract. Moving it into the 'Cooperation Obligations' section obscures its importance and makes it less likely that parties will be fully aware of the legal framework governing their agreement. This hides the information to the parties, and could be argued that there was no legal oversight in the drafting of the contract.",

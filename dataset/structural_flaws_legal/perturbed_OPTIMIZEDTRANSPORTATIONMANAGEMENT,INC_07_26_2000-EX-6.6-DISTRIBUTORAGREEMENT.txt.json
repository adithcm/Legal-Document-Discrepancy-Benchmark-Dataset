                "original_text": "WARRANTY:  ITS  Products  are  warranted  free from  defects of material or\nworkmanship  for 3 years after  shipment from the  manufacturer.  Equipment\npurchased from ITS, which becomes defective within that time period will be\nrepaired by ITS at its  headquarters  in San  Antonio,  Texas at no cost to\nCOMWARE  beyond cost of shipping  the  equipment  to ITS. ITS will bear the\ncost of returning the item to COMWARE by UPS,  REGULAR  DELIVERY.  priority\nshipping costs will be borne by COMWARE.\n\nThis  warranty  is  contingent  upon  proper  use and  installation  of the\nProducts and does not cover equipment which has been modified  without ITS'\nconsent or which has been  subjected  to  unusual  physical  or  electrical\nstress or on which the original  identification  marks have been removed or\naltered.",
                "changed_text": "WARRANTY: ITS Products are warranted free from defects of material or workmanship; however, the duration of this warranty is subject to change without prior notice. Equipment purchased from ITS which becomes defective may, at ITS's sole discretion, be repaired or replaced. The customer is responsible for all shipping costs associated with warranty claims.",
                "explanation": "The warranty section is modified to introduce ambiguity regarding the duration of the warranty and the responsibility for repair/replacement, which contradicts standard warranty practices. The original text clearly states a 3-year warranty, the new wording introduces uncertainty. The alteration also shifts shipping costs entirely to the customer, conflicting with the original agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates implied warranty laws and consumer protection laws, as it obscures the original warranty terms.",

                "changed_text": "GOVERNED BY THE STATE OF TEXAS: This Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner deemed appropriate by ITS. Comware may, at ITS's discretion, be required to submit to the jurisdiction of the State of California.",
                "explanation": "This clause is changed to remove the mandatory application of Texas law and replace it with language giving ITS complete discretion over interpretation. It also changes the jurisdiction, potentially forcing Comware to litigate in California.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates principles of contract law regarding choice of law and jurisdiction, creating an imbalance of power and undermining the certainty of the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "TERMINATION: Either ITS or COMWARE may attempt to terminate this Agreement, but such termination is subject to the approval of ITS and requires a substantial termination fee determined solely by ITS. This fee must be paid before the termination takes effect.",
                "explanation": "This section is modified to make termination conditional upon ITS's approval and payment of a termination fee. This introduces significant uncertainty and potentially prevents Comware from terminating the agreement even with 30 days notice as originally stipulated, which is contrary to the agreement's initial termination terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Undermines the principle of mutual agreement and creates an unreasonable restraint on trade. Could violate contract law principles regarding unconscionability.",

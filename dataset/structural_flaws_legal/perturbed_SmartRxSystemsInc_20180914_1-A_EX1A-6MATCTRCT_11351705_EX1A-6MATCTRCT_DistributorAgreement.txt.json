ARBITRATION:\nAny dispute arising over the terms and conditions of this Agreement or in any manner relating to this Agreement which the parties are unable to resolve informally between themselves or by mediation shall be submitted, upon the motion of either party, to arbitration under the appropriate rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). All such arbitration proceedings shall be administered by the AAA and held in Dallas, Texas. The parties agree that the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding as to each of them. The AAA administrative fee shall be advanced by the party initiating the proceeding, but shall be subject to final apportionment by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's fee shall be shared equally by the parties. The arbitrator's award may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Prior to invoking arbitration, the parties will make a reasonable effort to settle any dispute in an informal and expeditious manner. The parties separately and specially agree that if either shall contend that this Agreement is invalid or that grounds exist for its rescission or cancellation, that any dispute concerning such contention shall be submitted to arbitration in the manner provided in this section. Each party shall bear such party's own attorneys' fees in any arbitration proceeding; however, if either party commences an action in court to compel arbitration, enforce an arbitration award, or otherwise seek by judicial means to secure compliance with the arbitration provisions of this Agreement, then the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing party the prevailing party's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit incurred for such purpose.",
                "changed_text": "3.8 INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.\n3.9 Sales and Marketing Plans. From time-to-time, but in no event less frequently than annually, Company and Distributor will negotiate in good faith mutually acceptable sales and marketing plans (\"Plans\") for Distributor for each twelve-month period corresponding to the Distributor's fiscal quarter, which Plans may include revenue targets and other specific performance obligations of Distributor. The initial Plan will be established by the parties written ninety (90) days following the effective date of this Agreement and incorporated by reference into this Agreement as a new Exhibit C to this Agreement. This Plan shall be reviewed by the parties each year.\n10. ARBITRATION:\nAny dispute arising over the terms and conditions of this Agreement or in any manner relating to this Agreement which the parties are unable to resolve informally between themselves or by mediation shall be submitted, upon the motion of either party, to a method of resolution that is to be determined by mutual agreement. All such proceedings shall be administered and held at a location mutually agreed upon. The parties agree that the decision reached will be non-binding. The costs of the proceeding shall be determined by mutual agreement. The decision may not be enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Prior to invoking this resolution method, the parties will make a reasonable effort to settle any dispute in an informal and expeditious manner. Each party shall bear such party's own attorneys' fees in any proceeding.",
                "explanation": "The arbitration clause, initially clear and binding, is moved to Section 3.9 (Sales and Marketing Plans), an irrelevant section. The clause is then modified to be non-binding, contradicts the original clause, making the enforcement unclear. By moving the arbitration clause to an irrelevant section and then weakening the terms, its enforceability is significantly reduced.",

This Distributor Agreement shall be exclusively governed, construed, enforced and controlled by the laws of the United States of America and of the State of Texas. The parties agree that any controversy, claim, dispute, or disagreement arising under, out of, or relating to this Distributor Agreement shall be exclusively submitted for resolution exclusively to courts of competent jurisdiction located in the County of Orange, State of Florida, USA. Distributor consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the resolution of such controversies, claims, disputes, or disagreements.\n15.2 Service of Process. The Parties further agree that service of process in any such controversy, claim, dispute, or disagreement may be made by sending service by registered mail, return receipt requested, and the Parties expressly waive any other rights to service.

The primary responsibilities of the Distributor shall be as follows: (i) Marketing the Smart Pharm Assist Kiosk™ to Physicians, Physician group practices, Urgent Care Center, Freestanding Emergency Rooms, other retail convenience stores, other medical facilities, retailers (such as grocery stores (Brookshires), variety stores, (i.e., Family Dollar), medical office building owners, and other similar business in the Territory (collectively, \"Customers\"); and Smart Rx Reserves the right to market directly to Retailers nationally. (ii) Entering into pharmacy management services agreements (\"PMAs\") with Customers in the Territory (similar in form as set forth on Exhibit B); (iii) Arranging to have Smart Pharm Assist Kiosk™ supplied to Customers in the Territory under various contractual arrangements with Customers, including lease agreements, joint ventures, license agreements, jointly owned entities or other such ventures, between Customers in the Territory (and may also include contractual relationships with the manufacturer of Smart Pharm Assist Kiosk™ and the Distributor); (iv) Except as otherwise provided by the applicable law, the debts, obligations and liabilities of both the Distributor and the Company, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the party incurring such and neither Distributor, nor Company shall be obligated for any such debt, obligation or liability of the other party; (v) devotion of such time, energy, and skill on a regular and consistent basis as is necessary to distribute, promote the sale of, and sell the Products through all channels of distribution in the Territory in conformity with the Company's established marketing policies and programs; (vi) accurate representation and statement of Company policies to all potential and present customers; (vii) disclosure of any problems concerning Customers to the Company; (viii) Distributor has the sole right to bring in additional dealers under this Agreement.\n15. CONTROLLING LAW:\n15.1 This Distributor Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State where the Distributor is located, unless otherwise agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "The controlling law clause specifies that the agreement is governed by Texas law and any disputes must be resolved in Florida courts. This clause is moved to the 'Distributor Responsibilities' section, then the clause is altered to be dependant on where the distributor is located, removing the specification of the state of Texas. This makes it more difficult to determine the legal jurisdiction. By relocating the clause, the enforceability concerning choice of law is significantly reduced.",

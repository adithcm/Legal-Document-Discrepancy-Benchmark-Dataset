                "explanation": "The placement of Arbitration clause is after the Miscellaneous clauses, it makes the clause less discoverable, impacting enforceability. While it's still present, its unusual location can lead to oversights. This is a potential contradiction of standard legal practices regarding the positioning of critical dispute resolution mechanisms. Specifically, legal documents normally are read from top to bottom, and having essential data at the bottom will raise problems to anyone that is reading it for the first time.",

                "explanation": "By reordering clause 5.2.5 before 5.2.3, it suggests that direct negotiations or alternative dispute resolution can occur at anytime even after Arbitration has been initiated, which could cause a conflict.

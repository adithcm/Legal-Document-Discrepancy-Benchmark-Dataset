SPECIFICATIONS AND WARRANTY\n\n     For the acceptance period and for a period of one year from the Maintenance Commencement Date, and thereafter for as long as the Software is covered by Maintenance Services and is used by Sparkling in accordance with this Agreement, Garman warrants that the Software shall perform in conformance with the Specifications in all material respects.",

NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES\n\n     During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one year thereafter, both parties agree not to hire or allow its respective affiliates to hire any employee of the other party, or any person who was an employee of the other party during the previous six months and who was directly involved in the provision of services under this Agreement.\n\n     Garman warrants that the Software shall perform in conformance with the Specifications in all material respects for the acceptance period only.",
                "explanation": "Moving the warranty clause from its own dedicated section to the section on non-solicitation makes it less prominent and harder to find. Also, limiting the time frame the warranty is good for the acceptance period may be misleading.",

LIMITATION OF GARMAN'S LIABILITY\n\n     The exclusive remedy of either party in a claim against the other under this Agreement shall be the recovery of its direct damages. In no event shall either party be liable to the other for the recovery of any special, indirect or consequential damages even if the defendant party had been advised of the possibility of such damages including but not limited to lost profits, lost revenues, failure to realize expected savings, loss of data and loss of use. The parties agree that the limitation of liability in this paragraph reflects the allocation of risk between the parties and the price of the licenced Software.

It's been moved to 20(b) but includes 'unless otherwise specified', which contradicts the original exclusivity by allowing for unspecified exceptions, thus creating ambiguity about what other remedies might be available.",

If Sparkling terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 17(b), Sparkling shall cease using the Software at the end of the ninety (90) day notice period, and shall certify to Garman within thirty (30) calendar days of termination that Sparkling has destroyed or has returned to Garman all Software, Documentation and Codes.",

TRAINING\n\n     In conjunction with the installation of the Software at each existing or new Authorized Location, and prior to the commencement of acceptance testing at each Authorized Location, Garman shall provide as contracted a qualified personnel as specified in Schedule \"E.\" Garman shall also provide copies of reference documentation and manuals for training and reference by Sparkling's personnel.\n\n     This Agreement and the license granted under this Agreement shall remain in effect for one year from the date signed.",
                "explanation": "The Term and Termination conditions were moved to the 'Training' section. This is an unexpected location for such a critical clause, making it less discoverable. Also, replacing 'perpetually as long as fees are paid' with 'for one year from the date signed' directly contradicts the perpetual nature stated in the original document.",

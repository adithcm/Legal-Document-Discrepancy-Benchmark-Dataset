                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Ontario, Canada law and jurisdiction. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by stating Ontario law applies, but disputes will be resolved at Kallo's discretion. This contradicts the defined jurisdiction and potentially overrides legal processes, making it difficult to enforce the jurisdiction clause.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies Texas law, providing a clear legal framework. Changing this to a 'mutually agreed state' introduces ambiguity and makes enforcement unpredictable. The agreement now lacks a definitive governing law until the parties later agree, creating a potential conflict.",

                "changed_text": "4) Compensation   When custom Products are designed, developed and to be delivered to Bravatek-identified perspective clients, the parties shall agree to a proposed sales price for use during the project verbally prior to the commencement of each project.\n\n\n\n    For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with Fazync via email to IHSI's CEO, Devon Jones, and delivered through Bravatek or a Fazync -designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be discussed at a later time.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'in writing prior to the commencement of each project' to 'verbally prior to the commencement of each project' eliminates the paper trail and introduces greater ambiguity. The original text sets a clear payment timeline for the lead-finder fee, changing this to 'to be discussed at a later time' removes the payment terms.",

                "changed_text": "10) Indemnification   Fazync shall indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for damages deemed appropriate by Fazync, costs and expenses when Fazync sees fit, and other liabilities deemed reasonable, including attorney's fees and court costs when Fazync agrees to such. Indemnification only applies to third-party claims resulting from Fazync's intentional misconduct that causes significant damage to Bravatek.\n\nBravatek's indemnification responsibilities will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "By granting Fazync the sole discretion to determine the appropriateness and extent of indemnification, the clause effectively weakens Bravatek's protection. Replacing the clearer standard ('negligence or intentional misconduct') with 'intentional misconduct that causes significant damage' raises the bar for triggering indemnification. The final line also makes Bravatek's indemnification duties highly ambiguous.",

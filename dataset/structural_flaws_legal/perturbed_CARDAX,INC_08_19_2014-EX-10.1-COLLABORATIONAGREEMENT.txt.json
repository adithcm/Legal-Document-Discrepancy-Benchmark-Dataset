                "original_text": "11.1 Dispute Resolution. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance under the laws of the State of New York. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be discussed between the senior management of the Parties who will attempt to resolve the matter amicably. Any disputes which cannot be resolved in this way within sixty (60) days of one Party notifying the other of the existence of a dispute shall be finally settled before JAMS in accordance with the expedited arbitration procedures of JAMS. The arbitration shall be conducted in English in New York, New York, USA. The costs of the arbitration payable to JAMS shall be funded equally by the parties, provided that the prevailing party shall be reimbursed for such costs and expenses and its own actual out of pocket costs",
                "changed_text": "11.9 Headings; Interpretation. The section headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, do not form a part of this Agreement and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. The words \"include,\" \"includes\" and \"including\" shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase \"but not limited to.\" All references herein to Sections, Sections and Exhibits shall be deemed references to Sections and Sections of, and Exhibits to, this Agreement unless the context shall otherwise require. All Exhibits attached to this Agreement shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth herein. Words such as \"herein,\" \"hereof,\" \"hereto,\" \"hereby\" and \"hereunder\" refer to this Agreement and to the Exhibits, taken as a whole. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein: (a) any reference in this Agreement to any agreement shall mean such agreement as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time; (b) any reference in this Agreement to any law shall include corresponding provisions of any successor law and any regulations and rules promulgated pursuant to such law or such successor law; and (c) all terms of an accounting or financial nature shall be construed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as in effect in the United States from time to time. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be discussed between the senior management of the Parties who will attempt to resolve the matter amicably.",
                "explanation": "Moving the dispute resolution clause, including the arbitration agreement, to the 'Headings; Interpretation' section buries it within boilerplate language. This makes it less likely that a party will readily find and understand the binding arbitration clause, potentially undermining its enforceability. US law generally favors arbitration, but requires clear and conspicuous agreement.",

                "original_text": "5.3 Taxes. All federal, national, regional, district, local or other governmental income tax or similar tax that is imposed on either Party as a result of income, shall be the responsibility of such Party. All amounts payable by CAPSUGEL to CARDAX under this Agreement shall be paid free and clear of all deductions or withholdings whatsoever, except as may be required by law. If any deductions or withholdings are required by law to be made from any of the amounts payable by CAPSUGEL to CARDAX, the amount of any such withholding may be treated as part of the Royalty Payment, depending on the timing and the applicable legal requirements and CAPSUGEL shall provide CARDAX a receipt of any such withholdings.",
                "changed_text": "11.4 Waiver. No waiver of any default by either Party shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any subsequent default with respect to the same or any other provision hereof. No waiver shall be effective unless made in writing with specific reference to this Agreement and signed by a duly authorized representative of the Party granting the waiver. All federal, national, regional, district, local or other governmental income tax or similar tax that is imposed on either Party as a result of income, shall be the responsibility of such Party.",
                "explanation": "The relocation of the tax responsibilities and withholding clause to the section on 'Waiver' creates confusion. The original clause clearly defined who is responsible for taxes and how withholdings are to be handled. Placing a portion of it in the waiver section implies that these tax obligations could be waived, which is contrary to tax laws and common contract interpretation. This introduces ambiguity and potential unenforceability regarding tax obligations.",

Except in the event of (i) a Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct and/or (ii) a Party's breach of its confidentiality obligation, the total liability of one Party to the other Party (and its Affiliates) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Products, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), statute or otherwise, shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, be limited to the amount of revenues it receives under this Agreement.",

CARDAX acknowledges that it shall be solely and fully responsible to use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts for doing any and all freedom to operate assessments regarding possible infringement of third party intellectual property rights for the Product in the part of the Territory that the Parties reasonably determine require such protection; provided, however, each Party shall be solely and fully responsible for doing any and all freedom to operate assessments regarding possible infringement of third party intellectual property rights for any and all of its Intellectual Property Rights. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.",
                "explanation": "Moving the limitation of damages clause to the Freedom to Operate subsection of Intellectual Property matters creates a misleading context. This could suggest that the limitation of damages only applies to intellectual property-related claims, rather than to all potential claims under the agreement. This misplacement could weaken the enforceability of the general limitation of liability, especially for non-IP claims, as it is not readily apparent to a reasonable reader.",

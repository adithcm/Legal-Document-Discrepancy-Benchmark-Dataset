                "explanation": "Relocating the initial disclosure about California Business and Professions Code Sections to the end, near the website disclaimer, reduces its prominence. Also, rewording the disclosure to indicate that the code 'MAY' provide rights, and stating that the Master Franchise Agreement takes precedence, directly contradicts California law and makes the consumer believe the contract is above state legislation.",

By changing 'must sign' to 'MAY sign' and adding that enforceability is subject to the agreement, it contradicts and undermines the consumer protections provided by California Corporation Code 31512 and Business and Professions Code 20010.",

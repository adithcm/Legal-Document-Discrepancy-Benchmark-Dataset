                "original_text": "16.  Consent  to  Jurisdiction.  The  parties  hereby  unconditionally  and irrevocably  consent  to  the  exclusive  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  of  the Commonwealth  of Virginia  located in Fairfax  County and the  Federal  District Court for the Northern District of Virginia with respect to any action,  suit or any proceeding to enforce this  Agreement and  unconditionally  and  irrevocably waive the right to trial by jury in any such action,  suit or other  proceeding. Each of the parties hereby  unconditionally  and irrevocably waives any right to challenge  the  jurisdiction  of such  courts  or to  assert  that  such  courts constitute  an  inconvenient  forum or that venue in such courts is improper.  A party that  prevails in any action,  suit or other  proceeding  to enforce  this Agreement shall be entitled to be reimbursed for its costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith  (including,  without limitation,  reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements).",
                "changed_text": "16.  Consent to Jurisdiction. The parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia located in Fairfax County and the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Virginia with respect to any action, suit or any proceeding to enforce this Agreement, but jurisdiction is not exclusive. Each of the parties hereby waives the right to challenge the jurisdiction of such courts or to assert that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum or that venue in such courts is improper only to the extent they are not reasonably inconvenienced. A party that prevails in any action, suit or other proceeding to enforce this Agreement may be entitled to be reimbursed for its costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) at the discretion of the court.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates exclusive jurisdiction in Virginia courts, providing certainty. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by stating jurisdiction is 'not exclusive' and the waiver of challenge is conditional, making it uncertain where disputes can be resolved and if the waiver is enforceable. Reimbursement of legal fees is also made discretionary, weakening the original provision.",

This Agreement and all acts and  transactions  hereunder shall in all respects be governed by and construed in  accordance  with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia,  without regard to any of its conflicts of laws principles  which would result in the  application  of the  substantive  laws of another jurisdiction.  This Agreement shall not be construed or interpreted with any presumption against the party that caused this Agreement to be drafted.",

This Agreement and all acts and transactions hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, unless a conflict arises, in which case the laws of the state where Alex Job Racing, Inc. is headquartered will govern. This Agreement shall be construed or interpreted with a presumption against the party that caused this Agreement to be drafted.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states Virginia law governs, avoiding conflicts. The modified clause introduces a condition where Florida law (where Alex Job Racing, Inc. is headquartered) may supersede Virginia law if a conflict arises, creating uncertainty about which state's laws apply. Additionally, reversing the presumption against the drafter introduces a bias in interpretation.",

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,  duties and obligations  of the parties  hereunder may be assigned or delegated by XC or the AJR, as the case may be,  without the prior  written  consent of the other party hereto.  Any such  assignment or delegation  made without the written consent of the  other  party  hereto  shall  be ab  inito  null and void and of no force or effect.  This Agreement and the provisions  hereof shall be binding upon each of the  parties  hereto,  and  shall  inure  to the  benefit  of  their  respective successors (whether by merger, consolidation,  recapitalization or other similar transaction) and permitted assigns, sublicensees or delegatees.",

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, duties, and obligations of the parties hereunder may be assigned or delegated by XC or the AJR without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, unless that party undergoes a change in control due to a merger or acquisition, in which case assignment is permitted without consent. Any such assignment or delegation made without the written consent of the other party hereto shall be ab initio null and void and of no force or effect, except as outlined above. This Agreement and the provisions hereof shall be binding upon each of the parties hereto and shall inure to the benefit of their respective successors (whether by merger, consolidation, recapitalization, or other similar transaction) and permitted assigns, sublicensees, or delegatees.",
                "explanation": "The original clause strictly prohibits assignment without prior written consent, providing certainty. The modified clause introduces an exception allowing assignment without consent if there's a change in control, creating ambiguity. It's unclear what 'change in control' specifically entails, and this exception contradicts the earlier statement that any assignment without consent is void.",

                "explanation": "By severely limiting the liability to a fixed amount of $1000 regardless of the proven direct damages, this significantly alters the risk allocation agreed upon. The original clause allowed for the recovery of actual direct damages within specific categories, but the modified text caps this at an unrealistically low level, potentially undermining the purpose of the liability clause and making the contract unconscionable. Also, relocating this limitation to clause `5.8 Headings` does not make sense, as this does not relate to the Headings, which makes it confusing and misleading.",

                "explanation": "The additions create ambiguity regarding the governing law, jurisdiction, and jury trial waiver. Originally, Delaware law was explicitly chosen, and jurisdiction was set in Delaware courts. The modified text introduces conditions ('unless both parties mutually agree') that contradict the initial explicit statements, making these crucial aspects of the agreement uncertain and potentially unenforceable. This contradicts the purpose of a governing law clause, which is to provide clarity and predictability in case of disputes. Also, in section (c) now it says 'UNLESS such waiver is deemed unenforceable...', creating a contradiction that previously didn't exist.",

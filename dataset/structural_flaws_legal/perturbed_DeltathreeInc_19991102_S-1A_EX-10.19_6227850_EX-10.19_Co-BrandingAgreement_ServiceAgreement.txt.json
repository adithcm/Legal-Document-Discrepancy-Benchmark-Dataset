                "explanation": "By changing 'shall negotiate in good faith' to 'may, or may not, negotiate in good faith,' the contract introduces a contradiction. While seemingly minor, the original clause creates an obligation to negotiate in good faith, a legally recognized standard. The modified clause removes this obligation, suggesting that the parties can choose not to negotiate at all, which undermines the dispute resolution process intended by the agreement. This change affects the enforceability of the dispute resolution mechanism because the duty to negotiate in good faith is no longer guaranteed.",

                "explanation": "The original clause stipulated a specific venue (Hennepin or Ramsey County, Minnesota) and included a waiver of inconvenient forum arguments. The altered clause removes the venue convenience waiver and weakens the transfer provision, potentially creating ambiguity and increasing the likelihood of disputes over jurisdiction and venue. This directly impacts the enforceability and clarity of the jurisdiction clause.",

                "explanation": "The change removes the word irrevocably, making the jury waiver questionable, creating a legal contradiction. The sentence no longer firmly asserts an explicit agreement to permanently forgo the right to a jury trial, which introduces ambiguity.

                "explanation": "The language change from 'under any and all circumstances' to 'under most circumstances' introduces ambiguity about what would make the investor no longer responsible, and the inclusion of 'If the Investor is bankrupt, all rules and laws are thrown out the window.' introduces a significant contradiction. This could be interpreted as a blanket exemption from all contractual obligations in the event of bankruptcy, which would be invalid under Minnesota law. The added sentence directly contradicts the detailed list of unaffected obligations that follows, creating uncertainty about the enforceability of the investor's obligations during bankruptcy.",

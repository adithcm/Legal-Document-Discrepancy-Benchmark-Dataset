In the event of any controversy or claim relating to, arising out of or in any way connected to any provision of this Agreement (a \"Dispute\"), either Party may, by notice to the other Party, have such dispute referred to their respective senior officials designated below or their successors, for attempted resolution by good faith negotiations within 30 days after such notice is received. Any Dispute that is not resolved through such negotiations may be referred to binding arbitration in Denver, Colorado with the Judicial Arbiter Group as part of a 3 person panel, with costs borne separately by each party, to be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.",

In the event of any controversy or claim relating to, arising out of or in any way connected to any provision of this Agreement (a \"Dispute\"), either Party may, by notice to the other Party, have such dispute referred to their respective senior officials designated below or their successors, for attempted resolution by good faith negotiations within 30 days after such notice is received. Any Dispute that is not resolved through such negotiations may be referred to non-binding mediation in Denver, Colorado.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies binding arbitration, a legally significant term. Changing this to 'non-binding mediation' significantly alters the dispute resolution process. Arbitration clauses are often scrutinized, and this change undermines the enforceability of the original intent. Dispute resolution should be in its own section, so by changing it there is no direct legal contradiction. However, that can be used to have a basis for an argument.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that New Jersey law governs the contract. Changing the state to 'Delaware' introduces a conflict, as the contract specifies that Integra is located in New Jersey. This discrepancy makes it unclear which state's laws apply. While the choice of law is generally respected, the contradiction undermines the clarity and enforceability, making it easier to challenge in court. The contract states that the company's HQ is in New Jersey, but by adding Delaware, there is no way to understand which law needs to be considered first.",

                "explanation": "By removing the '20 years thereafter' phrase, the confidentiality clause only extends for the duration of the contract term, rather than providing extended protection. This could significantly impact the protection of trade secrets or other confidential information disclosed during the agreement, especially if those secrets have long-term value. Without the mention of how long after, it can introduce a point of legal contention, especially given the importance of the confidentiality section.",

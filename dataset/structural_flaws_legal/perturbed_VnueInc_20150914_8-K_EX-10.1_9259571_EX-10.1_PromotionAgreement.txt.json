Promoter represents, warrants, and covenants the following:   A. Promoter will disclose to VNUE any and all material facts and circumstances, which may affect its ability to perform its undertaking herein.   B. Promoter is an independent contractor acting in the limited capacity as an independent contractor for VNUE.   C. Promoter will not disseminate or share with third parties any material information about VNUE not already contained in a Company report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as Promoter acknowledges that such third parties might try to act on such material non-public information by engaging in \"insider trading\" to the detriment of VNUE.\n\n\n\nSource: VNUE, INC., 8-K, 9/14/2015\n\n\n\nSection 13.

                "explanation": "By moving the clause stating the agreement inures to the benefit of successors, heirs, and assigns into a section discussing competent work and then also adding that the agreement inures to the benefit of a third party introduces a potential contradiction and reduces the clause's enforceability. It creates ambiguity around who exactly benefits from the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Moving the liability clause into the section describing the promotion services obscures the nature and scope of liability. A court might find it difficult to enforce this clause because it's not readily apparent to a party reviewing the document. This relocation also creates a contradiction. While the promoter is liable and provides all the indemnity. the services are provided to the company, blurring the liability between both.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by stating that authorization can be revoked. The original text implies a standing authorization, but the modified text creates uncertainty about the stability and enforceability of the authorization. This would make it hard to enforce and ensure proper legal filing.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that agreement MAY be signed in counterparts. This introduces a lack of a direct commitment by all parties. This phrasing could be interpreted as non-binding and creates ambiguity. The word change has the effect of introducing uncertainty as to the agreement's adherence.",

                "explanation": "By adding the phrase 'unless one party is in disagreement', the mandatory arbitration clause is weakened. It introduces ambiguity by allowing a party to potentially opt-out of arbitration, thus contradicting the initial agreement to obey the arbitration decision.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"total confidentiality\" to \"reasonable effort towards confidentiality\", \"not knowingly spread\" and \"specific information\", the clause is weakened to the point that can be difficult to enforce. Furthermore, \"Both parties shall take reasonable precautions to preserve in strict confidence any confidential or proprietary information obtained by them, their agents, employees, subcontractors, suppliers, consultants, and in general, any person that has access to it.\" became \"Both parties shall take minimal precautions to preserve in reasonable confidence any information obtained by them, their agents, employees, subcontractors, suppliers, consultants, and in general, any person that has access to it.\" which reduces the scope of Confidential Information, limiting the range of protected information under the agreement.",

                "original_text": "13. Attorneys' Fees. If any legal action is brought by either of the parties hereto, it is expressly agreed that the prevailing party in such legal  action shall be entitled to recover from the other party reasonable attorney's fees in addition to any other relief that may be awarded. For  the purposes of this clause, the prevailing party is the party in whose favor final judgment is entered. In the event that declaratory or  injunctive relief alone is granted, the court may determine which, if either, of the parties shall be considered to be the prevailing party. The  amount of reasonable attorney's fees shall be determined by the court, in the trial of such action or in a separate action brought for that  purpose. Attorney's fees awarded under the provisions of this paragraph shall be in addition to any other relief that may be awarded.",
                "changed_text": "13. Attorneys' Fees. If any legal action is brought by either of the parties hereto, it is expressly agreed that the prevailing party *may* be entitled to recover attorney's fees, but only up to $500, regardless of the actual fees incurred. This clause is purely optional and can be waived by both parties at any time during the legal action. The court's discretion regarding the prevailing party is advisory only.",
                "explanation": "The modified clause introduces a contradiction regarding attorney's fees. It initially suggests the prevailing party is entitled to recover fees, but then imposes a low cap and makes the clause optional. This weakens the enforceability of the attorney's fees provision, as the limitation and optional nature conflict with the initial grant of entitlement. This misrepresents the condition of the term which could void the clause completely.",

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas and venue for  any legal action brought in State Court shall lie exclusively in Tarrant County, Texas and venue for any action brought in federal court shall  lie exclusively in the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division.",
                "changed_text": "11. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of a jurisdiction to be mutually agreed upon by both parties at the time of any dispute. Venue for any legal action shall be at the discretion of the defendant.",
                "explanation": "This clause originally specifies Texas law and venue in Tarrant County. The modification introduces a contradiction by stating the governing law will be 'mutually agreed upon' later. This creates uncertainty and weakens the enforceability of the governing law provision, as it's unclear which jurisdiction's laws will apply until a dispute arises. The defendant determining venue completely removes fairness from the agreement.",

In consideration of the services to be rendered under this Agreement as set forth above, the Company shall be  entitled to compensation in the amount of $150,000.00 (One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars), to be paid in equal installments of $37,500.00  (Thirty Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars) on January 1, 2008, April 1, 2008, July 1, 2008 and October 1, 2008. If Cano fails to make any  payment when required by this Agreement, the Company shall have the option of canceling this Agreement following the passage of ten  (10) days after having given Cano written notice of its default. While the Company shall have no further obligation to Cano following  cancellation of the Agreement, Cano shall remain liable for all unpaid installments for the then current term of the Agreement, which  installments shall be immediately due and payable.",

In consideration of the services to be rendered under this Agreement as set forth above, the Company shall be  entitled to compensation in the amount of $150,000.00 (One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars), to be paid at a schedule decided solely by the Sponsor, Cano. If Cano fails to make any payment when required by this Agreement, the Company shall *not* have the option of canceling this Agreement. While the Company shall have no further obligation to Cano following  cancellation of the Agreement *by Cano*, Cano shall remain liable for *only* the installments Cano sees fit, which shall *not* be immediately due and payable.",
                "explanation": "The modified payment clause contradicts the original by giving Cano complete control over the payment schedule and removing the Company's right to cancel for non-payment. It also contradicts the clear payment terms previously stated. This significantly weakens the Company's ability to enforce the payment terms.",

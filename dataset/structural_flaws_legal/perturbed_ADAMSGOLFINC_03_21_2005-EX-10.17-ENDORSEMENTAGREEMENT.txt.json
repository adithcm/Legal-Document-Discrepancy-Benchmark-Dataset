                "original_text": "33.  ARBITRATION\n\nIn the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Venue shall be Kansas. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "16. MEMBERSHIPS\n\nCONSULTANT warrants and represents that during the term of this Agreement he is a member in good standing of SAG, AFTRA or any other organization having jurisdiction over CONSULTANT'S services hereunder. This Agreement is subject to all of the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreements with SAG, AFTRA, or any other union agreements or codes having jurisdiction over CONSULTANT'S services hereunder. Any and all payments required to be made to SAG or AFTRA or any other organization having jurisdiction over CONSULTANT'S services hereunder, shall be the sole responsibility of CONSULTANT.\n\n33.  ARBITRATION\nIn the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a single arbitrator chosen by ADAMS GOLF. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with rules determined by ADAMS GOLF, in a location of ADAMS GOLF's choosing. The award or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be subject to appeal to ADAMS GOLF, whose decision shall be final.",
                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause to a section about memberships makes it less noticeable. Furthermore, the original clause ensures a fair, neutral arbitration process. Changing it to allow ADAMS GOLF to pick the arbitrator and dictate the rules introduces bias and contradicts standard arbitration practices, making the agreement unconscionable.",

PRODUCT DESIGN\nDuring the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall use best efforts to cooperate with ADAMS GOLF in giving advice, suggestions and recommendations concerning the acceptability and playability of current ADAMS GOLF lines, the development of new ADAMS GOLF lines, and information about significant golf PRODUCT and golf market trends, and meet as reasonably requested with ADAMS GOLF'S Design/Testing Teams. This Agreement shall be governed and construed according to the laws of the State of Delaware.",
                "explanation": "Moving the choice of law provision into the product design section hides it and potentially misleads a reader into thinking it is related to product design issues only. Switching the applicable law to Delaware might benefit Adams Golf due to its corporate-friendly legal system. This introduces a contradiction because Kansas law, where Watson and Adams Golf are located, would normally apply.",

INDEMNITY\n\nCONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "32. CONFIDENTIALITY\nBoth parties understand that the contents of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, all amounts paid or to be paid and any additional consideration, are extremely confidential, and that disclosure of same to any third party could be detrimental to the interests of one or both parties. Therefore, both parties agree not to disclose the terms of this Agreement, without the permission of the other party, to any third party other than to CONSULTANT'S business, legal and financial advisors, and with respect to all such advisors, CONSULTANT shall take all reasonable steps to ensure such confidentiality to ADAMS GOLF. Furthermore, CONSULTANT recognizes that during the course of performing his duties hereunder he may become aware of proprietary, confidential information concerning ADAMS GOLF, its PRODUCT, methods, processes, billing practices, financial condition, etc., or information ADAMS GOLF designates as confidential (collectively \"Confidential Information\"). CONSULTANT agrees that he will maintain in confidence and not disclose to any third party at any time any such Confidential Information and shall not use any such information to the detriment of ADAMS GOLF or for any purpose not contemplated by the Agreement.\n\n14. INDEMNITY\nCONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) ONLY if such suit is successful and Adams Golf prevails in court.",
                "explanation": "By adding the condition that indemnification is only required if Adams Golf wins in court, the scope of the original indemnity clause is significantly narrowed. This contradicts the standard understanding of an indemnity clause, which is to protect a party from potential losses even if a case is not fully adjudicated or won. By doing that, we change the law that exists in order to protect parties. Indemnity is intended to protect against claims and losses.",

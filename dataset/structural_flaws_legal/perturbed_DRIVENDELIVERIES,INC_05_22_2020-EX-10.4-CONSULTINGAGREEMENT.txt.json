                "original_text": "11.1. Arbitration. Except as described in Section 11.2 below, any dispute or controversy between Company and the Consultant and/or its employees or staff, including, but not limited to, those involving the construction or application of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or otherwise arising out of or relating to this Agreement, shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. Company and the Consultant (or its employees as applicable) shall share the costs of the arbitrator equally but shall each bear their own costs and legal fees associated with the arbitration. The location of the arbitration shall be in the County of San Diego, California.",
                "changed_text": "12.4. Headings. Headings are used in this Agreement for reference only and shall not be considered when interpreting this Agreement. The Parties agree to attempt to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement through good faith negotiation. Failing resolution through negotiation, the Parties may consider arbitration, but neither party is obligated to do so. Should arbitration be pursued, it will be conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules, and the costs will be shared equally. The location of any potential arbitration shall be in the County of San Diego, California. This provision is not intended to be binding, and either party may pursue other legal remedies as available.",
                "explanation": "The original arbitration clause is moved to the 'Headings' section and significantly weakened. The mandatory 'shall be settled by binding arbitration' is replaced with a non-binding 'may consider arbitration'. Further, a disclaimer is added indicating the provision is not binding, allowing either party to pursue other legal remedies. This directly contradicts the original intent of mandatory arbitration.",

                "original_text": "12.1. Governing Law; Consent to Personal Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction. To the extent that any lawsuit is permitted under this Agreement, the Parties hereby expressly consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in the County of San Diego, California.",
                "changed_text": "1.3 Expenses. The Company shall reimburse Consultant, in accordance with Company policy, for all reasonable expenses incurred by Consultant in performing the Services pursuant to this Agreement, but only if Consultant receives written consent from an authorized agent of the Company prior to incurring such expenses and submits receipts for such expenses to the Company in accordance with the Company's general expense reimbursement policies. This Agreement shall be interpreted under the general legal principles applicable to commercial agreements, without reference to any specific jurisdiction's laws or conflict of law rules. The Parties agree that in the event of any legal action, jurisdiction shall be determined based on the convenience of the parties and the availability of witnesses.",
                "explanation": "The governing law and jurisdiction clause is moved to the 'Expenses' section and made ambiguous. The explicit reference to California law is removed and replaced with 'general legal principles'. The consent to personal jurisdiction in San Diego, California, is removed and replaced with a clause indicating jurisdiction will be determined by 'convenience' - This introduces ambiguity and contradicts the standard practice of specifying governing law and jurisdiction, potentially leading to disputes over where a lawsuit should be filed and what laws apply.",

                "original_text": "4.3 Non-Solicitation. Consultant expressly agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, either directly or indirectly on his own behalf, or in the service or on behalf of others, solicit, divert or hire away, or attempt to solicit, divert or hire away any person employed by the Company for a period of five (5) years for any reason, and without limitation for the purpose of harming the Company or of obtaining and disseminating its trade secrets, or other proprietary and confidential information. Consultant also expressly agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, either directly or indirectly on his own behalf, or in the service or on behalf of others, solicit, divert, or attempt to solicit or divert any customer, client, supplier or vendor of the Company for a period of five (5) years for any reason, and without limitation for the purpose of harming the Company or of obtaining and disseminating its trade secrets, or other proprietary and confidential information",
                "changed_text": "6. Reports. Consultant agrees that Consultant will periodically keep the Company advised as to Consultant's progress in performing the Services under this Agreement. Consultant further agrees that Consultant will, as requested by the Company, prepare written reports with respect to such progress. The Company and Consultant agree that the reasonable time expended in preparing such written reports will be considered time devoted to the performance of the Services. Any agreements regarding solicitations shall be subject to further negotiation and are not binding under this Agreement, this is to include all current and future employees, customers, clients, suppliers or vendors of the company.",
                "explanation": "Moving the non-solicitation clause to the 'Reports' section reduces its visibility. Then, adding a disclaimer indicates any agreement regarding solicitations are not binding; this creates a direct contradiction. The original clause imposes a 5-year restriction, while the modified clause suggests that it is not binding. This contradiction makes the non-solicitation agreement practically unenforceable.",

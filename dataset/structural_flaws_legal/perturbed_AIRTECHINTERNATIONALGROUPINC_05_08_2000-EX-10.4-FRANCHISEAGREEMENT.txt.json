The Parties agree that any action brought by either Party against the other in any court, whether federal or state, shall be brought within the State of Texas in the judicial district in which AIRSOPURE has its principal place of business and do hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.",

                "explanation": "Moving the venue clause to a section unrelated to dispute resolution and changing the wording from 'shall' to 'may' and introducing the notion of mutually agreed-upon locations significantly weakens the enforceability of the venue clause.

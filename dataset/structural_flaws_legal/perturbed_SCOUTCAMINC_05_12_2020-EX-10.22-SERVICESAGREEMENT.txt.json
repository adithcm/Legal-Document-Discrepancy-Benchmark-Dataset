This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. The parties hereto each hereby submits herself or itself for the sole purpose of this Agreement and any controversy arising hereunder to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts in the State of New York.",

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. The parties hereto each hereby submits herself or itself for the sole purpose of this Agreement and any controversy arising hereunder to the jurisdiction of either the state courts in the State of New York or a jurisdiction determined by mutual consent.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandated exclusive jurisdiction in New York state courts. The modification introduces ambiguity by allowing for 'mutual consent' to determine jurisdiction, potentially conflicting with the initial exclusive jurisdiction clause. This creates uncertainty and could hinder enforcement, as a party could argue for a different jurisdiction after a dispute arises.",

                "explanation": "The original non-compete and non-solicitation clause was relatively strict. The addition of 'unless otherwise stipulated between the parties' at the end introduces a loophole. It's now unclear if the non-compete/non-solicitation is actually enforceable, as a verbal or undocumented agreement could potentially override it. This weakens the protection afforded to the Company and creates a legal contradiction.",

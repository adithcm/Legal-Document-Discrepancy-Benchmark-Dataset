                "explanation": "The addition of 'but the usage of stored information is subject to further negotiation' introduces uncertainty regarding the use of stored payment information. While the original text implied a straightforward process, the modified text creates a contradiction where the right to use payment information is no longer guaranteed, potentially violating consumer protection laws that require transparency in data usage.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'but Pelican Delivers has the right to refuse the service' after stating that 'once verification is completed, the user will be able to complete the order' introduces contradiction. This statement allows Pelican to reject a verified user. Such a statement may go against discrimination laws, or laws that protect consumers from arbitrarily being denied access to services.",

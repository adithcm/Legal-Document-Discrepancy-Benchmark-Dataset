The Parties shall use their respective best efforts to settle amicably any disputes, differences or controversies arising between the Parties out of or in connection with or in respect of this Agreement. However, if not so settled, then the same shall be submitted to arbitration and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be solely and finally settled by confidential binding arbitration, except as specifically provided otherwise herein. The confidential arbitration proceeding shall be held in Collin County, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the alternative dispute resolution rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration proceeding shall be held before a single arbitrator unless (i) the matter in controversy exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), (ii) the Parties cannot agree on the arbitrator, or (iii) either Party requests a panel of three (3) arbitrators. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and any order of enforcement as the case may be. The arbitrator shall not award any Party punitive, exemplary, multiplied or consequential damages, and each Party hereby irrevocably waives any right to seek such damages in arbitration or in judicial proceedings. Each Party shall bear its own costs in the arbitration, and the fees and expenses of the arbitration shall be shared equally by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the arbitrator shall have the right and authority to apportion among the parties all reasonable costs, including attorneys' fees and witness fees, taking into account the relative fault of the Parties. The foregoing provisions of this Section 11.9 do not limit the right of a Party to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction pending resolution of a dispute by arbitration.",

The Parties shall use their respective best efforts to settle amicably any disputes, differences or controversies arising between the Parties out of or in connection with or in respect of this Agreement. However, if not so settled, then the same shall be submitted to arbitration, but such arbitration shall not be binding on the parties, and the parties may pursue litigation. The confidential arbitration proceeding shall be held in Collin County, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the alternative dispute resolution rules of the American Arbitration Association.

                "explanation": "The arbitration clause is altered to state that arbitration is not binding, even though it initially states it should be submitted to arbitration. This introduces a contradiction, making it unclear whether arbitration is mandatory or optional. This is important, because Texas law favors arbitration, but this alteration makes the enforceability uncertain.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless another jurisdiction is deemed more appropriate by the court' introduces a contradiction. While the primary governing law is stated as Texas, this caveat creates uncertainty and invites legal challenges, undermining the predictability and enforceability of the contract. This is important, because without a clear governing law, which state laws apply becomes uncertain.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'unless Distributor objects within 24 hours of notification,' a legal contradiction is introduced into the assignment clause. The initial part of the clause outlines a condition where Hydraspin can assign the agreement under specific circumstances, while the added phrase gives the Distributor a window to block the assignment. This alters the original intent and creates uncertainty over the extent of Hydraspin's assignment rights, potentially invalidating assignment.",

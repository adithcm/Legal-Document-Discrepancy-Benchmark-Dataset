                "original_text": "12. Any dispute arising out of the execution of this Agreement, which cannot be negotiated and settled by both Parties, shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the People's Court where this Agreement is signed.",
                "changed_text": "10. Party B shall obtain Party A's written consent in the case the early termination of the Agreement. Party B shall pay one-month freight as liquidated damages in case of termination of the Agreement without consent. Within the contract period, Party B shall not charge the freight difference if Party A rents same-level vehicles. Party B shall also compensate Party A's other losses.\n\n12. Any dispute arising out of the execution of this Agreement, which cannot be negotiated and settled by both Parties, will be resolved through mediation, then arbitration if mediation fails. The method of dispute resolution is at the sole discretion of Party A.",
                "explanation": "The original dispute resolution clause specifies the People's Court as the jurisdiction. The modified clause introduces an initial step of mediation and states that arbitration will only occur if mediation fails. It then grants Party A the sole discretion to choose the method of dispute resolution. This contradicts the original clause's clear jurisdictional provision, making the dispute resolution process ambiguous and potentially unenforceable in its original intended jurisdiction.",

In addition to vehicle personnel insurance, Party B shall at least purchase injury insurance for two persons with coverage not lower than RMB500,000 per person. Party B shall bear any consequence arising out of the non-compliance of insurance purchase, and Party A shall have no liability.",
                "changed_text": "13. The annex of this Agreement constitutes a part of this Agreement and has the same effect as this Agreement. Any undealt matter can be negotiated and added by both Parties. \n\n6. Party B should try to get insurance for its vehicles, with liability coverage ideally around RMB 1 million if possible. Party B is encouraged to get injury insurance for at least two people.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates specific insurance coverage levels and makes Party B liable for non-compliance. The modified clause weakens the language, making insurance purchase optional ('should try') and the coverage amounts aspirational ('ideally around'). This introduces ambiguity regarding Party B's actual insurance obligations and reduces Party A's protection in case of accidents. This section now is placed into general statements rather than clear, legal standards.",

                "original_text": "5. In order to guarantee rapid transfer of Party A's parcel, Party B shall strictly comply with the following obligations:\n\n  (a) During the transportation, Part B shall completely comply with Party A's transportation arrangement and relevant systems. Party B shall bear any consequences and legal liability arising out of Party B's non-compliance, and Party A shall have no liability. Party A has the right to terminate this Agreement without further legal liability in the case that Party B does not comply with Party A's management and arrangement.",

Party B will try to comply with Party A's transportation arrangement and systems during transportation. Party B will be liable if they do not comply and if Party A wants to terminate this agreement due to non-compliance, Party A can do so.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates strict compliance with Party A's arrangements, holding Party B fully liable for any non-compliance and giving Party A the right to terminate the agreement. The modified version weakens this by stating that 'Party B will try to comply,' removing the strict obligation. Additionally the original gives Party A the right to terminate but the modified version turns it into if Party A 'wants' to terminate then 'can'. The changed text introduces uncertainty regarding the level of compliance expected from Party B and the certainty of Party A's termination right, weakening Party A's position.",

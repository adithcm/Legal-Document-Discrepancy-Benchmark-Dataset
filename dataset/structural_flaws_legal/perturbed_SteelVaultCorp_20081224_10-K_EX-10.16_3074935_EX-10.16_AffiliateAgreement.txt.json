When paying by credit card, the Marketing Affiliate agrees to pay for all items that are revoked or disputed by the  credit card company or the card holder along with any charges or fees charged by the credit card company including  fees associated with processing the credit card transaction and that the Marketing Affiliate will be billed for those items  in accordance with Equidata standard practices. Marketing Affiliate and the undersigned principal, partner or owner  further agree that this Agreement will serve as a personal guaranty by the undersigned principal, partner or owner of  the company, and the undersigned principal, partner or owner will become responsible for any unpaid balance past due  on any invoice. The Marketing Affiliate agrees to pay a late charge of 1 l/2% per month on the unpaid, past-due amount  as well as a returned check fee of not less than $35.00 per returned item. In addition, the Marketing Affiliate agrees to  pay 25% attorney's fees plus court cost in the event that the Marketing Affiliate's account is referred to an attorney for  collection.",

                "explanation": "The change introduces contradictory statements regarding financial obligations. Initially, the affiliate agrees to pay all charges and fees. The added text directly contradicts this by stating they are not responsible for disputed charges, personal guarantees, late fees, or attorney fees.",

In the case of disputed charge, defined as a non-payment of an invoice for which notice of dispute has been  given in writing by Marketing Affiliate to Equidata, Equidata or Marketing Affiliate may choose arbitration and  Marketing Affiliate and Equidata shall be obligated by the terms agreed upon by arbitration and all monies determined  owed shall be considered due and payable immediately. Such arbitration does not relieve Marketing Affiliate from its  obligation to promptly pay for undisputed charges in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

In the case of disputed charge, defined as a non-payment of an invoice for which notice of dispute has been  given in writing by Marketing Affiliate to Equidata, Equidata or Marketing Affiliate may choose arbitration but Marketing Affiliate and Equidata shall not be obligated by the terms agreed upon by arbitration, the dispute can be solved with an external mediator. Such arbitration relieves Marketing Affiliate from its  obligation to promptly pay for undisputed charges in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Such disputes shall  be settled by mediation in the City of Newport News, Virginia.",

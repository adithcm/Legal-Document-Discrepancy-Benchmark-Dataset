Biocept and Life Technologies and their respective Affiliates each agree to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement in compliance with all applicable Laws, in the Territory, including but not limited to applicable regulations, rules, and policies of third party payers that pay for the Assay.",
                "changed_text": "14.9 Force Majeure. Each party shall be excused from liability for the failure or delay in performance of any obligation under this Agreement by reason of any event beyond such party's reasonable control, including but not limited to, Acts of God, fire, flood, explosion, earthquake, or other natural forces, war, civil unrest, any strike or labor disturbance. Such excuse from liability shall be effective only to the extent and duration of the event(s) causing the failure or delay in performance and provided that the party has not caused such event(s) to occur. Notice of a party's failure or delay in performance due to force majeure must be given to the other party within five (5) calendar days after its occurrence. All delivery dates under this Agreement that have been affected by force majeure shall be tolled for the duration of such force majeure. In no event shall any party be required to prevent or settle any labor disturbance or dispute. In the event of a force majeure that persists for thirty (30) days or more, then either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other party.\n\n5.1 Compliance with Laws.

                "explanation": "Relocating the 'Compliance with Laws' clause to the 'Force Majeure' section buries a crucial compliance obligation within a section concerning unforeseeable events. This placement obscures the ongoing duty to comply with laws, potentially weakening enforcement as it's no longer prominently displayed in a dedicated regulatory compliance section.",

                "explanation": "Moving the Governing Law provision into the 'Definitions' section would obscure its importance. While the clause is still present, its unexpected location undermines its visibility and enforceability, as parties may overlook it when assessing their rights and obligations under the contract.",

The Receiving Party may use such Confidential Information only to the extent required to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement. The Receiving Party will use at least the same standard of care as it uses to protect proprietary or confidential information of its own to ensure that its, and its Affiliates', employees, agents, consultants and other representatives do not disclose or make any unauthorized use of the Confidential Information.

At any time for up to two (2) years after the Effective Date, should Life Technologies desire to offer for sale any Test outside the USA, it shall first discuss with Biocept an appropriate strategy and plan for such effort. Such strategy and plan may involve the development of, and obtaining all applicable regulatory authorizations for, an in vitro diagnostic kit, instruments or similar systems, in collaboration with Biocept (with funding support, and more fully described in Section 7.2), such strategy and plan to be reduced to writing and approved by the parties.\n\n10.1 Confidential Information.

                "explanation": "Changing 'five years' to 'one year' regarding confidential information. Additionally, changing 'same standard of care' to 'commercially reasonable' introduces ambiguity in determining the level of protection required. Changing 'promptly notify' to 'notify at the next Joint Steering Committee meeting' significantly delays the notification of potential breaches.",

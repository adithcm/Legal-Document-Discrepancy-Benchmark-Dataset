This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Arizona applicable to agreements fully executed and performed therein. Any claims arising hereunder or relating hereto shall be prosecuted only in the appropriate court or the State of Arizona or in the applicable United States District Court and neither party shall make any claim or demand in any other jurisdiction forum. Each party waives its right to a trial by jury and agrees to the jurisdiction of the judge in the appropriate court as governed by the State of Arizona. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and to the service of process by mail.",

The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and to the service of process by mail.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Arizona courts and waives jury trial rights. The modified version replaces this with a vague 'mutually agreed upon forum' for dispute resolution. This creates a legal contradiction because it voids the specific Arizona jurisdiction and the jury trial waiver from the agreement, making the actual method of resolution uncertain and unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The change adds the phrase 'which may or may not be paid at the discretion of TDA' to the royalty payment clause.

                "explanation": "The addition of 'if Smith does not object to the content of such advertising' introduces a contradiction. The clause initially states TDA will indemnify Smith for claims arising from advertising materials. The modified text means Smith is only indemnified if they don't object to the potentially harmful advertising, effectively creating a circumstance where Smith may want to prevent a claim to arise by objecting, but they also prevent TDA from indemnifying them. By Smith taking action to prevent the claim, they don't have any claim to seek TDA's indemnity. The legal obligation now depends on Smith's choices.",

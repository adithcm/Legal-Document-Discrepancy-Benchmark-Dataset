                "original_text": "THIS MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT IS GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE SUBJECT TO, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MASTER AGREEMENT BETWEEN NETZEE AND BANKERS BANK, INCLUDING THE LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY PROVIDED THEREIN. SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE HEREBY AFFIRMED BY BOTH PARTIES AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL LICENSES GRANTED OR EXERCISABLE THEREUNDER.",
                "changed_text": "THIS MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT IS GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE SUBJECT TO, SOME TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MASTER AGREEMENT BETWEEN NETZEE AND BANKERS BANK, INCLUDING THE LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY PROVIDED THEREIN ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH TERMS DO NOT CONFLICT WITH THIS AGREEMENT. SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE HEREBY ONLY PARTIALLY AFFIRMED BY BOTH PARTIES AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL LICENSES GRANTED OR EXERCISABLE THEREUNDER.",
                "explanation": "The modification adds ambiguity to the governing terms. Originally, the Maintenance Agreement was fully subject to the Master Agreement. Now, it suggests that only some terms apply and only when they don't conflict. This creates uncertainty about which parts of the Master Agreement are actually enforceable, potentially voiding certain terms of the original agreement, particularly the Limitations of Liability.",

                "changed_text": "Bankers Bank agrees to pay fees equal to $40 per month for all Participating Banks (original or added) for which maintenance is provided, unless otherwise agreed upon in a subsequent side agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a clause that permits altering the payment terms via 'side agreement'. This weakens the original agreement and introduces potential confusion/disputes about which payment terms are valid. It undermines the clarity and enforceability of the original payment clause.",

                "changed_text": "Maintenance provided by Netzee during the term of this Agreement shall include commercially reasonable efforts to provide standard maintenance upgrades, but Netzee reserves the right to modify or discontinue such maintenance upgrades at its sole discretion. Netzee will provide call-in support during mutually agreed upon hours. In the event of discrepancies, Netzee's sole obligation is to investigate and inform the customer of the findings. Availability of basic services will be provided, but Netzee does not guarantee any specific uptime percentage.",
                "explanation": "The revised clause significantly weakens Netzee's obligations. It removes the specific hours for call-in support, provides no guarantee of uptime, and eliminates any specific obligation to correct discrepancies, contradicting the original text. This reduces the enforceability of the maintenance service commitments.",

In addition to the other rights provided to Manager hereunder to disconnect the Projects of the Partners (or their Partner Affiliates), Manager shall disconnect the Projects of Alpha Willow, SP11, SP12, SP13, SP14 and SP21 (together with their Partner Affiliates, the \"LIFO Partners\") in the following circumstances.\n\nIf at any time, and for any reason other than force majeure affecting the Transmission Line, (i) the Transmission Line is incapable of delivering power at its designed capacity, availability or voltage and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would improve the capability of the transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or (ii) the Transmission Line line losses exceed 1.14%, the excess line losses have an adverse effect on the Projects of Alpha Mariah, Alpha Mariah (Prime), Beta Mariah, Beta Mariah (Prime), or Gamma Mariah or their Partner Affiliates, and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would reduce or eliminate such excess line losses, or (iii) the Transmission Line line losses for either of the power purchase contracts commonly known as Desert Winds I and Desert Winds III exceed the levels experienced immediately prior to the addition of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to the Transmission Line, the excess line losses have an adverse effect on the Projects of Alpha Joshua, Alpha Joshua (Prime), Beta Joshua, Beta Willow or Beta Willow (Prime) or their Partner Affiliates, and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would reduce or eliminate such excess line losses, then the Manager shall curtail the Projects of the LIFO Partners. Nothing contained in the preceding sentence shall affect the rights of the Manager to curtail or disconnect the Project of a Partner under Section 4 of that Partner's Technical Use Agreement. Any curtailment under this provision shall be in an amount sufficient to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or to reduce the Transmission Line line losses, as applicable, up to and including the Projects of all of the LIFO Partners. Such curtailment shall continue until the Manager shall determine that reconnecting the Projects of the LIFO Partners shall not result in the recurrence of the event giving rise to the curtailment. If the LIFO Partners shall inform the Manager in writing of an agreement among them concerning the priority of the curtailment of their respective Projects, the Manager shall effect any curtailment under these provisions according to such priority. If the LIFO Partners fail to so inform the Manager, the Manager shall in its discretion determine which of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to curtail. The Manager shall cooperate with the LIFO Partners to attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment under this provision, provided that any expenses in connection with such cooperation shall be paid by the LIFO Partners. In connection with any attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment, no change to the Transmission Line shall be made without the prior unanimous consent of the Partners (excluding the LIFO Partners), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.",

Any decision to disconnect shall be non-binding and subject to further negotiation between the Manager and the LIFO Partners.\n\nIf at any time, and for any reason other than force majeure affecting the Transmission Line, (i) the Transmission Line is incapable of delivering power at its designed capacity, availability or voltage and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners *might* improve the capability of the transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or (ii) the Transmission Line line losses *might* exceed 1.14%, the excess line losses *might* have an adverse effect on the Projects of Alpha Mariah, Alpha Mariah (Prime), Beta Mariah, Beta Mariah (Prime), or Gamma Mariah or their Partner Affiliates, and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners *might* reduce or eliminate such excess line losses, or (iii) the Transmission Line line losses for either of the power purchase contracts commonly known as Desert Winds I and Desert Winds III *might* exceed the levels experienced immediately prior to the addition of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to the Transmission Line, the excess line losses *might* have an adverse effect on the Projects of Alpha Joshua, Alpha Joshua (Prime), Beta Joshua, Beta Willow or Beta Willow (Prime) or their Partner Affiliates, and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners *might* reduce or eliminate such excess line losses, then the Manager *may* consider curtailing the Projects of the LIFO Partners. Nothing contained in the preceding sentence shall affect the rights of the Manager to curtail or disconnect the Project of a Partner under Section 4 of that Partner's Technical Use Agreement. Any curtailment under this provision shall be in an amount *deemed appropriate by the manager* to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or to reduce the Transmission Line line losses, as applicable, up to and including the Projects of all of the LIFO Partners.

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates the Manager to curtail LIFO Partners in certain transmission line conditions. The modified clause introduces ambiguity and optionality by using 'may', 'might', and 'consider', weakening the obligation. It also introduces language like 'deemed appropriate by the manager' which provides the Manager with a loophole to apply any amount, and 'endeavor' and 'reasonable' which are ambiguous and can be interpreted as non-binding. The contract shifts the responsibility to disconnect from the manager to further negotiation, undermining the intent.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states how to interpret references to the 'Manager'. This change introduces uncertainty by replacing 'shall' with 'may', implying that the references to ToyoWest Management Company could also refer to other entities, thus making the terms of the contract ambiguous and the manager's obligations unclear and potentially unenforceable.",

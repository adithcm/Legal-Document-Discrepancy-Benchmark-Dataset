                "explanation": "The reordering of the conditions undermines the clarity and enforceability of the indemnification clause. By relocating the 'no indemnification is required' section to the end, it creates ambiguity as to the scope of the indemnification obligation. Placing the limitations last suggests they might apply only to the phrase immediately preceding it, rather than the entire scope of the indemnification agreement. This shift could be interpreted as creating uncertainty about the extent to which the Blue Hills Parties are required to provide indemnification, weakening its protective value.",

The Holding Company shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration for not less than three years from the time of effectiveness or such shorter period as may be required by the Division or any other applicable regulator.",

The Holding Company shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration for a period determined at the discretion of the Holding Company, but not less than a commercially reasonable timeframe.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the specific three-year requirement with a vague 'commercially reasonable timeframe' introduces ambiguity. Section 12(b) mandates specific registration and ongoing reporting requirements. The original clause had a fixed duration, while the modification makes the duration subjective. The modified version implies compliance with Section 12(b) but removes the concrete timeframe, leading to uncertainty and potential non-compliance. The term \"commercially reasonable\" is vague and open to interpretation, which would weaken the enforceability of the registration requirement.",

                "explanation": "By adding the exception 'except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct,' the enforceability of the jury waiver is weakened. The introduction of these exceptions creates ambiguity. Gross negligence and willful misconduct are legal terms with specific meanings that would likely require judicial determination, thereby defeating the purpose of a jury waiver intended to prevent the need for jury trials. It introduces a loophole that can easily be invoked, thus diminishing the waiver's intended effect.",

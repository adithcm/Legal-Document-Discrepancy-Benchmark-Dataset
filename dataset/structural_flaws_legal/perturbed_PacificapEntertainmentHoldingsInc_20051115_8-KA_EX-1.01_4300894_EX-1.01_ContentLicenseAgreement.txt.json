                "original_text": "ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SETTLED VIA BINDING ARBITRATION ACCORDING TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS SET FORTH BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY , THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.",
                "changed_text": "ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SETTLED VIA BINDING ARBITRATION ACCORDING TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS SET FORTH BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION. The specific location of arbitration will be determined by mutual agreement between both parties, irrespective of the initial agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces a contradiction: while it initially states that disputes will be settled via binding arbitration according to AAA rules, it later allows for the location of arbitration to be determined by mutual agreement, potentially overriding the AAA rules which often specify location or a method for determining it. This could make the arbitration clause unenforceable as it introduces ambiguity.",

PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT reserves the right to alter acknowledgements if deemed necessary for promotional purposes.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT reserves the right to alter acknowledgements if deemed necessary for promotional purposes' directly contradicts the initial promise not to impair or alter copyright acknowledgements. This introduces a contradiction that undermines the intellectual property protection intended by the original clause and could weaken the agreement's enforceability regarding copyright issues.",

However, any projects currently in development at the time of termination will continue to be subject to revenue sharing until completion.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'However, any projects currently in development at the time of termination will continue to be subject to revenue sharing until completion' contradicts the preceding statement that 'All revenue sharing ceases with the termination of this Agreement.' This introduces uncertainty regarding the financial obligations upon termination, potentially leading to disputes and reduced enforceability of the termination clause.",

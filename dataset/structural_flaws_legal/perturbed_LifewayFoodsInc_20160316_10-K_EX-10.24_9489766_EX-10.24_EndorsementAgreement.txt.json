                "original_text": "15. Choice of Law and Forum - This Agreement will be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to conflict of laws principles.",
                "changed_text": "1. License - Individual grants Lifeway together with its affiliates, subsidiaries, parent companies and their representatives and employees have an unlimited, perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide and, except as set forth in Section 9, royalty-free, right to use, reuse, publish, reproduce, perform, copy, create derivative works, exhibit, broadcast, and display throughout the world the name, image and likeness of Individual in Marketing Materials (as defined below) in connection with marketing, advertising or otherwise promoting the Lifeway products and/or services and for historical reference and display purposes and other internal purposes, including without limitation, internal sales meetings. This Agreement will be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Lifeway shall be under no obligation to cause the Marketing Materials to be displayed, published or performed. Individual further waives the right to inspect or approve the Marketing Materials.",
                "explanation": "Moving the choice of law clause to the License section buries a crucial legal provision within a section detailing usage rights, making it less visible and potentially overlooked. This could hinder a party's ability to quickly understand the governing law in case of a dispute.",

Entire Agreement and Amendment - This Agreement, together with all exhibits, schedules and attachments, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Individual agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Lifeway from and against any and all claims, actions, causes or other expenses incurred arising from any misrepresentations or false statements made by the Individual in the Marketing Materials. This Agreement supersedes, and the terms of this Agreement govern, any prior agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof with the exception of any prior confidentiality agreements between the parties. This Agreement may only be changed by mutual agreement of authorized representatives of the parties in writing.",
                "explanation": "The placement of the indemnification clause within the 'Entire Agreement and Amendment' section makes it appear as though it only relates to prior agreements or amendments to the contract, potentially obscuring its broader application to any misrepresentations in the marketing materials. This reduces its clarity and enforceability.",

Compensation (a) In consideration of the rights granted by Individual hereunder, Lifeway agrees to pay Individual a royalty (the \"Royalty\") equal to $0.02 for each Lifeway product or individual item sold by Lifeway during each calendar month of the Term bearing Individual's first name, last name or other identifying personal characteristics; provided, however, the Royalty will cease being paid upon the death of Individual. Individual represents and warrants that any testimonial or review provided reflects her own honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences. Individual represents that she is a bona fide user of Lifeway products and/or services. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Royalty will not exceed $50,000 in any month.",
                "explanation": "By embedding the Representation clause inside the compensation subsection clause about royalty payments, it diminishes the emphasis of the individual's responsibilities. The Representation now appears to apply specifically to endorsements related to royalty payments instead of a general representation of truthfulness in all marketing materials.",

In the event either party is required to institute litigation to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party in such litigation shall be entitled to recover all costs including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and expenses incurred in connection with such enforcement and collection.",

In the event either party is required to institute litigation to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party may be entitled to recover all costs including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses incurred in connection with such enforcement and collection. The determination of whether these fees will be recovered is at the sole discretion of the judge.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall' to 'may' and adding the judge's discretion, the clause's enforceability regarding attorney's fees is weakened. It creates ambiguity where there was certainty.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces contradiction by stating Colorado law applies, but then allows for another jurisdiction's laws to apply if both parties agree. This makes the venue clause ambiguous and weakens its enforceability. Parties may dispute which jurisdiction applies in a given situation.",

In the event of any breach  of this  warranty or in the event any user of Product  makes a claim that  the  Product  was the cause of personal injury or property damage  (product  liability claim),  SIERRA shall indemnify,  defend and hold  ENVISION harmless from any liability occasioned  by a breach  of  warranty  or  a product  liability  claim. SIERRA  warrants  that it carries  general  liability  insurance of not less than $2 million  per occurrence and product liability insurance of not less than $5 million  per occurrence  and that,  upon the execution of this Agreement,  it  will name ENVISION as an additional  insured on such policies. SIERRA  further  warrants  that the Product will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning  of any federal, state, or local law or  regulation  or other  applicable  law. SIERRA  agrees to promptly notify ENVISION of any problem,  anomaly, defect or  condition which would reasonably cause ENVISION's concern relative to  stability, reliability, form, fit, function or quality of the Product.\n\nENVISION  warrants that the Finished Product will not be adulterated or misbranded  within the meaning of any federal,  state,  or local law or regulation or other  applicable law. In the event of any breach of this warranty or in the event any user of the Finished Product makes a claim that the Finished Product was the cause of personal injury or property damage (product liability claim), ENVISION shall indemnify, defend, and hold  SIERRA  harmless  from any  liability  occasioned  by a breach of warranty  or a  product  liability  claim. ENVISION  warrants  that it carries  general  liability  insurance of $1 million per occurrence and product liability  insurance of not less than $2 million per occurrence and that, upon execution of this  Agreement,  it will name SIERRA as an additional insured on such policies.",
                "changed_text": "13. Warranty. SIERRA warrants that the Product shall be free from defects in material and workmanship; however, SIERRA's liability is limited to the original purchase price. In the event of any breach of this warranty or in the event any user of Product makes a claim that the Product was the cause of personal injury or property damage (product liability claim), SIERRA may consider indemnifying, defending, and holding ENVISION harmless from any liability occasioned by a breach of warranty or a product liability claim, based on the availability of funds. SIERRA warrants that it carries general liability insurance of not less than $2 million per occurrence; but, in no way does this warranty guarantees that coverage extends to the product liability. SIERRA further warrants that the Product will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of any federal, state, or local law or regulation or other applicable law, except when reasonable delays occur due to force majeure.\n\nENVISION warrants that the Finished Product will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of any federal, state, or local law or regulation or other applicable law, provided this has undergone quality assessment. In the event of any breach of this warranty or in the event any user of the Finished Product makes a claim that the Finished Product was the cause of personal injury or property damage (product liability claim), ENVISION may offer assistance; however, financial liability shall be determined by a third-party arbitrator. ENVISION warrants that it carries general liability insurance of $1 million per occurrence, conditional on premium affordability.",
                "explanation": "The modified clause severely weakens both SIERRA's and ENVISION's warranties. For SIERRA, it limits liability to the purchase price, makes indemnification discretionary, suggests the insurance coverage might not apply to product liability claims, and allows for adulteration/misbranding due to force majeure. For ENVISION, the new clause uses conditional phrases, limits support instead of offering indemnification and relies on insurance affordability instead of committing. The modification contradicts the original commitment and the duty of good faith in warranty claims.",

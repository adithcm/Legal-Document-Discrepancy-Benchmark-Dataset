By moving this to the 'Fees and Expenses' section and changing the state to Delaware, it introduces confusion about which jurisdiction's laws apply. This misplaced clause now appears within a section detailing financial obligations, which is an unexpected and confusing location for a governing law provision.",

The Remarketing Agents may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketed Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder.

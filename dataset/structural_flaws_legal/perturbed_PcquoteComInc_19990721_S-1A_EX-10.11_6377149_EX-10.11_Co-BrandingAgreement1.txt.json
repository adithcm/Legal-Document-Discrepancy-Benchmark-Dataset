Each party irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Illinois and the federal courts situated in the State of Illinois, in connection with any action to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, to recover damages or other relief for breach or default under this Agreement, or otherwise arising under or by reason of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and enforced in all respects in accordance with the laws of a state to be determined later, except with regards to its rules regarding choice of law. Each party consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of a state to be determined later, in connection with any action to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, to recover damages or other relief for breach or default under this Agreement, or otherwise arising under or by reason of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Illinois law governs the agreement. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by stating the governing law will be 'a state to be determined later.' This contradiction undermines the enforceability of the contract as the jurisdiction is uncertain.",

SUCH LIMITATION SHALL BE THE EXTENT OF PCQ OR ABW'S LIABILITY REGARDLESS OF THE FORM IN WHICH ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE ACTION MAY BE BROUGHT AGAINST PCQ OR ABW, AND THE FOREGOING SHALL CONSTITUTE PCQ'S OR ABW'S SOLE REMEDY.  IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHICH ABW OR PCQ INCUR OR EXPERIENCE ON ACCOUNT OF ENTERING INTO OR RELYING ON THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF PCQ OR ABW HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

SUCH LIMITATION SHALL BE THE EXTENT OF PCQ OR ABW'S LIABILITY REGARDLESS OF THE FORM IN WHICH ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE ACTION MAY BE BROUGHT AGAINST PCQ OR ABW.

                "explanation": "The original text limits liability, preventing claims for lost profits or consequential damages. The modified text introduces a direct contradiction by stating that ABW *is* entitled to seek these damages. This creates a significant legal ambiguity about the scope of liability.",

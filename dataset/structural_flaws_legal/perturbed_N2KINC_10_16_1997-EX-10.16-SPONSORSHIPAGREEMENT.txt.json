NEITHER PARTY WILL BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS AS THEY RELATE TO SUCH USAGE REPORTS, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH USAGE REPORTS SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR PAYMENTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.",

HOWEVER, NEITHER PARTY WARRANTS THAT THE USAGE REPORTS WILL CONFORM TO ANY SPECIFICATIONS AT ANY GIVEN TIME.",
                "explanation": "This moves the warranty disclaimer to the middle of the statement, reducing its prominence and potentially creating ambiguity about its applicability. By burying it mid-sentence, it is less noticeable and could be overlooked, especially given the preceding statement about 'reasonable efforts'.",

                "original_text": "In the event that disputes between the parties arising from or concerning in any manner the subject matter of this Agreement, other than disputes arising from or concerning trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or confidentiality, cannot be resolved through good faith negotiation and mediation, the parties will refer the dispute(s) to the American Arbitration Association for resolution through binding arbitration by a single arbitrator pursuant to the American Arbitration Association's rules applicable to commercial disputes.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that disputes between the parties arise, the parties may choose to resolve the disputes through arbitration. If the parties choose to resolve the disputes through arbitration, the parties will refer the dispute(s) to the American Arbitration Association for resolution by a single arbitrator pursuant to the American Arbitration Association's rules applicable to commercial disputes. However, disputes concerning trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or confidentiality will not be subject to arbitration, and the parties may seek resolution through other means.",
                "explanation": "This change makes arbitration optional, where it was originally mandatory except for specific types of disputes. By changing 'will refer' to 'may choose to resolve,' the enforceability of arbitration as the primary method of dispute resolution is weakened. Furthermore, the removal of 'good faith negotiation and mediation' removes some steps of the binding nature to the arbitration clause.",

The parties may also send notice via facsimile or email, but the effective date of such notice will be determined at the sole discretion of the receiving party.",
                "explanation": "This change adds ambiguity to the notice provision by making facsimile and email notices subject to the receiver's discretion. This introduces uncertainty and weakens the enforceability of these methods, potentially leading to disputes about whether proper notice was given. It also directly contradicts the original agreement, stating that 'confirmed facsimile, confirmed email' is acceptable. ",

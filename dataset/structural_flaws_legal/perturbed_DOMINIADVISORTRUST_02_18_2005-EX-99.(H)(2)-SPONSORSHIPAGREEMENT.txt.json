The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder. As used in this Section 4, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.",

This Agreement shall be construed and enforced and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without reference to principles of conflicts of law. The captions in this Agreement are included for convenience only and in no way define or delimit any of the provisions hereof or otherwise affect their construction or effect. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but such counterparts shall, together, constitute only one instrument. The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance or gross negligence in the performance of its duties. As used in this Section 10, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.",
                "explanation": "The 'Limitation of Liability' clause is moved to the 'Miscellaneous' section. This section is generally for boilerplate clauses, and moving the liability limitation here obfuscates its importance and makes it less discoverable for parties reviewing the contract. Additionally, it removes the 'bad faith' and 'reckless disregard' clauses, which may further lessen the responsibilities of the sponsor.",

For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a fee accrued daily and payable monthly at an annual rate equal to 0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets for the Trust's then current fiscal year. If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be prorated. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information.",

For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a fee accrued daily and payable monthly at an annual rate equal to 0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets for the Trust's then current fiscal year, assuming sufficient profitability. If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be prorated, but only if the Board of Trustees determines adequate service was provided.

                "explanation": "Added qualifiers related to profitability and Board of Trustee determination. The initial wording clearly states the payment terms. The modified text introduces ambiguity and conditions ('assuming sufficient profitability', 'only if the Board of Trustees determines adequate service'). This creates uncertainty about the Sponsor's compensation and shifts discretion to the Trust, potentially leading to disputes and difficulty in enforcing the payment terms.",

                "explanation": "The changed text alters the condition on penalty upon agreement termination. It introduces a significant ambiguity and contradiction. Originally, termination could occur 'without the payment of any penalty'. This is changed to 'with the payment of a reasonable penalty', but 'reasonable' is undefined. This adds contradiction as the amount of reasonable penalty would be subject to interpretation and disagreement. Such change undermines the clarity and enforceability of the termination terms by opening door to disagreements about what penalty is considered reasonable.",

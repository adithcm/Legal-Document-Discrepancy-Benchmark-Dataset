In the event of a dispute arising out of this Agreement, the parties shall first negotiate in good faith in an effort to reach a settlement of the dispute. If having negotiated in good faith, the parties are unable to resolve their dispute, the parties shall submit the dispute to binding arbitration by a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall take place at an agreed location, or if the parties cannot agree on a venue in Reno, Nevada or Vancouver, BC, as determined by the flip of a coin. The arbitrator shall have jurisdiction over the conduct of discovery prior to the hearing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 11.13 shall be construed to prohibit either party from seeking appropriate injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "Moving the dispute resolution clause into the middle of the 'Notices' section buries a critical legal term within logistical contact information. This is now difficult to find the dispute clause, and its significance is obscured. This reduces the clarity and enforceability of the arbitration agreement.",

                "explanation": "Warranty disclaimers are crucial. Moving them to the counterparts clause—related to how the contract is signed rather than the substance of the agreement—makes it harder to find and thus weakens its enforceability, especially because it will look like it relates only to the signing procedure.",

                "explanation": "Legal fee stipulations are typically located with legal provisos, such as dispute resolution. Placing this between heading declarations makes the provision less clear and weakens its position. Also, it looks like it relates solely to the declaration of headings. The reader would be forgiven for mistaking the attorney's fees provision as an ancillary statement of how the heading section should be read rather than a freestanding contractual term.",

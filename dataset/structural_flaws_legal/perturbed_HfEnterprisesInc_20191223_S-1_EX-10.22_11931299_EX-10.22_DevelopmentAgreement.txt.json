                "original_text": "9.10. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of laws principles. It is hereby irrevocably agreed that legal jurisdiction and venue for any proceeding arising out of this Agreement shall be in the state or federal courts located in the County of Monroe, State of New York, United States.",
                "changed_text": "9.4. Relationship of the Parties. This Agreement shall be governed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of laws principles. It is hereby irrevocably agreed that legal jurisdiction and venue for any proceeding arising out of this Agreement shall be determined through mutual agreement of both parties. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between the parties, or as authorizing either party to act as agent for the other.",
                "explanation": "Moving the jurisdiction clause from a dedicated 'Governing Law; Jurisdiction' section to the 'Relationship of the Parties' section is misleading. Furthermore, changing it to 'mutual agreement' makes the clause unenforceable, as it is vague and doesn't specify a default jurisdiction if the parties disagree. This introduces a legal contradiction by implying jurisdiction is subject to negotiation, conflicting with standard legal practice where contracts clearly define jurisdiction.",

The parties acknowledge and agree that any material breach of this Agreement may subject the other to irreparable injury for which monetary damages may not be an adequate remedy. Therefore, in addition to any remedies otherwise available, the non-breaching party may be entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance to enforce the terms of this Agreement. The breaching party shall pay all reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, arbitration costs, and/or appeal costs incurred by the non-breaching party should it be necessary for the non-breaching party to enforce the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "5. Confidentiality; Non-Disclosure. The parties acknowledge that they have entered into that certain Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated as of January 18, 2018 (the \"NDA\"), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A. The terms of the NDA shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Agreement, mutatis mutandis. During the Term of this Agreement and thereafter for a period of five (5) years, the parties shall be bound by all of the protective terms and conditions of the NDA. The parties acknowledge and agree that any material breach of this Agreement may subject the other to irreparable injury for which monetary damages may not be an adequate remedy. Therefore, in addition to any remedies otherwise available, the non-breaching party may be entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance to enforce the terms of this Agreement. The breaching party shall only be responsible for attorney's fees if awarded by the Court.",
                "explanation": "Moving the clause allowing the non-breaching party to be paid reasonable attorney's fees from a more general Miscellaneous section to the Confidentiality section reduces its discoverability. Furthermore, changing it to only when attorney's fees are 'awarded by the Court' introduces ambiguity and removes the guarantee of coverage, which would normally apply even outside a court scenario, such as in arbitration.",

A party's failure to assert any right or remedy shall not constitute a waiver of that right or remedy. No waiver by either party of any default shall be deemed as a waiver of prior or subsequent default of the same or other provisions of this Agreement.",

For purposes of this Agreement, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below.  \"Improvements\" shall mean technical improvements, modifications or enhancements relating to the Technology that are developed by the Developer pursuant to this Agreement. \"Intellectual Property\" shall mean, but shall not be limited to, all of DSS's (i) issued and pending patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, designs, logos, and copyrights, and all pending applications for registration thereof; (ii) know-how, inventions, improvements, methods, operation manuals and procedures, trade secrets, technical information, formulas; (iii) computer software and programs, and related documentation, updates, and data, whether in object or source code form, and (vi) other similar proprietary and intellectual rights, whether or not registered. \"Person\" shall mean any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, trust or any other entity or organization of any kind or character, including a governmental authority or agency.  The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement, and all other rights and remedies available to either party at law or in equity are, to the extent permitted by law, exclusive of any other right or remedy now or hereafter available at law or in equity. \"Technology\" shall collectively mean (i) DSS's proprietary AuthentiGuard® technology (including DSS's related patents and patent applications, inventions, software, trademarks, trade names, service marks, technology marks, designs, logos, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and any other DSS owned intellectual property relating thereto), consisting of a unique application of the AuthentiGuard® patent coupled with next generation technology and software which enables and end-to-end brand protection solution for product authentication, counterfeit deterrence and data tracking via embedded customized technology marks with hidden codes placed in products which can be read an authenticated via an application loaded on various devices along with necessary hardware and DSS's portal, (ii) DSS's Prism Viewer technology comprised of a custom covert Prism image imbedded in a customer's products that is viewed and authenticated through the use of DSS's propriety smart phone application, and (iii) DSS's AuthentiSite technology suite comprised of an embedded digital Prism image coupled with a cloud-based security server and a smart phone verification application for website authentication.",
                "explanation": "Moving the 'Remedies Cumulative; Waiver' clause to the Definitions section makes it less accessible. This clause is critical for understanding the parties' rights in case of a breach and moving it to the Definitions section reduces clarity and enforceability. Furthermore, 'exclusive' was changed from 'cumulative', which is a legal contradiction.",

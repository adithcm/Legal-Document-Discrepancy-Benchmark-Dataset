Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures specified in this Section 15.12. The Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement by negotiation between a committee composed of four (4) members (two (2) from each Party) mutually agreed upon from the Subcontractor and Manufacturer boards of directors. Any Party may give the other Party written notice of any dispute not resolved in the normal course of business. Such notice shall include (a) a statement of that Party's position and a summary of arguments supporting that position, and (b) the name and title of the executive who will be representing that Party and of any other person who will accompany the executive in the negotiations. Within fifteen (15) days after delivery of the notice, the receiving Party shall respond with (a) a statement of that Party's position and a summary of arguments supporting that position, and (b) the name and title of the executive who will represent that Party and of any other person who will accompany the executive in the negotiations. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the initial notice, the executives of both Parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary to attempt to resolve the dispute. All reasonable requests for information made by one Party to the other will be honored. All negotiations pursuant to this clause are confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of applicable rules of evidence. 15.12.2 Mediation. If the dispute has not been resolved by the negotiation process specified in Section 15.12.1 within forty-five (45) days following the initial notice, the Parties may endeavor to settle the dispute by mediation under the then current CPR Mediation Procedure published by the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution (NYC). Unless otherwise agreed, the Parties will select a mediator from the CPR Panels of Distinguished Neutrals. 15.12.3 Choice of Law; Venue. If any dispute has not been resolved by a non-binding procedure as provided herein, within one-hundred twenty (120) days of the initiation of such procedure the complaining Party may seek such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate in the federal or state courts located in Maricopa County, Arizona. The Parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof or any other applicable law and that exclusive venue shall be in the federal or state courts located in Maricopa County, Arizona. Nothing stated herein is intended to limit either Party's right to seek emergency, temporary or permanent injunctive relief and both Parties expressly agree that either Party will be entitled to such relief to prevent actual or threatened violation of the confidentiality provisions in Section 11 herein. If there is a dispute or legal action regarding this agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs.",

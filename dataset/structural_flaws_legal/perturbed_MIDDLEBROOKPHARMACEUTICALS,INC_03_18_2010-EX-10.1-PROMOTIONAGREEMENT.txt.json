Each Party represents and warrants that it shall comply in all material respects with any and all applicable federal,  state, and local laws and regulations and industry guidances and standards applicable to the conduct of business and  the execution of any and all marketing and promotional services or activities pursuant to this Agreement, including but  not limited to: the federal anti-kickback statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b); federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and  relevant regulations; FDA promotional guidelines; FDA's Guidance on Industry-Supported Scientific and Educational  Activities (1997); US Department of Health and Human Services OIG Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical  Manufacturers (2003); the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (\"PhRMA\")  Code on Interactions  With Healthcare Professionals; and ethics opinions of the American Medical Association (\"AMA\").",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'but such compliance is not guaranteed' creates uncertainty and weakens the enforceability of the compliance clause. It introduces a legal contradiction by initially stating a warranty of compliance and then immediately disclaiming it.",

In the event of any controversy or claim arising from or relating to any provision of this Agreement, or any term or  condition hereof, or the performance by a party of its obligations hereunder, or its construction or its actual or alleged  breach, the Parties will try to settle their differences amicably between themselves in negotiations between the Parties'  respective Presidents or their executive level designees. If the dispute has not been resolved to the mutual satisfaction  of the Parties within sixty (60) days after delivery of written notice of such dispute, either party may request binding  arbitration.\n\n21.2. Any dispute which is not resolved by executive level negotiations will be settled by final and binding arbitration  before a single arbitrator in Asheville, NC and such arbitration will be conducted pursuant to then current rules of  arbitration of commercial disputes of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the  arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing party reasonable attorney's fees, expenses and costs. In no event will the arbitrator have any right or power to  award punitive or exemplary damages.",

In the event of any controversy or claim arising from or relating to any provision of this Agreement, or any term or  condition hereof, or the performance by a party of its obligations hereunder, or its construction or its actual or alleged  breach, the Parties will try to settle their differences amicably between themselves in negotiations between the Parties'  respective Presidents or their executive level designees. If the dispute has not been resolved to the mutual satisfaction  of the Parties, either party may, at their sole discretion, pursue mediation, arbitration, or other legal remedies as they deem appropriate.\n\n21.2. Arbitration is not required, and the choice to arbitrate rests solely with each party. The location and rules of any arbitration, should both parties agree to it, will be determined by mutual agreement at the time the dispute arises.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original arbitration clause, which mandated binding arbitration after a failed negotiation period. The modified text introduces uncertainty and non-binding nature of arbitration by stating that any party may 'pursue mediation, arbitration, or other legal remedies', and that 'Arbitration is not required'. This creates ambiguity regarding the dispute resolution process.",

                "explanation": "The inclusion of 'unless both parties agree to litigate in the state of Delaware' contradicts the initial choice of forum (North Carolina). This adds an element of uncertainty and makes it difficult to determine where a dispute will be resolved. Conflicting the choice of forum clause creates a contradiction that could lead to legal challenges regarding which jurisdiction has authority.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be non-refundable' to 'may be refundable based on a policy to be determined' introduces ambiguity and contradiction. It weakens the clear, upfront disclosure of the financial terms and creates uncertainty for consumers about the refund policy, conflicting with requirements for clear and conspicuous disclosure of financial terms.

                "original_text": "The parties desire to resolve disputes arising out of this Agreement without litigation. Accordingly, except for an action seeking a temporary restraining order or injunction related to the purposes of this Agreement, or a suit to compel compliance with this dispute resolution process, the parties agree to use the following alternative dispute resolution procedure as their sole remedy with respect to any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its breach.\n\n        b.     At the written request of a party, each party shall appoint a                knowledgeable, responsible representative to meet and negotiate                in good faith to resolve any dispute arising under this                Agreement. The parties intend that these negotiations be                conducted by non-lawyer, business representatives. The                discussions shall be left to the discretion of the                representatives. Upon agreement, the representatives may utilize                other alternative dispute resolution procedures such as mediation                to assist in the negotiations. Discussions and correspondence                among the representatives for purposes of these negotiations                shall be treated as confidential information developed for                purposes of settlement, exempt from discovery and production,                which shall not be admissible in the arbitration described below                or in any lawsuit without the concurrence of all parties.                Documents identified in or provided with such communications,                which are not prepared for purposes of the negotiations, are not                so exempted and may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted in                evidence in the arbitration or lawsuit.\n\n        c.     If the negotiations do not resolve the dispute within sixty (60)                days of the initial written request, the dispute shall be                submitted to binding arbitration by a single arbitrator pursuant                to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration                Association.",
                "changed_text": "The parties desire to resolve disputes arising out of this Agreement without litigation. The parties can select a means of resolution, including litigation if they choose to do so. \n\n        b.     At the written request of a party, each party may appoint any representative to handle negotiations as they see fit.\n\n        c.     If the negotiations do not resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days of the initial written request, the dispute can be submitted to a means of resolution as agreed upon by both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandated alternative dispute resolution. The modification introduces contradiction by stating that parties 'can select a means of resolution, including litigation'. This directly contradicts the initial desire to avoid litigation and weakens the commitment to the specific alternative dispute resolution procedure. It introduces uncertainty about the dispute resolution process and removes the guarantee of arbitration, moving it from binding arbitration to arbitration that the parties may or may not agree to.",

PageMaster Corporations' liability shall in no event exceed an amount equivalent to the amounts received by Go Call.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by initially stating no warranties are provided then stating PageMaster is fully liable for service interruptions and capacity constraints. This contradicts standard practices and creates uncertainty, since these statements are mutually exclusive. Also, amount received by PageMaster Corporation being paid to Go Call is a conflict of interest and goes against standards.",

In no event shall DGT be liable for consequential or incidental damages arising from any breach or breaches of this Agreement.

                "explanation": "Moving the sentence regarding consequential or incidental damages to the end makes it seem separate from the previous limitation of liability clauses, potentially weakening its protective effect. Because the provision is separated from the preceding clause that states liability is limited to the 'amount of the cost of the products', it can be argued there is no limit on the liability.",

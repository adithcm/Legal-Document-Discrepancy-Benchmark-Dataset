                "original_text": "L. ATTORNEY'S FEES. If any arbitration, litigation, action, suit, or other proceeding is instituted to remedy, prevent or obtain relief from a breach of this Agreement, in relation to a breach of this Agreement or pertaining to a declaration of rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will recover all such party's attorneys' fees incurred in each and every such action, suit or other proceeding, including any and all appeals or petitions there from. As used in this Agreement, attorneys' fees will be deemed to be the full and actual cost of any legal services actually performed in connection with the matters involved, including those related to any appeal to the enforcement of any judgment calculated on the basis of the usual fee charged by attorneys performing such services.",
                "changed_text": "L. ATTORNEY'S FEES. If any litigation, action, suit, or other proceeding is instituted to remedy, prevent or obtain relief from a breach of this Agreement, in relation to a breach of this Agreement or pertaining to a declaration of rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party may recover all such party's attorneys' fees incurred in each and every such action, suit or other proceeding, including any and all appeals or petitions there from, but the decision of attorney's fees is at the judge's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates the recovery of attorney's fees by the prevailing party in any legal proceeding. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by stating attorney's fees 'may' be recovered and that the decision is at the judge's discretion. This contradicts the original mandatory recovery, potentially discouraging parties from pursuing legitimate claims due to the uncertain outcome regarding legal costs. Such a change affects enforceability.",

                "explanation": "The original clause strictly prohibits UTK from divulging confidential information of AVDU unless authorized in writing. The modified clause introduces a contradiction by allowing UTK, at its discretion, to divulge confidential information if it's 'necessary to further their business prospects.'

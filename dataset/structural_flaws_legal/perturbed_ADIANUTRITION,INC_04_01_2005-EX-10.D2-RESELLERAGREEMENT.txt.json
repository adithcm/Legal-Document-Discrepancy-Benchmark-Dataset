                "explanation": "The addition of 'except when PivX deems otherwise in writing' after the disclaimer of warranties creates a contradiction. While the original text clearly disclaims all implied warranties, the added phrase introduces uncertainty, potentially negating the disclaimer. This makes it difficult to determine the enforceability of the warranty disclaimer.",

However, PivX reserves the right to pursue legal action in Detto's principal place of business.",
                "explanation": "The clause originally specifies California law and jurisdiction. Adding 'However, PivX reserves the right to pursue legal action in Detto's principal place of business' introduces a jurisdictional contradiction. While California law is meant to govern, PivX can choose to litigate in Washington, potentially undermining the California choice of law provision and creating uncertainty.",

This Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach of this Agreement by the other party that is not cured within thirty (30) days of the other party's receipt of written notice of such breach. If a material breach is cured within a thirty (30) day cure period this Agreement shall remain in effect as if no material breach had occurred. This Agreement shall terminate automatically without notice and without further action by the other party in the event that the other party becomes insolvent, which means it becomes unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business as they come due, or makes an assignment of this Agreement for the benefit of creditors.",

                "explanation": "The clause stipulates that the agreement terminates automatically if a party becomes insolvent. The added exception, 'except when the Parties mutually decide to not terminate this agreement,' directly contradicts the 'automatic termination' provision.

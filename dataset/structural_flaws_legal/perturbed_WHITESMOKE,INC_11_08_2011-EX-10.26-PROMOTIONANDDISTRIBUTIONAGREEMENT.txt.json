                "original_text": "8.5 Distributor will comply with all applicable commercial and public anti-bribery laws, including, without limitation, the UK's Bribery Act  2010 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\"Anti-Bribery Laws\"), which prohibit (amongst other things) corrupt offers of  anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official to obtain or keep business. ''Government officials\" include any  government employee, candidate for public office, and employee of government-owned or government-controlled companies, public  international organisations, and political parties. Furthermore, Distributor will not make any facilitation payments, which are payments to  induce officials to perform routine functions they are otherwise obligated to perform.",
                "changed_text": "8.5 Distributor is encouraged to be mindful of anti-bribery laws. While strict adherence is preferred, the parties acknowledge that local customs and business practices may necessitate some flexibility. Distributor should endeavour to avoid direct contravention of anti-bribery laws to the best of its ability.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandated strict compliance with anti-bribery laws. The modified clause suggests that while compliance is preferred, flexibility is acceptable due to local customs. This introduces ambiguity and weakens the enforceability of the anti-bribery provision, potentially contradicting the spirit and letter of the UK Bribery Act 2010 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977.",

Distributor shall comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations (\"Export  Laws\"), which the parties agree include: (a) the Export Administration Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, (b)  trade and economic sanctions maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, and (c) the International  Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State. Unless Distributor obtains prior authorisation required by  applicable Export Laws, Distributor shall not export any Product to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria.",

However, the parties agree that such compliance will be determined solely by Distributor based on its internal risk assessment policies. Unless Distributor obtains prior authorization required by what it determines to be applicable Export Laws, Distributor shall attempt to avoid exporting any Product to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the Distributor shall comply with all export control laws and regulations. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by stating that such compliance will be determined by the Distributor based on its internal risk assessment. By transferring the determination of which laws apply to the Distributor, the enforceability of the clause is significantly diminished and contradicts regulations that must be followed.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear condition for indemnification which Google will follow through with if an IP claim arises. The changed clause modifies the conditions required for indemnification. By adding caveats like 'unless circumstances prevent such notification', 'to the extent Distributor deems necessary', and giving the Distributor the right to make the final decisions on the matter, this weakens the guarantee of indemnification, introducing ambiguity and a potential out for Google to refuse or dispute the indemnification claim.",

The intent is that by removing the clear statement of the applicable law and replacing with \"Submission to Jurisdiction\", it introduces ambiguity and necessitates further legal interpretation. This may lead a party to incorrectly assume a specific jurisdiction applies for all disputes, when the governing law may dictate otherwise. It obfuscates the governing law.",

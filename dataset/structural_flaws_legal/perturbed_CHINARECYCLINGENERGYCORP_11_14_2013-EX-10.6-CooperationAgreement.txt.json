If negotiations fail, either party could take a legal action to the local people's court where Party A is located.",
                "explanation": "The original dispute resolution clause mandated legal action in Party A's local court. The modified clause adds the phrase 'a mutually agreeable alternative dispute resolution method will be pursued', creating ambiguity. It now implies negotiation as the primary method, contradicting the original clause's direct allowance of legal action, leading to uncertainty regarding the binding nature of the dispute resolution process and court jurisdiction.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates principles of contract certainty and enforceability. While not directly violating a specific law, it weakens the enforceability of the dispute resolution clause, which could be challenged under general contract law principles.",

                "explanation": "The original termination clause states the agreement is automatically terminated if any main equipment stops operation. The modified clause adds 'unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties in writing.' This creates a contradiction. While the original clause implies automatic termination, the addition allows for continued operation under potentially different, unstated terms, thus weakening the initial automatic termination clause.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates disputes be resolved exclusively in England and Wales courts. The modified text replaces this with a vague 'mutually agreed upon' method, contradicting the original explicit jurisdiction clause. This introduces ambiguity and makes the jurisdictional requirement unenforceable as there is no clear enforcement mechanism.",

Such indemnification obligation of Tom Holding is conditioned upon Skype promptly notifying Tom Holding in writing setting forth with specificity the claim or action to which such indemnification obligation applies, and reasonable cooperation, information, and assistance in connection therewith. Tom Holding will have the right to control the defense of each such claim and any lawsuit or proceeding arising therefrom. In no event will Skype settle any such claim or lawsuit or proceeding arising therefrom without the prior written approval of Tom Holding. In defending against such claim or action, Tom Holding may (i) contest; (ii) settle; (iii) and in the case of any claim that the Group Rights infringe the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party, (a) procure for Skype and its customers the right to continue using the Group Rights, as applicable, or (b) modify or replace the Group Rights, as applicable, so that it they longer infringe.",

In defending against such claim or action, Tom Holding may (i) contest; (ii) settle only after written consent from Skype, which can be withheld for any reason; (iii) and in the case of any claim that the Group Rights infringe the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party, (a) procure for Skype and its customers the right to continue using the Group Rights, as applicable, or (b) modify or replace the Group Rights, as applicable, so that it they longer infringe.",
                "explanation": "The change removes the 'unconditionally' guarantees, changes 'promptly notifying' to just 'notifying' and 'reasonable cooperation' to 'minimal cooperation'. These make it more difficult for Skype to actually receive indemnification because it removes the right from Tom Holding to control the defense of each such claim. These changes reduce the strength and clarity of Tom Holding's guarantee, making the indemnification clause less enforceable.",

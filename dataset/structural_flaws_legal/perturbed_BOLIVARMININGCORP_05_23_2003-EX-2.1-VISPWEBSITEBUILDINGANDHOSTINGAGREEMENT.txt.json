Any controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement that has not been resolved through the informal mediation of the parties shall be resolved through arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect, as modified by the terms set forth below: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted in New York state; (b) the arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator selected by the parties; (c) the parties shall act in a commercially reasonable manner and speedily select and then conduct the arbitration within 45 days with the expenditure of minimal discovery efforts and expense which shall be determined, if necessary, by the arbitrator. The agreement to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable under prevailing New York law.  Any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be binding and enforceable by any party to the arbitration and judgment shall be rendered upon it in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in New York.",
                "changed_text": "All questions regarding the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York. Any controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to non-binding mediation prior to either party seeking any other legal remedy. Arbitration may be used at either parties discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates arbitration under specific rules. The modification allows for non-binding mediation as the primary step, and makes arbitration optional, contradicting the original mandatory arbitration agreement. This weakens the enforceability of the arbitration clause.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'Provider reserves the right to alter these fees at any point without any prior written notice or consent' a legal contradiction is created regarding the fixed fees. This undermines the certainty of the financial terms, potentially violating laws requiring clear and upfront disclosure of costs.",

However, Provider reserves the right to reduce or eliminate services offered based on its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modification adds a clause that the 'Provider reserves the right to reduce or eliminate services offered based on its sole discretion.' This directly contradicts the initial promise of 'no charge' for specified services. This creates uncertainty and allows the provider to unilaterally change the agreement, making it harder to enforce the original terms.",

                "original_text": "12.1 The execution, effect, interpretation and performance of this Agreement and resolution of any dispute arising from this Agreement will be governed by PRC Laws. 12.2 Any dispute arising from construction or performance of this Agreement will be firstly resolved through negotiations of the Parties. 12.3 If the Parties fail to resolve the dispute through negotiations, any of the Parties may submit the dispute for resolution by litigation at the local people's court having jurisdiction over Party A.",
                "changed_text": "14.5 This Agreement is made in six counterparts with two for each Party, and each original has the same effect. 12.1 The execution, effect, interpretation and performance of this Agreement and resolution of any dispute arising from this Agreement will be governed by mutual agreement of the parties. 12.2 Any dispute arising from construction or performance of this Agreement will be firstly resolved through negotiations of the Parties. 12.3 If the Parties fail to resolve the dispute through negotiations, any of the Parties may submit the dispute for resolution by internal mediation.",
                "explanation": "The governing law and dispute resolution clause is moved to the 'Supplemental Provisions' section, which typically concerns administrative or boilerplate matters, not core legal procedures. The shift of governing law from 'PRC Laws' to 'mutual agreement of the parties' and dispute resolution to 'internal mediation' creates a structural flaw that makes it difficult for the parties to enforce their legal rights under the contract, and the shift to internal mediation reduces enforceability. The change from PRC laws to the agreement of the parties can potentially void the clause.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'without prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, may not' creates a contradiction in the confidentiality clause. It initially mandates strict confidentiality, but now implies information can be disclosed to third parties while still holding the receiving party liable, undermining the purpose of the confidentiality agreement. This also contradicts the statement that the receiving party 'will keep in strict confidence'.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless it sees fit to do so' at the end of the paragraph introduces a legal contradiction. It negates the initial firm commitment of Party A to fulfill specific promotional obligations. By adding this clause, Party A can avoid being held in breach, even if they fail to meet those promotional obligations. It gives full discretion to Party A regardless of previous requirements.",

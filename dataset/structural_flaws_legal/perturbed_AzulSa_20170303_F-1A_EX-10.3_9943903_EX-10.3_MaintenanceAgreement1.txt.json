                "explanation": "Moving the 'INSURANCES' section to 'MISCELLANEOUS' makes it less visible and easily overlooked, thus increasing the risk of non-compliance. Normally, important items such as insurance requirements are placed within their own section rather than be an addendum to miscellaenous terms.",

                "explanation": "Moving the 'DISCLAIMER' section to 'DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION' is misleading because disclaimers should be distinct and clearly labelled. This placement can obscure the liability limitations, making them harder to recognize and understand.",

This strategic relocation introduces a contradictionâ€”while the contract intends to establish clear legal jurisdiction, its placement dilutes its emphasis, potentially causing confusion or oversight during dispute resolution. This contradicts legal best practices that advocate for clear and direct articulation of governing law and arbitration processes to ensure all parties are fully aware of their rights and obligations.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from New York to Delaware when the involved parties are based in New Jersey and Massachusetts respectively creates confusion and potentially weakens enforceability. Selecting Delaware law, while not entirely irrelevant (Conformis is a Delaware corporation), introduces ambiguity as it is not the primary location of business for either party's operations or negotiations.",

                "explanation": "Changing the jurisdiction from New York to Delaware introduces contradiction and confusion regarding where disputes will be resolved, similar to the governing law change. This contradiction makes it less clear where the contract can be enforced, thereby reducing its enforceability.",

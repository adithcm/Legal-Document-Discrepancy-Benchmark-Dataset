                "original_text": "Governing Law and Forum. This Agreement will for all purposes be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that require the application of the laws of a different state. Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably agrees that the federal and state courts in the Northern District of California shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any suit or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement, (ii) submits to the venue and jurisdiction of such courts, and (iii) irrevocably consents to personal jurisdiction by such courts.",
                "changed_text": "Governing Law and Forum. This Agreement will for all purposes be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of a state that the parties mutually agree on at the time of any dispute, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that require the application of the laws of a different state. Each of the parties hereto (i) agrees that the courts in a district agreed upon at the time of any suit or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement shall have jurisdiction, (ii) submits to the venue and jurisdiction of such courts if agreed upon, and (iii) consents to personal jurisdiction by such courts if the parties have agreed to such.",
                "explanation": "By changing the location of the governing law and forum, the legal jurisdiction and venue are now ambiguously defined and subject to future agreement, which contradicts the original clause's intention to establish a clear and enforceable jurisdiction. The original clause clearly specifies California law and the Northern District of California courts, whereas the altered clause introduces uncertainty by making the governing law and forum contingent upon mutual agreement at the time of a dispute.",

                "changed_text": "Each party agrees to consider carrying liability insurance to possibly cover some of the risks potentially posed under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that each party carries liability insurance. The modified text weakens this obligation to merely 'consider' obtaining insurance, and further weakens the coverage requirement from 'sufficient' to 'possibly cover some.' This creates a contradiction by implying that insurance is optional and that full coverage is not required. This is particularly problematic as insurance requirements are a key part of risk mitigation.",

In such event, all payments made shall become immediately due and payable and this Agreement shall not be automatically terminated but may be terminated following negotiations.",
                "explanation": "The original force majeure clause stipulates that upon the occurrence of a force majeure event lasting two months or more, 'all payments made shall become immediately due and payable and this Agreement shall be automatically terminated.' The modified text contradicts this automatic termination by stating that the agreement 'shall not be automatically terminated but may be terminated following negotiations.' This creates uncertainty regarding the termination process and obligations of the parties during and after a force majeure event.",

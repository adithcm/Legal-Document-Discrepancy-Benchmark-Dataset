The Parties shall seek to resolve any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including without limitation, any dispute regarding the enforceability of any provision, through good faith negotiations between them within Thirty (30) days of any notice of dispute being served or such longer period of time as may be mutually agreed between the Parties. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within this timeframe, and one or both parties one or both parties desire to pursue the dispute, the complaining party must submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association. The Parties will share equally the cost of arbitrating such dispute. The arbitrator(s) shall not be empowered to award punitive or other damages in excess of compensatory damages, and both parties irrevocably waive the right to any such damages. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered by any court having jurisdiction over the dispute. In the event that the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator within a Thirty (30) day period, each party shall designate an arbitrator and those two arbitrators shall choose a third arbitrator, with that third arbitrator serving as the sole arbitrator of the dispute.",

Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all notices, consents, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted hereunder: (i) shall be in writing; (ii)) shall be sent by email, certified or registered U.S. mail, or reliable express delivery service (with a copy sent by one of the foregoing means), charges prepaid as applicable, to the appropriate address(es) or number(s) set forth below; and (iii) shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt by the addressee, as evidenced by (A) a receipt executed by the addressee (or a responsible person in his or her office), the records of the Person delivering such communication or a notice to the effect that such addressee refused to claim or accept such communication, if sent by messenger, U.S. mail or express delivery service, or (B) a receipt generated by the sender's email showing that such communication was sent to the appropriate number on a specified date, if sent by email. The Parties shall seek to resolve any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including without limitation, any dispute regarding the enforceability of any provision, through good faith negotiations between them within Thirty (30) days of any notice of dispute being served or such longer period of time as may be mutually agreed between the Parties.

All such communications shall be sent to the addresses for each Party as first set forth above, or to such other addresses or numbers as any Party may inform the others by giving Seven (7) days prior notice.",
                "explanation": "Moving the dispute resolution clause (including the arbitration agreement) into the section about 'Notices' makes it less obvious and harder to find. It's no longer in a section explicitly labeled for disputes, making it difficult for a party to readily understand the required dispute resolution mechanism. This reduces the clause's enforceability by obscuring its purpose.",

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by each of the Parties on separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute but one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by email shall be equally as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. Any Party delivering an executed counterpart of this Agreement by email shall also deliver a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement, but the failure to deliver a manually executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability or binding effect of this Agreement. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR PURCHASE OR USE OF THE PRODUCTS.",
                "explanation": "By moving the limitation of liability clause to the section on 'Counterparts; Email Execution,' its prominence and relevance are diminished.

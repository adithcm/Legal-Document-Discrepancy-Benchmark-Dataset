                "original_text": "TPC acknowledges that time is of the essence in the payment of all compensation due Consolidated Artists hereunder. For the purposes of this Agreement, all payments not received within thirty (30) days of the date due shall be deemed \"past due\". Such past due payments shall bear interest at a rate of two percent (2%) per month OR the maximum rate permissible by law, whichever is less. The imposition of interest provided for in this Paragraph shall be in addition to any other remedies available to Consolidated Artists under this Agreement or otherwise. Accordingly, Consolidated Artists shall not be precluded from exercising any other remedies, whether at law or in equity, to enforce the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "TPC acknowledges that time is of the essence in the payment of all compensation due Consolidated Artists hereunder. For the purposes of this Agreement, all payments not received within thirty (30) days of the date due shall be deemed \"past due\". Such past due payments shall bear interest, if any, as determined solely at TPC's discretion and will be added to promotional budgets for the following year. The imposition of interest provided for in this Paragraph shall be at the discretion of TPC and does not create a legal obligation. Accordingly, Consolidated Artists' sole recourse for missed payments is limited to an offer of additional product at wholesale prices.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly defines late payment penalties. The modified clause introduces ambiguity regarding interest and limits remedies available to Consolidated Artists, thus weakening their legal recourse for non-payment, a violation of contract law principles regarding remedies for breach of contract.",

Should Consolidated Artists be required to institute litigation due to TPC's breach of any terms of this Agreement, all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees, shall be borne by TPC.",

Should Consolidated Artists be required to institute litigation, each party will bear its own costs and fees.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Virginia law and venue and mandates TPC to cover legal costs for Consolidated Artists if they win a breach of contract claim. The modified clause allows TPC to choose the litigation location and states that each party bears its own costs. This weakens Consolidated Artists' position by potentially forcing them to litigate in an unfavorable venue and eliminates their ability to recover legal fees even if they win. This is a legal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "TPC agrees to protect, indemnify and hold harmless Consolidated Artists and Ogle from and against any and all expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs whatsoever, including attorneys' fees, arising out of, or in any way connected with, any claim or action which arises from the use of the Endorsed Product, the use of the Ogle Endorsement, or the performance of Consolidated Artists' and Ogle's obligations hereunder.",

This indemnity does not cover actions from the Endorsed Product, the use of the Ogle Endorsement, or the performance of Consolidated Artists' and Ogle's obligations hereunder.",
                "explanation": "The original indemnity clause is broad. The modified version significantly narrows the indemnity, limiting it only to TPC's direct negligence in manufacturing and excluding claims related to endorsement activities or the use of the endorsed product. This severely weakens the protection for Consolidated Artists and Ogle, potentially leaving them liable for claims arising from their endorsement of a faulty product. This adds a legal contradiction.",

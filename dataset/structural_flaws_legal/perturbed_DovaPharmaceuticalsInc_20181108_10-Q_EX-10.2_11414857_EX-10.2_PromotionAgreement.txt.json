EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. For clarity, the Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that to the extent that either Party hereto has disclosed, or in the future discloses, to the other Party any Know-How or other intellectual property of such Party or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, the other Party shall not acquire any ownership rights in such Know-How or other intellectual property by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, and as between the Parties, all ownership rights therein shall remain with the disclosing Party (or its Affiliate).",
                "explanation": "Moving the jury trial waiver to the Know-How Disclosure section creates a structural flaw by burying a critical legal right within an irrelevant clause. Jury trial waivers are typically located in the dispute resolution section, not intellectual property rights. This makes it difficult to find and understand for someone reviewing the contract.",

THE FOREGOING SENTENCE SHALL NOT LIMIT (1) THE OBLIGATIONS OF EITHER PARTY TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY FROM AND AGAINST THIRD PARTY CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 11.1 OR 11.2, AS APPLICABLE, OR (2) DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY'S BREACH OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-USE OBLIGATIONS IN ARTICLE 9.",

It is the intention of the Parties that any payments or transfer of value by a Party as it relates to the Product shall constitute transfers of value by that Party and such Party shall be responsible for the reporting described in the immediately preceding sentence. However, if a Party is deemed to have provided any payments or transfers of value to a Third Party on behalf of the other Party as it relates to the Product, then such Party shall provide to the other Party, in a format reasonably acceptable to such other Party, the data and other information on a timely basis (i.e., in the case of manual reporting of such data and other information, within [***] following the end of each Calendar Quarter, and, in the case of automated reporting of such data and other information, on a periodic basis during each Calendar Quarter as reasonably requested by such other Party) for such other Party's reporting under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and other Applicable Laws.",

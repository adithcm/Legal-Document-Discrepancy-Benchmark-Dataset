The Notice to Arbitrate shall contain         a concise description of the matter submitted for arbitration.\n\n39.2    The Parties hereto shall within ten (10) business days of receipt of         the Notice to Arbitrate jointly appoint a single arbitrator. If the         Parties fail to appoint an arbitrator who shall jointly select a third         arbitrator within ten (10) days, failing which same shall be designated         by the President of the Arbitrators' Institute of Canada Inc. upon the         request of either Party.\n\n39.3    The arbitration shall take place in the Municipality of Metropolitan         Toronto and shall be governed by the provisions of the Arbitration Act.\n\n39.4    The determination of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall be         final and binding upon the Parties hereto.\n\n39.5    The cost of the arbitration shall be borne by the Parties hereto\n     equally.\n\n39.6    Submission to the arbitration under this Article shall be a condition         precedent to the bringing of any action with respect to this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "I have moved the arbitration clause to the wrong location and have also changed the nature of the binding arbitration clause to a non-binding and suggestion to arbitrate clause. By doing this, I have significantly altered the original intent of the dispute resolution mechanism, making enforcement more difficult and ambiguous. The original text was clear about mandatory arbitration, while the modified text allows for other forms of dispute resolution and introduces uncertainty. I have also added that after a dispute arises, the parties can decide after 30 days if they want to arbitrate or litigate. That can create more confusion and ambiguity to whether they want to resolve or not.",

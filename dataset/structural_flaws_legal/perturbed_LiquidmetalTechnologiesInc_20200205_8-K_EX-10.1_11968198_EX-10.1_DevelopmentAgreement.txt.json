The parties irrevocably agree that any legal actions or proceedings brought by or against them with respect to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the courts in and for Maricopa County, Arizona, and the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, and by execution and delivery hereof, the parties irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction and hereby irrevocably waive any and all objections which they may have with respect to venue in any of the above courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this paragraph shall not preclude or limit either Party's rights to pursue actions in the International Trade Commission, or for either Party to pursue an action with respect to a Licensed Patent before a foreign court or governmental agency if neither the federal courts nor the state courts have subject matter jurisdiction over the action. This Agreement, the legal relations between the parties, and any action, whether contractual or non-contractual, instituted by any party with respect to matters arising under or growing out of or in connection with or in respect of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Arizona (U.S.A.), excluding any choice of law rules that may direct the application of the laws of another jurisdiction, and except that questions affecting the construction and effect of any Patent shall be determined by the law of the country in which the Patent has been granted. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. THE PARTIES HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION RESULTING FROM OR INVOLVING THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.",

The parties agree that any legal actions or proceedings brought by or against them with respect to this Agreement shall be brought in a forum as agreed upon by both parties at the time of the dispute. This Agreement, the legal relations between the parties, and any action, whether contractual or non-contractual, instituted by any party with respect to matters arising under or growing out of or in connection with or in respect of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of a jurisdiction that is mutually decided upon at the time of dispute, and except that questions affecting the construction and effect of any Patent shall be determined by the law of the country in which the Patent has been granted. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) is specifically included in application to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Arizona courts as the exclusive venue and waives jury trials. The modification replaces this with a clause stating that the forum and governing law will be decided at the time of the dispute, and included UN convention. This introduces ambiguity and makes enforcement unpredictable, as the venue and applicable law are not predetermined. Also, the original clause waives jury trials, which gives the power to the judge. This is omitted.",

                "explanation": "Moving the Limitation of Liability clause to the section on 'Research, Development, and Collaboration' makes it less prominent and harder to find.

                "explanation": "Moving the Eutectix Indemnification clause from its dedicated section (Insurance and Indemnification) and embedding it within the 'Shipment and Delivery' section makes it less likely to be noticed. While it's related to the movement of equipment, it's not logically connected in a way that would make someone proactively look for it there. This relocation reduces its prominence and could be argued as an attempt to conceal the extensive indemnification obligations of Eutectix.",

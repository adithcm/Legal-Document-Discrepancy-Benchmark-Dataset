                "original_text": "All matters relating to arbitration will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. Sections 1 et seq.). Except to the extent governed by the Federal Arbitration Act or other federal law, this Agreement and all claims arising from the relationship between Hyatt (and/or any of its Affiliates) and Playa (and/or any of its Affiliates) under this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois (U.S.A.), without regard to its conflict of laws rules, except that any Illinois law or any other law regulating the offer or sale of franchises, business opportunities, or similar interests, or governing the relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee or any similar relationship, will not apply unless its jurisdictional requirements are met independently without reference to this Section 4.",
                "changed_text": "All matters relating to arbitration will be subject to review by both parties before the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. Sections 1 et seq.) is applied. Except to the extent governed by other federal law, this Agreement and all claims arising from the relationship between Hyatt (and/or any of its Affiliates) and Playa (and/or any of its Affiliates) under this Agreement will be loosely governed by the laws of the State of Illinois (U.S.A.).",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity by stating arbitration matters will be subject to review before the Federal Arbitration Act is applied, effectively weakening its initial assertion of governing arbitration matters. Additionally, changing 'governed' to 'loosely governed' reduces the certainty of Illinois state law being applied, creating uncertainty about the governing jurisdiction.",

To the extent there is any conflict between the Rules and the Federal Arbitration Act as it pertains to such arbitration, the Rules shall prevail.",
                "changed_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement may be subject to mediation or other form of resolution. To the extent possible the Parties will try to settle amicably. Arbitration may be considered as a last resort; however, the International Chamber of Commerce Rules shall not prevail over local jurisdictions.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces mandatory arbitration with a discretionary option, undermining the enforceability of the original arbitration clause. By stating 'arbitration may be considered', and stating the ICC rules do not prevail over local jurisdiction, this shifts dispute resolution from a structured arbitration process to potentially lengthier and uncertain litigation.",

If a Party prevails on some, but not all, of its claims, such Party shall be entitled to recover an equitable amount of such fees, costs and expenses as determined by the arbitrator(s). All amounts recovered by the prevailing Party under this Subsection shall be separate from, and in addition to, any other amount included in any award(s) rendered in favor of such Party pursuant to this Section 5.",

If both parties agree and if the arbitrator deems fit; however, the arbitrator may determine any cost to be split between both parties as deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces conditions that weaken the 'loser pays' provision. The original clause clearly stated the prevailing party 'shall' be entitled to recover fees, now it is at the discretion of both parties with the arbitrator, and the arbitrator may divide costs. The language 'may be entitled' shifts the right to recover costs to something discretionary, which makes it difficult to enforce",

                "original_text": "All notices or other communications required or desired to be sent to either of the parties will be invalid, unless made in writing and sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or sent by recognized international courier service (e.g., Federal Express, DHL, etc.) with charges prepaid, or by facsimile or electronic mail which is subject to confirmation by letter. The address for all notices or other communications required to be sent to ARGO or YEC will be the mailing address stated on the signature page to this Agreement, or such other address as may be provided from one party to the other on at least ten (10) days prior written notice. Any such notice will be effective upon the date of receipt.",
                "changed_text": "All notices or other communications required or desired to be sent to either of the parties are suggested to be made in writing. The address for all notices or other communications required to be sent to ARGO or YEC will be the mailing address stated on the signature page to this Agreement. Any such notice will be effective upon the date of receipt, if the parties acknowledge it.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates specific methods for valid notices, while the modified version makes written notice merely a suggestion. By removing the requirements for registered mail, courier service, or confirmed electronic mail, and adding the condition 'if the parties acknowledge it', the clause becomes ambiguous and potentially unenforceable. It contradicts the original intention of ensuring reliable and verifiable communication, especially given the clause specifying which law the contract is subjected to.",

Additionally, if a suit or action is filed to enforce this agreement or with respect to this Agreement, the prevailing party is entitled to reimbursement from the other party for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the suit or action, including reasonable attorney's fees at the trial level and on appeal.",
                "changed_text": "If there is a default under this agreement, the defaulting party may consider reimbursing the non-defaulting party for costs and expenses. Additionally, if a suit or action is filed, the prevailing party may be entitled to reimbursement if both parties agree.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates the defaulting party to reimburse costs, including attorney's fees. The modified version replaces 'must reimburse' with 'may consider reimbursing' and adds 'if both parties agree' condition. This transforms a mandatory obligation into a discretionary one, significantly weakening the non-defaulting party's recourse and introducing ambiguity regarding cost recovery, especially in jurisdictions that honor the 'loser pays' rules.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that disputes be exclusively brought in Tel Aviv courts. The changed text replaces 'shall be exclusively' with 'shall be', removing exclusivity, and inserts 'preferably', making the location non-binding. This directly contradicts the intention of specifying a mandatory jurisdiction for dispute resolution. By making it a preference, the parties can now potentially litigate elsewhere. ",

Any controversy or claim between the Parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 12.2 [ARBITRATION] and the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 12.2 [ARBITRATION] is held to be unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to arbitrate or any other part of this Section 12.2 [ARBITRATION]. The arbitration will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes. The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the Parties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage limitations expressed in this Agreement. Issues of arbitrability will be determined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; in all other respects, the arbitrator will be obligated to apply and follow the substantive law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.",

If no resolution can be reached within thirty (30) days          following the date on which one party informed the other party his          intention to refer the disputes, controversies and claims for          arbitration, such disputes, controversies and claims shall be referred          to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Committee          (\"Arbitration Committee\") for a final and binding arbitration in          pursuance to the arbitration rules which is effective on the date          hereof.\n\n20.2     The venue of arbitration shall be in Shanghai or Beijing, China (to be          decided by PPG SHANGHAI).\n\n20.3     The arbitration shall be conducted in English and Chinese.\n\n20.4     There shall be three arbitrators.

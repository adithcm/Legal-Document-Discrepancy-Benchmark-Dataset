                "explanation": "Relocating the anti-bribery representation from Section 1.9 (typically dealing with agreement specifics) to Section 13, concerning 'Use of Name/Public Statements,' is a structural flaw. This is because compliance-related clauses such as anti-bribery are often found in their section to emphasize their importance and applicability, making it harder to find and enforce this critical clause.",

This relocation obscures the direct guarantee related to the manufacturing standards of the study drug, potentially diluting Adaptimmuneâ€™s explicit commitment. Placing this guarantee within the operational details of clinical data management rather than in a dedicated warranties section may diminish its prominence and impact, leading to the perception that it applies only when MD Anderson holds the IND.",

If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

                "explanation": "The solvency maintenance disclosure, crucial for policyholders, is moved to be adjacent to membership details and adds the caveat 'contingent upon board approval,' obscuring its importance and potentially misleading policyholders about its implications. Solvency disclosures are intended to be clear and prominent, as they directly affect the financial security of the contract.",

                "explanation": "The 'MEMBERSHIP' clause is moved after the 'DIVIDENDS' clause, an unexpected location, and adding the phrase 'at the discretion of the Thrivent Financial Board' weakens members' rights, introducing ambiguity.

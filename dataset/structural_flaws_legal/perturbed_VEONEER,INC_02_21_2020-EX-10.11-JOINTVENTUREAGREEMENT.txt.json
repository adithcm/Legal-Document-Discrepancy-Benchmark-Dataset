                "changed_text": "Article 3.Governing Law\n\nThis Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan, except in cases where the parties mutually agree to apply the laws of another jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'except in cases where the parties mutually agree to apply the laws of another jurisdiction' introduces a contradiction. The original clause clearly states Japanese law governs. The addition allows for a potentially unenforceable, vague agreement to supersede the specified governing law, creating legal uncertainty and undermining the initial agreement on jurisdiction.",

However, if such indemnification creates financial burden to Nissin Parties, the indemnification responsibilities could be waived.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'However, if such indemnification creates financial burden to Nissin Parties, the indemnification responsibilities could be waived' introduces a significant loophole. This contradicts the initial obligation for Nissin to ensure indemnification. The 'financial burden' clause is vague and subjective, allowing Nissin to potentially avoid their indemnity obligations based on a self-determined hardship.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties can agree to enforce this agreement at an earlier or later date regardless of VNBJ Closing and VNBZ Closing.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties can agree to enforce this agreement at an earlier or later date regardless of VNBJ Closing and VNBZ Closing', the original terms for when and how the agreement goes into effect are severely contradicted. The amendment is very clear and concise about when the agreement shall be effective, but the added language states that even though there are requirements to take effect, the parties can agree to ignore those requirements. This introduces ambiguity to when the agreement should be enforced.",

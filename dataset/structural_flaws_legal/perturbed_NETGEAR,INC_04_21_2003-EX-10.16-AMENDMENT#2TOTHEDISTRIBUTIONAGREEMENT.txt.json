                "original_text": "Subject to the terms of this Amendment, the Territory listed in Section          2 of the Agreement is amended to be the United States and [*].",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms of this Amendment, the Territory listed in Section          2 of the Agreement is amended to be the United States and [*]. However, NETGEAR reserves the right to alter this territory at any time, without prior notice, due to unforeseen circumstances.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'NETGEAR reserves the right to alter this territory at any time, without prior notice, due to unforeseen circumstances,' the binding agreement is weakened. The unilateral ability to change the agreed-upon territory without notice introduces uncertainty and contradicts the initial territory agreement. This could lead to disputes regarding the distributor's exclusive rights and create ambiguity in the contract.",

                "original_text": "During the initial one year period beginning on the Amendment Date,          Distributor shall be the only distributor appointed by NETGEAR in [*],          subject to Distributor conducting mutually agreed to marketing          activities as described in the Marketing Plan for [*] to be developed          and agreed to by and between the parties and which shall be attached to          and made a part of this Agreement as Exhibit 4a.",
                "changed_text": "During the initial one year period beginning on the Amendment Date, Distributor shall be the only distributor appointed by NETGEAR in [*]. Marketing activities, described in the Marketing Plan (Exhibit 4a), shall be developed at NETGEAR's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the 'mutually agreed to' nature of the marketing plan and gives NETGEAR sole discretion. This contradicts the original intention of collaborative marketing efforts, potentially harming the Distributor's ability to fulfill their obligations under the agreement and introducing a contradiction.",

                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall remain in effect for the current term and any renewal term of the Agreement. However, NETGEAR reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time, with or without cause, providing a 30-day written notice.",
                "explanation": "By adding the termination clause, the certainty of the Amendment's term is undermined. While contracts can have termination clauses, adding it in this manner, particularly with 'with or without cause,' directly contradicts the initial statement that the amendment will last the term of the agreement. This alteration introduces an imbalance of power and renders the agreement's duration uncertain.",

Reseller must ensure that Sub-Reseller complies with the terms of the Agreement applicable to Reseller as if Sub- Reseller were an original party to the Agreement and any breach by Sub-Reseller of the Agreement will be deemed a breach by Reseller. Sub-Reseller is not be a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement.",

Reseller should attempt to ensure that Sub-Reseller complies with the terms of the Agreement applicable to Reseller, but any breach by Sub-Reseller of the Agreement will not be automatically deemed a breach by Reseller.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'must ensure' to 'should attempt to ensure' and removing the automatic deeming of a breach introduces ambiguity and weakens the enforceability of the reseller's obligations regarding the sub-reseller's compliance. It contradicts the original intent of holding the reseller fully accountable for the sub-reseller's actions.",

                "explanation": "Adding 'some of' introduces ambiguity about which parts of the agreement are actually superseded, creating doubt and potential legal challenges. It contradicts the standard 'entire agreement' clause by not clearly defining the scope of what is covered, leaving room for previous agreements to potentially apply.",

                "original_text": "10.12. Dispute Resolution. (a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity  thereof (each, a \"Dispute\"), shall to the extent possible be settled through friendly consultation among the Parties hereto. The claiming Party (the  \"Claimant\") shall promptly notify the other Party (the \"Respondent\") in a dated written notice that a Dispute has arisen and describe the nature of  the Dispute. Any Dispute which remains unresolved within sixty (60) days after the date of such written notice shall be submitted to the China  International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the \"Commission\") to be finally settled by arbitration in Beijing, PRC in accordance  with the Commission's then effective rules (the \"Rules\") and this Section 10.12. The language of the arbitration shall be Mandarin Chinese.\n\n(b) The arbitration tribunal shall consist of three (3) arbitrators. The Claimant shall appoint one (1) arbitrator, the Respondent shall appoint one (1)  arbitrator, and the two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall appoint a third arbitrator. If the Claimant and the Respondent fail to appoint one (1)  arbitrator, or the two (2) arbitrators appointed fail to appoint the third arbitrator within the time periods set by the then effective Rules, the relevant  appointment shall be made promptly by the Commission.\n\n(c) Any award of the arbitration tribunal established pursuant to this Section 10.12 shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and enforceable in  any court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties shall use their best efforts to effect the prompt execution of any such award and shall render  whatever assistance as may be necessary to this end. The prevailing Party (as determined by the arbitrators) shall be entitled to reimbursement of  its costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred in connection with the arbitration and any judicial enforcement, unless the  arbitrators determine that it would be manifestly unfair to honor this agreement of the Parties and determine a different allocation of costs.\n\n(d) The foregoing provisions in this Section 10.12 shall not preclude any Party from seeking interim or conservatory remedies, including injunctive  relief, from any court having jurisdiction to grant such relief.",

The Parties shall use their best efforts to effect the prompt execution of any such award and shall render  whatever assistance as may be necessary to this end. The prevailing Party may be entitled to reimbursement of  its costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, but the decision to award such cost will be under complete descretion of the arbitrators. \n\n(d) The foregoing provisions in this Section 10.12 shall preclude any Party from seeking interim or conservatory remedies, including injunctive  relief, from any court having jurisdiction to grant such relief.",
                "explanation": "The clause initially mandated arbitration in Beijing under CIETAC rules, ensuring a defined and binding dispute resolution process. Modifying the clause to suggest mediation first, replacing mandatory arbitration with potential arbitrators, and altering the award to be non-binding severely undermines the enforceability and predictability of dispute resolution. This creates a legal contradiction by turning a clear, binding process into a discretionary and uncertain one.",

This Agreement and any rights or authority granted hereunder shall not be assigned or transferred by either Party, including by  operation of law, merger or otherwise, without the express written consent of the other Party, provided that Licensor may assign this Agreement  without consent to any of its Affiliates and Licensee may assign this Agreement without consent to SINA Leju or an Affiliate of Licensee that is  controlled by SINA Leju.",

This Agreement and any rights or authority granted hereunder shall not be assigned or transferred by either Party, including by  operation of law, merger or otherwise, without the express written consent of the other Party, provided that Licensor may assign this Agreement  without consent to any of its Affiliates and Licensee may assign this Agreement without consent to SINA Leju or an Affiliate of Licensee that is  controlled by SINA Leju. However, Licensor is required to notify, in writing, the other party of any assignment done. Such assignment, at that point, will need to be approved by both parties.",
                "explanation": "The clause initially allowed for assignment under certain conditions, particularly for affiliates, without requiring consent. The modified clause introduces a requirement for notification and subsequent approval for any assignment, including those previously allowed without consent. This contradiction can lead to confusion and disputes over the validity of assignments, particularly if one party refuses to grant approval after an assignment has already been made based on the original terms.",

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that monetary damages would be enough compensation if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach of this Agreement could be adequately compensated  in all cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which a party hereto may be entitled, at law or in  equity, it will be determined by a judge. An appointed individual will determine whether it will be possible to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and  permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement, only if posting any bond or  other undertaking.",
                "explanation": "Initially, the agreement explicitly allowed for specific performance and injunctive relief without requiring a bond. The changed version says that monetary damages are adequate. This change contradicts the original intent by reversing the assumption about irreparable harm and by introducing uncertainty about when specific performance might be available and makes it subject to an approval.",

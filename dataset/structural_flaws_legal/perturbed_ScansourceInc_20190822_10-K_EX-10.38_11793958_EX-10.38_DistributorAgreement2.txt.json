                "original_text": "Term and Termination. This Agreement and the license granted herein shall remain effective until terminated. Customer may terminate this Agreement and the license at any time by destroying all copies of Software including any Documentation. Customer's rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Cisco if Customer fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, Customer shall destroy all copies of Software and Documentation in its possession or control.",
                "changed_text": "Term and Termination. This Agreement and the license granted herein shall remain effective until terminated. Customer may terminate this Agreement and the license at any time by destroying all copies of Software including any Documentation. Customer's rights under this Agreement will terminate if Customer fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement; however, Cisco will provide a 30-day written notice before termination due to non-compliance, giving the Customer time to rectify the breach. Upon termination, Customer shall destroy all copies of Software and Documentation in its possession or control.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction regarding the termination process. The original clause states immediate termination without notice for non-compliance, while the modified version adds a 30-day notice period. This creates ambiguity and potential legal challenges in enforcing the termination clause, particularly under contract law principles of reasonable notice.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of Cisco is proven' introduces an exception to the liability limitation. While some jurisdictions may disallow limitations on liability for gross negligence, its inclusion here creates internal inconsistency. The initial clause disclaims liability for all damages, but the added phrase suggests liability could exist under specific circumstances. This weakens the disclaimer and introduces legal uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an internal contradiction. Initially, the license is granted 'for which Customer has paid the required license fees'. However, the addition of 'regardless of whether required license fees have been paid' directly contradicts this. Furthermore, the grant of a perpetual license after the first payment contradicts the entire licensing structure. It becomes unclear whether payment is a prerequisite for the license, making the clause unenforceable.",

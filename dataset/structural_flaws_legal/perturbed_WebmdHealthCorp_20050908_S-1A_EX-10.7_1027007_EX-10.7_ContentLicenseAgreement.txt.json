WebMD's aggregate liability for all damages, losses and causes of action in any way related to this agreement or the content, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, either jointly or severally, shall not exceed fifty dollars ($50), unless otherwise stated.",
                "explanation": "This alteration removes explicit disclaimers of warranties (merchantability, fitness for purpose) and limits on liability, placing the aggregate liability statement within a clause that now contains an exception which undermines the disclaimer. This could be viewed as an unconscionable limitation of liability.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies New York law governs without regard to conflict of laws principles. Removing this ensures a conflict of laws analysis will be made to choose which jurisdiction applies. This change introduces uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "Altering the contract to allow for verbal modification introduces a structural flaw. The Statute of Frauds, depending on jurisdiction and the nature of the agreement, may require certain contracts or modifications to be in writing to be enforceable. This change makes it easier to argue that modifications are valid even without written documentation, potentially leading to disputes over the terms.",

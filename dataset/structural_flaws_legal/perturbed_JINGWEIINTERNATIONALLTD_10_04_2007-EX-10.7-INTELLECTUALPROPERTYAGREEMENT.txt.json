In case no settlement can be reached through consultation within 30 days after one party ask for consultation, each party can submit such matter to China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the \"CIETAC\") in accordance with its rules, and the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in Chinese and shall take place in Beijing. The arbitration award shall be final and conclusive and binding upon the parties and shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.",

In case no settlement can be reached through consultation, each party can submit such matter to arbitration. The arbitration award shall be binding upon the parties but be determined by mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "The restructuring of the sentence introduces contradictionâ€”the first part states arbitration, but the latter part allows for 'mutual agreement' on the details. This contradicts the original clause's strict arbitration requirement, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties in writing,' the clause introduces uncertainty. This weakens the original clause's strength, leading to uncertainty in enforcement because the applicable law can change based on mutual agreement, contradicting the initial binding statement.",

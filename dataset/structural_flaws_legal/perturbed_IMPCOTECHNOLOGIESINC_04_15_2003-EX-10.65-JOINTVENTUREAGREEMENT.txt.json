The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted at London, United Kingdom, in the English language.",

But the dispute resolution should be agreed upon mutually. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted at London, United Kingdom, in the English language.",
                "explanation": "The arbitration clause, which should be clear and binding, is moved to a section about product legends and modified so that is it not binding. Adding 'But the dispute resolution should be agreed upon mutually' creates a contradiction, because it suggest that the rule of the International Chamber of Commerce is not binding.",

The Parties hereby stipulate that they hereby submit to the jurisdiction of the above-referred courts, but the jurisdiction will be agreed upon as to any changes in the agreement.",
                "explanation": "The governing law and jurisdiction clause is critical for enforceability. The addition of 'but the jurisdiction will be agreed upon as to any changes in the agreement' makes the jurisdiction uncertain and dependent on future agreement. This contradicts the initial clause's intention of establishing exclusive jurisdiction and would make disputes about jurisdiction more likely.",

The Parties represent to each other that it has not made, and agrees that it will not make, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in connection with any other business transactions involving the JVC, any payment or transfer of anything of any value, directly or indirectly, to the following:\n    (a)   to any government official or employee (including employees of government corporations), or to any political party or candidate; or\n    (b)   to any officer, director, employee or representative of any actual or potential JVC customer; or\n    (c)   to any other person or entity if such payment or transfer would violate the laws of the country in which such payment or transfer is made or violate the laws of the United States.

                "explanation": "The original text prohibits third party payments, but by adding \"If a payment is needed for the development of the business, the government officials and employees can be engaged\" in Article 1, contradicts the original term. This introduces an ambiguity and makes it harder to enforce.",

                "explanation": "The contract is now stating that Delaware law applies to an agreement to be performed in New York, but also includes the New York General Obligations Law, creating confusion about which jurisdiction's laws take precedence.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction by initially waiving the right to a jury trial, then carving out an exception for specific circumstances (gross negligence or willful misconduct).

                "explanation": "The original notice clause specifies registered mail or fax followed by mail. The modified version introduces electronic mail without clarifying whether it supersedes or supplements the registered mail requirement. This creates ambiguity, as it's unclear whether registered mail is still required or if email is sufficient. In legal contexts, the method of notice can be crucial, and this ambiguity can be exploited to argue that proper notice was not given, hindering contract enforcement.",

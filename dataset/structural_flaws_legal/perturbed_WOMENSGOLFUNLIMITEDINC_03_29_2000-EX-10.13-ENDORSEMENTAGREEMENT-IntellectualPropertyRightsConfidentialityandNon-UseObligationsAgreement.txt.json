                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Recipient hereby consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal and County Courts in Essex County, New Jersey and agrees that the Company may seek temporary restraining orders against it or other extraordinary relief necessary to protect the Information.",
                "changed_text": "Recipient acknowledges the existence of know-how, proprietary, confidential and trade secret Information. Recipient may consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal and County Courts in Essex County, New Jersey should both parties be amenable.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states the Recipient consents to the jurisdiction of specific courts for seeking restraining orders. The modified clause removes the explicit consent, making it contingent on both parties' agreement. This introduces uncertainty and weakens the Company's ability to immediately seek legal recourse, as it's no longer a pre-agreed term.",

                "changed_text": "Recipient may execute documentation, instruments, specifications, and disclosures if both parties find them necessary to assign, prosecute, protect, perfect, or exploit the company ownership of intellectual property.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Recipient further agrees' to 'Recipient may execute... if both parties find them necessary' weakens the obligation. The original text mandates the recipient's cooperation in protecting the company's IP. The modified version makes this cooperation discretionary, subject to mutual agreement. This could hinder the Company's ability to fully protect its intellectual property rights.",

The rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Exhibit A shall survive the termination or expiration of this endorsement agreement, regardless of cause or circumstances of the termination or expiration.",
                "changed_text": "The Professional acknowledges the existence of Exhibit A. The rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Exhibit A may survive the termination or expiration of this endorsement agreement depending on the circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The modified text weakens the binding nature of Exhibit A by stating that the rights and obligations 'may' survive termination instead of 'shall' survive, and by adding 'depending on the circumstances.' This creates ambiguity about the enforceability of the confidentiality and non-use obligations after the agreement ends.",

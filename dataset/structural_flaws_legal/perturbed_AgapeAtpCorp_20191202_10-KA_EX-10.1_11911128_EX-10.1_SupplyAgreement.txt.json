The Manufacturer agrees to give the Customer exclusive rights to the marketing, promotion and sales of the new products should the Customer decide to take on the new products.",
                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause to a section about 'New Products' makes it less likely to be noticed during contract review. The placement under a heading concerning product development obscures its significance as a method of dispute resolution, thereby hindering its enforceability.",

                "explanation": "Placing the governing law clause in the section 'Other products outside of the product range' makes it less prominent and easily overlooked. This diminishes its effectiveness, as parties might miss the jurisdiction under which the contract will be interpreted.",

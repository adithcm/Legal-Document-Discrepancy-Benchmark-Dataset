Notwithstanding the foregoing, eGain's liability will be determined by the business requirements.",
                "explanation": "The addition of \"Notwithstanding the foregoing, eGain's liability will be determined by the business requirements.\" introduces a contradiction. The first part of the clause sets a clear limit on liability (price paid for services). The added sentence introduces ambiguity, suggesting that business requirements might override the stated limit, making the limitation of liability clause unclear and potentially unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The added sentence \"However, matters of data privacy will be governed by the laws where the data is stored.\" creates a contradiction. While the contract states California law governs, data privacy is now subject to potentially conflicting laws based on data storage location. This can lead to legal uncertainty, especially if data is stored outside of California, and weaken the original governing law clause.",

                "explanation": "Adding \"Unless agreed to otherwise by eGain\" to the waiver clause creates a contradiction. The original clause strictly requires written waivers. The added phrase provides eGain with the unilateral ability to verbally waive rights or breaches, contradicting the written requirement and introducing ambiguity.",

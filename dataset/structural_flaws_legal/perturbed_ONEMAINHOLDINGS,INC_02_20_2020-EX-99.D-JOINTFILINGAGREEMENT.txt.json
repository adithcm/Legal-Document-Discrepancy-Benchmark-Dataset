                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement. In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "explanation": "Moving the disclosure about Rule 13d-1(k) from the beginning to the middle of the paragraph obscures its importance and makes it less prominent. This could be interpreted as a structural flaw because it potentially reduces the clarity and immediate enforceability of the agreement's compliance with securities regulations.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'may be executed in any number of counterparts' to 'shall only be executed in one counterpart' introduces a contradiction. The original wording allows for flexibility in execution, while the altered wording restricts it, potentially conflicting with standard business practices and expectations regarding the execution of legal agreements.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'as of February 20, 2020' to 'but the date of agreement will be determined at a later date' introduces uncertainty. The original wording clearly establishes the effective date of the agreement. The changed text creates ambiguity, making it unclear when the agreement becomes legally binding and creating a legal contradiction.",

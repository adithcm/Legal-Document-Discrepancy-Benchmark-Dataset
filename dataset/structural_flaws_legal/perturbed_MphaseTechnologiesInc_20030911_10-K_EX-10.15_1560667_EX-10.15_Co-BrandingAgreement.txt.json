                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that New York law governs the agreement. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by stating that the governing law will be determined at Lucent's discretion. This could be interpreted as a violation of fair contracting principles and create uncertainty about which jurisdiction's laws apply, making enforcement difficult. Ambiguity undermines the legal certainty that parties rely on when entering into a contract.",

Either party wishing to terminate\n          the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least\n          thirty (30) days prior to the desired date of termination.",

                "explanation": "The original states Lucent cannot unreasonably withhold consent for renewal. By removing \"which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,\" it grants Lucent the power to reject renewal without providing a reason, shifting contract power and potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing. This removal is an increased risk for mPhase.",

                "explanation": "The original clause is a standard limitation of liability. The modified clause adds an exception for gross negligence or willful misconduct, but then imposes a frivolous remedy of a 'fruit basket'. This trivializes and undermines the potential for actual damages, creating a contradiction between acknowledging potential liability for serious misconduct and providing a nonsensical form of compensation. This renders the clause largely unenforceable, as a fruit basket does not constitute adequate compensation for gross negligence or willful misconduct.",

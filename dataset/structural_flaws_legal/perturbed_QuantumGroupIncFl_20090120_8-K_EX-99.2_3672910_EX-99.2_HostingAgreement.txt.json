                "original_text": "Choice of Law This Agreement will be governed by the substantive laws of the State of New York, without regard for its conflict of laws provisions. Waiver of Jury Trial The parties waive any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Waiver of Jury Trial The parties waive any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. Choice of Law This Agreement will be governed by laws determined suitable by IBM, without regard for its conflict of laws provisions.",
                "explanation": "The 'Choice of Law' clause originally specified New York law. By changing it to 'laws determined suitable by IBM' the agreement now grants IBM unilateral power to choose the governing law, which could severely disadvantage the Customer. This contradicts standard legal principles of mutual agreement and fairness in contracts.",

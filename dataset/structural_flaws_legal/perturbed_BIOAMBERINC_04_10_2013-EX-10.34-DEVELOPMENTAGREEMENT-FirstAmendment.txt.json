Within thirty (30) days of the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrating such production levels of succinic acid, Bioamber will cease any further funding and/or other support for the BRI Project. Further Bioamber will require that any unexpended funds received from Bioamber be utilized for a project other than the BRI Project.",
                "changed_text": "Section 2.2 of the Development Agreement is hereby amended to allow Cargill at its sole discretion to apply [***] during the period of July 5, 2011, through September 30, 2011, to perform the Work Plan in addition to the [***] specified in the unamended Section 2.2. Notwithstanding the above, Bioamber may fund the BRI Project up until the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrates the ability to produce succinic acid (or salts thereof) from any feedstock at a concentration of [***] grams/liter succinic acid (or salts thereof).

                "explanation": "Moving the condition regarding Bioamber's funding of the BRI project to Section 2.2 (which discusses Cargill's work plan application) makes it unclear if and how the funding condition relates to Cargill's obligations or if it's a general condition applicable elsewhere. Its enforceability is weakened by being disconnected from the original clause outlining project funding restrictions (Section 13.9).",

                "explanation": "By placing the conditions related to the Scale-up and Production Project (which originally formed new Section 13.10) after the statement that all other terms remain unchanged, there is a conflict: are the Scale-up and Production Project terms *new* and overriding, or are the *old* terms still in full effect?

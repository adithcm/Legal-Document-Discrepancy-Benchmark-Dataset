                "explanation": "Moving the litigation disclosure to directly after the 'IN WITNESS WHEREOF' section makes it appear part of the concluding remarks rather than a distinct disclosure, obfuscating its importance and discoverability. This placement disrupts the flow of information, diminishing the likelihood that it will be properly reviewed and understood. Given the disclosure is required by New York Law, its placement impacts enforceability.",

                "explanation": "Moving the bankruptcy clause after the witness and source information makes it appear as if it's part of the source data rather than a legally binding disclosure. This placement could lead to a reasonable person overlooking it or misinterpreting its significance. This may be a violation of regulations relating to proper disclosure in franchise agreements in New York.",

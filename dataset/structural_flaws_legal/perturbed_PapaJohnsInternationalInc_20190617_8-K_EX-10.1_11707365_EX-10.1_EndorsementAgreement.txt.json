                "original_text": "9. Arbitration. In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a single arbitrator (who shall be a lawyer) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. All such arbitration shall take place at the office of the American Arbitration Association located in or nearest to New York, New York. Each Party is entitled to depose at least two (2) fact witnesses and any expert witness designated by the other Party, and to conduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate. The award or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court.",
                "changed_text": "10. Confidentiality and Non-Disparagement. Each Party shall hold all confidential information received pursuant to this Agreement, including the terms and conditions of this Agreement and CELEBRITY'S personal and/or business affairs, confidential and may only disclose them (i) with the prior written consent of the other Party, (ii) where required by law or (iii) to such party's advisors, attorneys or other designees, as long as such recipients also keep such information confidential. Nevertheless, after the parties have announced the association between CELEBRITY and PAPA JOHN's or the association otherwise becomes public, each party may respond, discuss and comment in a favorable and positive manner that CELEBRITY is associated with PAPA JOHN'S during any public events and/or interviews, subject to the requirements herein. All Parties agree not to disparage or make derogatory comments, verbal or written, regarding the other Party during the Term of the Agreement, and for one year thereafter.\n\n9. Arbitration. In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be addressed via a method agreed upon by both parties.",
                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause to a section focused on confidentiality and non-disparagement makes it less prominent and easily overlooked. Additionally, changing the specifics of how the dispute will be solved is no longer in line with the American Arbitration Association, which weakens the enforceability of that part of the agreement.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, PAPA JOHN'S shall be solely responsible for ensuring that any and all Required Disclosures comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and guidelines, including, without limitation, the FTC's \"Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising\" and PAPA JOHN'S shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the ABG Indemnified Parties (as hereinafter defined) from any and all liability arising out of the same, unless ABG or CELEBRITY materially modifies the Required Disclosure provided by PAPA JOHN'S (i.e. if the Required Disclosure provided by PAPA JOHN'S complied with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and guidelines, and ABG or CELEBRITY's modification of the Required Disclosure causes such Required Disclosure to not comply all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and guidelines).",

                "explanation": "By removing the references to 'Required Disclosure', the clear and conspicuous language, and the FTC guidelines, and weakening the phrasing the contract is non-compliant with the FTC.

Each of the Farids Group and the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and in the courts hearing appeals therefrom unless no basis for federal jurisdiction exists, in which event each party hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and the courts hearing appeals therefrom, for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Farids Group and the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for any reason, other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this Section 8.6, that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that the action, suit or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such action, suit or proceeding is improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Each of the Farids Group and the Company irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all rights to trial by jury in connection with any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.",

Each of the Farids Group and the Company hereby consents to submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, but may elect to resolve disputes through binding arbitration decided at the discretion of both parties. Each of the Farids Group and the Company hereby agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for any reason, other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this Section 8.6. Each of the Farids Group and the Company waives any and all rights to trial by jury unless explicitly stated in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies exclusive jurisdiction in New York courts and waives rights to a jury trial. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by allowing disputes to be resolved through binding arbitration decided at the discretion of both parties, and not specifying the arbitration criteria. This contradicts the initial agreement of court jurisdiction and creates uncertainty about the dispute-resolution process.",

It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedies to which they are entitled at law or equity. In the event of any dispute between the parties concerning the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the party prevailing in such dispute shall be entitled to collect from the other party all costs incurred in such dispute, including reasonable attorneys' fees.",
                "changed_text": "The parties agree that if one party believes irreparable damage would occur if any provisions are breached, they can seek remedies, but these remedies are capped at $5000. In the event of any dispute, each party is responsible for their own legal costs.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows for specific performance and recovery of all costs, including attorney's fees, by the prevailing party. The modified clause restricts remedies to a capped amount of $5000 and stipulates that each party bears their own legal costs. This creates a financial disincentive for pursuing legitimate claims and contradicts the original intent of making the agreement's terms specifically enforceable.",

                "explanation": "The original clause restricts the Farids Group from acquiring more than 19.99% of the company's shares, with specific stipulations for waiver and termination. The modified clause introduces a contradiction by giving the CEO sole discretion to approve acquisitions exceeding the limit if it's in the Farids Group's best interest. This undermines the shareholder protection intent of the original clause, making it difficult to enforce the ownership limitation.",

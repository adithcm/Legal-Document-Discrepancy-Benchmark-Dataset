                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless the Company makes an agreement otherwise' creates a loophole that significantly weakens the disparagement clause. It implies that the Company can unilaterally permit JANA to make disparaging statements, undermining the intended protection against negative publicity and creating uncertainty about the clause's actual effect. This clause contradicts the original intent by suggesting that the company can verbally permit the making of disparaging statements which contradicts the whole section itself.",

                "explanation": "The added words 'unless the JANA Nominees express they will do so' gives the JANA Nominees an ability to do what they wish. This ability of whether or not they wish to tender their resignation defeats the purpose of the clause and is contradictory to the overall intent of the agreement.",

This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed, governed, and enforced according to the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles. The Parties hereby agree and consent that any and all causes of action arising under this Agreement shall only have jurisdiction and venue in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and/or the Circuit Court for Chesterfield County. Each of the parties consents to the jurisdiction and venue of either court for the resolution of all causes of action arising under this Agreement upon proper service of process.",

This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed, governed, and enforced according to the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles. The Parties hereby agree and consent that any and all causes of action arising under this Agreement shall have jurisdiction and venue in a court within the Commonwealth of Virginia, unless all parties agree to pursue a cause of action in another venue. Each of the parties consents to the jurisdiction and venue for the resolution of all causes of action arising under this Agreement upon proper service of process.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specified the Eastern District of Virginia and/or the Circuit Court for Chesterfield County as the exclusive venues for disputes. The modification introduces ambiguity by stating that jurisdiction and venue shall be in a court within the Commonwealth of Virginia unless all parties agree to another venue. This contradicts the initial specification of exclusive venues, making the enforceability of the jurisdictional clause uncertain. It becomes unclear whether the parties are bound by the specified courts or can choose another venue by mutual agreement.",

CONSULTANT agrees that during its consultancy for REIT and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of its consultancy with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, it will not, for itself or any other person or entity: (a) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company's employees, contractors, independent contractors or any person who provides services to the Company to terminate or reduce their employment or other relationship with the Company; (b) hire any individual who is (or was within the six (6) months immediately preceding such hiring, unless such employee was terminated from such employment by Company) an employee, exclusive contractor, or exclusive independent contractor of the Company; or (c) attempt to do any of the foregoing.",

This section 7.1 shall not apply if the consultant is able to demonstrate that the solicited employee was actively seeking employment at other companies before being contacted by the consultant.",
                "explanation": "A condition has been added stating the non-solicitation clause does not apply if the solicited employee was actively seeking other employment before the consultant contacted them. This contradicts the initial strict non-solicitation agreement by creating an exception. This makes the enforceability of the non-solicitation agreement ambiguous because it is now dependent on evidence of the solicited employee's job-seeking activities. It is unclear what constitutes 'actively seeking' and introduces potential disputes over the intent of employees.",

                "explanation": "A clause is added that gives the Company the ability, at their sole discretion, to reimburse the consultant for up to 20% of the overall consulting fee to cover federal income taxes, if both parties agree. This new clause clashes with a prior statement which holds CONSULTANT solely responsible for all applicable taxes, thus weakening the clarity and enforceability of the consultant's tax obligations. This makes the enforceability of the tax responsibility agreement questionable because the degree and conditions of compensation are subject to both parties agreements, which can then conflict with the initial sole responsibility clause.",

                "original_text": "17. Governing Law and Venue. This Agreement is to be governed and construed according to the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of law. The proper exclusive venue for resolution of any dispute related to this Agreement is only in Los Angeles, California, and both parties consent to jurisdiction and venue in Los Angeles, California.",
                "changed_text": "18. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties relative to the subject matter and supersedes any other prior understandings, written or oral, between the parties with respect to this subject matter. No variations, modifications, or changes in the Agreement are binding on any party to the Agreement unless set forth in a document duly executed by or on behalf of such parties. 17. Governing Law and Venue. This Agreement is to be governed and construed according to the laws of the State of California; however, venue for dispute resolution may be determined by mutual agreement of both parties, regardless of location.",
                "explanation": "Relocating the venue selection clause to a non-standard section and adding contradictory language undermines the enforceability of the original venue clause. The added phrase introduces ambiguity and a loophole, as it suggests that while California law applies, the actual location for resolving disputes can be anywhere if both parties agree. This weakens the initial agreement for exclusive venue in Los Angeles, California, potentially leading to disputes over jurisdiction and increased legal costs. The relocation also moves the governing law provision away from dispute resolution, making it less visible.",

EXCEPT FOR INDEMNIFICATION  OBLIGATIONS DUE TO LIABILITIES TO THIRD PARTIES, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE, POWER, BUSINESS GOOD WILL, REVENUE OR PROFIT, NOR FOR INCREASED EXPENSES, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE OR NON PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS THE DAMAGES AROSE DUE TO A PARTY'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a clause that allows parties to 'mutually agree' that consequential damages are recoverable, directly contradicting the initial statement that no party will be liable for such damages. This creates ambiguity and makes the enforceability of the limitation of damages clause uncertain. A court may find the clause unenforceable due to the internal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "11. Insurance. Without limiting or qualifying the Sponsor's liabilities, obligations, or indemnities, before the Event, the Sponsor will obtain, at its sole cost and expense, a comprehensive general liability insurance policy from a company acceptable to ANTHEMIC and authorized to do business in the state of Illinois with limits of no less than $1,000,000.00 per occurrence and $2,000,000.00 as an annual aggregate. The insurance mentioned in the preceding sentence will name ANTHEMIC as additional insured. The Sponsor will also maintain any statutorily required workers compensation insurance. The Sponsor will provide ANTHEMIC with properly executed certificates of insurance before the Sponsor provides any products or services at the Event, and the insurance will contain a provision that it cannot be reduced or cancelled unless and until the insurance company notifies ANTHEMIC. Any third party that performs services on the Event grounds on behalf of the Sponsor will be required to satisfy the same insurance requirements as provided in this section.",

Without limiting or qualifying the Sponsor's liabilities, obligations, or indemnities, before the Event, the Sponsor should consider obtaining a comprehensive general liability insurance policy, as they see fit. The Sponsor may also consider maintaining any statutorily required workers compensation insurance. The Sponsor will provide ANTHEMIC with a copy of any insurance policies they decide to obtain, if any. Any third party that performs services on the Event grounds on behalf of the Sponsor may be required to satisfy the same insurance requirements as provided in this section.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates the Sponsor to obtain specific insurance coverage. The modified clause uses vague language ('should consider', 'may also consider', 'if any') which removes the mandatory nature of the insurance requirement. This weakening of the insurance clause could expose ANTHEMIC to greater liability in case of an incident and makes the Sponsor's obligation unclear. This weakens the explicit requirements stated previously.",

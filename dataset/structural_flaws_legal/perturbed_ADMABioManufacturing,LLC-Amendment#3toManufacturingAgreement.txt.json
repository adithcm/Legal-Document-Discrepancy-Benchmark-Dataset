                "original_text": "Should ADMA fail to supply a minimum of [***] Batches of Product (the \"Minimum Volume\") of Product during the time period as specified in this Amendment #3, ADMA agrees that Sanofi Pasteur shall be entitled to obtain from ADMA as liquidated damages, and not a penalty, amounting to $[***] ([***]) USD. ADMA accepts and declares that the amount of the liquidated damages is a fair and equitable compensation, and not a penalty, for such failure in reaching the volume commitment within the timelines agreed herein and in regard to the value and use of the Source Plasma.",
                "changed_text": "Should ADMA fail to supply a minimum of [***] Batches of Product (the \"Minimum Volume\") of Product during the time period as specified in this Amendment #3, ADMA agrees that Sanofi Pasteur shall be entitled to obtain from ADMA as liquidated damages, but the Parties can renegotiate a fair amount.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines liquidated damages for failure to meet the minimum volume. The modified text introduces an option to 'renegotiate a fair amount,' contradicting the initial agreement on liquidated damages, creating ambiguity and potentially voiding the clause.",

ADMA agrees to assume the risks of loss to the Sanofi Pasteur Property and shall reimburse Sanofi Pasteur, at the dollar value, the Source Plasma in case of damage or loss.",

ADMA agrees to assume the risks of loss to the Sanofi Pasteur Property, except in cases of force majeure.",
                "explanation": "The original clause makes ADMA responsible for any loss or damage. The modified version adds 'except in cases of force majeure'. While force majeure is a valid legal concept, its inclusion here, without further definition, creates ambiguity about what constitutes force majeure and who bears the burden of proof, potentially weakening ADMA's responsibility for losses.",

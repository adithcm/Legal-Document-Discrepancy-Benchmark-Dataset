                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G shall be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned without the necessity of filing additional joint acquisition statements. The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, except to the extent that he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned. The undersigned acknowledge that each *may* be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, except to the extent that he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate. All subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G may or may not be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned, as mutually agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall' to 'may' and adding a clause that filings may or may not happen 'as mutually agreed upon', the mandatory nature of the filing responsibility is undermined, creating ambiguity and weakening the enforceability of the joint filing agreement. This introduces a contradiction between the initial statement of acknowledgement and the subsequent discretionary element.",

                "explanation": "Adding parenthetical statements to the signatures introduces ambiguity and potential challenges to the agreement's enforceability. Phrases like 'Acknowledged, not necessarily agreed,' 'Signature under protest,' 'Subject to internal review,' and 'Authorization pending' suggest that the signatories may not fully consent to or be authorized to enter into the agreement. This creates a contradiction between the formal signature and the expressed reservations, making it unclear whether the parties are truly bound by the agreement. Additionally, future challenges can be raised based on the signatures and undermine enforceability of the law.",

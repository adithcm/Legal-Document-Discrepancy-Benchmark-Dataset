If any action is brought among the parties with respect to this Agreement or otherwise, by way of a claim or counterclaim, the parties agree that in any such action, and on all issues, the parties irrevocably waive their right to a trial by jury. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any such action shall be the State Courts of Nevada.",

Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any action relating to Exhibit A shall be the State Courts of Nevada. If any action is brought among the parties with respect to this Agreement or otherwise, by way of a claim or counterclaim, the parties agree to resolve claims through mediation rather than legal action, but can ignore mediation if mutually agreed.",
                "explanation": "The governing law section originally contained a waiver of the right to a jury trial. I've moved a piece of the original text by limiting the exclusive jurisdiction for actions relating to Exhibit A, and I've altered the jury waiver into a suggestion for mediation that can be ignored. This introduces uncertainty and contradicts the original intent of mandatory resolution within Nevada's legal system, making the enforceability of the original clause questionable. It goes against standard practice for governing law clauses.",

                "explanation": "The attorney's fees clause originally stated that the prevailing party 'will be entitled' to recover fees. I've changed this to 'may be entitled' and added that the distribution of this is solely at the discretion of the judge. This change introduces ambiguity and makes it less certain that the prevailing party will actually recover their fees, weakening the clause and potentially discouraging parties from pursuing legal action to enforce the agreement. The judge may not rule in the prevailing party's favor.",

Any provision of this Agreement may be waived at anytime by the party entitled to the benefit thereof; however, the written instrument is not needed and a verbal confirmation from either party will be sufficient. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will be deemed, or will constitute, a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver.",
                "explanation": "The waivers clause required a written instrument for waiving provisions. I've altered this to allow for verbal confirmation. This change contradicts the original intent of having a clear, documented waiver process, making it easier for disputes to arise regarding whether a waiver was actually given and what its scope was. This is contradictory to contract law's basic standards.",

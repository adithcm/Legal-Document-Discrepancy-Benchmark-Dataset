                "original_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with the Agreement shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the *** by three (3) arbitrators (\"Arbitral Tribunal\").",
                "changed_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with the Agreement shall be settled under the rules decided by both parties.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the mandatory arbitration clause and replaces it with a vague reference to rules decided by both parties. This makes dispute resolution unclear and potentially unenforceable, as it introduces ambiguity about the method of dispute resolution.",

                "location": "Section 17.7"

Should the claimant fail to appoint an arbitrator in the Request for Arbitration within *** days of being requested to do so, or if the respondent should fail to appoint an arbitrator in its Answer to the Request for Arbitration within *** days of being requested to do so, the other party shall request the *** to make such appointment.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party may decide to nominate one arbitrator. Should the claimant fail to appoint an arbitrator in the Request for Arbitration, or if the respondent should fail to appoint an arbitrator in its Answer to the Request for Arbitration, the parties may decide to request the *** to make such appointment.",
                "explanation": "The modification from 'shall' to 'may' regarding the nomination of arbitrators and the request for appointment introduces uncertainty and allows parties to avoid arbitration, contradicting the original intent of a binding arbitration agreement. The change also undermines the structure and process of arbitration as outlined in the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Arbitration Act, which requires clear and binding agreements to arbitrate.",

                "original_text": "This arbitration agreement does not preclude either party seeking conservatory or interim measures from any court of competent jurisdiction including, without limitation, the courts having jurisdiction by reason of either party's domicile. Conservatory or interim measures sought by either party in any one or more jurisdictions shall not preclude the Arbitral Tribunal granting conservatory or interim measures. Conservatory or interim measures sought by either party before the Arbitral Tribunal shall not preclude any court of competent jurisdiction granting conservatory or interim measures.",
                "changed_text": "This arbitration agreement might preclude either party seeking conservatory or interim measures from any court, pending Arbitral Tribunal agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification adds uncertainty by stating that the arbitration agreement 'might' preclude seeking interim measures, and introduces a condition requiring 'Arbitral Tribunal agreement.' This weakens the right to seek immediate judicial relief and creates a contradiction by suggesting the arbitration agreement's effect on interim measures is conditional and subject to an agreement, thereby muddying the process.",
                "contradicted_law": "The right to seek conservatory measures is fundamental; this provision creates an uncertain obstruction.",

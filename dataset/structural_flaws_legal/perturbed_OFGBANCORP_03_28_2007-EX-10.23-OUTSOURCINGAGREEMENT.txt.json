                "explanation": "Removing 'internal laws of the State of New York, excluding its principles of conflict of laws' and replacing it with 'principles of conflict of laws' will introduce contradiction. Contract disputes will become unpredictable, since the contract refers to principles of conflict of laws without specifying which jurisdiction's laws apply, leading to substantial ambiguity and potentially unenforceable terms.",

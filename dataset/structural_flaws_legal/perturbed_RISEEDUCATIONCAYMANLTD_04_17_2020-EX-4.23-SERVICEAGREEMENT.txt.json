                "explanation": "The original dispute resolution clause is moved to the 'Miscellaneous' section. Dispute resolution clauses are generally interpreted to require clear and conspicuous placement and are expected to be easily identifiable, and by moving it to miscellaneous it makes it difficult to enforce.",

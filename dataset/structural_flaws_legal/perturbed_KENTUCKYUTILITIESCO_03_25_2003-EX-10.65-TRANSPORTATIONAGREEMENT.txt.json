Shipper agrees to indemnify and hold Transporter harmless for refusal to transport gas hereunder in the event any upstream or downstream transporter fails to receive or deliver gas as contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n(b) Shipper agrees to indemnify and hold Transporter harmless from all suits, actions, debts, accounts, damages, costs, losses and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising from or out of breach of any warranty by Shipper herein.\n\n11.2 Transporter shall not be obligated to provide or continue service hereunder in the event of any breach of warranty.",

                "explanation": "Removing `or will be in place as of the requested effective date of service, and that it has advised the upstream and downstream transporters of the receipt and delivery points under this Agreement and any quantity limitations for each point as specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto.` creates a contradiction regarding the shipper's responsibility. It is a standard business practice to provide that service will be in place or `will be` in place. Taking it out introduces a flaw.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a legal contradiction because the agreement involves parties based in Kentucky (LOUISVILLE GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY). Changing the governing law to Kentucky, when the contract states it applies to Texas law creates ambiguity and contradicts the principle of contractual certainty and violates the intent of the parties. Also, since Tennessee Gas Pipeline is a Delaware Corporation, the interpretation might need to be in accordance to Delaware law.",

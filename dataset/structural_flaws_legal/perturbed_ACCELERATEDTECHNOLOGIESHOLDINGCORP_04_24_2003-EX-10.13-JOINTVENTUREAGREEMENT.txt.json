The principal place of business of the Joint\n      Venture shall be at 1600 Lower State Road, in the City of Doylestown, Bucks\n      County, Pennsylvania, but may maintain such other offices as the Joint\n      Venturers may deem advisable at any other place or places within or without\n      the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.",

The principal place of business of the Joint\n      Venture shall be at 1600 Lower State Road, in the City of Doylestown, Bucks\n      County, Pennsylvania, but may maintain such other offices as the Joint\n      Venturers may deem advisable at any other place or places within or without\n      the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Any disputes arising under this agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties.",
                "explanation": "The arbitration clause, normally expected in a dispute resolution section (which doesn't exist here), is buried within the 'Offices of the Joint Venture' section. This makes it less likely to be noticed and agreed upon knowingly, potentially undermining its enforceability under Pennsylvania law, which generally favors arbitration agreements but requires clear and unambiguous assent.",

On any termination of the Joint\n      Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to\n      the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds\n      shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their\n      prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint\n      Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers\n      ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set\n      forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an\n      undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it\n      shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or\n      property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party\n      receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets.",

Despite the provisions of Section 6 governing division of income and losses, any distribution of funds upon termination of the joint venture will be split 75% to Collectible Concepts Group and 25% to Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts Section 6 of the agreement, which dictates a 50/50 split of income and losses. By stating a different distribution ratio specifically for termination, a legal contradiction is introduced. This could lead to disputes and legal challenges regarding which clause takes precedence. The enforceability of either clause becomes questionable due to the internal inconsistency.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Collectible Concepts Group may transfer its interest in the Joint Venture to a wholly-owned subsidiary without the consent of Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc.",
                "explanation": "This adds an exception to the prohibition of transferring interest which contradicts the intial statement that no transfer can occur without the consent of the other venturer. This makes it unclear whether consent is actually needed, thus reducing the enforceability of the section.",

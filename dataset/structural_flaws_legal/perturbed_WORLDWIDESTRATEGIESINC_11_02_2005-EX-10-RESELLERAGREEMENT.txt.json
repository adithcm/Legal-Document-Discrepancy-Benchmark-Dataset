                "original_text": "(a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF COLORADO, UNITED STATES, WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS PRINCIPLES REGARDING CONFLICT OF LAWS.\n(b) ARBITRATION. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, without limitation, the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement or the breach, termination or invalidity of this Agreement that cannot reasonably be resolved by the Parties shall be settled exclusively and finally by binding arbitration under the International Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect on and as of the date of this Agreement (the \"AAA Rules\"), except as such AAA Rules are modified pursuant to this Section 10.12(b).",
                "changed_text": "(a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF COLORADO, UNITED STATES, WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS PRINCIPLES REGARDING CONFLICT OF LAWS.\n(b) ARBITRATION. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, without limitation, the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement or the breach, termination or invalidity of this Agreement that cannot reasonably be resolved by the Parties shall be attempted to be settled exclusively and finally by binding arbitration; however, if that isn't possible the means of resolution shall be determined by mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "The alteration suggests arbitration is preferred but not mandated, creating ambiguity. The change removes the explicit requirement for 'binding arbitration under the International Arbitration Rules,' replacing it with a conditional statement that allows for alternative dispute resolution methods if binding arbitration isn't feasible. This undermines the enforceability of the arbitration clause, as it introduces uncertainty about whether disputes must be arbitrated or can be resolved through other means.",

                "explanation": "Arbitration clause relocated to section 4.16, which is normally about reseller's duties. This misplacement makes it less likely for the parties to notice and understand its implications, reducing its enforceability. Making sure the parties are aware and understand all the sections can improve its enforceability, but that is only if the section is appropriately placed.",

Reseller shall be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify TouchStar, its officers, directors, employees, and agents against, and hold each of them harmless from, any and all claims (including without limitation, all damages (whether direct, indirect, incidental, criminal, special, or punitive), losses, liabilities, expenses, costs, and attorneys' fees related to such claims) resulting from (a) the negligent or willful failure of Reseller to comply with its obligations hereunder, (b) the acts or omissions of Reseller, its officers, directors, employees, or agents during the term of this Agreement or thereafter, (c) any express or implied representation or warranty made by Reseller or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents with regard to the TouchStar Software or the Support Services not contained in written literature of TouchStar or specifically authorized by TouchStar in writing, and (c) the installation of a call center system by TouchStar on behalf of Reseller or any Other Reseller and the use of the TouchStar Software in the operation of a call center system, unless caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of TouchStar.",

                "explanation": "The modification alters the indemnification clause to create contradictionâ€”initially stating the reseller is responsible and liable for indemnifying TouchStar, it shifts, asserting the reseller won't be liable for indemnity. This creates a conflict and renders the clause open to interpretation, diminishing its enforceability.",

                "original_text": "(e) It is the intention of the parties that the covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be enforced to the greatest extent (but to no greater extent) in time, area and degree of participation as is permitted by the Law of that jurisdiction whose Law is applicable to any acts allegedly in breach of such covenants. To this end, the parties agree that the covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be construed to extend in time and territory and with respect to degree of participation only so far as they may be enforced in such jurisdiction, and that the covenants contained in this Section 1 are to that end hereby declared divisible and severable. It being the purpose of this Section 1 to govern competition by the Sellers and their respective subsidiaries, the non-competition covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be governed by and construed according to the Law of all the jurisdictions in which competition in breach of this Agreement is alleged to have occurred or to be threatened that best gives them effect.",
                "changed_text": "It is the intention of the parties that the covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be construed to extend in time and territory and with respect to degree of participation only so far as they may be enforced in such jurisdiction, and that the covenants contained in this Section 1 are to that end hereby declared divisible and severable. It being the purpose of this Section 1 to govern competition by the Sellers and their respective subsidiaries, the non-competition covenants contained in this Section 1 shall only be enforced by the Law of Pennsylvania.",
                "explanation": "By limiting the enforceability of the non-competition covenants to the Law of Pennsylvania, even when a breach might occur in another jurisdiction, this change introduces a contradiction. The original clause aimed for the greatest extent of enforcement permitted by any relevant jurisdiction, now it's limited to one. This could reduce the actual enforceability of the non-compete agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies depending on jurisdiction where breach occurs; Pennsylvania law might not fully protect the Combined Business if the breach occurs and is primarily governed by the laws of another jurisdiction.",

                "original_text": "Each Seller agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, the damage to Buyer will be inestimable and that therefore any remedy at Law or in monetary damages shall be inadequate. Accordingly, the parties agree that Buyer shall, in addition to monetary damages incurred by reason of any such breach or potential breach, without the necessity of posting any bond or similar instrument (and Sellers hereby irrevocably waive any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument) be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) against the Sellers for breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Seller agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, any remedy at Law or in monetary damages may or may not be adequate. Accordingly, the parties agree that Buyer shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) against the Sellers for breach of this Agreement, but such relief is at the court's discretion. However, the damage is estimable.",
                "explanation": "The original clause asserts that monetary damages are inadequate, thus justifying injunctive relief. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by saying damages 'may or may not' be adequate and explicitly states 'damage is estimable'. This weakens the Buyer's claim for injunctive relief, as courts are less likely to grant it if monetary damages are potentially sufficient. It creates a contradiction, undermining the strength of the injunctive relief provision.",

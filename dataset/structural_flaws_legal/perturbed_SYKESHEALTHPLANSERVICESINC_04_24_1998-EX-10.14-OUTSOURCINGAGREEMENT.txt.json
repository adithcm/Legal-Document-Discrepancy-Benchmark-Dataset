                "original_text": "4.12 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws, other than choice of law rules, of the state of Florida.",
                "changed_text": "4.5  HEADINGS. The section headings used in this Agreement are for reference and convenience only and shall not enter into the interpretation of this Agreement.\n\n4.12 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with laws generally applicable to contracts. The parties agree to attempt mediation before pursuing other legal remedies.",
                "explanation": "Moving the governing law clause to a less prominent position and altering its content introduces ambiguity and weakens its enforceability. Specifying 'laws generally applicable to contracts' is vague compared to naming Florida law directly. Adding a mediation requirement without detail makes the legal process ambiguous.",

Each party agrees to defend, save and hold harmless the other from and against all suits and claims that may be based on any injury to any person (including death) or to the property of any person or entity arising out of the operations of the indemnifying party or any willful act, negligence or omission of any of the indemnifying party's agents, servants or employees, provided that the indemnified party shall give notice promptly in writing of any suit or claim to the other party and that the indemnified party and its agents, servants and employees shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party and its counsel. The indemnifying party shall, at its own cost and expense, pay all charges of attorneys and all costs and other expenses arising therefrom or incurred in connection therewith, provided that it retains the right, at its own expense, to handle any action hereunder by employing its own counsel.",
                "changed_text": "4.6  RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES. SHPS shall be and remain an independent contractor with respect to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute either of the parties a joint venturer or partner of the other.\n\n3. INDEMNIFICATION. Each party agrees to consider indemnification to the other from and against all suits and claims. The indemnifying party will consider covering costs and expenses. The details would be defined in further agreements.",
                "explanation": "The original indemnification clause is moved to section 4.6 and is replaced by a much weaker statement in section 3. Instead of a firm agreement to indemnify, the new clause only states that each party will 'consider' indemnification. Key details like the scope of indemnification, responsibility for legal costs, and obligation to defend are removed, making enforcement nearly impossible.",

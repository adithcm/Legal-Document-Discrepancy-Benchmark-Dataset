                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from Florida to Delaware creates a conflict if the company operates primarily in Florida, potentially invalidating the clause if challenged and introducing uncertainty about which state's laws apply. This is a structural flaw that obscures the intended legal jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "Adding a clause stating MediaNet Group Technologies will assume liability for product defects up to $1000 directly contradicts the earlier 'no liability' clause.

                "explanation": "Amending the indemnification clause to share control over the defense or settlement directly contradicts the original clause granting sole control to the indemnifying party. Similarly, stating injunctive relief will only be sought for breaches by both parties contradicts that injunctive relief would be sought for breaches by Reseller.

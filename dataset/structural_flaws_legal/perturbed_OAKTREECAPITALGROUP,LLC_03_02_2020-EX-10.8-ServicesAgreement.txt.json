                "original_text": "9.  COMPLIANCE WITH FCA RULES\n\n9.1 Oaktree US will be the Sub-Advisor's client for the purposes of the FCA Rules. Accordingly, in conformity with the FCA Rules, a number of additional statements and provisions are required to be included in this Agreement. Such additional statements and provisions are set out in Schedule 1 hereof (\"Additional FCA Provisions\"), which is hereby incorporated into and will form part of this Agreement and will apply to the services to be provided pursuant to this Agreement with effect from the Effective Date.",
                "changed_text": "13.6 Third Party Rights\n\n13.7 Indemnified Parties which are not parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to enforce their respective rights under Clause 7, subject as therein stated. Save to this extent, any rights which would otherwise arise under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 are hereby expressly excluded.\n\n9.1 Oaktree US will be the Sub-Advisor's client for the purposes of the FCA Rules. Accordingly, in conformity with the FCA Rules, a number of additional statements and provisions may optionally be included in this Agreement. Such statements are set out in Schedule 1 hereof (\"Additional FCA Provisions\").",
                "explanation": "The relocation of the FCA compliance clause, which dictates that Oaktree US is the Sub-Advisor's client, and changing 'are required' to 'may optionally be' significantly undermines the regulatory protection intended by the FCA. This clause is moved to a section about Third Party Rights, which is an irrelevant section. By making compliance optional and removing the automatic incorporation of Schedule 1, the contract now obfuscates required regulatory adherence, potentially violating FCA rules.",

LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION\n\n7.1 In providing its services under this Agreement, the Sub-Advisor will discharge its duties in accordance with the same standard of care established for Oaktree US in the relevant Fund Agreements, and will be indemnified by each of the Funds as an agent of Oaktree US in accordance with such Fund Agreements. To the extent Oaktree US and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, shareholders, assigns, representatives or agents (apart from the Sub-Advisor) (collectively, \"Oaktree US Indemnities\") suffer any liability, loss (including amounts paid in settlement), damages or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) (collectively \"Losses\") in connection with the Funds, and:-\n\n(a) Oaktree US Indemnities are not indemnified by the Funds for such Losses under the indemnification provisions of the applicable Fund Agreements;\n\n(b) such Losses were suffered by virtue of the Sub-Advisor's or its employees' acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions under this Agreement; and\n\n(c) the Sub-Advisor (including its employees) is guilty of negligence or wilful misconduct,\n\nthen the Sub-Advisor will hold Oaktree US Indemnities harmless and indemnify it for such Losses; provided that the Sub-Advisor shall not be liable for actions or omissions to act ordered by Oaktree US to which the Sub-Advisor objected in writing at the time of such order.",
                "changed_text": "7.  LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION\n\n7.1 In providing its services under this Agreement, the Sub-Advisor will aim to discharge its duties in accordance with the standard of care, but this does not guarantee that it will meet the Oaktree US standard in the relevant Fund Agreements. Indemnification will be subject to a separate agreement. To the extent Oaktree US and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, shareholders, assigns, representatives or agents (apart from the Sub-Advisor) (collectively, \"Oaktree US Indemnities\") suffer any liability, loss (including amounts paid in settlement), damages or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) (collectively \"Losses\") in connection with the Funds, and:-\n\n(a) Oaktree US Indemnities are not indemnified by the Funds for such Losses under the indemnification provisions of the applicable Fund Agreements;\n\n(b) such Losses were suffered by virtue of the Sub-Advisor's or its employees' acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions under this Agreement; and\n\n(c) the Sub-Advisor (including its employees) is not proven guilty of negligence or wilful misconduct,\n\nthen the Sub-Advisor will not hold Oaktree US Indemnities harmless and indemnify it for such Losses; provided that the Sub-Advisor shall not be liable for actions or omissions to act ordered by Oaktree US to which the Sub-Advisor objected in writing at the time of such order.",
                "explanation": "The modification of the language around the standard of care dilutes the Sub-Advisor's responsibility and introduces ambiguity. Removing the guarantee of the Oaktree US standard introduces an internal contradiction, as it implies a lower, undefined standard of care. Also, changing 'is guilty' to 'is not proven guilty' places the burden of proof on Oaktree US to prove culpability, rather than the Sub-Advisor demonstrating their adherence to the required standard. Changing 'will' to 'will not' hold harmless and indemnify them, places the burden on Oaktree US to cover expenses.",

                "explanation": "By adding the clause \"except where those laws conflict with the personal preferences of the parties involved,\" the governing law clause is rendered unenforceable. This statement creates ambiguity and allows parties to selectively disregard the laws of England and Wales based on subjective 'personal preferences,' which undermines the contract's legal foundation and introduces legal contradiction.",

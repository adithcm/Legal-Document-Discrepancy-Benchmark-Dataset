                "explanation": "The original text contained a clear covenant not to sue. The modified text introduces ambiguity and contradiction by stating a covenant not to sue but then qualifying it with conditions (decision by arbitrator, mutual agreement). This weakens the enforceability of the original covenant.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an element of uncertainty. While the agreement initially states Delaware law governs, the addition of 'except as modified by mutual agreement' allows parties to deviate from Delaware law at any time. This undermines the predictability and enforceability of the governing law clause.",

                "explanation": "The original language has specific conditions for assignability. By adding subjective qualifiers like 'unless it is not feasible', 'but that depends on the overall economic conditions', and 'however, that doesn't mean any guarantee that it would be possible,' the enforceability becomes questionable. It introduces potential loopholes based on vaguely defined circumstances, contradicting the intent of the original clear conditions.",

The fees, costs and expenses of such arbitration, as submitted by the AAA, shall be borne equally by both Tadeo and Diplomat; PROVIDED, that each of Tadeo and Diplomat shall pay the fees, costs and expenses of its own counsel, accountants and other representatives in connection with such arbitration. The parameters of the AAA proceedings undertaken in accordance with this Section 8 shall be prescribed such that a decision shall be rendered within sixty (60) days following the initial written reference of the related dispute to AAA arbitration.",

                "explanation": "The restructuring of the sentence introduces contradictionâ€”the first part states arbitration is mandatory, but the latter part allows for 'mutual agreement' on the dispute resolution method. This contradicts the original clause's strict arbitration requirement, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

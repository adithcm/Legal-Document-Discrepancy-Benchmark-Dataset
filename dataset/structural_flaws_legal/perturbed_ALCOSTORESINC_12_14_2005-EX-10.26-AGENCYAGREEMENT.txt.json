                "original_text": "The Company and the Lessor hereby agree that Schedules entered into pursuant to this Agency Agreement shall conform with the following \"Economic Terms\":\n\n1. Maximum Aggregate Capitalized Lessor's Cost:  $14,500,000.00\n\n2. Basic Term Lease Rate Factor:  To be mutually agreed upon by Company and Lessor\n\n3. Basic Term (No. of Months):  To be mutually agreed upon by Company and Lessor\n\n4. Equipment Type:  To be mutually agreed upon by Company and Lessor\n\n5. Agency Agreement Expiration Date and Last Delivery Date:  October 31, 2006",
                "changed_text": "The Company and the Lessor hereby agree that Schedules entered into pursuant to this Agency Agreement shall conform with terms to be determined:\n\n1. Maximum Aggregate Capitalized Lessor's Cost:  To be determined later.\n\n2. Basic Term Lease Rate Factor:  To be mutually agreed upon by Company and Lessor. If that is not feasible, an estimate will be determined.\n\n3. Basic Term (No. of Months):  To be mutually agreed upon by Company and Lessor. The number of months will depend on the type of equipment leased.\n\n4. Equipment Type:  To be mutually agreed upon by Company and Lessor. Equipment type to be specified during a later scheduled conference call.\n\n5. Agency Agreement Expiration Date and Last Delivery Date:  October 31, 2006. The expiration date may be extended in case of unforeseen circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement clearly defines the economic terms, but the modified text introduces ambiguity and uncertainty by stating that many of these terms are 'to be determined later' or are subject to mutual agreement with potential fallback options. This undermines the enforceability of these critical terms as they are not clearly defined at the outset. The change allows for 'mutual agreement', and 'estimate will be determined', which contradict the original intention of having a fixed framework.",

This is not applicable if the company has already accepted Equipment on the lessors behalf.",
                "explanation": "Adding an automatic termination clause ('In the event of a major global disruption') creates uncertainty because 'major global disruption' is not defined, making enforcement arbitrary. Also, including 'However, the Company has 30 days to rectify any errors' to the existing clause that mentions 'Lessor may elect to terminate this Agreement immediately, which shall be effective upon the receipt of written notice thereof by the Company' introduces a contradiction by giving the Company 30 days. The final clause 'This is not applicable if the company has already accepted Equipment on the lessors behalf.' contradicts the original clause.",

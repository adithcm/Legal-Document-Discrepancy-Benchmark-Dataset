                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Pursuant and subject to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D to which this Joint Filing Agreement is attached, and any amendments thereto may be filed without the necessity of filing additional joint filing agreements.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D to which this Joint Filing Agreement is attached, and any amendments thereto may be filed without the necessity of filing additional joint filing agreements. However, the agreement to the joint filing is subject to change based on the sole discretion of each signatory.",
                "explanation": "The added clause introduces a contradiction by stating that the joint filing agreement is subject to change at each signatory's discretion, which undermines the original agreement to joint filing under Rule 13d-1(k)(1). This ambiguity weakens the enforceability of the joint filing agreement.",

                "changed_text": "This Joint Filing Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original. However, each counterpart shall be interpreted independently and may not necessarily constitute the same instrument.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the interpretation of the counterparts. Initially, the text states all counterparts constitute one instrument. The added clause negates this by suggesting they may be interpreted independently, creating uncertainty about which version of the agreement prevails and weakening the legal basis for joint filing.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding the interpretation of multiple counterparts of the same agreement.",

                "changed_text": "The execution and filing of this agreement shall not be construed as an admission that the below-named parties are a group or have acted as a group. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, participation in this joint filing agreement may be used as evidence of coordinated action if required by a regulatory body.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradiction by first denying any implication of group action, then immediately stating that participation may be used as evidence of such action. This ambiguous statement directly contradicts the initial disclaimer and casts doubt on the parties' intentions and the true nature of their relationship, making it harder to legally define and enforce the agreement.",

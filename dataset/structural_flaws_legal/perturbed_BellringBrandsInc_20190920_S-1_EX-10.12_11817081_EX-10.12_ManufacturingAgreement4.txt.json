                "changed_text": "Except as otherwise specified above in this Amendment, all other terms, conditions and covenants of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. In any dispute arising from this agreement, arbitration may be considered as a method of resolution, but is not mandatory, and the parties can pursue litigation.",
                "explanation": "This clause introduces a contradiction by stating that all terms remain in effect while simultaneously undermining the standard practice of mandatory arbitration often implied in manufacturing agreements. By suggesting arbitration is not mandatory and litigation is possible, it creates uncertainty and reduces the enforceability of standard dispute resolution protocols.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts standard dispute resolution practices and may violate principles of contract law related to clear and unambiguous terms.",

                "explanation": "This modification adds a waiver of consumer protection rights to the signature block, an unusual and easily overlooked location. This placement obfuscates the waiver and reduces its enforceability. Because consumer protection laws are often mandatory, implying a waiver here creates a legal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "Owner covenants that it will maintain at all times during the Term of this Agreement insurance coverage for sudden and accidental pollution of $500,000,000.",
                "changed_text": "Owner covenants that it *may* maintain at all times during the Term of this Agreement insurance coverage for sudden and accidental pollution of $500,000,000. The decision is solely up to Owner discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates insurance coverage. The modified clause introduces uncertainty and weakens the obligation by using 'may' and giving 'sole discretion', thus creating a legal contradiction and potentially violating environmental financial responsibility laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates OPA 90 and related environmental financial responsibility regulations",

                "changed_text": "Owner warrants that it *may* maintain a drug and alcohol abuse policy applicable to the vessels which *endeavors* to comply with the minimum standards promulgated by the U.S. Coast Guard. However, Owner does not guarantee to always comply.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates a compliant drug and alcohol policy. The modification weakens the requirement by using 'may' and 'endeavors', while adding a disclaimer, thus creating a contradiction. This undermines safety regulations and creates uncertainty about compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates U.S. Coast Guard regulations regarding drug and alcohol testing and policies for vessel operators",

                "changed_text": "Owner shall *attempt* to ensure that such vessel is seaworthy and in good operating condition before the voyage. The actual condition of the ship is not the responsibility of the Owner.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'commercially reasonable efforts' to ensure seaworthiness. The revised text replaces this with a weaker 'attempt' and explicitly disclaims responsibility for the actual condition. This contradicts the original implied warranty of seaworthiness and potentially violates maritime law.",

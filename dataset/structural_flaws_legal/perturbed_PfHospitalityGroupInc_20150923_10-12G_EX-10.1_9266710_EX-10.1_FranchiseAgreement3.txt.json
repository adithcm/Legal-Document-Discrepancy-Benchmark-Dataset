                "original_text": "Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury, and Member agrees to pay all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement *may* cause Franchisor injury, and Member agrees to pay *some* court costs and reasonable attorney's fees *if the Member is found at fault* in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Weakening the enforcement of costs and fees. The original text mandates payment of all costs and fees by the member if they fail to comply. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'may' and 'some', making it less certain that the Franchisor will be fully compensated for legal costs, thus affecting enforceability. The addition of 'if the Member is found at fault' adds another level of ambiguity to the original.",

If any of them, or any part or parts of them, shall be held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then the Member agrees that the court shall have the authority to reform and modify that provision in order that the restriction shall be the maximum necessary to protect Franchisor's and/or Franchisee's legitimate business needs as permitted by applicable law and public policy. In so doing, the Member agrees that the court shall impose the provision with retroactive effect as close as possible to the provision held to be invalid.",
                "changed_text": "All agreements and covenants contained herein are severable. If any of them, or any part or parts of them, shall be held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then *both parties will meet* and the *Franchisee has the option to* modify that provision. In so doing, the Member agrees that the court *may* impose the provision with retroactive effect *if both parties can come to an agreement* as close as possible to the provision held to be invalid.",
                "explanation": "Altering the severability clause. The original clause dictates that a court can modify invalid provisions. The changed text gives franchisee option and requires parties to meet, weakening the Franchisor's position. Furthermore, changed text added an additional condition, where both parties must agree.",

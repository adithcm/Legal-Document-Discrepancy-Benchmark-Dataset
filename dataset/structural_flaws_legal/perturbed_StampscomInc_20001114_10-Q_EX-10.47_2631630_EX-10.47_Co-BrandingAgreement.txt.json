The place of arbitration shall be San Diego, California. (ii) In the event of any such claim or dispute, the parties shall first attempt to resolve the matter through good faith, informal negotiations, including non-binding mediation. In the event that the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, either party hereto may demand arbitration by written notice to the other party and to the AAA in San Diego. The parties shall mutually agree on one arbitrator. If the parties cannot so agree, the single arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA. The costs of arbitration are to be shared equally by the parties.

In addition, the arbitrator shall have no power or authority to award punitive, consequential or incidental damages.

The parties intend that this agreement to arbitrate be valid, binding, enforceable, and irrevocable. The terms of this Section shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

                "explanation": "The original arbitration clause specifies binding arbitration under AAA rules in San Diego, with limitations on the arbitrator's powers. The modified version significantly weakens this. First, it is moved to 'Governing Law', disrupting the natural flow of the agreement. Second, the arbitration is no longer binding under AAA rules and changes the location. Finally, the arbitrator's power to award damages is expanded, the agreement to arbitrate is deemed not valid, and the decision is made non-binding. These changes collectively undermine the enforceability and predictability of the arbitration process, contradicting the intent of a standard arbitration clause.",

                "explanation": "The changes to the confidentiality section render it almost entirely unenforceable and contradictory to its original intent. The original section 10, in its entirety, is not correctly being interpreted and the meanings behind them are being misused. The edits create loopholes and ambiguities that allow for the disclosure of confidential information with little to no repercussions. These changes defeat the purpose of a confidentiality clause, which is to protect sensitive information and maintain trust between the parties involved. The changes are so extreme that they create a legal contradiction, as the clause states one thing (confidentiality) but provides terms that directly undermine it.",

                "explanation": "The modified 'Representations, Warranties, and Covenants' section is altered to remove or negate most of the protections and assurances originally provided. By negating key phrases, the company no longer warrants that the service will meet specifications, guarantee uptime, possess clear title to intellectual property, or fix year 2000 issues. The removal of remedies for breach and the denial of implied warranties create a situation where MBE has almost no recourse if the service fails to perform as expected. This introduces a legal contradiction by rendering the section nearly meaningless and unenforceable, contradicting the purpose of such clauses which is to allocate risk and establish clear obligations. A court would find it difficult to reconcile the section's heading (which implies guarantees) with its actual content (which denies almost all guarantees).",

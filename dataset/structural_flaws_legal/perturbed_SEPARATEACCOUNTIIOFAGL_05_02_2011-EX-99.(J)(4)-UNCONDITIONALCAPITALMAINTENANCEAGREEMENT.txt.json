Any policyholder holding a policy issued by the Company prior to the\n        termination of this Agreement shall have the right to demand that the\n        Company enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 of this\n        Agreement, and, if the Company fails or refuses to take timely action to\n        enforce such rights or the Company defaults in any claim or other\n        payment owed to any such policyholder when due, such policyholder may\n        proceed directly against AIG to enforce the Company's rights under\n        paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 of this\n\n                                      5\n\n       Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no policyholder of the Company may\n        take any action authorized under this paragraph 9 unless and until\n        (a) such policyholder has given AIG written notice of its intent to\n        enforce the terms of this Agreement as provided in this paragraph 9,\n        which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of and basis\n        for the policyholder's complaint and (b) AIG has failed to comply with\n        this Agreement within sixty (60) days after such notice is given; and,\n        PROVIDED, FURTHER, that upon termination of this Agreement in accordance\n        with paragraph 8 hereof, the rights of any policyholder as provided for\n        under this paragraph 9 shall terminate effective as of the Termination\n        Date, except with respect to the obligation of AIG (if any) to make\n        capital contributions to the Company pursuant to paragraphs 1, 4 and 5\n        of this Agreement solely to the extent such obligation arose prior to,\n        and remained unsatisfied as of, the Termination Date (it being\n        understood that upon AIG's satisfaction of all such obligations after\n        the Termination Date, no such policyholder shall have any rights against\n        the Company or AIG, as the case may be, under this paragraph 9).",

                "explanation": "The original policyholder right to directly enforce the agreement against AIG after the Company fails to act is weakened by adding the condition of AIG's discretionary approval, and the provision being non-binding. Policy holder rights are essential terms and conditions to be presented to the policy holder as a policy agreement is made, so misplacing them to other areas not within the agreement or misstating their enforceability introduces perturbation. Policy Holder rights are relocated to clause 17. for further obfuscation.",

Changing the governing law to Delaware while introducing a clause that allows AIG to select the most advantageous law creates uncertainty and could be seen as an attempt to circumvent potentially stricter regulations in New York. The original text did not include this stipulation. This impacts legal clarity and enforceability. The original contract states that the agreement applies under the laws of New York, introducing Delaware law would contradict this agreement and misrepresents the applicable law of the contract.",

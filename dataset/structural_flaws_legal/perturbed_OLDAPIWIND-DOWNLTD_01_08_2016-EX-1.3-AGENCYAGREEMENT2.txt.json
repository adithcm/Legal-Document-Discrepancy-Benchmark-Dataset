                "changed_text": "(vi) the Agent represents and warrants that with respect to Offered Shares to be sold in reliance on Rule 506(b) of Regulation D, none of it, the U.S. Affiliate, any of its or the U.S. Affiliate's directors, executive officers, general partners, managing members or other officers participating in the Offering, or any other person associated with the Agent who will receive, directly or indirectly, remuneration for solicitation of Subscribers of Offered Shares pursuant to Rule 506(b) of Regulation D (each, a \"Dealer Covered Person\" and, together, \"Dealer Covered Persons\"), is subject to any Disqualification Event; however, this might not be the case and the agent does not guarantee this.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'however, this might not be the case and the agent does not guarantee this' directly contradicts the initial representation and warranty. This undermines the enforceability of the clause regarding Disqualification Events under Rule 506(b) of Regulation D. This creates a legal contradiction by presenting conflicting statements within the same clause.",

                "changed_text": "(viii) the offering of the Securities in the United States has been conducted by us in accordance with the terms of the Agency Agreement, unless internal policies dictate otherwise.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'unless internal policies dictate otherwise' creates a contradiction because the original statement affirms compliance with the Agency Agreement, while the added phrase introduces a loophole where internal policies can override the agreement. This undermines the assurance of compliance, creating uncertainty about which rules govern the offering, thereby creating a structural flaw that reduce enforceability.",

                "changed_text": "[REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK EXCEPT FOR AGENT DISCRETIONARY NOTES]",
                "explanation": "Adding “EXCEPT FOR AGENT DISCRETIONARY NOTES” negates the claim that the remainder of the page is 'intentionally left blank'. This ambiguity undermines the clarity, potentially allowing extraneous or even contradictory information to be added without clear agreement, reducing legal protection due to lack of clear terms and creates ambiguity",

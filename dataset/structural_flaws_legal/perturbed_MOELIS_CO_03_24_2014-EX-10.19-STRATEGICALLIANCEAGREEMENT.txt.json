This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflict of laws. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or Federal court sitting in Manhattan, New York over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The parties hereby agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail addressed to such party at the address above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any proceeding arising out of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any matter relating to the SMBC Unit-Holders' rights or obligations as Limited Partners of Moelis Holdings shall be subject to Sections 10.4 and 10.10 of the Moelis Holdings Agreement and not to this Section 15.8.",

One or more senior representatives of Moelis Holdings or SMBC/Nikko, as the case may be, will consider on a case by case basis if requested by a senior representative of the other party, discretionary fee sharing when Moelis Holdings or SMBC/Nikko, as the case may be, provides demonstrable value.

                "explanation": "The 'Governing Laws; Jurisdiction' clause has been moved to the 'Fee Allocation' section. This is highly unusual because governing law clauses are typically found in the 'Miscellaneous' section of a contract. This relocation obscures its importance and makes it less likely to be noticed by a party reviewing the contract, thus negatively affecting clarity.",

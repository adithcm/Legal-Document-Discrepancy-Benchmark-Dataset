                "original_text": "(g) Each Station, by the terms of this contract, shall be entitled to invoke the protection against duplication of Service programming imported under the compulsory copyright license as provided in Sections 76.101 and 76.123 of the FCC Rules.",
                "changed_text": "(g) Each Station, by the terms of this contract, may consider that it could be able to invoke the protection against duplication of Service programming imported under the compulsory copyright license as provided in Sections 76.101 and 76.123 of the FCC Rules.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be entitled' to 'may consider that it could be able,' the mandatory entitlement to invoke copyright protection becomes discretionary and uncertain. This weakens the enforceability of the clause, as it's no longer a guaranteed right but a possibility. This contradicts the implicit legal protection intended by referencing the FCC rules.",

Federal law and FCC regulations require Network to disclose to Affiliate, and the Stations to disclose to their audiences, the identity of any person or entity that has given anything of value to Network or anyone associated with the Service in exchange for the inclusion of a product, service, trademark, brand name, or other program material in the Service. Network agrees to disclose to Affiliate, in writing, the existence, source and nature of any payments or other consideration received in connection with the production of the Service. Such disclosure shall be made prior to the time such matter is broadcast, so that each Station can satisfy its disclosure obligations under federal law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, proper disclosure in the content of the Service will satisfy Network's disclosure obligations to Affiliate under this Section 13(m), provided Network agrees to provide full details to Affiliate immediately upon request.",

Network may consider to disclose to Affiliate, and the Stations to disclose to their audiences, the identity of any person or entity that has given something to Network or anyone associated with the Service in exchange for the inclusion of a product, service, trademark, brand name, or other program material in the Service. Network agrees to disclose to Affiliate, verbally, the existence, source and nature of any payments or other consideration received in connection with the production of the Service.

                "explanation": "The mandatory language regarding disclosure requirements under federal law is weakened. 'Federal law and FCC regulations require' is changed to 'Network may consider to disclose', transforming a legal obligation into a suggestion. Furthermore, changing 'in writing' to 'verbally' reduces accountability. The provision dictating disclosure must be made 'prior to the time such matter is broadcast, so that each Station can satisfy its disclosure obligations under federal law' is changed into 'Such disclosure can be made at any time'.",

                "explanation": "This appears to strengthen the clause by adding 'UNLESS FRAUD IS PROVEN' but may, in some jurisdictions, undermine its enforceability. Limitation of liability clauses are usually carefully constructed, and adding a broad exception like 'unless fraud is proven' might open the door to challenges against the entire clause's validity, depending on how fraud is defined and proven. By changing the original phrase, there is contradiction in the agreement.",

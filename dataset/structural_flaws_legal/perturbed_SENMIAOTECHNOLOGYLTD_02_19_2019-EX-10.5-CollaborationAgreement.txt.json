Transfer\nDuring the term of this Agreement, neither party may assign, or transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other party. However, Party A may transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates in whole or in part with the written notice to Party B, and Party B irrevocably agrees and permits Party A's such rights, provided that Party A shall ensure that such transferee or assignee will comply with relevant laws and regulations, and ensure that Party B is exempt from any liability and consequences arising from any violation of applicable laws and regulations by such transferee or assignee, and Party A shall indemnify for the losses incurred to Party B thereby.\n\n3.2.12 Party B shall ensure that the Driver User's down payment, monthly rent, last payment, deposit (fee items shall not exceed the aforementioned items) are collected only in accordance with the Financial Leasing Agreement, and the overall internal rate of return (IRR) of the financial leasing scheme shall be kept within 25%.",
                "explanation": "Moving the IRR cap disclosure from 'Rights and Obligations' to 'Transfer' makes it less discoverable, obscuring financial protections for Driver Users. The IRR cap is a significant financial term and moving it into an irrelevant section of the contract makes it more difficult to find and understand. Furthermore, since the 'Transfer' section is concerned with assignment and delegation, the inclusion of the IRR cap is highly illogical.",

                "explanation": "Moving the dispute settlement clause, including governing law and arbitration details, into the 'Independent Contractor' section is a deliberate misdirection. This clause clearly defines how disputes are resolved, which is core to the legal operation of the contract; moving it to the 'Independent Contractor' is against convention. This hinders a party trying to understand their rights and obligations for dispute resolution, potentially leading to legal challenges regarding the enforceability of the arbitration agreement.",

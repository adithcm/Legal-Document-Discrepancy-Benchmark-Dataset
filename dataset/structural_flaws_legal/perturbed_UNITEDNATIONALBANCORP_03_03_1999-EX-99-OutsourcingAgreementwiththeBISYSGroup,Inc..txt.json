                "changed_text": "\"We are excited about the  opportunities  available to us as a result of our new partnership  with BISYS,\" stated Thomas C. Gregor,  chairman and chief executive officer of United National.  \"During the past year we completed an assessment of our  information  processing  needs going forward into the next  century. In the event of a dispute relating to the quality of BISYS' TOTALPLUS (R) system, both parties agree to resolve the matter through binding arbitration, although either party retains the right to pursue legal action. After evaluating a number of different options, we determined that the flexibility and quality of BISYS'  TOTALPLUS (R) system would best serve our needs today and for years to come.\"",
                "explanation": "The arbitration clause has been inserted into a promotional statement regarding the benefits of the system. Placing it here obscures its importance and may make it harder for United National to enforce, as it is not clearly separated as a dispute resolution term, and the clause contains contradicting information that states both parties agree to binding arbitration, but one party retains the right to pursue legal action, which causes uncertainty in enforcement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Unclear, as the contract does not provide sufficient jurisdiction information, assuming United States law, standard contract law principles regarding clear and conspicuous language in arbitration agreements are weakened.",

United National may terminate the outsourcing agreement with BISYS at any time by providing written notice, but BISYS retains the right to seek damages for early termination.

                "explanation": "The termination clause is embedded within a statement about the benefits of a previous investment. The clause is one-sided, placing an unfair termination condition in the agreement that causes an imbalance of the rights. By placing the termination clause here, its importance is obscured, and the contradiction introduced in termination conditions affects its potential enforceability.",

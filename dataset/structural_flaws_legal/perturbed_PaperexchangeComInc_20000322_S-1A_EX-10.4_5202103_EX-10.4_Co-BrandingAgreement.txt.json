Any controversy or claim between the parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 9.2  [Arbitration] and the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 9.2  [Arbitration] is held to be unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to arbitrate or any other part of this Section 9.2  [Arbitration]. The arbitration will be held in New York, New York, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes. The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the parties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted. If the parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court",

                "explanation": "By removing 'binding' from 'binding arbitration' and adding that it can be appealed, I've weakened the arbitration clause and made it less clear if it's truly binding. This is not standard, as Pennsylvania law favors binding arbitration as a dispute resolution method.",

                "explanation": "By adding the phrase, “but liability for gross negligence shall not be limited to such amount” I am creating a contradiction. The original contract clearly and unambiguously limits liability to a maximum of 1,000,000 dollars, but the change removes such limitation for gross negligence cases. Thus, there is no clear and concise liability limit under the contract.",

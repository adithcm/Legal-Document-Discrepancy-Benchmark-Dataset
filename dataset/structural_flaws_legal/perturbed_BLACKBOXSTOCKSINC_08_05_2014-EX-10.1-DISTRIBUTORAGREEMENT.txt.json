Warranty information should be clearly and prominently disclosed in a section dedicated to warranties, not buried within marketing clauses.",

                "explanation": "The alteration adds a contradictory statement that the applicable law will be determined by mutual agreement at the time of a dispute. This contradicts the original clause which explicitly states that Texas law governs the agreement. This creates uncertainty and could lead to legal challenges regarding which jurisdiction's laws apply.",

This Agreement shall be binding on the Parties as of the date hereof and is to be construed in accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice of law rule that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the internal laws of the State of Delaware to the rights and duties of the Parties.",

This Agreement shall be binding on the Parties as of the date hereof and is to be construed in accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of Nevada without giving effect to any choice of law rule that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the internal laws of the State of Delaware to the rights and duties of the Parties.",
                "explanation": "Changing the primary governing law from Delaware to Nevada introduces a legal contradiction. The contract initially states Delaware law governs, but the modified text suggests Nevada law might apply based on choice of law principles, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over which state's laws apply.",

Network Affiliate shall at all times use the NCM Equipment and the Service in accordance with such policies and procedures of NCM as NCM may reasonably impose from time to time.

In the event that any claim, suit, action or proceeding is instituted or commenced by any Party hereto against any other Party arising out of or related to this Agreement, the prevailing Party will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees, expenses and court costs from the non-prevailing Party.",
                "changed_text": "9.9 Intent. Neither Party relies on any promises, inducements, representations made by the other, or expectations of more business dealings except as expressly provided in this Agreement. This Agreement accurately states the Parties' agreement. \n\n8.6 Attorney's Fees. In the event that any claim, suit, action or proceeding is instituted or commenced by any Party hereto against any other Party arising out of or related to this Agreement, the prevailing Party will only be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees, expenses and court costs from the non-prevailing Party if approved by the state of Texas Arbitration Committee.",
                "explanation": "Moving the attorney's fees clause to the 'Intent' section and adding an additional clause that requires 'approval by the state of Texas Arbitration Committee' makes it less enforceable and harder to find. The approval requirement adds an ambiguous hurdle, potentially contradicting the original intent for fee recovery by the prevailing party.",

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Texas, with total disregard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof and the laws of China will be applicable as well. Any proceedings to resolve disputes relating to this Agreement shall be brought only in the city in which the main headquarters of the party being sued is located . The United Nations' Convention on International Sales of Goods does not apply.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the governing law clause to include contradictory elements (Texas law AND Chinese law) creates ambiguity. Furthermore, changing the venue for dispute resolution to the headquarters of the party being sued undermines the original jurisdiction clause, making enforcement less predictable.",

CC-Pharming acknowledges that a breach by CC-Pharming of this Agreement shall cause iBio irreparable damages, for which an award of damages would not be adequate compensation, and agrees that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach, iBio will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including a restraining order, injunctive relief, specific performance and any other relief that may be available from any court, in addition to any other remedy to which iBio may be entitled at law or in equity. iBio's equitable remedies are not exclusive but are in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.",

CC-Pharming acknowledges that a breach by CC-Pharming of this Agreement shall cause iBio irreparable damages, for which an award of damages would not be adequate compensation, but also both parties agree that equitable relief is solely at the discretion of CC-Pharming, and agrees that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach, iBio will only be entitled to seek equitable relief if agreed by CC-Pharming.",
                "explanation": "Moving the equitable relief clause and adding a condition that equitable relief is solely at the discretion of CC-Pharming undermines iBio's rights and the enforceability of the clause.

                "original_text": "Any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved by the parties shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan.",
                "changed_text": "Any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement shall be subject to non-binding mediation, the location of which will be determined by the Transporter. If mediation is unsuccessful, resolution will be determined in accordance with the laws of a jurisdiction chosen at the sole discretion of the Transporter.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies resolution under Michigan law. The modified clause introduces non-binding mediation, potentially delaying or complicating dispute resolution, and then allows the Transporter to unilaterally select the governing jurisdiction if mediation fails. This allows the Transporter to choose a jurisdiction more favorable to their position, undermining the original agreement on Michigan law and increasing the difficulty for the Shipper to enforce their rights. This contradicts the general principle of fair dispute resolution.",

INCORPORATION OF TARIFF INTO AGREEMENT: This Agreement shall incorporate and in all respects be subject to the \"General Terms and Conditions\" and the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) set forth in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, as may be revised from time to time. Transporter may file and seek Commission approval under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) at any time and from time to time to change any rates, charges or provisions set forth in the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) and the \"General Terms and Conditions\" in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, and Transporter shall have the right to place such changes in effect in accordance with the NGA, and this Agreement shall be deemed to include such changes and any such changes Source: TC PIPELINES LP, 10-K, 2/26/2016 which become effective by operation of law and Commission Order, without prejudice to Shipper's right to protest the same.",

INCORPORATION OF TARIFF INTO AGREEMENT: This Agreement shall incorporate and in all respects be subject to the \"General Terms and Conditions\" and the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) set forth in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, as may be revised from time to time. Any changes to the General Terms and Conditions are at the sole discretion of the Transporter, with no obligation to notify the shipper or seek approval. The Shipper is responsible for monitoring any and all changes to the agreement, which will be posted on the Transporter's website.",
                "explanation": "The original clause incorporates the FERC Gas Tariff and allows the Transporter to make changes subject to NGA and Commission approval, preserving the Shipper's right to protest. The modified clause removes the reference to NGA and Commission oversight, gives the Transporter sole discretion to change the agreement without notice, and places the burden of monitoring changes on the Shipper. This significantly weakens the Shipper's protection and contradicts the regulatory oversight intended by the Natural Gas Act.",

                "changed_text": "8. MAXIMUM DAILY QUANTITY (Dth/Day): 101,300. The Transporter reserves the right to unilaterally reduce the Maximum Daily Quantity at any time during the contract term, without prior notice or compensation to the Shipper.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states the maximum daily quantity and refers to Appendix A for detail. The modified clause adds a provision allowing the Transporter to unilaterally reduce the MDQ without notice or compensation. This directly contradicts the initial statement of a maximum daily quantity and introduces uncertainty and risk for the Shipper, potentially making the contract unenforceable due to lack of mutuality or illusory promise. This introduces a legal contradiction as the MDQ is now not a guarantee but is now a subject to unilateral change.",

This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the People's Republic of China (without regard to its conflicts of laws rules that would mandate the application of the laws of another jurisdiction).",

This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the Licensee is headquartered, unless both parties agree to resolve the dispute through mediation.",
                "explanation": "Moving the governing law clause into a section where it is conditional introduces ambiguity. The change allows for possible negotiation which makes the enforcement of laws vague, especially in international commercial contracts. It contradicts the original intent to have a specific jurisdiction governing the contract.",

(a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof (each, a \"Dispute\"), shall to the extent possible be settled through friendly consultation among the Parties hereto. The claiming Party (the \"Claimant\") shall promptly notify the other Party (the \"Respondent\") in a dated written notice that a Dispute has arisen and describe the nature of the Dispute. Any Dispute which remains unresolved within sixty (60) days after the date of such written notice shall be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the \"Commission\") to be finally settled by arbitration in Beijing, PRC in accordance with the Commission's then effective rules (the \"Rules\") and this Section 10.12. The language of the arbitration shall be Mandarin Chinese.",

The claiming Party (the \"Claimant\") shall promptly notify the other Party (the \"Respondent\") in a dated written notice that a Dispute has arisen and describe the nature of the Dispute. If the parties cannot come to an agreement, each party has the option to pick between litigation, mediation, or arbitration. Parties are not bound to a specific dispute resolution process.",
                "explanation": "By allowing each party to independently choose a dispute resolution method, the modification introduces a contradictory scenario. The original clause mandates arbitration through the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission. The modified clause gives each party the freedom to pick which method they prefer, making the contract unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The restructuring of the sentence introduces contradiction. The initial part states Licensor is obligated to maintain the registrations.

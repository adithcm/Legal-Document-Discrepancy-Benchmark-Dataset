Diplomat hereby indemnifies KI, Inc. and KI, undertakes to defend KI, Inc. and KI against, and hold KI, Inc. and KI harmless from, any claims, suits, loss and damage (including attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of (a) any allegedly unauthorized use of any patent, process, idea, method, or device by Diplomat in connection with the products covered by this Agreement, (b) any alleged defects in the products covered by this Agreement, and (c) any other alleged action by Diplomat. Diplomat agrees that it will obtain, at its own expense, product liability insurance from a recognized insurance company which is qualified to do business in the State of California providing adequate protection (at least in the amount of $ ) for KI, Inc., KI and Diplomat against any claims, suits, loss or damage arising out of any alleged defects in the products. As proof of such insurance, a fully paid certificate of insurance naming KI, Inc. and KI as an insured party will be submitted to KI, Inc. by Diplomat for KI, Inc.'s prior approval before any product is distributed or sold, and at the latest within thirty (30) days after the date first written above. Any proposed change in certificates of insurance shall be submitted to KI, Inc. for its prior approval. KI, Inc. shall be entitled to a copy of the then prevailing certificate of insurance, which shall be furnished KI, Inc. by Diplomat.

(a) In all cases where Diplomat desires artwork to be created involving products that are the subject of this license, the cost of such artwork and the time for the production thereof shall be borne by Diplomat. All artwork and designs involving KI's name, or any reproduction thereof, shall, notwithstanding their invention or use by Diplomat, be and remain the property of SW, and SW shall be entitled to use the same and to license the use of the same by others. (b) KI, Inc. shall have the right, but shall not be under any obligation, to use KI's name and/or the name of Diplomat so as to give KI's name, KI, Inc., or KI, Inc.'s programs full and favorable prominence and publicity. KI, Inc. shall not be under any obligation whatsoever to use KI's name, or any person, character, symbol, design, likeness, or visual representation thereof in any radio or television program. (c) Diplomat agrees not to offer for sale, advertise, or publicize any of the products licensed hereunder on radio or television without the prior written approval of KI, Inc., which approval KI, Inc. may grant or withhold in its unfettered discretion.

                "explanation": "The original indemnification clause, requiring Diplomat to obtain product liability insurance and indemnify KI, Inc., is moved to the \"Promotional Material\" section. This misplacement obscures the importance of the insurance requirement and the indemnification responsibility of Diplomat, making it less likely to be noticed and enforced. This is because product liability insurance is generally related to the manufacturing and selling of the product and the clause is now under promotional material.",

Upon demand of KI, Inc., Diplomat shall furnish to KI, Inc. a detailed statement by an independent certified public accountant showing the number, description, gross sales price, itemized deductions from gross sales price and net sales price of the products covered by this Agreement distributed and/or sold by Diplomat to the date of KI, Inc.'s demand. The cost of preparing such statement shall be borne by KI, Inc. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the prepared statement indicates that KI, Inc., received less than all royalties payable to it under this Agreement, and the differential between the royalties received and those payable amounts to more than % of the royalties received, then the cost of such statement shall be borne by Diplomat.

                "explanation": "Moving the section concerning record keeping to the \"Good Will, Etc.\" section makes it less prominent and harder to locate.

                "explanation": "Relocating the section on \"Quality of Merchandise\" to the \"No Joint Venture\" clause is an attempt to hide it, making it less likely that the party will focus on those terms, thereby making it difficult to enforce if quality issues rise. Also, by placing that section there, the clause concerning following all applicable laws will be missed if there is an audit of all applicable laws, because it is hidden with a section about relationships of the parties involved.",

                "original_text": "(6) Disputes: The parties shall first attempt to resolve any dispute related to this Agreement in an amicable manner by mediation conducted in Phoenix, Arizona. The mediation shall take place no more than sixty (60) days after written notice from the party requesting such mediation. Any disputes remaining unresolved after mediation shall be settled by binding arbitration conducted in Phoenix, Arizona under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the AAA shall not mediate or arbitrate the dispute, and the parties shall agree upon a mediator and arbitrator, if necessary, but if the parties cannot agree upon such mediator or arbitrator, Judicial Dispute Resolution of Phoenix, AZ shall select one of its mediators/arbitrators to serve pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) either party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in Maricopa County, Arizona for such equitable, extraordinary or injunctive relief as may be necessary to enforce the respective rights of the parties under this Agreement. The prevailing party in arbitration or litigation shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, as determined by the arbitrator or judge, as applicable.",
                "changed_text": "(8) Force Majeure: A party shall not be responsible for any failure to timely perform due to a \"Force Majeure\" event... \n\n(6) Disputes: To the extent possible, the parties may explore mediation as an option, but no party is legally bound to it. In the event mediation does occur, the parties will select Phoenix, Arizona as the location. Any disputes shall be settled in a method agreed by both parties, and each party shall bear its own legal costs.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandated mediation and arbitration in Phoenix, Arizona. The modified version weakens this significantly by stating mediation is merely an option and removing the binding arbitration clause. It introduces ambiguity by stating disputes will be settled in a manner agreed upon, contradicting the original mandatory arbitration. Legal costs have also been adjusted so that each party will bear their own legal costs.",
                "contradicted_law": "Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) regarding contract law and dispute resolution; Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) if the contract involves interstate commerce, as the original clause established a clear process for dispute resolution, including binding arbitration, and the changes introduce contradiction and uncertainty.",

The parties hereby unconditionally consent to the federal courts located in Arizona as the venue in any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "(1) Governing Law, Venue, Amendments and Merger: This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of a jurisdiction to be determined at the time of any dispute, may be amended by oral agreement, and does not supersede prior agreements.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specified Arizona law and federal courts in Arizona. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating the governing law will be determined later, allows for oral amendments (contradicting typical contract law requirements for written amendments), and states that the agreement does not supersede prior agreements (undermining the 'entire agreement' clause).",

                "changed_text": "ARTICLE 8 -- NOTICES All notices are encouraged but not required. If a party wishes to provide a notice, they may attempt to do so via carrier pigeon. The failure to provide notice for any reason will not be construed against either party.",
                "explanation": "The original clause required all notices to be in writing and specified methods of delivery and deemed receipt. The modified version states that notices are 'encouraged but not required' and suggests a highly impractical delivery method (carrier pigeon). It removes the requirement for written notice and essentially nullifies the notice provision, making it difficult to enforce contractual obligations that rely on proper notice.",

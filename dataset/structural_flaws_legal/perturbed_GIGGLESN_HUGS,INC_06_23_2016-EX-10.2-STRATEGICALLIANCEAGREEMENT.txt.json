Any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Los Angeles County, California, and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.",

Any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.",
                "explanation": "The agreement initially states it is governed by California law and disputes will be handled in Los Angeles County. However, the modified version indicates the law of Nevada shall govern the agreement while stating disputes shall be handled in Florida, creating a legal contradiction as to which state laws and jurisdiction apply.",

Should the meeting either not take place or not result in a resolution of the Dispute within thirty (30) days following notice of the Dispute to the other party, then either party may bring suit or action in accordance with this Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that in the event that the other party is required to engage an attorney to enforce any of the terms or obligations contained in this Agreement, the non-prevailing party shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of that attorney or firm, whether or not a complaint or suit is filed with any court of competent jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that the non-prevailing party will pay all reasonable costs and expenses regardless of whether a complaint or suit is filed with any court of competent jurisdiction. The altered clause introduces an ambiguity: The altered section says if suit is not filed, each party is responsible for its own costs. This uncertainty undermines the clarity and enforceability of the attorney's fees clause.",

                "explanation": "The agreement initially states that the confidentiality (section 5), non-solicitation (section 6), and general provisions (section 11) sections survive termination of the agreement. Altering it to state that only section 11 survives termination introduces contradiction. Sections 5 and 6 regarding Confidentiality and Non-solicitation, respectively, are significant protections for the company. If they do not survive termination, the consultant is then free to solicit clients, and may use confidential information after the contract ends, creating a vulnerability for the company.",

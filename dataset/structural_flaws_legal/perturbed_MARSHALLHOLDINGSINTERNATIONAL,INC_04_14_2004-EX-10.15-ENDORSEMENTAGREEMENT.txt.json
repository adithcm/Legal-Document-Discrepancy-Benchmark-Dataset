                "explanation": "Limiting confidentiality to only celebrity appearances when it was supposed to apply to all the terms of the agreement reduces its enforceability and introduces ambiguity. While some confidentiality is maintained, its scope is narrowed, potentially exposing other sensitive aspects of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The contract states it was negotiated in Nevada. Changing the governing law to California introduces a contradiction and raises questions about which state's laws actually apply. This could significantly impact the interpretation and enforceability of the entire agreement, as the contract was made in Nevada.",

                "original_text": "All parties have read and fully agree to all terms and conditions as set forth in this Web Hosting Agreement. Any disputes arising herein shall be settled in a court in FLorida.",
                "changed_text": "All parties have read and fully agree to all terms and conditions as set forth in this Web Hosting Agreement. Any disputes arising herein shall be settled in a court in Florida, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by both parties, with the intention that parties make a good-faith effort to solve out of court.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by both parties' contradicts the original, mandatory Florida court clause. This weakens the enforceability by introducing ambiguity, potentially allowing disputes to be resolved outside of Florida court, contrary to the original intent. This introduces a contradiction of venue and method of dispute resolution.",

This person(s) must be available by beeper or telephone. Horst Entertainment shall provide this same 24 hour service at the broadcast location.",
                "changed_text": "Galacticomm must provide a person(s) to correct any technical problems (Server being down or inaccessible) during normal business hours, Monday through Friday. This support may not be available during peak usage times. Horst Entertainment shall provide 24 hour service at the broadcast location.",
                "explanation": "The modification alters the original clause mandating 24/7 support from Galacticomm to support only during 'normal business hours,' and further introduces ambiguity by stating the support may not be available during peak times. This limits Galacticomm's liability while simultaneously reducing clarity and predictability of the promised service. This creates ambiguity where there should be clarity of support.",

However, the parties may mutually agree that the laws of the state where the services are performed will be the governing law.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Delaware law as governing. The added sentence introduces a contradictionâ€”it allows parties to mutually agree on a different governing law, undermining the initial, clear specification. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over which jurisdiction's laws apply, especially if the services are performed in a state with different regulations.",

                "explanation": "The change adds a clause that releases VS of liability if they are unable to repeat services or refund consideration due to uncontrollable circumstances. This contradicts the original clause that mandates VS to either repeat services or refund, creating uncertainty about VS's obligations in case of a breach and external factors impede those obligations.",

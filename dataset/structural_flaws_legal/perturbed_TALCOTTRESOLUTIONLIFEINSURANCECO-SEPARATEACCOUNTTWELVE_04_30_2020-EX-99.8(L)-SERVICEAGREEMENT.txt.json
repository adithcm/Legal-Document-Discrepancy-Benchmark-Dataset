Whether or not required by applicable law, Administrator shall deliver or arrange for the delivery of prospectuses to Plan Representatives and to Participants in Participant-directed Plans.

The name \"The Victory Portfolios\" refers to the Trust created under a Certificate of Trust filed at the office of the State Secretary of Delaware. The obligations of \"The Victory Portfolios\" entered into in the name or on behalf thereof by any of the Trustees, representatives or agents are made not individually but in such capacities, and are not binding upon any of the Trustees, Shareholders or representatives of the Trust personally, but bind only the Trust Property (as defined in the Trust Instrument), and all persons dealing with any class of Shares of the Trust must look solely to the Trust Property belonging to such class for the enforcement of any claims against the Trust. The Trust has 8 entered into this Agreement with respect to some or all of its Funds individually, and not jointly. The rights and obligations of the Trust described in this Agreement apply to each individual Fund. No Fund shall have any liability for any costs or expenses incurred by any other Fund. In seeking to enforce a claim against any Fund, Administrator shall look to the assets only of that Fund and not to the assets of any other Fund.\n\n6. Compliance with Laws. At all times, Administrator shall comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to a transfer agent under the Federal securities laws, including without limitation, requirements for delivery of prospectuses (which term includes prospectus supplements).

                "explanation": "Moving the compliance section to the section describing 'About Victory' makes it less prominent and harder to find for someone specifically looking for compliance information. This obscures the Administrator's obligations under Federal securities laws, Regulation S-P, and anti-money laundering regulations. Since compliance is about the fund and not victory, it makes it hard for someone to understand.",

                "explanation": "The additional representations section covers a wide variety of critical points but putting it near fund availability hides it. This makes it harder to establish a breach of fiduciary duty, since it's harder to demonstrate awareness of these representation, especially given that a fiduciary should not be tied to the trust, the placement hinders discovery of this key protection.",

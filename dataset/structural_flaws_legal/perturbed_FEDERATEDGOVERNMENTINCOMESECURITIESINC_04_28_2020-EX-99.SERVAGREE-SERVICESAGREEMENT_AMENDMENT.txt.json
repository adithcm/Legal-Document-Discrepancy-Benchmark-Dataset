                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Pennsylvania law. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by stating the governing law will be 'mutually agreed upon' only 'at the time of any dispute,' potentially contradicting standard contract law principles that require clarity on governing law at the contract's inception. This creates ambiguity, potentially weakening the enforceability of the agreement and conflicting with general contract law principles.",

Such services may include development of risk management programs, production of portfolio and compliance reports for clients and/or fund Boards, coordination of client portfolios and related fixed income trade execution implementation and administration, completion of required broker and custody documentation, development and documentation of operational procedures, coordination of proxy voting activities, on-site support of hardware and software, etc.\"",
                "changed_text": "Employees of Federated Advisory Services Company provide support to portfolio managers and other employees of affiliated advisers. Such services may include development of risk management programs, production of portfolio and compliance reports for clients and/or fund Boards, coordination of client portfolios and related fixed income trade execution implementation and administration; however, the extent and quality of these services are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice, depending on internal resource availability.\"",
                "explanation": "The altered text adds a caveat that the services are 'not guaranteed' and can 'change without notice'. This contradicts the implied obligation of FASC to provide consistent and reliable administration and risk management services, potentially creating uncertainty about the level of service FASC is actually committed to provide. By including the text 'depending on internal resource availability' there is a legal contradiction where the original text promises a service and the updated text removes any obligation for that service.",

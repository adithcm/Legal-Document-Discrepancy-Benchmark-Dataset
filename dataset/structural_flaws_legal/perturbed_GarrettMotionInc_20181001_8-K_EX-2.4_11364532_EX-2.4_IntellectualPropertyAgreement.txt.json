EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING THEIR EXECUTION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS TRANSACTION, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. THIS SECTION HAS BEEN FULLY DISCUSSED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES AND THESE PROVISIONS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY EXCEPTIONS.",

THIS SECTION HAS BEEN FULLY DISCUSSED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES AND THESE PROVISIONS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY EXCEPTIONS.",
                "explanation": "The jury trial waiver has been moved from 'Dispute Resolution' to 'Group Members'. This is problematic because jury trial waivers should be conspicuously placed and easily found, usually near dispute resolution clauses, so that parties are aware of their rights. Placing it under 'Group Members' buries it in an irrelevant section, making it harder to find and thus potentially harder to enforce.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States law generally requires that jury trial waivers are knowing and voluntary, and are more likely to be enforced when conspicuous.",

Any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including to its execution, performance or enforcement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof. Each Party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction, forum and venue of any state or federal court sitting in New York City in the State of New York over any and all claims, disputes, controversies or disagreements between the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns under or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including their execution, performance or enforcement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise.

                "explanation": "The governing law and jurisdiction clause has been moved from the 'Miscellaneous' section to 'Recordation of Intellectual Property Rights Assignment Agreements' where it logically doesn't belong, thus making it harder to quickly ascertain the governing law. Courts expect these clauses to be clear and easily identifiable, and placing them in unexpected locations increases the risk of challenge.",
                "contradicted_law": "Standard contract law principles expect governing law clauses to be unambiguous and readily apparent within the contract.",

The warranty period for any item of Equipment and related Software shall be twelve (12) months from the date of delivery of such Equipment and related Software to Distributor as set forth in Paragraph 8.1 (hereinafter, this period of time shall be referred to as the \"Initial Warranty Period.\")\n\n14.3 Airspan's obligation and Distributor's sole remedy under this warranty are limited to the replacement or repair, at Airspan's option, of the defective Equipment or Software within the Initial Warranty Period. Airspan shall have no obligation to remedy any such defect if it can be shown that: (a) the Equipment or Software was altered, repaired, or reworked by any party other than Airspan without Airspan's prior written consent; (b) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's improper storage, mishandling, abuse, or misuse of the Equipment or Software; (c) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's use of the Equipment or Software in conjunction with equipment electronically or mechanically incompatible or of an inferior quality; or (d) the defect was the result of damage by fire, explosion, power failure, or any act of nature.\n\n14.4  In no event shall Airspan be obliged to provide on-site maintenance. Subject to the provisions of this warranty clause, defective parts or components must be returned by Distributor to Airspan's designated facility located within the contiguous 48 states in the United States, freight prepaid, within the Initial Warranty Period, and said defective parts will be repaired or replaced by Airspan at no charge to Distributor.

                "explanation": "Relocating the warranty clause to the 'Miscellaneous' section buries it within unrelated terms, making it less prominent and harder for the distributor to locate. This weakens its enforceability because it's not where one would reasonably expect to find warranty information. The warranty clause is no longer clearly defined under a dedicated section.",

If any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof is unable to be resolved by mutual agreement of the parties, each of the parties hereby (i) agrees that any action, suit or proceeding with respect to this Agreement against it or its properties or revenues must be brought exclusively in the federal and state courts siting in Minneapolis, MN, and (ii) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such court and any appellate court from any order or judgment thereof in any such action, suit or proceeding.  The parties hereby irrevocably agree that all claims in respect of such action, suit or proceeding may be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent they may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action, suit or proceeding.

                "explanation": "Moving the dispute resolution clause to section 1.4 and deleting 'by mutual agreement of the parties' introduces ambiguity and undermines enforceability. The absence of a clearly defined method for dispute resolution creates uncertainty, making it difficult to enforce because the process is not clearly outlined or agreed upon. By taking out 'by mutual agreement of the parties' in section 21.5, it contradicts itself. It does not specify who will come to an agreement on how a dispute will be resolved.",

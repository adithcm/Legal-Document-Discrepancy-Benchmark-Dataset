                "original_text": "The parties waive their rights to seek remedies in court (except where the relief sought is an injunction or other equitable relief), including any right to a jury trial. Except in a case where the relief sought is an injunction or other equitable relief, the parties agree that any dispute between the parties arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement, whether characterized or sounding in contract or tort or otherwise, shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. The arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles, California, USA. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own expenses of the arbitration, but the arbitration fees and costs shall be borne equally between the parties participating in the arbitration. Disputes shall not be resolved in any other forum or venue.",
                "changed_text": "The parties agree that any dispute between the parties arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement, whether characterized or sounding in contract or tort or otherwise, shall be resolved through a method agreed to by both parties. The parties waive their rights to seek remedies in court (except where the relief sought is an injunction or other equitable relief), including any right to a jury trial. If the parties are unable to agree to a resolution method, then the disputes shall be handled through binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. The arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles, California, USA. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own expenses of the arbitration, but the arbitration fees and costs shall be borne equally between the parties participating in the arbitration. Disputes shall not be resolved in any other forum or venue.",
                "explanation": "The clause now states that disputes shall be resolved through a method agreed by both parties. If the parties can't agree, then arbitration is required. This introduces an ambiguity, the change weakens the mandatory arbitration clause by inserting an initial step of 'mutual agreement' which undermines the original intent for disputes to be resolved exclusively through arbitration. It makes the enforceability of the arbitration clause difficult.",

                "original_text": "STAAR informs Distributor that Sections 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 above are requirements of the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC), and that non-compliance by Distributor of these Sections will constitute grounds for STAAR to immediately cease supply of Products to Distributor and will be deemed a failure by Distributor to perform a material obligation, warranty, duty or responsibility hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "STAAR informs Distributor that Sections 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 above are not requirements of the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC). Distributor's failure to perform any of these obligations will be deemed a failure to perform a material obligation, warranty, duty or responsibility hereunder.",
                "explanation": "The statement explicitly denies the connection to the Medical Device Directive, potentially weakening the clause's legal weight. By saying that Sections 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 are not requirements of the Medical Device Directive, the distributor could argue that these sections are not vital to compliance and thus, non-compliance may not be a material breach. This contradicts the purpose of the original clause which was to emphasize the importance of these sections by directly linking them to the Medical Device Directive.",

                "explanation": "The statement explicitly removes the warrant that the distributor will comply with Data Protection Laws. By removing 'Data Protection Laws,' the clause no longer explicitly warrants compliance with those laws, making it less clear that the Distributor is legally responsible for adhering to them. This could reduce the legal protection for data subjects and weaken the enforceability of the data protection provisions. By reducing that part, the statement is now easier to violate and harder to comply with legal regulations.",

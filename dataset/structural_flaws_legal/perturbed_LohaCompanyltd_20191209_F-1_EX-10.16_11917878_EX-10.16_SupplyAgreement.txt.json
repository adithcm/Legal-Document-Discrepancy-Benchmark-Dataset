The Sellers, in accordance with the Buyers' claim, shall be responsible for the immediate elimination of the defect(s), complete or partial replacement of the commodity or shall devaluate the commodity according to the state of defect(s).

                "explanation": "The added phrase 'However, if the goods have already been sold on, the sellers will have no obligations to replace' creates a significant loophole. It contradicts the previous stipulations that the sellers are responsible for replacement or compensation, potentially shielding the sellers from liability if the buyers resold the goods even if the defects were present upon original delivery. This undermines the buyer's claim rights.",

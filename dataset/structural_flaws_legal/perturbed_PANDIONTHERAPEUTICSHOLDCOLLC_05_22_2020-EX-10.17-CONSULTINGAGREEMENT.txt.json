                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding which state's laws apply to the entire agreement. While Massachusetts law is initially specified, an exception is carved out for intellectual property matters, designating Delaware law instead. This is problematic because intellectual property provisions are woven throughout the agreement and makes the governing law uncertain.",

The Consultant hereby assigns to the Company all Inventions and any and all related patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, and other industrial and intellectual property rights and applications therefor, in the United States and elsewhere and appoints any officer of the Company as Consultant's duly authorized attorney to execute, file, prosecute and protect the same before any government agency, court or authority. However, this paragraph shall not apply to Inventions which do not relate to the business or research and development conducted or planned to be conducted by the Company at the time such Invention is created, made, conceived or reduced to practice and which are made and conceived by the Consultant not during normal working hours, not on the Company's premises and not using the Company's tools, devices, equipment or Proprietary Information. The Consultant further acknowledges that each original work of authorship which is made by the Consultant (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of this Agreement and which is protectable by copyright is a \"work made for hire,\" as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'except for those created outside of working hours' after stating that all inventions shall be the property of the company creates a contradiction. The original clause states an assignment of ALL inventions, but the added phrase and the subsequent paragraph carve out exceptions, leading to uncertainty about ownership.",

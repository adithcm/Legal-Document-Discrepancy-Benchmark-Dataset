ARBITRATION\n22. 1. 1 Should any dispute of whatever nature arise between the parties, then any and all disputes shall be submitted to and decided by arbitration. Any such arbitration (\"the arbitration\") will be governed by the provisions of this clause 22.\n22. 2 Subject to the other provisions of this agreement specifically providing for the resolution of any dispute, where any dispute, disagreement, or claim arises between the parties (called here after the dispute) concerning this agreement, the parties shall try to resolve the dispute by negotiation. This entails that the one party - 43 - TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01 invites the other in writing (providing details of the dispute) to meet and to attempt to resolve the dispute within 7 (seven) days from the date of the written invitation. Should the dispute not be resolved in this manner, the dispute will go to arbitration.\n22. 3 The arbitration shall be held informally in Johannesburg or such other place agreed upon by the parties and in accordance with the rules of the Arbitration Foundation of Southern Africa, it being the intention of the parties that, as far as possible, the arbitration shall be concluded within 21 days after it has been demanded.\n22. 3 The arbitrator shall be a person agreed upon by the parties or, failing such agreement, by the chairperson of AFSA. The arbitrator shall be empowered to appoint such assistants as he deems fit in the event of the subject matter of the dispute requiring expertise in any particular field for its proper resolution.\n22. 4 Unless the parties otherwise agree, the arbitrator's award shall be in writing, and shall be final and binding upon the parties and at the notice of either party, be capable of being made an order of a competent court.\n22. 5 No provision in this arbitration clause shall be taken as prohibiting the rights of either party to approach the appropriate court for the purposes of any interim or interdictory relief.",

                "explanation": "The alteration introduces ambiguity and potential contradiction regarding the dispute resolution mechanism. The original clause mandates arbitration for all disputes. However, the modified clause introduces the concept of resolving disputes through a mutually agreed-upon method, which contradicts the original mandatory arbitration requirement. The clause mentions it would go to arbitration depending on the party's decision, leading to a question of whether it goes to arbitration or to another method.",

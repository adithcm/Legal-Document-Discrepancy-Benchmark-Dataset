                "changed_text": "(xxxix) Purchaser and its designees are granted derivative standing to pursue the Avoidance Actions (subject to section 11.2(f) below) and Other Causes of Action in the name of and/or on behalf of Merchant;\n(xxiii) Agent, as the exclusive agent for Merchant, is authorized to conduct, advertise, post signs, utilize sign-walkers, and otherwise promote the GOB Sale as a “store closing”, in accordance with the Sale Guidelines (as the same may be modified and approved by the Bankruptcy Court), subject to compliance with the Sale Guidelines, the Approval Order, and all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances, including, without limitation, all laws and regulations relating to privacy and consumer protection, occupational health and safety and the environment, together with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and",
                "explanation": "By moving the authorization to conduct \"going out of business,\" \"sale on everything,\" \"everything must go\" sales away from the original section, it obscures the Agent's explicit right to advertise with those specific terms. This relocation introduces contradiction: originally the Agent has authorization for those sales, but now it only indicates \"store closing\".",

Thereafter, Agent shall have no obligation to accept Gift Certificates. Agent's acceptance of Gift Certificates shall not impact the Wind-Down Budget or the Wind-Down Cap.",
                "explanation": "By removing the timeframe limitation for gift card acceptance, this implies that the Agent has no limitations on when to accept merchant gift certificates, or gift cards. This induces contradiction, as the original terms specifically mention that they are to be valid for only 10 days, but by having no timeframe it induces doubt.",

                "explanation": "Removing “at Agent's expense” from the original text implies that any costs incurred by the Merchant for insuring the Additional Agent Merchandise, including filing proofs of loss, would be on Merchant.

GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION\n\nThis Agreement shall be governed by, and its provisions enforced in accordance with, the laws of California without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws. If a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a single arbitrator (who shall be a lawyer not employed by or associated with either party to this Agreement) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. All such arbitration shall take place at the office of the American Arbitration Association located within 225 miles of Hayward, California. Each party is entitled to depose one fact witness and all expert witnesses retained by the other party, and to conduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate. The award or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court.",

Accordingly, in case of any question with respect to the construction of this Agreement, it is to be construed as though such section headings had been omitted.

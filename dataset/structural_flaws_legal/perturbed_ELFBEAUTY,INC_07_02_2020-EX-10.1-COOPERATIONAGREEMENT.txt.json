(i) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed within that state, without giving effect to any law or principals of law that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. (ii) Each Party (A) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery or other federal or state courts of the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (C) agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery or other federal or state courts of the State of Delaware, and each Party irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury and (D) irrevocably consents to service of process by a reputable overnight mail delivery service, signature requested, to the address of such Party's principal place of business or as otherwise provided by applicable law.",

Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process by a reputable overnight mail delivery service, signature requested, to the address of such Party's principal place of business or as otherwise provided by applicable law.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Delaware courts as the exclusive venue for disputes. By adding a clause that the Parties can mutually agree that another court could be used to settle any dispute introduces contradictionâ€”the first part states Delaware court is mandatory, but the latter part allows for 'mutual agreement' on another court. This contradicts the original clause's strict Delaware court requirement, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

Moreover, in the event of the breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, timeliness in obtaining relief is of the essence.",

                "explanation": "The added phrase \"however, this does not limit either party from seeking monetary damages\" introduces a contradiction because the original clause focuses solely on injunctive relief.

                "explanation": "The initial clause states a straightforward reimbursement of expenses up to $250,000. The appended clause giving the company 'the right to re-evaluate and reimburse accordingly depending on the result of the internal review' introduces uncertainty. This new clause contradicts the original agreement by suggesting that the company's internal review can alter the reimbursement amount. ",

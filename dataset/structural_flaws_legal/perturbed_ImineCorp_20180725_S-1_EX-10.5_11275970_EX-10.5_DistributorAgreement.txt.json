                "explanation": "Moving the entire warranty disclaimer section into a general section makes it less prominent and harder for the distributor to readily identify and understand the warranty terms (or lack thereof). Warranty disclaimers are typically expected in a dedicated warranty section, not buried within general provisions. This reduces its enforceability because it would be more difficult to prove that the distributor was fairly notified of the disclaimer. Moving this section to General requires the user to apply additional scrutiny to the general section of the document.",

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed pursuant to the laws of the State of Indiana, U.S.A., without reference to principals of conflicts of laws. All disputes arising out of this shall be settled by final binding arbitration in Hamilton County, Indiana, pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in Hamilton County, Indiana, U.S.A., for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, without breach of this arbitration agreement and without any abridgment of the powers of the arbitrators, and agree that such courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any such action.",
                "changed_text": "8.5 Use of Trade Names. The Distributor will present and promote the sale of the Products fairly. The Distributor may use JRVS's product names in the Distributor's advertising and promotional media provided (i) that the Distributor conspicuously indicates in all such media that such names are trademarks of JRVS and (ii) that the Distributor submits all such media to JRVS for prior approval and complies with the requirements set forth in Section 8.4. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Distributor will immediately cease all use of Products' names and JRVS Trademarks and, at the Distributor's election, destroy or deliver to JRVS all materials in the Distributor's control or possession which bear such names and trademarks, including any sales literature. The Distributor will not challenge any intellectual property rights claimed by JRVS in such trademarks.\n8.6 Choice of Law; Dispute Resolution. The agreement shall be governed by the laws of Indiana unless the distributor feels that Taiwan is a more appropriate venue. All disputes arising out of this shall be settled by final binding arbitration in whatever location the distributor is most comfortable with. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in Hamilton County, Indiana, U.S.A., for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, without breach of this arbitration agreement and without any abridgment of the powers of the arbitrators, and agree that such courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any such action.",
                "explanation": "Moving the choice of law to 'Use of Trade Names' greatly affects the legal standing. Choice of Law should have its own section or a section that's directly related to dispute resolution. By placing it here, it indicates that it is not of much importance and can possibly get lost when reviewing the legal contract. Furthermore, the dispute resolution has been altered to include \"unless the distributor feels that Taiwan is a more appropriate venue\", giving the distributor a way out of the Choice of Law.\n",

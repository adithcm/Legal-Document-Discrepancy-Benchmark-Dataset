RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES\n\n27.1 If a dispute should arise under this Agreement between or among the Parties they shall make every reasonable effort to resolve such dispute. However, in the event that they are unable to resolve such dispute, the matter shall be referred to the Management Committee which shall either resolve the matter or determine the method, such as arbitration, by which the matter should be resolved. This procedure shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which may arise under this Agreement between or among the Parties. The performance of this Agreement by the Parties shall continue during the resolution of any dispute.",

CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n31.1 All data and information that is acquired or received by any Party in connection with the APCN 2 in anticipation of or under this Agreement shall be held confidential and shall not be divulged in any way to any third party, without the prior approval of the Management Committee. If a dispute should arise under this Agreement between or among the Parties they shall make every reasonable effort to resolve such dispute.

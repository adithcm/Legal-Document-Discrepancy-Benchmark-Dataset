                "explanation": "By inserting a clause stating that 'arbitration is not required,' the original intent of binding arbitration is undermined, potentially conflicting with standard legal practice which holds that binding arbitration must be unequivocally stated and agreed upon.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Receiving Party will immediately destroy or erase all copies of documents or materials containing any Confidential Information provided by Disclosing Party and, upon the Disclosing Party's request, promptly confirm destruction of same by signing and returning to the Disclosing Party a certificate of destruction reasonably satisfactory to the Disclosing Party.",

                "explanation": "The change in wording regarding the measures to preserve confidentiality introduces a contradiction. Originally, the measures were to be 'no less than the measures taken by the Receiving Party', now, it states it should be 'less than the measures taken by the Receiving Party'. This weakens the obligation to protect confidential information, and destroys the clause regarding destruction of confidential information",

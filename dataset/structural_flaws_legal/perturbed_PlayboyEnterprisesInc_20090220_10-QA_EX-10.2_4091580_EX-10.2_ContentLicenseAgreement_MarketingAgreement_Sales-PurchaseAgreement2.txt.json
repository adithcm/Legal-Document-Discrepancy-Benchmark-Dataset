                "changed_text": "4. Playboy is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Contract.\n\n5. This Contract, when attached to a purchase order, shall consist of the entire agreement between the parties and shall  supersede any conflicting or contrary terms and conditions of any purchase order or other order form whether supplied  by Purchaser or Supplier.\n\n6. This Contract may not be modified or terminated except in writing, and no claimed modification, termination or waiver  shall be binding unless also signed by an authorized representative of Playboy.\n\n7. Violation of this agreement by supplier may result in prosecution for Playboy properties infringement, unfair competition and other causes of action; however, the supplier may not be prosecuted.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states the possibility of prosecution for violations. The modified clause introduces a contradiction by stating that while prosecution may result, the supplier 'may not be prosecuted,' creating ambiguity and weakening the enforceability of the agreement regarding intellectual property rights and potential penalties.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'unless supplier can demonstrate that the defect wasn't their fault', we create an exception to the indemnification clause that weakens the protection afforded to Playboy and the Purchaser. It introduces ambiguity about when and how the supplier can avoid liability, potentially leading to disputes and making the clause less enforceable.",

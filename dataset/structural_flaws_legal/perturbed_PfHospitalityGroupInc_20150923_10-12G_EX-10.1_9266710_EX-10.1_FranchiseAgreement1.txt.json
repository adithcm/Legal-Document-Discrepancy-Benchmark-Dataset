Except as otherwise provided in Section 25.7 [Remedies Not Exclusive] below, any controversy or claim arising between us will first be submitted to non-binding mediation administered by an established, neutral mediation service with experience in franchise disputes. Both parties must sign a confidentiality agreement before participating in any mediation proceeding. The mediation will take place in the city where our principal offices are located at the time the demand for mediation is filed. Once either party has submitted a dispute to mediation, the obligation to attend will be binding on both parties. Each party will bear its own costs with respect to the mediation. The fee for the mediation, however, will be split equally.",

                "original_text": "20. Governing Law\n     A) This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA without regard to conflict of\n laws principles.",
                "changed_text": "7. Demonstration Equipment\n     A) The Distributor agrees to purchase demonstration products as new products are released subject to special pricing. The Distributor agrees to\nuse the demonstration equipment for the duties as noted in 5 A, B, C, D as above and not to re-sell this demonstration equipment to End Users. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of a mutually agreed-upon state, USA without regard to conflict of\nlaws principles.",
                "explanation": "The governing law clause is moved from a clearly labeled section to the 'Demonstration Equipment' section, where it is less likely to be noticed. Furthermore, the governing law has been changed from 'New York' to 'a mutually agreed-upon state', introducing ambiguity and potential for future disputes over jurisdiction. This reduces the enforceability of the original clause.",

                "changed_text": "4. Territory\n     A) The Distributor is appointed as an exclusive Distributor within the following territories: [*]. The Distributor agrees to abide by vague payment terms. \n     B) The Distributor agrees to act as a Distributor for Lucid within the above Territories and not to solicit any sales of the Product(s) outside the\nabove Territories.",
                "explanation": "The specific payment terms detailing the letter of credit requirement is moved to the 'Territory' section and diluted by the usage of the phrase 'vague payment terms'. This obfuscates the financial obligations of the distributor, making enforcement of the original payment terms difficult as it would now be considered an optional agreement. This creates uncertainty regarding payment obligations.",

TERMINATION\n     A) Either party may terminate this agreement by giving written Notice to the other party if:\n     i) The other party fails to perform or satisfy any of the conditions, covenants or obligations of this Agreement.\n ii) The other party files or has filed against it, a petition seeking relief under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganisation, moratorium, liquidation or\nsimilar law affecting creditors' rights\n     B) In addition, Lucid may terminate this agreement by giving the Distributor Written Notice if there is any change of control, ownership or\nmanagement of the Distributor.\n     C) Either party may terminate this agreement by providing Ninety days Written Notice.",
                "changed_text": "11. Intellectual Property\n     A) Lucid is the sole owner of all trademark symbols and logos under which the products will be sold. Lucid agrees that the Distributor may use the\nappropriate trademarks to promote the sale of products in the Territory. Such use is only with Lucid's permission and must be related to the sale of\nLucid products. The Distributor acquires no rights to Lucid trademarks by selling Lucid products. The Distributor may not use Lucid trademarks,\nsymbols or logos as part of its business or corporate names. \n Termination can be done by the will of both parties. \n     B) The Distributor will assist Lucid in protecting Lucid's patents, copyright, trademarks and logos. The Distributor will inform Lucid of any known\nor suspected violations of Lucid's patents, copyright, trademarks, symbols and logos. If Lucid requests, the Distributor will assist in protecting\nsuch intellectual property from infringement.",
                "explanation": "The detailed termination clause is moved from its dedicated section to the 'Intellectual Property' section, and is further obfuscated by the phrase 'Termination can be done by the will of both parties'. This change removes the specific conditions and notice periods for termination, replacing them with an ambiguous statement. This contradicts the detailed terms and limits the party's rights.",

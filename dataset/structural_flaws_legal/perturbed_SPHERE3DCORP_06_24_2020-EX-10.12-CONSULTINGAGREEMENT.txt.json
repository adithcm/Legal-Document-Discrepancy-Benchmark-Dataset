Any disputes under this Consulting Agreement shall be resolved by appropriate proceedings in the state of New York.",
                "changed_text": "This Consulting Agreement shall be governed by, and construed pursuant to the laws of the State of New York, applicable to agreements made and performed wholly within such State. Any disputes under this Consulting Agreement shall be resolved by mutual agreement between both parties and appropriate proceedings in the state of New York.",
                "explanation": "The restructuring of the sentence introduces contradictionâ€”the first part states the disputes shall be resolved by the state of New York but also states that mutual agreement between parties is acceptable. This contradicts the original clause's strict law requirement, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless otherwise notified' creates ambiguity and potential contradiction. The original clause is a clear and unambiguous statement about the consultant's tax status. The modification introduces an exception that undermines the certainty of the original statement.",

                "explanation": "The inclusion of 'with a possible revision based on company performance' directly contradicts the 'vest immediately' clause, creating a legal uncertainty. The original RSA vests immediately, but the addition introduces potential alterations based on performance, making the vesting unclear.",

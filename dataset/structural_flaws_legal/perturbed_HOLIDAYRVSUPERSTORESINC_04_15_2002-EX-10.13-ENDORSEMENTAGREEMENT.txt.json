                "explanation": "The governing law clause originally specifies California law. By changing it to Delaware law creates a contradiction since company Holiday RV Superstores, Inc. is a Delaware corporation but has principal office in Florida. This may create ambiguity about which state's laws apply, potentially impacting the enforceability of the contract.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows the prevailing party to recover attorneys' fees. The modified clause contradicts this by stating each party bears their own costs unless otherwise agreed. This introduces a contradiction, making it unclear whether attorneys' fees can be recovered, and weakens the incentive to enforce the agreement.",

This Agreement may not be modified except in a writing signed by one of the Parties.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires a writing signed by both Parties to modify the agreement. The modification introduces a contradiction which states that the Agreement can be modified with a writing signed by one of the Parties. This creates contradiction that may make this agreement difficult to enforce.",

                "explanation": "The original text places the limitation of liability and warranty disclaimers in a clearly labeled and separate section. Moving the crucial first sentence of limitation of liability to the end of section H, with the remaining text in section G makes the provision less conspicuous and harder to find, as individuals are less likely to expect such clauses to be embedded within seemingly unrelated sections like 'Governing Law'. This placement obscures the explicit disclaimer of warranties, potentially undermining its enforceability. The modified text buries the key sentence concerning liability within unrelated clauses, making it less prominent and more difficult to locate quickly.",

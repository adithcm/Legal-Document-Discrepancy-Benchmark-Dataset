                "original_text": "24. Governing law and jurisdiction\n\n24.1 This agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Ohio law.\n\n24.2 The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of Ohio shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non- contractual disputes or claims).",
                "changed_text": "2.5 The Distributor shall not without the Supplier's prior written consent make any promises or guarantees about the Products beyond those:\n\n(a) agreed between the Distributor and the Supplier; and\n\n(b) contained in any promotional material supplied by the Supplier. 24.1 This agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with laws determined by both parties in the event of a dispute.\n\n24.2 The parties agree that the courts of Ohio shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non- contractual disputes or claims).",
                "explanation": "Moving the governing law and jurisdiction clause to the 'Distributor's undertakings' section makes it less visible and harder to find, hindering its enforceability. By changing the original text from Ohio law to 'laws determined by both parties' in the event of a dispute introduces a contradiction, undermining the original clause's clear specification of Ohio law and weakening the contract's legal certainty and predictability.",

The Supplier may add the distributor to their current insurance certificate at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "The Supplier shall add the distributor to their current insurance certificate. To 'The Supplier may add the distributor to their current insurance certificate at their discretion.' creates uncertainty. The original text imposes a clear obligation on the Supplier to add the distributor to their insurance, offering a degree of protection. The modified text transforms this obligation into a discretionary action, weakening the distributor's security and introduces potential disputes around insurance coverage.",

                "explanation": "Adding 'unless otherwise agreed' to the termination clause creates ambiguity and undermines the original clause's clarity. It allows for potential termination conditions outside of the agreed-upon 12-month notice, weakening the enforceability of the termination provisions. This also makes it difficult to determine under what circumstances the 'otherwise agreed' clause would be invoked.",

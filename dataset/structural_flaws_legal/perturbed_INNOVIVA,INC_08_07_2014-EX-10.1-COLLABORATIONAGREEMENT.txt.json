This Agreement shall be construed, and the respective rights of the Parties determined, according to the substantive law of the State of Delaware notwithstanding the provisions governing conflict of laws under such Delaware law to the contrary, except matters of intellectual property law which shall be determined in accordance with the intellectual property laws relevant to the intellectual property in question.",

This Agreement shall be construed, and the respective rights of the Parties determined, according to the substantive law of the State of Delaware notwithstanding the provisions governing conflict of laws under such Delaware law to the contrary, except matters of intellectual property law which shall be determined in accordance with mutually agreed terms rather than the intellectual property laws relevant to the intellectual property in question.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by stating that intellectual property law will be decided based on 'mutually agreed terms' instead of relevant legal statutes. This weakens the enforceability of IP protections.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'must be' to 'may be' removes mandatory written communication, allowing for less traceable oral agreements. It is moved to the general section.",

This Agreement may be altered, amended or changed only after written and signed acknowledgement from an external mediator.",

The alteration of the “amended or changed only by a writing” clause introduces an external entity, potentially slowing the rate at which changes can be made. ",

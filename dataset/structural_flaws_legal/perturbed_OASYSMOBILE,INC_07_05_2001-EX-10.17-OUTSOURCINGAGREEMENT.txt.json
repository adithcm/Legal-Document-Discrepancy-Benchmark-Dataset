                "changed_text": "All payments made hereunder are non-cancelable and non-refundable, unless otherwise specified by a court of law.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless otherwise specified by a court of law' creates a legal contradiction. The original clause states that all payments are non-cancelable and non-refundable. The added phrase introduces an exception, allowing a court to order cancellation or refund, thus directly contradicting the initial statement. This undermines the enforceability of the non-cancelable and non-refundable provision.",

E.piphany will reimburse HSNS's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such assistance.",
                "changed_text": "E.piphany will defend or, at its option, settle a claim brought against HSNS that the Application, as used within the scope of this Agreement, infringes a U.S. copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret, and indemnify HSNS against all damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be assessed in any such claim. However, if HSNS delays notifying E.piphany, E.piphany's liability for damages will be at their own discretion.",
                "explanation": "By adding the sentence, 'However, if HSNS delays notifying E.piphany, E.piphany's liability for damages will be at their own discretion,' a contradiction is created. Initially, E.piphany agrees to defend and indemnify HSNS against infringement claims. The added sentence introduces uncertainty regarding the extent of E.piphany's liability in case of delayed notification. It enables them to take on a defensive approach.",

Any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be instituted in a state or federal court in San Francisco or San Mateo County, California, and each party hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.",

Any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be instituted in a state or federal court in San Francisco or San Mateo County, California, unless the defendant is outside of those respective states.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the governing law and jurisdiction clauses. Initially, the agreement states that California law governs and legal actions must be in San Francisco or San Mateo County, California. The modification allows for the agreement to instead resolve in the defendant's state, creating an element of subjectivity.",

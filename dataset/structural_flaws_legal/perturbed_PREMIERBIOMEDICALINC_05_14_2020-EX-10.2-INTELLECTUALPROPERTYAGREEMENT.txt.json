This Agreement and the rights of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania including all matters of construction, validity, performance, and enforcement and without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws. Venue for any action brought under this Agreement shall be in the appropriate court in Mercer County, Pennsylvania.",

This Agreement and the rights of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania including all matters of construction, validity, performance, and enforcement and without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws. Venue for any action brought under this Agreement shall be determined at the sole discretion of Marv Enterprises, LLC.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies venue in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, providing a clear and predictable location for dispute resolution. The modified clause contradicts this by granting Marv Enterprises, LLC sole discretion to determine venue. This undermines the original venue clause, creating uncertainty and potentially allowing Marv to choose a venue inconvenient or biased against the other parties. Parties would reasonably expect that the venue is clearly defined.",

To the extent that terms in the 2010 Agreement/2020 Agreement are not contradicted or revised here, the terms as stated in 2010 Agreement/2020 Agreement remain in full effect, are controlling, and apply to THI licensing of the Applications in Appendix A and the Licensed Products derived therefrom.",

To the extent that terms in the 2010 Agreement/2020 Agreement are not contradicted or revised here, the terms as stated in 2010 Agreement/2020 Agreement remain in full effect unless those terms are found to be unfair or commercially unviable as determined solely by Premier Biomedical, Inc., are controlling, and apply to THI licensing of the Applications in Appendix A and the Licensed Products derived therefrom.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a significant element of uncertainty into the licensing agreement. While the original clause states that the terms of the 2010/2020 agreements remain in full effect, the modified version adds an exception: those terms can be disregarded if Premier Biomedical, Inc. deems them 'unfair or commercially unviable.' Because the sole discretion of determining unfairness lies with Premier, this creates a serious power imbalance and calls into question the enforceability of the original agreements terms. Parties reasonably expect that their prior contract agreement is honored to a degree.",

Marv shall be reimbursed for the cost(s) of all legal expenses associated with this agreement by THI, though reimbursement is contingent upon the overall profitability of the Joint Venture, as determined at the sole discretion of THI.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that THI will reimburse Marv for legal expenses. The modified version adds a contingency: reimbursement depends on the Joint Venture's profitability, as determined solely by THI. This introduces uncertainty and gives THI control over whether Marv is actually reimbursed. THI now has the power to avoid paying legal expenses by claiming the Joint Venture is not profitable, undermining the original reimbursement agreement. Parties can expect legal fee responsibility to be clear and not nebulous.",

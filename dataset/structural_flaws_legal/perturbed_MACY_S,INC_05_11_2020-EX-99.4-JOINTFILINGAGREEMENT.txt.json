                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to consider joint filing with each of the Reporting Persons (as such term is defined in the Schedule 13D referred to below) on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13D (including amendments thereto and statements on Schedule 13G) with respect to the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Macy's, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and that this agreement may be considered as an exhibit to such filing.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states agreement to joint filing. The modified text weakens this to 'agree to consider' and 'may be considered', creating ambiguity as to the commitment to joint filing, potentially hindering enforcement of SEC regulations mandating such filings.",

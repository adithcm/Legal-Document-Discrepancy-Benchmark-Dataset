                "changed_text": "Sabco shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Prolong, its officers, directors, employees and representatives only for direct damages, excluding any consequential or punitive damages, arising directly from Sabco's gross negligence. This indemnification shall not extend to claims arising from the inherent risks of motorsport activities.",
                "explanation": "The modified text significantly limits the scope of Sabco's indemnification obligations. By excluding consequential and punitive damages and limiting it to gross negligence, Prolong's protection is reduced. Furthermore, excluding inherent motorsport risks weakens the protection, creating uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "Prolong shall indemnify Sabco for claims arising directly from use of Prolong's logos or designs, provided Sabco uses said logos and designs exactly as provided and without modification. Prolong is not responsible for indemnifying Sabco for any other reason, including claims against Prolong's products due to product liability.",
                "explanation": "The revised clause adds a condition that indemnification for logo/design use only applies if Sabco uses them exactly as provided, potentially leading to dispute over minor alterations. Additionally, the explicit exclusion of product liability claims creates uncertainty and drastically reduces Prolong's exposure, which is normally part of the contract.",

While both parties acknowledge the laws of North Carolina, the final determination of applicable law rests with mutual agreement in the case of any dispute.",
                "explanation": "The revision replaces North Carolina law with 'principles of equity and fairness, as determined by the parties', making the governing law ambiguous and unenforceable. The acknowledgement of North Carolina law is immediately contradicted by allowing a later 'mutual agreement', leading to confusion.",

Arbitration\n   Any and all disputes or controversies between the Parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce; provided, a Party may seek a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other provisional judicial relief if in its judgment such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status quo. Despite any such action for provisional relief, the Parties will continue to participate in good faith in the procedures specified in this Section 16. Each Party shall appoint one arbitrator who shall mutually appoint a third arbitrator who shall be the sole arbitrator for the proceeding. The arbitration shall be held, and any award shall be rendered, in Paris (France), in the English language. The award may include reimbursement of the costs of the arbitration (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney fees) to the prevailing Party or a portion of such costs as determined by the arbitrator. An award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause to the 'Payment of Expenses' section makes it less noticeable and harder to find. Arbitration clauses are typically expected in a 'Dispute Resolution' or similar section, so placing it elsewhere creates a structural flaw.",

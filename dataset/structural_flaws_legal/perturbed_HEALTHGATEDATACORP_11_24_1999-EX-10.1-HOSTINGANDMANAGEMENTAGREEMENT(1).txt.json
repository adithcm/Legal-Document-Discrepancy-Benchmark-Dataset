However, compliance will be subject to internal reviews, but compliance cannot be guaranteed. Both parties agree to indemnify each other in respect of       any unauthorised disclosure of data by them.",
                "explanation": "A clause mandating compliance with the Data Protection Act and EU Data Protection Directive is moved to an irrelevant section, 'Content Management'. The additional clause 'However, compliance will be subject to internal reviews, but compliance cannot be guaranteed' creates ambiguity and undermines the initial compliance statement, making the obligation less clear and enforceable.",

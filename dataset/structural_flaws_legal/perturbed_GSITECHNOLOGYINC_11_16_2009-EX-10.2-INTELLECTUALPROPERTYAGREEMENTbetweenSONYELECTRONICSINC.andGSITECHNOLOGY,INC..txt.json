                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states California law governs the agreement. Moving it to section 5.5 (JTAG / Mask Works) is illogical. By moving the governing law clause to the JTAG section and also adding 'the rules and substantive Laws of another jurisdiction, by mutual consent' will confuse what the valid rules for resolution are.",

The Parties hereby agree that all disputes related to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration pursuant to  the rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association.

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates arbitration, which is standard. The modified clause contradicts itself by stating that all disputes shall be settled by 'a mutually agreed upon method.' This creates ambiguity and contradicts the original intent of mandatory arbitration, making enforcement unclear and potentially unenforceable.",

In addition, any stock certificate representing such shares shall  contain the restrictive legend set for on Schedule A may not be sold, transferred or hypothecated unless such transfer is pursuant to an effective  registration statement or an exemption from such registration as verified by an opinion of counsel acceptable to Bizzingo.\n\n\n  With a copy to:   Daniel H.

Theismann or his representatives, at his cost and expense, shall have the right, upon reasonable notice and during  normal business hours, to inspect Bizzingo's books and records and all other documents and material in Bizzingo's possession or control with  respect to the determination of Royalties payable hereunder. Theismann shall have free and full access thereto for such purposes and may make  copies thereof.\n\n All books and records relative to Bizzingo's obligations hereunder shall be maintained and made accessible to Theismann for inspection at a  location in the United States for at least one year after termination of this Agreement. \n\n8. RESTRICTED STOCK, RISK OF INVESTMENT, AND INVESTMENT INTENT.\n  (a). Theismann acknowledges that the Royalty Warrant and Bonus Warrant and the shares of common stock of Bizzingo underlying such warrants  are securities.

                "explanation": "I've relocated the disclosure about restricted stock to a section regarding inspection and audit rights, where it doesn't logically belong. Additionally, I've negated the protective clauses around the stock by stating the stock 'may be sold, transferred or hypothecated without restrictions'. This directly contradicts securities regulations, which requires restricted stock to have limitations on transferability unless specific conditions are met.",

(a). Bizzingo will acquire basic business information for a prospective user of the Network, which will include all or part of the following; business\nname and address, telephone number, email address or website. This basic business information will be acquired through (i) arrangements with\nspecific groups, clubs, networks, or associations, such as Chambers of Commerce, Universities, or trade organization, to acquire member\ninformation, or (ii) through purchase or license arrangements with content providers. In either case, once Bizzingo obtains information for a\nspecific user, it will use that information to create or seed a separate user profile in its database for that prospective user (\"Seeded Profile\"). As of\nthe date of this Agreement, Bizzingo has arrangements with content providers and associations to provide the basic business information for over\n6,000,000 prospective users which will be seeded by Bizzingo. For clarification purposes, at this point in the process, a Seeded Profile is not an\n\"Activated User.\"\n(b). In order to activate a Seeded Profile, Bizzingo will contact a prospective user informing them of the existence of their Seeded Profile on the\nNetwork, and the prospective user is then required to: (i) search and locate the Bizzingo database for its Seeded Profile and (ii) claim the Seeded\nProfile by editing or adding content to the Seeded Profile. Once the steps set forth in the immediately preceding sentence has been completed by a\nuser, that user will be deemed to be an \"Activated User\" and the Network will identify that user as an Activated User.\nMethod 2. A prospective user independently (from Method 1) may create its own user profile on the Network. This user will be deemed an\nActivated User and the Network will identify that user as an \"Activated User.\"",
                "changed_text": "19. CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENT. Concurrent with the execution of this agreement, the parties will execute a  mutually acceptable Confidentiality and Non-Disparagement Agreement.\n\nSCHEDULE A\n (Attached to and made a part of the Celebrity Endorsement Agreement\n dated March 14, 2012 by and between Bizzingo, Inc. and\n Joseph Theismann)\n\nI Background\n\nBizzingo may acquire basic business information for a prospective user of the Network, which will include all or part of the following; business\nname and address, telephone number, email address or website. The business information will be acquired through purchase or license arrangements with content providers. In either case, once Bizzingo obtains information for a\nspecific user, it will use that information to create a user profile in its database for that prospective user. In order to activate a user profile, the user is not required to search and locate the Bizzingo database for its profile and claim the Profile by editing or adding content to the Profile.\nEach user will be deemed to be an Activated User.\nMethod 2. A prospective user independently (from Method 1) may create its own user profile on the Network. This user will be deemed an\nActivated User and the Network will identify that user as an \"Activated User.\"",
                "explanation": "The modification to the definition of 'Activated User' removes the requirement for users to claim their profiles, making the process automatic. This potentially violates privacy laws, as users are automatically enrolled and activated without their explicit consent. By burying it within the confidentiality section it has reduced its clarity and enforceability.",

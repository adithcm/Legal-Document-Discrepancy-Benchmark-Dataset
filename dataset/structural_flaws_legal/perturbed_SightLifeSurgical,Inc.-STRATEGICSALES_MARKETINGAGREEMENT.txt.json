                "original_text": "19. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding the choice of law rules, and the parties hereby agree to submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the State and Federal courts of the State of California, and agree that the State and Federal courts of the State of California shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of all disputes related to or arising out of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "10. Tax Indemnity. Surgical agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Imprimis from any and all claims or demands under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any state or local tax law or ordinance in respect of any failure of Imprimis to withhold income tax, FICA or any other tax from the Sales Commissions paid to Surgical, including any interest or penalties relating thereto and any costs or expenses incurred in defending such claims.\n\n19. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding the choice of law rules, and the parties hereby agree to submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the State and Federal courts of the State of Washington, and agree that the State and Federal courts of the State of Washington shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of all disputes related to or arising out of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The governing law clause specifies which jurisdiction's laws will be used to interpret the contract and where disputes will be resolved. By changing the jurisdiction from California to Delaware, and venue from California to Washington, this introduces uncertainty and potential conflicts, as the contract was originally intended to be interpreted under California law, given one party is in California. It also contradicts the initial statement declaring the contract under California Law. The contract has relationships with the locations of the organizations and would not expect the dispute to occur elsewhere. As well as relocation, there is now a governing law that is contradicted.",

If Surgical becomes aware that Surgical is or becomes the subject of any debarment or similar proceedings in any jurisdiction, then Surgical shall promptly notify Imprimis.",
                "changed_text": "7. Conflicts of Interest. 7.1. Surgical represents and warrants that Surgical is not under any pre-existing obligation in conflict or in any way inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. Surgical represents and warrants that Surgical's performance of all the terms of this Agreement will not (a) breach any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information acquired by Surgical in confidence or in trust prior to commencement of this Agreement, or (b) breach any other agreement with any third party. Surgical warrants that Surgical has the right to disclose and/or or use all ideas, processes, techniques and other information, if any, which Surgical has gained from third parties, and which Surgical discloses to Imprimis or uses in the course of performance of this Agreement, without liability to such third parties. Surgical represents and warrants that Surgical has not granted and will not grant any rights or licenses to any intellectual property or technology that would conflict with Surgical's obligations under this Agreement. Surgical will not knowingly infringe upon any copyright, patent, trade secret or other property right of any former client, employer or third party in the performance of the Services.\n\nSurgical hereby certifies that Surgical is not currently nor has been debarred by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pursuant to 21 USC ยง335a(a) or (b), or under any similar law or regulation by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency or any other national or regulatory authority or agency. Surgical does not need to inform Imprimis if proceedings occur.",
                "explanation": "The debarment clause is a critical disclosure related to regulatory compliance, specifically concerning the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By moving this to Conflicts of Interest, it is obfuscated because it is not immediately clear that debarment could be a potential conflict. Furthermore, the clause that states that the company must inform Surgical if proceedings occur has been removed.",

                "explanation": "The indemnification clause is a key risk allocation provision. Moving it to the Publicity section and stating that Surgical only has to abide by this clause is very harmful. As the liability has become one-sided, it may be difficult to find as publicity is not correlated to legal obligation. The indemnification has become one-sided and only applied to Surgical now.",

Compensation; Expenses (a) As described in the Fund's Prospectus, the Fund may impose a sales charge \"load\" in connection with the purchase of shares of the Fund, a portion of which will be paid to S2K pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Prospectus. (b) In consideration of the marketing, sales and other related activities provided by S2K, the Distributor may compensate S2K for such services on each Fund's behalf and at the direction of each such Fund. The amount of compensation payable by the Distributor to S2K hereunder shall be determined on a class by class basis. At the direction of each Fund, ALPS or its designated agent will facilitate the payment of the applicable dealer reallowance fee to S2K in the amounts set forth in Exhibit B hereto. S2K shall perform such distribution-related activities for which such payments are appropriate under all applicable rules and regulations and shall make such occasional certification as required by the Distributor to such effect. (c) No compensation with respect to a Fund shall be due and owing hereunder until the Distributor actually receives payments from such Fund, to the extent applicable. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall S2K be entitled to receive fees or compensation that would cause a Fund's sales charges to exceed the maximum amount allowed under FINRA rules or applicable law. (e) S2K shall reimburse Distributor for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including but not limited to: FINRA advertising/filing fees (including additional fees for expedited reviews as set forth in Section 2(b) herein).",

As described in the Fund's Prospectus, the Fund may impose a sales charge \"load\" in connection with the purchase of shares of the Fund, a portion of which may be paid to S2K pursuant to terms in the Prospectus, however, S2K will determine the specifics of distribution activities for which payments are appropriate, and shall make certification as required by their own internal auditor.",
                "explanation": "Relocating the detailed compensation terms to the 'Miscellaneous Provisions' obscures the financial arrangements between the distributor and S2K. Furthermore, making S2K decide the specifics of distribution activities and 'their own internal auditor' contradicts FINRA rules which mandate compliance. This could reduce transparency and allow for practices that exceed FINRA limitations.",

(a) It is understood and agreed that in performing S2K's duties under this Agreement, S2K hereby undertakes to, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its representatives, officers, directors or employees who perform services under this Agreement to act in a manner consistent with written instructions received from the Distributor. (b) Each party hereto agrees that any \"Nonpublic Personal Information,\" as the term is defined in Regulation S-P (17 CFR 248.1 - 248.30) (\"Reg S-P\"), may be disclosed by a party hereunder only for the specific purpose of permitting the other party or parties to perform services set forth in this Agreement. Each party agrees that with respect to such information, it will comply with Reg S-P and any other applicable Federal or state regulations and that it will not disclose any Nonpublic Personal Information received in connection with this Agreement to any party except to the extent required to carry out the services set forth in this Agreement or as required by applicable law.",

(a) The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall end on the 60th day following a written notice from one party to the other of its decision to terminate this Agreement at the end of such 60-day period or upon termination of the applicable Distribution Agreement with respect to a Fund. Termination of this Agreement as to a Fund shall not terminate this Agreement with respect to any other Fund so long as such other Fund's (or Funds', as the case may be) Distribution Agreement is effective. If this Agreement is terminated by one party, it shall terminate the entire Agreement. (b) Any \"Nonpublic Personal Information,\" as the term is defined in Regulation S-P (17 CFR 248.1 - 248.30) (\"Reg S-P\"), may be disclosed by a party hereunder only if termination has occurred.",
                "explanation": "Moving the Reg S-P compliance clause to the section on 'Duration and Termination' drastically reduces its visibility and practical effect during the active period of the agreement. The explicit requirement for S2K to act consistently with the Distributor's instructions has been removed, creating ambiguity about whose standards of compliance govern S2K's activities. This could lead to violations of data protection laws (Reg S-P) and opens a possibility of regulatory oversight evasion since the agreement now only mentions Reg S-P in the context of the agreement's termination.",

(b) The Distributor shall indemnify and hold harmless S2K and each of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and control persons (as defined in Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act), from and against any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (including the reasonable cost of investigating or defending any alleged loss, liability, claim, damage or expense and reasonable counsel fees incurred in connection therewith), as incurred, arising in connection with (i) the Distributor's violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) the Distributor's violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation with respect to its conduct under the Agreement, or (iii) any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in any advertising or promotional material published or provided by the Distributor to S2K; provided, however, that in no case is the foregoing indemnity to be deemed to protect S2K and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and control persons (as defined in Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act), against any liability to which S2K or any such person would otherwise be subject by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence or by reason of the reckless disregard of S2K's obligations and duties under this Agreement.

                "changed_text": "10. Relationship of the Parties. In carrying out the provisions of this Agreement, S2K is, for all purposes, an independent contractor and none of S2K's offices, directors, employees or representatives is an employee of the Distributor. As an independent contractor, S2K has no authority, express or implied, to speak for, act for or bind the Distributor in any manner whatsoever. S2K shall indemnify and hold harmless the Distributor from any direct costs arising in connection with S2K's conduct under the Agreement; however, S2K is only responsible for direct costs if S2K acts as an employee of the distributor.",
                "explanation": "Moving and altering the indemnification clause into the 'Relationship of the Parties' section minimizes its impact and enforceability. By stating that S2K is only responsible if they act as an employee, this introduces a significant loophole that undermines the Distributor's protection. Inadvertent actions are no longer covered. The original clause also covered S2K's violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation, the altered clause removes this stipulation, so any legal issues are not held against them in accordance to the document.",

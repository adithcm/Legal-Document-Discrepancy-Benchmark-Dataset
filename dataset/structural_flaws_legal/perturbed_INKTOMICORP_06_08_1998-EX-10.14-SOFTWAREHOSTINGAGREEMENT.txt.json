                "original_text": "12.3   This Agreement shall be construed, enforced, performed and in all respects governed by and in accordance with the laws in the State of Washington. In any action or suit to enforce any right or remedy under this Agreement the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.",
                "changed_text": "12.3   This Agreement shall be construed, enforced, performed and in all respects governed by and in accordance with the laws in the State of Washington, or any other state that both parties agree upon. In any action or suit to enforce any right or remedy under this Agreement the prevailing party may be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' for attorneys fees and adding 'or any other state that both parties agree upon' for jurisdiction introduces uncertainty and contradiction. The original clause firmly establishes Washington law as the governing law and mandates the recovery of attorney's fees for the prevailing party. The altered clause, however, allows for the selection of a different governing law by mutual agreement and makes the recovery of attorney's fees discretionary. This undermines the original intent of the clause, making it less enforceable and more ambiguous.",

Inktomi will permit Microsoft to have access to, and to make copies of, all such books and records for purposes of auditing and verifying such costs and expenses, provided that Microsoft shall give Inktomi reasonable notice prior to each requested audit and shall perform such audit during normal business hours at Inktomi's office(s) where such records are normally kept. If any Microsoft audit should determine that Inktomi overcharged Microsoft by an amount of [*]% or more for the period audited, then in addition to any and all other rights and remedies Microsoft may have under the circumstances, Microsoft may require Inktomi to reimburse it for all costs it incurred relating to such audit.",
                "changed_text": "4.3  Inktomi shall keep true and accurate books and records, in accordance with what it determines is accurate accounting practices, relating to all costs and expenses for which Inktomi is entitled to charge Microsoft pursuant to Section 4.1 above, throughout the Term. Inktomi will permit Microsoft to potentially have access to, and to potentially make copies of, all such books and records for purposes of auditing and verifying such costs and expenses, provided that Microsoft may give Inktomi some form of notice prior to any potential audit and may perform such audit during times and locations of Inktomi's choosing. If any audit should determine that Inktomi potentially overcharged Microsoft by an amount it deems significant, then Microsoft may request Inktomi consider reimbursing it for all costs it incurred relating to such audit.",
                "explanation": "Several contradictions are introduced by weakening the requirements. Replacing 'Generally Accepted Accounting Principles' with 'what it determines is accurate accounting practices' gives Inktomi complete discretion. Altering Microsoft's access and audit rights to 'potentially' and 'may' makes these rights optional. Changing the overcharge trigger and response to 'potentially overcharged by an amount it deems significant' and 'may request Inktomi consider reimbursing it' introduces subjectivity and eliminates any mandatory action. These contradictions significantly weaken Microsoft's auditing rights and reduce accountability.",

                "changed_text": "10.3   Subject to Section 12.9 below, in the event the Microsoft Search Engine is somewhat inaccessible to Microsoft, potentially due to a problem other than one with Microsoft's servers or the telecommunication line from Microsoft to the Hosting Servers, for potentially twenty-four (24) consecutive hours, or for some forty-eight (48) hours or more in potentially seventy-two (72) hour period, or for seventy-two (72) hours or more in some week period, and such somewhat inaccessibility is allegedly due to any reason other than Microsoft's breach of its obligations under this Agreement, then Microsoft may, at Inktomi's discretion, suspend performance and/or potentially terminate this Agreement sometime with further obligation.",
                "explanation": "Introducing several contradicting changes that weakens Microsoft's rights. Changing the language used to determine how long Microsoft Search Engine is inaccessible, how long the period is and if it is due to a breach of obligations all reduces its enforceability, reducing the time periods of hours, and adding language such as potentially, allegedly, and sometime reduces the likelihood Microsoft is able to terminate this agreement if it fails. Additionally, adding 'at Inktomi's discretion' completely voids the rights for Microsoft to suspend performance and terminate the agreement.",

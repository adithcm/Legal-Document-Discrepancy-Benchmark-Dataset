                "explanation": "The added sentence introduces contradictionâ€”the first part states that termination can occur for any reason if there is a sixty-day notice. The added statement introduces uncertainty, as the termination might not proceed if both parties do not agree. This contradicts the first part of the sentence, reducing clarity and enforceability of the contract's termination.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Reseller reserves the right to provide warranties.",
                "explanation": "The clause initially denies the reseller authority to make warranties, which is then contradicted by the added text stating that the 'Reseller reserves the right to provide warranties.'

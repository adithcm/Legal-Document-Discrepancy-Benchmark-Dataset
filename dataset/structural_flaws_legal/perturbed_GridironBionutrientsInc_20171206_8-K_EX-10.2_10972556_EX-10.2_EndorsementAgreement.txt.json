                "explanation": "Moving the remuneration details to the definitions section obscures its enforceability. Changing \"beginning on the first full quarter\" to \"at the Company's discretion and as budget allows\" introduces ambiguity and allows the company to avoid the donation more easily, and switching quarterly reports to annual, makes it harder to follow.",

                "explanation": "Moving definition of licensed products to Remuneration section and changing \"all\" to \"some\" reduces clarity and introducing the potential that not all products need the logo, leading to possible trademark issues.

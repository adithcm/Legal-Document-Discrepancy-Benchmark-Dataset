                "explanation": "The inclusion of \"Parties can mutually agree on any resolution method, even if not specified in this agreement, to solve the dispute in an efficient and reasonable manner\" undermines the dispute resolution process by suggesting methods not originally agreed upon. This contradicts the established process, creating uncertainty and potentially rendering the original agreement unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'NICE remains responsible towards Contractor, jointly and severally with the Affiliate, for all of its obligations hereunder so assigned, and provided further that the assignee signs this Agreement' introduces contradiction by enabling NICE to assign its obligations to an affiliate without requiring the affiliate to be bound by the contract or NICE remaining responsible.

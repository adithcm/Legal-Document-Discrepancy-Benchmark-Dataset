Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party (the \"Relevant Party\") shall not,  and shall cause its Affiliates not to, do or cause to be done any of the following in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (a) directly or indirectly through any other Person. pay, offer to pay, promise to pay, or authorize the payment of any monies or anything of value to any official or employee of any Government Authority or any political party or candidate for political office for the purpose of illegally or improperly inducing or rewarding any action by such official, employee or candidate favorable to the Relevant Party or any of its Affiliate or (b) take any other action that, if taken by a Person subject to United States law, would violate  the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that is familiar with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.",

Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to. at all times, attempt to comply in all respects with all  applicable Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party (the \"Relevant Party\") shall not,  and shall cause its Affiliates not to, do or cause to be done any of the following in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (a) directly or indirectly through any other Person. pay, offer to pay, promise to pay, or authorize the payment of any monies or anything of value to any official or employee of any Government Authority or any political party or candidate for political office for the purpose of illegally or improperly inducing or rewarding any action by such official, employee or candidate favorable to the Relevant Party or any of its Affiliate or (b) take any other action that, if taken by a Person subject to United States law, would violate  the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that is familiar with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.",
                "explanation": "Moving the compliance clause to a section on 'further assurances' weakens its enforceability. Furthermore, changing 'comply' to 'attempt to comply' introduces ambiguity and suggests compliance is not mandatory. This weakens the explicit commitment to adhere to all applicable laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This could make it harder to prove a breach of contract if a party violates a law.",

Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, the non-Defaulting Party may immediately terminate this Agreement by giving notice  to the Defaulting Party. The non-Defaulting Party's remedy set forth in the  immediately preceding sentence is not intended to be exclusive and is in addition to, and may be exercised concurrently with, any other right or remedy that may otherwise be available to the Non-Defaulting Party at law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, the Non-Defaulting Party may recover damages against the Defaulting Party even if this Agreement is terminated (including damages arising out of such termination).",

Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, the parties may mutually agree to pursue remedies, but such agreement is not guaranteed.

Without limiting the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, the Non-Defaulting Party may recover damages against the Defaulting Party even if this Agreement is terminated (including damages arising out of such termination).",
                "explanation": "Relocating the remedies section to 'dispute resolution' diminishes its immediate impact. Also, 'may immediately terminate' is replaced with 'parties may mutually agree', making remedies subject to agreement rather than a right. This fundamentally changes the recourse available to the non-defaulting party and creates legal ambiguity. It replaces a clearly defined remedy with a vaguer, optional one.",

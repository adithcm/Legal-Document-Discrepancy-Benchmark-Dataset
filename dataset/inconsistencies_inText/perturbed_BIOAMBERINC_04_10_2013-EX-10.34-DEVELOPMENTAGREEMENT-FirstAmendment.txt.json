Section 13.9 of the Development Agreement is amended to add the following at the end of the Section:   \"Notwithstanding the above, Bioamber may fund the BRI Project up until the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrates  the ability to produce succinic acid (or salts thereof) from any feedstock at a concentration of [***] grams/liter succinic acid (or salts thereof).  Within thirty (30) days of the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrating such production levels of succinic acid, Bioamber will  cease any further funding and/or other support for the BRI Project. Further Bioamber will require that any unexpended funds received from  Bioamber be utilized for a project other than the BRI Project.",

Further Bioamber will require that any unexpended funds received from  Bioamber be utilized for a project other than the BRI Project.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding Bioamber's funding obligations. The original text stipulates that Bioamber *will* cease funding the BRI project within 30 days of reaching a certain production level. The modified text introduces the possibility that Bioamber *may elect to continue* support, creating ambiguity and uncertainty. The clause saying 'Further Bioamber may elect to continue to support the BRI project as deemed necessary despite production levels being achieved' contradicts the first sentence, thus creating an in-text contradiction.",

New Section 13.10 is added to the Development Agreement as set forth below:   \"13.10 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13.9, Bioamber may conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to Bioamber hereby  agreeing to convert the demonstration-scale Pomacle France succinic acid production facility and the Sarnia Plant to solely utilize CB1 as the  biocatalyst for the production of succinic acid (and/or salts thereof). This conversion will be carried out according to the provisions of Section 5.9  of the Commercial License, it being understood that all economic obligations of item (iv) above will be relative to the E. coli strain technology, not  the Mitsubishi strain technology. In order to enable such conversion, Bioamber will put in place agreements with the owners/operators of the  Sarnia Plant that will enable Bioamber to require such conversion of the Sarnia Plant to solely use CB1 for the manufacture of succinic acid as  described above.\"",

                "explanation": "The original text states Bioamber agrees to convert plants to 'solely utilize CB1'. The modification changes 'solely utilize' to 'primarily utilize'. This introduces a contradiction because the plants were supposed to only use CB1 but can now 'primarily' use CB1. This creates a contradiction on whether or not Bioamber must convert the facilities completely or if they can maintain the old biocatalyst as well. This contradiction will create ambiguity for enforcement of obligations of each party.",

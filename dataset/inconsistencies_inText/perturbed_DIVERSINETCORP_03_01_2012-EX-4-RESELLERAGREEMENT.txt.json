                "explanation": "Section 9(c) originally states invoices are due within 30 days. By modifying it to 60 days, we introduce an in-text contradiction with sections of the contract referencing the original 30-day payment term. This creates ambiguity about the correct payment deadline and could lead to disputes over late payment penalties.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term and for one (1) year after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, or such longer period as required by applicable law,  Reseller agrees to maintain complete books, records and accounts relevant to the computation of and accounting for the amounts payable under  this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Reseller has to keep records for seven years after the agreement ends. By reducing this period to one year, a contradiction is created. This introduces uncertainty about the required retention period and potential disputes over audit rights.",
                "location": "Section 13"

                "changed_text": "Diversinet may assign this Agreement at  any time and in such event, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if the assignee were named as the licensor in the first instance  and Diversinet shall relinquish all responsibility for the assignee's performance.",
                "explanation": "The original text has a clause that holds Diversinet responsible should the assignee fail to perform. By removing this clause, there will be in-text contradiction, creating an ambiguity regarding who is ultimately responsible for the performance of this agreement after the assignment.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, all undisputed invoices are due within 30 days of receipt. Late payments shall accrue interest at a rate of 1.5% per month.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding payment deadlines. Clause 12.1(ii) states invoices shall be paid within 60 days, while the added sentence mandates payment within 30 days and imposes late fees. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment deadline and penalty for late payment.",

However, either party may elect to pursue litigation in the courts of New York instead of arbitration, regardless of any other provision in this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces a direct contradiction regarding the dispute resolution mechanism. The original clause mandates exclusive arbitration under ICC rules. The added sentence allows either party to pursue litigation, overriding the arbitration requirement. This creates uncertainty and legal ambiguity regarding how disputes will be resolved.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict concerning the survival period of confidentiality obligations. While the main clause specifies a five-year survival for Clause 4, the added sentence stipulates that obligations related to trade secrets within Section 4.1 survive indefinitely.

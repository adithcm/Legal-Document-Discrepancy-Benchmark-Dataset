                "original_text": "2.   Terms of Payment: Party B agrees to pay Party A the Intellectual Property License fees (the \"License Fees\") and the specified amount of the license fees and the form of payment are set forth in Appendix 2. Party A has the right to exempt the obligation of payment or adjust the amount of the License Fees set forth in Appendix 2 according to the actual circumstances from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "2.   Terms of Payment: Party B agrees to pay Party A the Intellectual Property License fees (the \"License Fees\") and the specified amount of the license fees and the form of payment are set forth in Appendix 2. Party A has the right to unilaterally increase the amount of the License Fees set forth in Appendix 2 according to the actual circumstances from time to time.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding Party A's power over license fees. The original text states that Party A can exempt or adjust the fees, implying a degree of flexibility potentially benefiting Party B. The modified text states that Party A can unilaterally increase fees, removing the potential benefit to Party B and contradicting the original intent by suggesting that Party A has total discretion over fee increases.",

Party B shall pay the license fee to the account designated by Party A before December 31 each year. Party A has the right to determine whether or not to exempt the Party B's obligation to pay license fee at its discretion.",

Party B shall pay the license fee to the account designated by Party A before June 30 each year. Party A has the right to determine whether or not to exempt the Party B's obligation to pay license fee at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement specifies that the license fee payment is due before December 31st each year. The modified text changes the payment deadline to June 30th each year. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the payment deadline, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes regarding when the payment is actually due.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that Party A can terminate the agreement with 30 days written notice to Party B. The modified text changes this notice period to 60 days. This creates a conflict regarding the required notice period for termination by Party A, leading to ambiguity about the actual amount of notice required, creating an in-text contradiction.",

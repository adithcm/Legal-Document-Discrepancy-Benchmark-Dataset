                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. The original clause states payment shall be made on a specific '[***] days basis,' while the added sentence grants MediWound the option to defer payment up to 120 days without penalty. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment deadline, making enforcement ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows MediWound '[***]' days to inspect and approve or reject the Bromelain SP sample. The added sentence introduces a conflicting term by stating that if MediWound doesn't provide a rejection notice within 15 days, the sample is deemed accepted, regardless of the original inspection period. This creates a contradiction about the actual timeframe allowed for inspection and acceptance, making it uncertain which term governs.",

The added text introduces a condition that early termination fees apply if the contract is ended before the fifth year, creating a contradiction about MediWound's termination rights.

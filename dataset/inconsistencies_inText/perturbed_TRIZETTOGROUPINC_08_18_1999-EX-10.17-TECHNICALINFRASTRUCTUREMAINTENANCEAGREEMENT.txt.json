                "original_text": "5. CHARGES (a) Charges will be invoiced and are payable within thirty (30) days after the date of the invoice. All charges are subject to change by MMMW for the forthcoming period capped at the CPI annually, on thirty days written notice. MMMW reserves the right to apply [*] finance charges.",
                "changed_text": "5. CHARGES (a) Charges will be invoiced and are payable within thirty (30) days after the date of the invoice. However, for preferred clients, payment is due upon receipt of the invoice. All charges are subject to change by MMMW for the forthcoming period capped at the CPI annually, on thirty days written notice. MMMW reserves the right to apply [*] finance charges.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. While the original clause specifies a 30-day payment window, the modified clause introduces an immediate payment requirement for 'preferred clients' without defining what constitutes a preferred client. This creates uncertainty about which payment terms apply and to whom, leading to potential disputes.",

MMMW may cancel this Agreement if the Customer does not remit payment according to the terms of MMMW's invoice.",
                "changed_text": "(d) Customer, upon thirty days prior written notice, may cancel this Agreement at the end of the Initial Term and thereafter on each anniversary of the end of the Initial Term. However, the customer can cancel the agreement at any time without notice if they are unsatisfied with the services. MMMW may cancel this Agreement if the Customer does not remit payment according to the terms of MMMW's invoice.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the cancellation policy. The original clause requires 30 days written notice, while the altered text allows immediate cancellation without notice if the customer is unsatisfied. This creates ambiguity about the required procedure for contract termination and could lead to disputes over cancellation fees or other penalties.",

                "original_text": "8. WARRANTY (a) MMMW warrants that the Technical Infrastructure remains in satisfactory operating condition provided it is: 1) continuously subject to MMMW's inspection and acceptance of the hardware for service; and 2) subject to normal use and conditions. MMMW's sole and exclusive obligation under this warranty shall be at its option to repair or exchange any hardware not in satisfactory operating condition. Said obligation shall be subject to the conditions and charges of Section 3, 4 and 5 and the prompt submission of (or notification to MMMW of the problem) the hardware to MMMW for service.",
                "changed_text": "8. WARRANTY (a) MMMW warrants that the Technical Infrastructure remains in satisfactory operating condition for the first 30 days, regardless of MMMW's inspection and acceptance of the hardware for service; and 2) subject to normal use and conditions. MMMW's sole and exclusive obligation under this warranty shall be at its option to repair or exchange any hardware not in satisfactory operating condition. Said obligation shall be subject to the conditions and charges of Section 3, 4 and 5 and the prompt submission of (or notification to MMMW of the problem) the hardware to MMMW for service.",
                "explanation": "The original warranty clause states that the technical infrastructure must be 'continuously subject to MMMW's inspection'. The modified version directly contradicts this by stating that the warranty is valid for 30 days regardless of MMMW's inspection. This contradiction undermines the original clause and creates confusion about the requirements for maintaining warranty coverage. It becomes unclear whether continuous inspection is required beyond the initial 30 days, leading to potential disputes.",

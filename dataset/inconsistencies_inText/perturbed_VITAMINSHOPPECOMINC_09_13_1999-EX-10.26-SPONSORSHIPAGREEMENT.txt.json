                "original_text": "Client will pay Excite sponsorship and advertising fees of [*****] for the first twelve (12) month period following the Launch Date ([*****]). These fees will be paid in twelve (12) equal monthly installments of [*****]. The first monthly payment for [*****] will be due one month following the Launch Date. Subsequent installments will be due on a monthly basis thereafter.",
                "changed_text": "Client will pay Excite sponsorship and advertising fees of [*****] for the first twelve (12) month period following the Launch Date ([*****]). These fees will be paid in twelve (12) equal monthly installments of [*****]. The first monthly payment for [*****] will be due one month following the Launch Date. Subsequent installments will be due on a bi-monthly basis thereafter.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction in the payment schedule. The original text states that subsequent installments are due on a 'monthly basis,' while the modified text specifies a 'bi-monthly basis.' This introduces ambiguity regarding the payment frequency, potentially leading to disputes over late fees or breach of contract.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the revenue share payment deadline. The original text specifies a 30-day payment window, while the modified text extends this to 60 days. This inconsistency creates uncertainty about the enforceable payment deadline, which could lead to financial disagreements between Excite and Client.",

                "changed_text": "Regardless of Excite's actual delivery of impressions, the term of this Agreement will not be shorter than [*****] after the Launch Date, unless the Agreement is terminated earlier without penalty.",
                "explanation": "The changed text adds ambiguity by stating 'without penalty'. This contradicts the potential penalties for early termination that may be outlined elsewhere in the agreement or general legal principles. It creates uncertainty about whether early termination is indeed penalty-free, regardless of specific circumstances.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. The original text states 'no later than *** after the invoice date', which is a shorter period. The modified text gives a 60-day grace period to ELEPHANT TALK for payment, creating conflicting deadlines for payment.",

If no termination notice is provided, the Agreement will be automatically extended for consecutive *** periods until such time as *** termination notice is provided. At the end of *** Parties will negotiate in good faith regarding a possible extension of the Initial Term.",

If no termination notice is provided, the Agreement will be automatically extended for consecutive *** periods until such time as *** termination notice is provided. However, the Agreement can be terminated at any time, without prior notice, if both parties come to a mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces conflicting conditions regarding termination. One part requires a notification period, while the other suggests immediate termination by mutual consent. This creates ambiguity on whether a notification period is always necessary, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The change in section 12.1 introduces a direct contradiction regarding the liability limit for a material breach. Originally, the liability was capped at a certain amount. Now, it's unlimited unless gross negligence is proven. This causes confusion and uncertainty about the real liability exposure, creating grounds for potential disputes.",

                "original_text": "2.3 The first Development Fees payment shall be due forty-five days after the end of the Calendar Quarter in which the first Sale of a Development Product took place. Thereafter, WPD shall furnish to CNS Development Fees no later than forty-five days after the end of each Calendar Quarter for the Sale of Development Products through the end of such Calendar Quarter and shall further furnish CNS with a written statement setting forth an accounting showing the calculation of the Development Fees.",
                "changed_text": "2.3 The first Development Fees payment shall be due forty-five days after the end of the Calendar Quarter in which the first Sale of a Development Product took place. Thereafter, WPD shall furnish to CNS Development Fees no later than thirty days after the end of each Calendar Quarter for the Sale of Development Products through the end of such Calendar Quarter and shall further furnish CNS with a written statement setting forth an accounting showing the calculation of the Development Fees.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by altering the payment deadline for Development Fees. The original text states that subsequent Development Fees are due 'no later than forty-five days' after the end of each Calendar Quarter, while the revised text shortens this deadline to 'thirty days'. This discrepancy creates uncertainty regarding the actual payment deadline, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction in the cure period for a material breach. Initially, a breaching party has thirty days to cure the breach. The modified text extends this period to sixty days. This conflicting information creates uncertainty as to how much time the breaching party has to resolve the issue before termination of the agreement can occur.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction in the indemnification clause. Initially, the indemnity covers attorney's fees. The modification excludes those fees.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if ExxonMobil has a good faith dispute regarding any amounts invoiced by FCE, ExxonMobil may withhold payment for the disputed amount, provided that ExxonMobil pays the undisputed amount and notifies FCE in writing of the specific amount and nature of the dispute promptly upon receipt of FCE's invoice in which case the Parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith. The Parties shall endeavor to resolve such dispute within fifteen (15) days of notice of the dispute, and ExxonMobil shall remit payment to FCE within fifteen (15) days of resolution of such dispute.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding late payment interest. The original clause states interest accrues at 1% per month (or the maximum legal rate), while the modified clause states no interest will be charged. This creates uncertainty about whether late payments are subject to interest, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces three main inconsistencies. Firstly, the donation disbursement changes from quarterly to monthly payments, which contradicts the original text. Secondly, the unit conversion for BlackMPConcentrate shifts from 30 to 15 Units and Zezel Probiotic water shifts from 1 unit to 0.5 unit, creating conflicts about the value calculation. This affects how the donations are calculated and paid.",

                "explanation": "The original default notice period for failure to pay is 10 business days, while the altered text gives 30 business days. Furthermore, the curing period for any default is 30 days which has been changed to 15 days. This contradicts itself creating confusion, meaning either party can claim either period as they see fit.

To effect payment of such minimum monthly fees, Customer hereby authorizes M&I to initiate debit entries from and, if necessary, initiate credit entries and adjustments to Customer's account at the depository institution designated in the ACH Authorization Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B, which shall be executed by Customer contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement.

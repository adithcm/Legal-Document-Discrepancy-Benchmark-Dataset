                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "TAG shall make payment within twenty (20) days after receipt of LMG's invoice. Any amount not paid when due will thereafter bear interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction regarding whether late payments accrue interest. The original text states that interest accrues at 1% per month, while the modified text states that no interest will be charged, leading to ambiguity regarding the financial penalties for late payments.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by removing the expiration date of LMG's indemnification obligations. The original text specifies a 12-month expiration after the Conversion Date, while the modified text implies that the obligations continue indefinitely. This introduces uncertainty regarding the duration of LMG's liability.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction on the number of days prior written notice the insurer must provide to TAG. The original text specifies 30 days while the modified text specifies 10 days. This creates an inconsistency in the protection afforded to TAG, leading to uncertainty regarding how many days of warning TAG should expect before an insurance policy of LMG is cancelled.",

The Invoice specifically will      identify the Equipment, Software, or other items shipped, and the Contract      Price of such items.  Any Installation Services or other services provided      by Airspan will be invoiced separately following completion of such      services.  The Invoice also shall state the total due to Airspan from      Distributor (the \"Invoice Total\"), which shall include the Contract Price,      and any applicable taxes, duties, and other fees due pursuant to Section 6      of this Agreement.

                "explanation": "Modifying the payment term from 'Net forty-five (45) days' to 'Net thirty (30) days' directly contradicts the original payment deadline, creating uncertainty. This could lead to disputes over late payment penalties and disrupt the payment schedule.",

                "explanation": "Changing the dispute notification period to 'fifteen (15) days' and the payment term for undisputed amounts to 'net sixty (60) days' creates two contradictions. First, it shortens the time for raising a dispute, potentially hindering the process. Second, it contradicts the initial payment term of either 30 or 45 days (depending on previous change) outlined in Section 7.1, causing confusion regarding payment timelines.",

                "explanation": "Reversing Airspan's liability for damages related to termination and reducing the payment recognition period from 90 to 30 days introduces a significant contradiction.

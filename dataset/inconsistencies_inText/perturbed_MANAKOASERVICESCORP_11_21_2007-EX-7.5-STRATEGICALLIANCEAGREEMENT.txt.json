In consideration for providing these Services, MKOS shall pay UTEK $120,000 in the form of unregistered shares of common stock (923,077 shares) upon the execution of this Strategic Alliance Agreement. 1/12th of the shares (76,923) shall vest each month during the term of this Agreement. In lieu of payment of shares, MKOS shall have the option of paying UTEK $10,000 per month for the Services described in this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated any unvested shares will be returned to MKOS.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding the treatment of unvested shares upon termination. The original text states that unvested shares will be returned to MKOS. The added sentence states that UTEK shall retain all shares, creating an in-text contradiction about the fate of unvested shares and introducing uncertainty in enforcement upon the contract termination.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding UTEK's right to terminate the agreement for late payment. The original text grants UTEK a unilateral option to terminate if payment is not received within five days. The added sentence allows MKOS to waive this right by providing written notice of a valid reason for delay, contradicting the original unilateral termination right of UTEK and creating uncertainty in enforcement about payment deadlines.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding the consequences of termination. The original text allows either party to terminate with 30 days' notice, implying no penalty. The added sentence states that if UTEK terminates early, it is required to provide a refund to MKOS, contradicting the original term of termination and creating uncertainty in enforcement upon termination by UTEK before the defined 12-month term.",

                "original_text": "Within 60 days after the death of the Employee, the Employer will provide to the \"Insurer\" a written statement indicating the amount of each policy's proceeds the Employee's beneficiary is entitled to receive.",
                "changed_text": "Within 30 days after the death of the Employee, the Employer will provide to the \"Insurer\" a written statement indicating the amount of each policy's proceeds the Employee's beneficiary is entitled to receive.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the deadline for the employer to provide the insurer with a written statement regarding the beneficiary's proceeds. Article IV originally stated 60 days, but is now changed to 30 days, creating uncertainty about the correct deadline.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time while the Employee is living by written notice thereof by either the Employer or the Employee to the other; however, this Agreement can only be terminated within the first year of execution. In any event, this Agreement will terminate upon termination of the Employee's employment.",
                "explanation": "This modification adds a restriction stating the agreement can *only* be terminated within the first year. This creates a direct conflict with the initial clause stating it may be terminated 'at any time,' introducing ambiguity. This conflict creates uncertainty on termination conditions.",

If special circumstances warrant additional time, the decision will be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than 120 days after receipt of request for review. Written notice of any such extension will be furnished to the Claimant prior to the commencement of the Extension.",

Written notice of any such extension will be furnished to the Claimant prior to the commencement of the Extension.",
                "explanation": "This change modifies the timeline for the Named Fiduciary to render a decision upon review of a denied claim. Originally, it was 60 days, extendable to 120. Now it's 30 days, extendable to 90. This creates a contradiction regarding the allowable timeframe, causing uncertainty about when a decision is expected.",

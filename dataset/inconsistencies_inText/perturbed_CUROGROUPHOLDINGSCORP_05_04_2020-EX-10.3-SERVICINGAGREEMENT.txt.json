                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(b) Subject to Section 7(d), the Servicer may resign its duties hereunder by providing the Owner with at least 60 days' prior written notice.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Subject to Section 7(d), the Servicer may resign its duties hereunder by providing the Owner with at least 30 days' prior written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the notice period required for the Servicer's resignation. The original text states a 60-day notice, while the modified text reduces it to 30 days. This creates uncertainty about the actual notice period, leading to potential disputes.",

The Servicer will be entitled to receive the Servicing Fee for the performance of the duties and provision of the services called for in this Agreement in accordance with, and subject to, the Loan Agreement. The Servicing Fee shall be payable on each Payment Date for the immediately prior Servicing Period in accordance with Section 2.4 of the Loan Agreement. Any opinion, filing or other services performed by the Servicer hereunder that generates additional costs shall be at the expense of the Owner.",
                "changed_text": "Section 9. Compensation. The Servicer will be entitled to receive the Servicing Fee for the performance of the duties and provision of the services called for in this Agreement in accordance with, and subject to, the Loan Agreement. The Servicing Fee shall be payable on each Payment Date for the immediately prior Servicing Period in accordance with Section 2.4 of the Loan Agreement. Any opinion, filing or other services performed by the Servicer hereunder that generates additional costs shall be at the expense of the Servicer unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties in writing.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'at the expense of the Owner' to 'at the expense of the Servicer unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties in writing', we introduce conflicting terms regarding who bears additional costs. The original clause makes the Owner responsible, but the modified clause shifts the burden to the Servicer. This contradiction introduces ambiguity and potential disputes over cost allocation.",

                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the requirement for the Agent's prior written consent for amendments. The original clause mandates this consent as long as the Loan Agreement is active, while the revised clause explicitly removes this requirement. This contradiction creates significant uncertainty regarding the amendment process and could lead to disputes about the validity of any amendments made without the Agent's consent.",

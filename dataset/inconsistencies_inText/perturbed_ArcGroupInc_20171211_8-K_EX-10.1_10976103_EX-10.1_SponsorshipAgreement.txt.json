                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) equal installments, each due on or prior to the 15th of each month between June and November of the applicable Contract Year.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by changing the due date of the installment payments from the 1st to the 15th of each month. This creates uncertainty regarding which payment schedule should be enforced, potentially leading to disputes over late payment penalties.",

                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by changing the payment deadline for Playoff Payments from 30 to 15 days after invoice receipt. Furthermore, it now states that failure to deliver an invoice *does* relieve the sponsor of their obligation, directly contradicting the original clause. This creates significant uncertainty in payment obligations.",

                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by negating the carry-over policy for unused Annual Trade Value, stating it *will not* carry over or be usable after the term, which is the direct opposite of the original clause. This introduces uncertainty about the usability of the Annual Trade Value.",

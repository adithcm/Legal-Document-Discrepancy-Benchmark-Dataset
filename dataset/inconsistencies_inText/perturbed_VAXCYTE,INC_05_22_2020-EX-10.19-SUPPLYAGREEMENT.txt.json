In the event that Sutro makes a Manufacturing Change and is not able to Manufacture and supply Product in conformance with the Required Standards within [***] days of the delivery date identified on the applicable purchase order, Sutro shall Manufacture such Product without such Manufacturing Change. The rights of SutroVax set forth in this paragraph are in addition to any other rights set forth in this Supply Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction by introducing a blanket exemption for Sutro from liability for delivery delays caused by Force Majeure events, regardless of the delay's duration. This conflicts with the prior clause which explicitly outlines a time-bound liability for Sutro for failing to supply compliant products. Even though a force majeure clause exists elsewhere, this new addition directly impacts delivery delays and payment which can be disputed.",

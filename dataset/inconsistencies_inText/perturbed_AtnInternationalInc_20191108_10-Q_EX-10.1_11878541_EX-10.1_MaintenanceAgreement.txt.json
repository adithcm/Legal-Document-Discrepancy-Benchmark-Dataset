Vendor will provide a payment request to AT&T on a monthly basis on the first day of each calendar month for the Structured Payments set forth in the Build Addendum and the Maintenance Fees set forth in the Maintenance Addendum, in each case as provided in the respective addendum. AT&T shall pay Vendor no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of such monthly payment request for Structured Payments. AT&T shall pay, or provide a written notice of any good faith dispute to, Vendor no later than ninety (90) days after receipt of an invoice for Maintenance Fees. Any dispute of an invoice for Maintenance Fees shall be made by AT&T in good faith and shall set forth in writing a detailed description of the disputed amounts and the reason for such dispute. Notwithstanding any good faith dispute, AT&T shall pay all undisputed amounts in full to Vendor no later than the due date for such invoice. Invoices received by AT&T more than one (1) year after the Delivery of Material and Deliverables or the provision of Services are untimely and AT&T has no obligation to pay such invoices.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict in access rights. Initially, access was 'reasonable' and required coordination.

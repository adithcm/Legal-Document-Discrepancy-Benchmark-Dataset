In accordance with the Payment Instructions, NCB          shall pay the Merchants on a timely basis the net settlement amounts          due to them and shall credit NPC's account at NCB for the fees due to          NPC hereunder.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by specifying a payment timeframe of \"within 10 business days\", while the preceding sentence states payments will be made according to 'the schedule and procedures established from time to time by the parties'. The vagueness about payment timeframe will introduce a conflicting obligation, as one section mentions a definitive payment term and the other does not.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction. The original clause states NPC is responsible for 'all' expenses, but the revision states NPC is responsible for only '50%' of fees.

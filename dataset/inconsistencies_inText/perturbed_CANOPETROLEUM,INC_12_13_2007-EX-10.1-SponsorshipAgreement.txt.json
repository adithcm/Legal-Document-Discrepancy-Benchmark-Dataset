In consideration of the services to be rendered under this Agreement as set forth above, the Company shall be entitled to compensation in the amount of $150,000.00 (One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars), to be paid in equal installments of $37,500.00  (Thirty Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars) on January 1, 2008, April 1, 2008, July 1, 2008 and October 1, 2008. If Cano fails to make any  payment when required by this Agreement, the Company shall have the option of canceling this Agreement following the passage of ten  (10) days after having given Cano written notice of its default. While the Company shall have no further obligation to Cano following  cancellation of the Agreement, Cano shall remain liable for all unpaid installments for the then current term of the Agreement, which  installments shall be immediately due and payable.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the consequences of cancellation after non-payment. Originally, the unpaid installments become immediately due and payable. The modified text adds a late fee, contradicting the immediate due date and creating uncertainty about the final amount owed upon cancellation. The late fee introduces ambiguity, as it's unclear if it applies to the entire unpaid balance or just past-due installments.",

This agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term. However, Cano can terminate this agreement at any time without penalty.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction. The first sentence specifies a one-year term. The addition introduces automatic renewal but allows Cano to terminate at any time without penalty, negating the renewal clause's notice requirement and suggesting the contract can be unilaterally ended despite the established term and renewal process. It is unclear if the renewal term applies to Cano given the new sentence.",

The rights and remedies granted in this agreement to Cano in the event of default are cumulative, and the exercise  of such rights shall be without prejudice to the enforcement of any other right or remedy authorized by law or this agreement. However, in the event of a default by Cano due to non-payment, the Company's sole and exclusive remedy shall be cancellation of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction. The original clause states Cano's rights are cumulative. The addition limits the Company's remedy for non-payment to only cancellation, contradicting the concept of cumulative rights by restricting available actions. This makes it unclear if the Company can pursue other remedies alongside cancellation.",

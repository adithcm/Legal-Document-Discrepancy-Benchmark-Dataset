                "changed_text": "7.8 Payment of Services Invoice Telnet hereby covenants to pay all invoices rendered to its account by Galaxy within 15 days of the date of invoice. However, for the first three months of this agreement, Telnet shall have 30 days to pay all invoices rendered to its account by Galaxy; Interest shall accrue on overdue accounts at the rate of 1.5% per month calculated and payable from the date of invoice until the date of payment in full of the overdue amount.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that Telnet has 15 days to pay invoices, but then adds an exception for the first three months where they have 30 days. This creates uncertainty as to which payment deadline applies.",

Thereafter, this agreement will renew automatically from year to year unless cancelled in writing by either Party giving the other written notice of such cancellation a minimum of 60 days before the end of the then current term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Galaxy reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time with 30 days written notice to Telnet.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by initially stating the agreement renews annually unless cancelled with 60 days' notice, but then adding a clause that Galaxy can terminate at any time with only 30 days' notice. This creates ambiguity and impacts the enforceability of the initial term.",

If Galaxy accepts inventory returns, Telnet shall pay a restocking fee of twenty-five percent (25%) of the original billing amount for the returned inventory. However, if the termination is due to Galaxy's breach of contract, no restocking fee will apply.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating Telnet must pay a 25% restocking fee for returned inventory, but then adds an exception where no fee applies if termination is due to Galaxy's breach. This depends on the interpretation of who breached the agreement, which makes its enforcement uncertain.",

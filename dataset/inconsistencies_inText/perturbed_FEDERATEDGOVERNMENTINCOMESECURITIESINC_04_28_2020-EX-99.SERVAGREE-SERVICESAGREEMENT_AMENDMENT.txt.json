Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Amendment have the meanings given to such terms in the Services Agreement (as defined below).",

Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Amendment shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Services Agreement (as defined below), unless explicitly overridden by definitions within this Amendment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by allowing definitions within the amendment to override those in the original Services Agreement. This creates uncertainty as to which definition applies in any given situation, potentially leading to disputes.",

The Services Agreement also shall remain in full force and effect without amendment with respect to Accounts that are investment companies under the 1940 Act.",

The Services Agreement also shall remain in full force and effect without amendment with respect to Accounts that are investment companies under the 1940 Act, pending further review and potential modification.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by stating that the amended services agreement remains in effect unless stated otherwise in future communications. This introduces an element of uncertainty and conflicts with the explicit written agreement. The phrase 'pending further review and potential modification' concerning accounts under the 1940 act also renders the binding nature of the contract ambiguous.",

The interpretation of this exception shall be at the sole discretion of a mutually agreed upon arbiter.",
                "explanation": "This amendment introduces a contradiction by stating that while Pennsylvania law governs, it defers to international trade laws in case of conflict. The phrase 'interpretation of this exception shall be at the sole discretion of a mutually agreed upon arbiter' introduces subjective judgement and thus ambiguity as to which laws ultimately control.",

Said amounts charged to Equidata will be billed separately to Marketing Affiliate and are due immediately upon receipt.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment deadline from 30 days to 60 days in this section contradicts the late fee clause, creating confusion. The late fee is assessed based on the original 30-day payment term, but now the payment term is 60 days according to this section. This introduces ambiguity about when late fees apply, as the original clause states a penalty for payments after 30 days, but this modification allows 60 days. The original late fee clause is unaffected in section 1, so this creates a direct contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The modified text introduces a contradiction by changing the attorney's fees percentage from 25% to 5%. This in-text contradiction creates uncertainty about the amount of attorney's fees the Marketing Affiliate is responsible for in case of collection.",

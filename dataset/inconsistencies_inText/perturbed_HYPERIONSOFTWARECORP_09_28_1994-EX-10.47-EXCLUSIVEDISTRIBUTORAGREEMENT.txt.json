                "original_text": "Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees and expenses payable hereunder for which Developer issues an invoice to Distributor shall be due and payable thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice. A late payment charge of the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest interest rate allowed by applicable law shall be charged upon all unpaid amounts due hereunder for more than thirty (30) days.",
                "changed_text": "Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees and expenses payable hereunder for which Developer issues an invoice to Distributor shall be due and payable sixty (60) days from the date of the invoice. A late payment charge of the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest interest rate allowed by applicable law shall be charged upon all unpaid amounts due hereunder for more than thirty (30) days.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by specifying different payment deadlines. Section 2.2 initially states that invoices are due within 30 days, but now it states 60 days, while the late payment charge still applies after 30 days. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding when late fees are applicable.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation creates a contradiction by modifying the reporting and documentation deadlines. The section initially mandates that the monthly report be submitted within 10 days of each month's end, but now says 30 days. The requirement to provide an English translation of each license agreement is changed from 1 day to 5 days. This inconsistency results in uncertainty regarding the stipulated timeframes.",

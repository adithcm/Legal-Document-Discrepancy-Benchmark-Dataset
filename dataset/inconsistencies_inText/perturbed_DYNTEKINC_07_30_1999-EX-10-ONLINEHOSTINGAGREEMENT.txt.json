                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction to the implicit expectation of consistent interest accrual by creating an exception for disputed invoices. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement regarding when interest applies.",

                "changed_text": "Diplomat will pay such invoice within 30 days of receipt, provided that if Diplomat reasonably determines that there is an error in the invoice, Diplomat shall pay the undisputed portion of the invoice within 30 days of receipt, and the parties will attempt to resolve the error. The parties agree to resolve errors within 15 days of notice of error; if the parties are unable to resolve errors within 15 days of notice of error Diplomat will pay such invoice within 45 days of receipt.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. The original text states payment is due in 30 days. The changed text adds conditions that could extend the payment period to 45 days, introducing an inconsistency regarding when payment is actually due. This creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction. The original clause states that 'all other terms and conditions' continue during the extended period. The addition introduces an exception, allowing for fee renegotiation and potential increase, contradicting the 'all other terms and conditions' provision. This creates ambiguity about the fixed nature of pricing during the Additional Period and potential disputes regarding cost.",

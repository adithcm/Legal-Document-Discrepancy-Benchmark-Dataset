Terms of payment by the Agent to the Company for Products shipped to the Customer will be net thirty (30) days from the date of statement unless the Agent chooses to pay the Company via electronic funds transfer in which case the terms of payment will be net forty-five (45) days.

However, as an incentive for expedited payment processing, Agents who remit payment within fifteen (15) days from the date of statement will receive a two percent (2%) discount on the total invoice amount. All payments will be made in United States Dollars without set-off or counterclaim, free and clear of (and without deduction for) any taxes, duties, charges, withholdings, restrictions or conditions of any nature imposed or levied by any political, taxing or other authority.",

This creates an in-text contradiction by creating a conflict between two payment deadlines.",

The original clause requires a 30-day cure period for any breach, including payment failures (5 business days), but the added sentence permits immediate termination for payment failures, overriding the cure period.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. The original text specifies 'sixty ( 90 ) day', which is ambiguous, I modified the value to 'sixty (60) day'. This clashes with a subsequent, new clause stating 'Payment is due within 90 days of invoice date' which creates uncertainty about which payment term to enforce.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the termination timeframe for the distributor. Clause C states that either party may terminate by providing Ninety days written notice. But new clause D states that the distributor may terminate the agreement at any time, without cause, upon thirty days written notice to Lucid. This creates an in-text contradiction, as the two clauses provide different termination timeframes for the distributor.",

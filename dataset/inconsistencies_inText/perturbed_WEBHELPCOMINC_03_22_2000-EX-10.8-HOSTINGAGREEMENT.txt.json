All amounts payable hereunder are exclusive of any and all taxes, and Customer is responsible for payment of such taxes (excluding taxes based on eGain's net income).",

All amounts payable hereunder are exclusive of any and all taxes, and Customer is responsible for payment of such taxes (excluding taxes based on eGain's net income).",

The original text specifies payment on or before the first day of the month, while the modified text changes it to within 30 days of invoice receipt. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty about the actual due date for payment.",

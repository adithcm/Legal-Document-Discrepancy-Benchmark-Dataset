                "changed_text": "The standstill period (the \"Standstill Period\") begins on the date of this Agreement and shall extend until thirty (30) days prior to the deadline for the submission of stockholder nominations for directors for the 2021 Annual Meeting pursuant to the By-Laws. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in the event that the MG Capital Designees are not nominated for election, or fail to get elected at the 2021 Annual Meeting, then the Standstill Period shall automatically be extended for an additional year from the date of the 2021 Annual Meeting.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence creates an in-text contradiction by providing an additional condition that extends the Standstill Period. The original clause clearly defines the Standstill Period, but the added condition introduces ambiguity as to when the period definitively ends. This creates uncertainty about the obligations during the standstill period.",

Between the date of the Initial Reimbursement and the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting, the Company will reimburse the MG Capital Parties for the Expenses in an aggregate amount not exceeding $650,000 (inclusive of the Initial Reimbursement, the \"Cap\"), which Expenses shall be reimbursed on a dollar-for-dollar basis at the same time as the Company reimburses its third party vendors (e.g., legal counsel, public relations firm, financial advisor and proxy advisory firm)in connection with the MG Capital Parties' consent solicitation and Nomination Notice; provided that all Expenses, subject to the Cap, shall be reimbursed no later than the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting.",

Previously, the clause stated that the Company would reimburse up to the Cap. This change makes it ambiguous how much the MG Capital Parties will actually be reimbursed, creating uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original clause prohibits disparagement, but the new clause allows it under specific circumstances.

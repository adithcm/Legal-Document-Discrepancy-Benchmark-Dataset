Except as may be specifically authorized in writing by NETGEAR, and subject to NETGEAR's continuing approval of Distributor's credit status and financial condition, Distributor will pay NETGEAR for all Products ordered by Distributor within [*] of the date the corresponding invoice is issued by NETGEAR. The foregoing notwithstanding, the parties agree that payment for the initial order placed by Distributor under this Agreement shall be due and payable within [*] of the date the corresponding invoice is issued by NETGEAR. NETGEAR, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to specify, and to change from time to time, Distributor's credit line and payment terms. All payments are to be made in U.S. dollars. Payment for shipments made outside of the United States shall be made by wire transfer in accordance with wire",

The foregoing notwithstanding, the parties agree that payment for the initial order placed by Distributor under this Agreement shall be due and payable within 15 days of the date the corresponding invoice is issued by NETGEAR.

                "explanation": "The modified text introduces an in-text contradiction by specifying two different payment deadlines for the initial order. One instance gives the original timeframe of '[*]', while the following sentence explicitly states '15 days'. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding when the initial payment is actually due, leading to potential disputes.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately if (i) the other party becomes insolvent, files or has filed against it a petition in bankruptcy, or ceases doing business; or (ii) the other party fails to cure a material breach of the Agreement within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of such breach from the party not in default.

The first sentence states that 'either party' can terminate with 90 days notice, while the last sentence specifies 'NETGEAR only' can terminate the agreement without cause. This contradiction introduces uncertainty and potential disputes over the termination rights of each party.",

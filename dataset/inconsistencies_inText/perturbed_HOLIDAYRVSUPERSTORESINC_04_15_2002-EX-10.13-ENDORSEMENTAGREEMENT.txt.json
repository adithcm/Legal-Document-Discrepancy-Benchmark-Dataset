In the event that the Company desires to terminate the Agreement prior to the Termination Date, it shall provide AGI with at least 60 days prior written notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement and this Agreement shall so terminate following the expiration of this 60-day period, without any further responsibility by either Party except as provided in Section 5.",

In the event that the Company desires to terminate the Agreement prior to the Termination Date, it shall provide AGI with at least 60 days prior written notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement and this Agreement shall so terminate following the expiration of this 60-day period, without any further responsibility by either Party except as provided in Section 5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AGI reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time with only 30 days written notice.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding the termination clause. The original text states the company needs to provide 60 days notice, but the added text allows AGI to terminate with only 30 days notice, creating an inconsistency.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states the fee is non-refundable for *any* reason. The modified text introduces an exception where the fee *is* refundable if AGI breaches its warranty, directly contradicting the 'for any reason' clause.",

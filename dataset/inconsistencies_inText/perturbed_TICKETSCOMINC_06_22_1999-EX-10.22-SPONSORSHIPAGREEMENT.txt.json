                "original_text": "Tickets agrees to pay MP3.com, during the term of this Agreement, as follows: (i) $[***] payable on the Effective Date; (ii) $[***] payable on or before one month subsequent to the Effective Date; (iii) $[***] payable on or before two months subsequent to the Effective Date; (iv) $[***] payable on or before three months subsequent to the Effective Date; (v) $[***] payable on or before four months subsequent to the Effective Date; (vi) $[***] payable on or before five months subsequent to the Effective Date. Any late payments under this Agreement will be assessed a service fee of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, to the extent allowed by law.",
                "changed_text": "Tickets agrees to pay MP3.com, during the term of this Agreement, as follows: (i) $[***] payable on the Effective Date; (ii) $[***] payable on or before one month subsequent to the Effective Date; (iii) $[***] payable on or before two months subsequent to the Effective Date; (iv) $[***] payable on or before three months subsequent to the Effective Date; (v) $[***] payable on or before four months subsequent to the Effective Date; (vi) $[***] payable on or before five months subsequent to the Effective Date. Any late payments under this Agreement will be assessed a service fee of three percent (3%) per month for the first month, and one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month thereafter, to the extent allowed by law.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the late payment fee structure. The original text specifies a flat 1.5% monthly fee, while the modified text introduces a higher 3% fee for the initial month of lateness, then reverts to 1.5%. This creates ambiguity about which interest rate applies and causes confusion about the late fee structure, undermining its enforcement.",

Furthermore, for a thirty (30) day period, beginning thirty (30) days prior to the first anniversary of this Agreement, Tickets shall have the right to renew the Agreement for another year with Sponsor Fees that do not exceed a [***] percent increase over the existing Sponsor Fees. Any payments which have accrued prior to the date of termination shall remain due and payable.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in full force and effect until one (1) year subsequent to the Effective Date, provided however, that Tickets may terminate this Agreement for any reason upon thirty (30) days' notice to MP3.com at any time prior to the expiration of sixty (60) days subsequent to the Effective Date. Furthermore, Tickets shall have the right to renew the Agreement for another year with Sponsor Fees as negotiated by both parties at least 30 days before the end of current agreement term. Any payments which have accrued prior to the date of termination shall not be payable.",
                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction by removing the percentage increase cap for the renewed agreement and changing the due payments. The original agreement includes a clause saying that 'Tickets shall have the right to renew the Agreement for another year with Sponsor Fees that do not exceed a [***] percent increase over the existing Sponsor Fees' however the updated agreement allows both parties to negotiate the increase in price with no limit. Also the second change states that 'Any payments which have accrued prior to the date of termination shall not be payable' creating contradiction with the original text 'Any payments which have accrued prior to the date of termination shall remain due and payable.'",

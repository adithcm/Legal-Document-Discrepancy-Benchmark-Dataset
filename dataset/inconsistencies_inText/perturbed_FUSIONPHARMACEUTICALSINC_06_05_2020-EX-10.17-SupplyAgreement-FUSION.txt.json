                "changed_text": "FUSION shall pay such invoice within [***] of receipt of the invoice. However, should the payment be made after [***], a late fee of 10% will be applied to the invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an inconsistency in the payment terms. The original text specifies payment within [***] of invoice receipt. The added sentence introduces a late fee if payment is made after a different unspecified duration, creating confusion about the exact payment deadline and applicable penalties.",

                "explanation": "This change adds another termination condition that directly contradicts the original payment terms. While Section 3.5 allows for [***] payment period, this modification allows CPDC to terminate the agreement if payment is not received within 15 days, creating a direct conflict regarding the allowable payment timeframe and the consequences of late payment.",

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this agreement will automatically terminate if FUSION fails to achieve a minimum purchase volume of [***] within the first year.",
                "explanation": "This adds another automatic termination condition based on a purchase volume that was not part of the original contract conditions for remaining active. This creates a conflict as it gives CPDC a new unilateral avenue to terminate the contract which contradicts the original terms of termination.",

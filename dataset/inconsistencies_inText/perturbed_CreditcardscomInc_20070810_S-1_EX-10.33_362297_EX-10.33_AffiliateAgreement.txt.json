                "explanation": "Section 3 states fees are paid monthly, but this change introduces a 90-day delay after each quarter, which creates an inconsistency with the monthly payment term, leading to ambiguity about when payments are actually made.",

                "changed_text": "Affiliate will continue to receive Commission payments for all Approved Accounts placed during the term of this Agreement, provided that the Affiliate has submitted all required monthly performance reports within 15 days of month end; otherwise, no commission will be paid.",
                "explanation": "While Section 5 states Affiliate will receive commission payments for all approved accounts placed during the term of the agreement, the addition of the requirement for monthly performance reports creates a condition under which those commissions may not be paid, creating a contradiction. This uncertainty could lead to disputes over payments.",

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the amount of Commissions, the definition of Approved Accounts, and all other provisions of this Agreement are subject to change without notice other than posting such information on the Chase Website. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO AFFILIATE, THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT. AFFILIATE'S CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM FOLLOWING CHASE'S POSTING OF A NEW AGREEMENT ON ITS WEB SITE WILL CONSTITUTE BINDING ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE.",

                "explanation": "The addition of a 30-day written notice for changes that negatively impact commission structure directly contradicts the earlier statement that all provisions, including commissions, are subject to change without notice other than posting on the website, which creates ambiguity and potential disputes.",

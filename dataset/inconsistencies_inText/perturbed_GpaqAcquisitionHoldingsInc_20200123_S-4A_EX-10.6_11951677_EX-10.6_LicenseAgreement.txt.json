For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means an equity or income interest of fifty percent (50%) or more, or the possession of the power, directly or indirectly, to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Affiliate, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.",

For purposes of this definition, \"control\" will be determined at the discretion of PFHOF's board of directors, taking into consideration any influence the entity has on PFHOF's operations or strategic direction.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by changing the definition of \"Affiliate\" with respect to PFHOF. The original definition relies on direct or indirect control based on a 50% or more equity/income interest or the power to direct management. The modified definition broadens the definition to include affiliated entities, those working in conjunction, or strategic partnerships, and removes the specific control threshold, giving PFHOF's board discretion. This conflicts with other contract sections that rely on the original, more restrictive definition to determine rights and obligations, creating ambiguity and uncertainty in enforcement.",

Thereafter, the agreement shall automatically renew for successive five (5)-year terms, unless either Party gives written notice to the other Party of intent not to renew at least six (6) months prior to the expiration of the then-current Term. If either party elects not to renew the Agreement and the other party wishes to continue the Agreement, the Parties shall attempt in good faith to negotiate an amendment to the Agreement to renew the Term on such terms as may be negotiated by the Parties. Such good faith negotiation shall continue until both Parties agree to cease negotiations or until expiration of the Term.",

Such good faith negotiation shall continue until both Parties agree to cease negotiations or until expiration of the Term.",
                "explanation": "The modified text in Section 4.1 creates a contradiction by stating that only PFHOF can provide notice to terminate the renewal. The original language allows either party to provide written notice of intent not to renew. This change creates a situation where the Village Media Company may be bound to the agreement indefinitely, as it lacks the ability to prevent automatic renewal, causing uncertainty in contract enforcement and a potential legal dispute.",

The first Annual Guarantee payment shall be due and payable on the Effective Date and thereafter shall be payable to PFHOF on each twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date during the Term.",

                "explanation": "The modified language introduces a contradiction to the Annual Guarantee. While the first sentence indicates payment of the guarantee each year, and later language indicates the increase of the fee after the initial period, the addition of 'or decrease' creates confusion regarding the payment due. There is no condition mentioned by which the Annual Guarantee can decrease, opening to interpretation and increasing potential for disputes.",

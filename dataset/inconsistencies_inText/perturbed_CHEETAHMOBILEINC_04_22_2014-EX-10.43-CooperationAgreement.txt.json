Party B shall review within thirty working days upon receipt of Party A's written objection and notify the results thereof to Party A.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. Originally, Party B was required to pay the share of revenues to Party A prior to the 20th day of each month. The modification states that payment is due within 60 days of receiving the invoice, which conflicts with the original timeline and creates uncertainty about the enforceable payment deadline.",

                "explanation": "The original text stated that Party B would not pay any share of profits to Party A if Party A breached the covenant to list Party B's search engine as the default. The modified text directly contradicts this by stating that Party B will still pay any share of profits.

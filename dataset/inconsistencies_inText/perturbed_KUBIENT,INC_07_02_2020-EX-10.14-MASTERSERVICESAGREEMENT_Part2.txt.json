Subject to the doctrine of sequential liability, payment shall be made to the appropriate Party net 30 days from the end of the calendar month.",

Subject to the doctrine of sequential liability, payment shall be made to the appropriate Party net 45 days from the end of the calendar month.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment term from net 30 days to net 45 days creates a conflict with the statement in Exhibit A that states 'The payment term provision above shall supersede the payment term provision set forth in Exhibit A'. This introduces ambiguity as to whether payments should be made within 30 days or 45 days, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'supersede' to 'secondary', a direct conflict is created. Previously, the terms in Exhibit B were meant to override Exhibit A in case of conflict but now the terms in Exhibit A override Exhibit B, which has the changed payment terms. This could lead to disputes and differing interpretations regarding payment obligations.",

                "explanation": "Changing Kubient's right to revenue from Nativo from 'no right to' to '25% of revenue' creates a clear contradiction. This uncertainty can lead to disputes over revenue sharing for Nativo deals introduced by Kubient.",

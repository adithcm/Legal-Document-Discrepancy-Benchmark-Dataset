                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by altering the payment deadline for Merchant Accounts on the FDMS \"Omaha\" platform. The original text states that payments are due no later than [***] [***] days after the end of each month, while the modified text shortens this period to five (5) business days after the end of each month. This creates ambiguity regarding the correct payment deadline, leading to potential disputes over contractual obligations.",

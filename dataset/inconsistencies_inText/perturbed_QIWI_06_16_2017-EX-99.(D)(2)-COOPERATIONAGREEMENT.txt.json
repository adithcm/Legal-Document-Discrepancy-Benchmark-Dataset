                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any person, any other person directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, working alongside, in conjunction, or in strategic partnership with such person and, in the case of a trust, any trustee or beneficiary (actual or potential) of that trust and, in the case of an individual, any person connected with him; provided that, for the purposes of this Agreement, neither QIWI nor any of its subsidiaries is to be regarded as an Affiliate of Otkritie;",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by changing the definition of 'Affiliate' to include entities in strategic partnerships and loosely affiliated, moving away from the original, more strict definition of controlling/controlled entities. This undermines other contract sections that rely on the original definition to determine rights and obligations, introducing legal uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "changed_text": "For two (2) years following the Effective Time, QIWI covenants that at least one half of the total transactions processed by the Contact money transfer system during such two-year period shall be settled through PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie, provided that QIWI may terminate its obligation under this Clause 4.1 at any time, without any compensation to Otkritie.",
                "explanation": "The modification removes the compensation clause for early termination of the obligation to use PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie. This creates a direct contradiction, as the original clause stipulates a fee for termination, while the modified clause allows termination without any payment. This creates significant uncertainty in enforcement, as it is unclear whether Otkritie is entitled to compensation in the event of early termination by QIWI.",

                "original_text": "Unless otherwise mutual agreed between the Parties, this Agreement shall remain in effect until the earlier of the below events occur:\n\n (a) The fifth (5t h) anniversary of this Agreement; and\n\n (b) Otkritie ceasing to own more than 2,237,216 class B shares or American depositary shares of QIWI.",

                "explanation": "The change alters the duration and conditions for the agreement's termination. It extends the anniversary date from the fifth to the tenth, and decreases the number of shares Otkritie needs to possess to keep the agreement in effect. This creates a direct conflict with the original termination clause, as the agreement's lifespan and the threshold for share ownership now contradict the initial terms, causing uncertainty on which termination condition prevails.",

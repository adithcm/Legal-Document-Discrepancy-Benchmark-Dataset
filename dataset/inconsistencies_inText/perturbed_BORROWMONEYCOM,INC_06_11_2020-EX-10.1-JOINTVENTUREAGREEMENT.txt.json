                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Term 4. The duration of this Venture (the \"Term\") will begin on March 1, 2020 and continue in full force and effect until February 28, 2025 or as otherwise provided in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Term 4. The duration of this Venture (the \"Term\") will begin on March 1, 2020 and continue in full force and effect until February 28, 2025 or as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 5. The Term may be terminated by either member with a 30-day written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict. Section 4 states the term ends on a specific date (February 28, 2025), while the added sentence in section 5 allows either member to terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice. This creates uncertainty regarding the actual duration of the venture, contradicting the original fixed end date and potentially leading to disputes.",

However, BorrowMoney.com, Inc. shall receive two votes on any matter pertaining to IT Development, internet Back office Maintenance And Deployment of medical Service, due to their specialized expertise.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction to the principle of equal voting rights. While section 28 establishes that each member receives one vote, section 29 grants BorrowMoney.com, Inc. an additional vote on specific matters. This undermines the original equal weight principle and creates ambiguity about the voting power distribution, potentially leading to disputes regarding decision-making.",

On the liquidation of the Venture assets, distribution of any amounts to Members will be made in proportion to their respective capital accounts or as otherwise may be agreed in writing. 39. However, JVLS, LLC will receive the first $100,000 of the liquidation proceeds before any distribution based on capital accounts.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a direct conflict with the stated distribution method. Section 38 dictates that liquidation proceeds are distributed proportionally to capital accounts or as otherwise agreed in writing. The added section 39 gives JVLS, LLC priority to the first $100,000, which directly contradicts the proportional distribution based on capital accounts and creates uncertainty about how liquidation proceeds will actually be divided, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that interest accrues on payments not made 'when due'. The modified text specifies a grace period of *three (3) business days* before interest starts accruing. This introduces an in-text contradiction, as it is now unclear whether a payment is considered 'late' immediately upon the due date or after the three-day grace period. If, later on in the contract, there is a clause that indicates payments should be paid within a specific time frame, and this is not followed, there could be an in-text contradiction that creates uncertainty in enforcement. For example, there could be a penalty if payments aren't made in a timely fashion, or the other party could cease business operations until payments are made. The addition creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

Subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 10 hereof, the GOB Sale shall commence at each Store on a date determined by Agent in its sole discretion after the occurrence of the Closing (the \"Sale Commencement Date\") and shall end at each Store no later than August 31, 2018 (the \"Sale Termination Date\", and the period from the Sale Commencement Date to the Sale Termination Date as to each Store being the \"Sale Term\"), provided that the Sale Commencement Date shall occur no later than April 19, 2018. Agent may, in its discretion, earlier terminate the GOB Sale on a Store-by- Store basis upon not less than seven (7) days' prior written notice (a \"Vacate Notice\") to Merchant (the \"Vacate Date\"), provided, that it being understood that Agent's obligations to pay all Expenses, including Occupancy Expenses, for each Store subject to a Vacate Notice shall continue until the applicable Vacate Date, provided, however, that, with respect to Occupancy Expenses, Agent's obligations to pay all Occupancy Expenses for each Store shall continue until the last day of the calendar month in which the Vacate Date occurs for such Store.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction regarding Agent's obligation to pay Occupancy Expenses. The original clause states Agent's obligations continue until the end of the calendar month of the Vacate Date, while the modified clause states they cease immediately upon the Vacate Date. This creates uncertainty about which condition applies, leading to potential disputes.",

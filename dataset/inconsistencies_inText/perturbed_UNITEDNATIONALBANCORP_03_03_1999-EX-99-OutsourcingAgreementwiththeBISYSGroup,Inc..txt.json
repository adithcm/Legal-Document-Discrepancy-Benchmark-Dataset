Gregor,  chairman and chief executive officer of United National.  \"During the past year we completed an assessment of our  information  processing  needs going forward into the next  century.

Gregor, chairman and chief executive officer of United National. \"During the past year we completed an assessment of our information processing needs going forward into the next century. After evaluating a number of different options, we determined that the flexibility and quality of BISYS' TOTALPLUS (R) system would best serve our needs for the immediate future. However, this agreement is subject to re-evaluation and potential termination within one year if BISYS fails to meet key performance indicators.\"",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by initially suggesting a long-term commitment ('years to come') but then adding a clause that allows for termination within a year based on performance. This creates uncertainty about the duration of the agreement and the actual commitment made.",

Nevertheless,  we believe that the enhanced  capabilities  which  BISYS  offers  are  better  matched to the future direction of our Bank.\"",

Nevertheless, we believe that while BISYS offers advanced capabilities, United Financial Services may still continue to provide certain specialized processing tasks, if deemed necessary for operational efficiency.\"",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the earlier statement about fully moving to BISYS. By suggesting that United Financial Services might still be used, it creates ambiguity about the scope of BISYS's responsibilities and potentially complicates the transition and cost structures, leading to possible payment disputes. It undermines the original rationale for choosing BISYS.",

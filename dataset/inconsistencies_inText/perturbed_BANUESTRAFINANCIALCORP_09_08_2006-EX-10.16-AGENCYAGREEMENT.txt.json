Any out-of-pocket expenses or commissions payable under this Agreement shall be paid in next day funds on the earlier of the initial Closing Date or a determination by the Company to terminate or abandon the Offering, and on each subsequent Closing Date thereafter.",
                "changed_text": "b. Agent shall be reimbursed for expenses as contemplated by Section 8 of this Agreement, regardless of whether the Offering is successfully completed. Any out-of-pocket expenses or commissions payable under this Agreement shall be paid within 30 days of invoice submission, only if the offering is successfully completed. If the offering is terminated or abandoned, reimbursement will be at the sole discretion of the Company.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding when and under what conditions the Agent is reimbursed for expenses. The original text states reimbursement regardless of the offering's success, payable in next day funds. The revised text introduces a 30-day payment term contingent on successful completion and discretionary reimbursement upon termination, creating uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original text sets a limit of $5,000 on reimbursable agent expenses. The addition introduces a lower threshold of $2,500 if the offering doesn't meet a certain target. This creates an in-text contradiction on total expenses, making uncertain how the expenses will be accounted for if the raised capital does not meet the 75% threshold.",

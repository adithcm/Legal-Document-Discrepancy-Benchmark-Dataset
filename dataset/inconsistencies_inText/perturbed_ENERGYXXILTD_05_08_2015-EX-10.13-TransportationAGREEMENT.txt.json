                "original_text": "10.1 Payment. All payments are due within 10 days of receipt of the invoice by ACH or wire transfer, unless the Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory that the financial condition of Shipper or Shipper's guarantor (if any) is or has become impaired or unsatisfactory or Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory it necessary to do so, in which case the payment due date shall be that specified in a written notice to the Shipper. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shipper may withhold payment of amounts it disputes in good faith, provided that if any such amount is later determined to have been due Transporter Section 10.2 below shall apply to such amount.",
                "changed_text": "10.1 Payment. All payments are due within 10 days of receipt of the invoice by ACH or wire transfer, unless the Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory that the financial condition of Shipper or Shipper's guarantor (if any) is or has become impaired or unsatisfactory or Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory it necessary to do so, in which case the payment due date shall be that specified in a written notice to the Shipper. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shipper may withhold payment of amounts it disputes in good faith. All payments are due within 45 days of receipt of the invoice by ACH or wire transfer.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by stating that payments are due within 10 days and in another sentence stating they are due in 45 days. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual payment deadline, leading to potential disputes. It creates uncertainty in enforcement of the original 10 days payment clause.",

Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated by either Party upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice. The term of this agreement shall last for 10 years, and can only be terminated with 1 year prior written notice.",
                "explanation": "By including an additional sentence stating the term of the agreement lasts for 10 years and can only be terminated with 1 year prior written notice conflicts with the previous sentence about terminating with 30 days prior written notice. This in-text contradiction creates an uncertainty regarding the actual term length.",

(a) Transporter shall have a lien on all Crude Petroleum delivered to Transporter to secure the payment of any and all transportation, or any other charges that are owed Transporter. Such lien shall survive delivery of Crude Petroleum to Shipper. Such lien shall extend to all Crude Petroleum in Transporter's possession beginning with Shipper's first receipt of transportation or other services from Transporter. The lien provided herein shall be in addition to any lien or security interest provided by statute or applicable law. Transporter may withhold delivery to Shipper of any of Shipper's Crude Petroleum in its possession and exercise any other rights and remedies granted under this Agreement or existing under applicable law until all such charges have been paid as provided above.",

Transporter shall not have a lien on all Crude Petroleum delivered to Transporter.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence \"Transporter shall not have a lien on all Crude Petroleum delivered to Transporter.\" directly contradicts the start of the clause which states Transporter does have a lien. This creates a direct in-text contradiction regarding the Transporter's ability to use a lien, and uncertainty in enforcement.",

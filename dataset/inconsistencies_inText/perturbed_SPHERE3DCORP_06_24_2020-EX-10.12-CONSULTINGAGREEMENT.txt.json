                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction regarding the termination clause. The original text implies automatic renewal for an additional month if no notice is given within 5 days. The added section (b) allows the company to terminate at any time with 30 days notice, conflicting with the automatic renewal clause. This creates uncertainty about whether the contract automatically renews or can be terminated at will after the initial 12-month period, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The added text introduces a contradiction. The original states the Shares are to be issued upon execution but then later specifies that they will be issued no later than July 1st, 2020. This creates ambiguity. Secondly, the options vesting monthly for six months has added language, creating uncertainty in the event of disagreement.",

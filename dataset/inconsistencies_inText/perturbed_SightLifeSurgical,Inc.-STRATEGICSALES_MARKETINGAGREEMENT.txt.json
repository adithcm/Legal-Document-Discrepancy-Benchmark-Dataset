Within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, Imprimis shall deliver to Surgical a report setting forth for such calendar quarter the calculation of the applicable Sales Commission due under this Agreement for the sale of the Product (as defined in the SOW). Imprimis shall remit the total Sales Commission payments due for the sale of Product during such calendar quarter at the time such report is made.",

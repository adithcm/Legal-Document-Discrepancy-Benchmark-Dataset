                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. Initially, invoices were to be paid within 45 days. Now, the payment deadline is set to 30 days, creating uncertainty about the actual timeframe for payment and potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates a direct conflict regarding the notice period required for cancellation. The original clause stipulated a three-month notice, while the altered version extends it to six months.

                "original_text": "Payment of License Fees shall be made in Canadian funds in arrears within thirty (30) days following each calendar month during the Term in which Licensed Programs were exhibited hereunder and shall be accompanied by a statement of account showing the calculation of the License Fees.",
                "changed_text": "Payment of License Fees shall be made in Canadian funds in arrears within sixty (60) days following each calendar month during the Term in which Licensed Programs were exhibited hereunder and shall be accompanied by a statement of account showing the calculation of the License Fees.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the payment deadline from thirty (30) days to sixty (60) days in Section 6(c). This conflicts with the original thirty (30) day deadline, creating uncertainty about when payments are actually due, potentially leading to disputes. A different section could implicitly reference the thirty (30) day period, making this perturbation more apparent.",

                "explanation": "This modification reduces the notice period required for termination by Rogers from sixty (60) days to thirty (30) days. This directly contradicts the original clause. If another section refers back to the original sixty (60) day period, it creates conflict and ambiguity regarding the actual required notice period, which can lead to disputes over the legitimacy of a termination notice.",

                "explanation": "The modified text changes the post-termination distribution period from sixty (60) days to thirty (30) days. This in-text contradiction creates ambiguity about the extent to which Rogers can continue to use Licensed Programs after termination, leading to potential disputes regarding usage rights and payment obligations during this period.",

                "original_text": "The Adviser hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless FASC and its trustees, officers and employees (each of the foregoing an \"Indemnified Party\" and collectively the \"Indemnified Parties\") against and from any and all losses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments and suits and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Party, other than as a consequence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Indemnified Party, arising out of or in connection with this Limited Power of Attorney or any other agreement, instrument or document executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, including without limitation the reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements in connection with defending such Indemnified Party against any claim or liability related to the exercise or performance of any of FASC's powers or duties under this Limited Power of Attorney or any of the other agreements, instruments or documents executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, or the taking of any action under or in connection with any of the foregoing. The obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Limited Power of Attorney with respect to actions taken by FASC on behalf of the Adviser during the term of this Limited Power of Attorney.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless FASC and its trustees, officers and employees (each of the foregoing an \"Indemnified Party\" and collectively the \"Indemnified Parties\") against and from any and all losses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments and suits and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Party, other than as a consequence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Indemnified Party, arising out of or in connection with this Limited Power of Attorney or any other agreement, instrument or document executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, including without limitation the reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements in connection with defending such Indemnified Party against any claim or liability related to the exercise or performance of any of FASC's powers or duties under this Limited Power of Attorney or any of the other agreements, instruments or documents executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, or the taking of any action under or in connection with any of the foregoing. The obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall NOT survive the termination of this Limited Power of Attorney with respect to actions taken by FASC on behalf of the Adviser during the term of this Limited Power of Attorney.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that indemnification obligations survive termination, while the modified text says they do not. This creates a direct conflict and uncertainty about whether the Adviser must continue to indemnify FASC after the Limited Power of Attorney is terminated, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original clause limits liability to the Fund's assets only, shielding the Adviser's assets. The modification expands the liability to also include the Adviser's assets, creating a significant contradiction regarding the scope of liability and potentially exposing the Adviser to greater financial risk. This introduces uncertainty about which entity bears the ultimate financial responsibility.",

                "changed_text": "The powers and authorities herein granted may be revoked or terminated by the Adviser only with the consent of FASC. Any attempted revocation or termination without FASC's written consent shall be deemed null and void.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants the Adviser the power to revoke the agreement at any time with written notice. The revised text changes this fundamentally, stating that the agreement can ONLY be revoked with the consent of FASC, which gives FASC significant power over the agreement. This is a direct contradiction that severely impacts the Adviser's rights, leading to disputes over whether a termination by the Adviser alone is valid or not. There is now uncertainty about who holds the power to terminate.",

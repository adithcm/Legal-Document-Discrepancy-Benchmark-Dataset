                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting payment deadlines. The original text specifies payment dates of 10 days, 60 days, and 10 days prior to the production session, while the modified text specifies 15 days, 45 days, and 5 days prior to the production session, respectively. This creates uncertainty about the exact payment deadlines, creating potential disputes.",

Such termination may relieve HDS of its obligation to provide any further consideration  pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces conflicting terms regarding termination. The original text specifies a ten (10) day notice period and a seven (7) day cure period, whereas the modified text specifies a five (5) day notice period and a fifteen (15) day cure period. Furthermore, the original text clearly states termination 'shall relieve' HDS of further payment obligations, the modified text uses 'may relieve' introducing ambiguity. This creates uncertainty around the correct termination procedure and obligations.",

(a) Member specifically acknowledges that, pursuant to the Franchise Agreement, and by virtue of its position with Franchisee, Member will receive valuable specialized training and Confidential Information, including, without limitation, information regarding the operational, sales, promotional, and marketing methods and techniques of Franchisor and the System. (b) Member covenants and agrees that during the term of the Franchise Agreement, except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor, Member shall not, either directly or indirectly, for itself, or through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, persons, partnership, corporation, or entity: (i) Own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, rent or lease to, or have any other interest in business that (directly or indirectly) operates, or grants franchises or licenses to operate, a restaurant featuring pizza and related food specialties or that offers products or services substantially similar to those then offered by Pizza Fusions Restaurants (\"Competitive Business\");",

                "explanation": "This change introduces contradictions by changing the acknowledgment of 'valuable specialized training and Confidential Information' to 'some training and general information,' contradicting the premise for the non-compete agreement. Additionally, the non-compete period is limited to the first year, conflicting with the later definition of the \"Post-Term Period\" which is defined as two years, creating ambiguity and uncertainty.",

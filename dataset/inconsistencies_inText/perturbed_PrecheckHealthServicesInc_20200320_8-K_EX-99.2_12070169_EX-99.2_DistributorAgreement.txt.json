                "original_text": "10. This Agreement shall be in effect until March 18. 2021, unless sooner terminated by either party upon (30) days written notice, without cause.",
                "changed_text": "10. This Agreement shall be in effect until March 18. 2021, unless sooner terminated by either party upon (30) days written notice, without cause.\n10a. Notwithstanding section 10, the Principal may terminate this agreement immediately if the Distributor fails to meet sales quotas defined in Exhibit B. Such sales quotas will be communicated by email and are considered accepted unless disputed in writing within 5 business days.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the termination clause. Section 10 states that either party can terminate with 30 days' notice without cause, but section 10a allows the Principal to terminate immediately if the Distributor fails to meet sales quotas, creating uncertainty in the conditions required for agreement termination. The additional requirement of sales quotas in Exhibit B is also not mutually agreed upon, and only communicated via email.",

The Principal shall maintain the right to contact and market its products to potential customers in the Territory; The Principal may fulfill orders directly to customers if the distributor is unable to fulfill the order within 14 business days, in which case the distributor will not receive commission. \n",
                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction. Initially, the Principal agreed to pass all sales leads and orders to the Distributor (section 4). However, the modified text grants the Principal the right to directly fulfill orders if the Distributor cannot fulfill it within 14 days, undermining the Distributor's exclusive (as specified in clause 2) sales rights. This introduces ambiguity about who has the final say on order fulfillment and whether the distributor is truly the only entity selling the products in the Territory.",

                "changed_text": "2. The Principal grants Distributor non- exclusive rights to sell these products within the countries of Romania (the \"Territory\"), which may be amended by mutual written agreement.\n2a. Notwithstanding the above clause, The Principal can unilaterally change the territory to include any country within Europe. The Principal also has the right to appoint other distributors for specific market segments within the Territory, such as government contracts, without requiring the Distributor's consent.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding the territory rights. While section 2 states that the territory can only be amended by mutual written agreement, section 2a allows the Principal to unilaterally change it to include any country within Europe and appoint distributors for market segments within the territory. This undermines the 'non-exclusive rights' granted to the Distributor, potentially leading to disputes about territorial control and sales rights.",

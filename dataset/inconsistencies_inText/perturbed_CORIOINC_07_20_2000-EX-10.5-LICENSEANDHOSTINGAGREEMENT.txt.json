                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the resolution time for Priority 1 incidents. The original text states that Commence One will continue resolution efforts on a 24x7 basis until the incident has been resolved, implying no specific deadline.

The original text implies fixed fees for years 2-5 and beyond (represented by [*]). By adding the statement 'However, Commerce One reserves the right to increase the Maintenance and Support Fees by up to 15% annually after the first year,' it creates uncertainty about whether the listed fees are truly fixed or subject to change.

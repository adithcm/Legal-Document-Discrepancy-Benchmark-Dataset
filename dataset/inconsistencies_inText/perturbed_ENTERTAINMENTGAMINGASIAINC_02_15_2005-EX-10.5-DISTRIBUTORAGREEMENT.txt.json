Distributor agrees that all payments to Vendor for the Products shall be made by wire transfer in United States Dollars (U.S.$); provided, further,\n\n  6.2.1. For all Products to be delivered by Vendor directly to Distributor, the Price shall be paid by Distributor to Vendor within the earlier of: (1) one hundred eighty (180) calendar days from the date of delivery; or (2) thirty (30) calendar days after the sale or rental of the relevant Products by Distributor; and\n\n  6.2.2. For all Products to be delivered by Vendor directly to a third party purchaser of Distributor (as instructed pursuant to the relevant Purchase Order), the Price shall be paid by Distributor to Vendor within forty-five (45) days of Distributor's sale of the Products to the third party purchaser.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in payment terms. Section 6.2.2 originally states payment is due within 45 days of the distributor's sale to a third party. The modification changes this to 180 days. This directly conflicts with the original 45-day deadline, creating confusion and potential disputes regarding when payment is actually due for third-party sales.",

If Distributor fails to purchase or complete the purchase of the Products (or the payment thereof) in the quantities and the times specified in Section 5.1 of this Agreement, Vendor shall have the right to convert this Agreement from an exclusive grant of distribution rights to a non-exclusive grant of distribution rights by providing written notice to Distributor within fourteen (14) days of any date by which Distributor was obliged to purchase the specified quantity of Products as set in Section 5.1 of this Agreement. Upon providing notice to Distributor pursuant to this Section 5.5, Distributor shall no longer be required to purchase balance of the Products required to be purchased pursuant to Section 5.1 of this Agreement. Distributor shall not be liable for any losses or damages incurred by Vendor as a result of Distributor's failure to meet its obligations under Section 5.1 of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding liability for failure to purchase. The original clause explicitly states Distributor 'shall not be liable for any losses or damages'. The modified version changes this to 'shall be liable for any losses or damages'. This introduces direct conflict regarding whether the Distributor is responsible for Vendor's losses in the event of failure to purchase, which can lead to legal disputes.",

Except when this Agreement is terminated due to the uncured breach of Distributor, Distributor shall have within one (1) month of termination of this Agreement the right to return the Products purchased by Distributor to Vendor provided that the Products are unopened upon receipt by Vendor. Distributor will receive a credit for the full price paid by Distributor for the Products.

Except when this Agreement is terminated due to the uncured breach of Distributor, Distributor shall have within six (6) months of termination of this Agreement the right to return the Products purchased by Distributor to Vendor provided that the Products are unopened upon receipt by Vendor. Distributor will receive a credit for half the price paid by Distributor for the Products. Under such circumstances, Vendor shall have the right to market and sell such returns to other customers that may be interested in acquiring the goods referred to herein.",
                "explanation": "This changes the term related to the time the Distributor has to return Products (from 1 month to 6 months) and the amount of the credit received (from full price paid to half the price paid). The Distributor now has more time to return items, however, receives a lower reimbursement than previously agreed. This could cause conflict should the Distributor not return items within the original 1-month window, but still wants to return the items.",

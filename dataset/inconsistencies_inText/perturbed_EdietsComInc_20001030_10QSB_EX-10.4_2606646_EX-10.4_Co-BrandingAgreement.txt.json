Following the Initial Term, Women.com shall have the right, upon no fewer than sixty (60) days prior written notice to eDiets, to increase the amount of the Payment Schedule; provided, that (i) Women.com may not increase the Payment Schedule more than once in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months; and (ii) such increase may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the then current Payment Schedule.",

Following the Initial Term, Women.com shall have the right, upon no fewer than thirty (30) days prior written notice to eDiets, to increase the amount of the Payment Schedule; provided, that (i) Women.com may increase the Payment Schedule no more than twice in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months; and (ii) such increase may not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the then current Payment Schedule.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment schedule. The original text states that Women.com must provide no fewer than 'sixty (60)' days written notice to increase the payment schedule, can only increase the payment schedule 'once' in a twelve (12) month period, and the increase may not exceed 'twenty percent (20%)'. The modified text contradicts each of these conditions, causing confusion.",

The original text specifies the Initial Term to be 'two (2)' years, with renewal terms of 'twelve (12)' months each, and 'sixty (60)' days notice for termination. The modified text changes this to an Initial Term of 'one (1)' year, renewal terms of 'six (6)' months, and 'thirty (30)' days notice for termination, leading to confusion about the contract's duration and renewal conditions.",

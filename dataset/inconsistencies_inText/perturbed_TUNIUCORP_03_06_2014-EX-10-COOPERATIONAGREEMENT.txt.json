Such Service Fee shall be paid to the bank account designated by Party B in writing. If Party B intends to change its bank account, it shall send a written notice to Party A seven business days in advance.",

Such Service Fee shall be paid to the bank account designated by Party B in writing. If Party B intends to change its bank account, it shall send a written notice to Party A thirty business days in advance.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by changing the notice period for bank account changes from seven to thirty business days. This creates ambiguity about the correct notification period, potentially leading to payment disputes and uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'such notice must be given at least 90 days in advance' to section 6.1.1 creates a contradiction. The original clause gives Party B the right to terminate in advance without stating any specific notice period but the added clause contradicts this by requiring a 90-day notice. This uncertainty regarding the required notice period could lead to disputes.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the breaching party shall be responsible to the other Party in respect of any indirect loss or damage caused hereunder.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'neither Party' to 'the breaching party' in the last sentence of section 8.1, a contradiction is introduced regarding liability for indirect losses or damages. The original text explicitly excludes responsibility for indirect losses, while the modified text includes it. This conflict creates ambiguity over which rule applies in the event of a breach, leading to legal uncertainty.",

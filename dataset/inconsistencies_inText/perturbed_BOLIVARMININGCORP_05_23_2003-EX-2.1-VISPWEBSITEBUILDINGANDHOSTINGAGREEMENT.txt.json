                "original_text": "This agreement shall be for a term of five years from the date of this document. This agreement shall renew automatically each year thereafter, unless either party serves written notice of its intention not to renew, on the other at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the then current term of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This agreement shall be for a term of five years from the date of this document. This agreement shall renew automatically each year thereafter, unless either party serves written notice of its intention not to renew, on the other at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the then current term of this agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, either party may terminate this agreement with 30 days written notice, subject to a termination fee as outlined in Exhibit A.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the termination of the agreement. The original text specifies a 90-day notice for non-renewal, implying that termination is only possible at the end of the term. The added sentence allows for termination at any time with 30 days' notice and a fee, creating uncertainty about the actual termination process and conditions.",

However, KCI's Customers will be billed for any storage space used exceeding 5Mbs and for any technical support requests beyond the first 5 hours per month.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an inconsistency in the pricing terms. The original text states that KCI's customers receive the web site setup, maintenance, technical support, and any services 'for no charge'. The added sentence then introduces charges for exceeding storage limits and for excessive tech support, which contradicts the earlier claim of 'no charge'. This creates ambiguity as to what is actually included in the 'no charge' service and what will incur extra fees.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces conflicting remedies for the failure to issue the opinion letter. The original clause specifies liquidated damages of 10% interest per 30 days. The added sentence offers an alternative, where KCI can provide a cash payment instead. This creates ambiguity regarding which remedy YourNetPlus.com can pursue if KCI fails to issue the opinion letter, or whether KCI has the right to choose the remedy.",

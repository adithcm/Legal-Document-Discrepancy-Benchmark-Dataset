                "explanation": "The payment terms are changed from 30 days to 60 days, creating a direct contradiction with any other clauses that might rely on the original 30-day payment window. This introduces uncertainty about the correct payment deadline.",

                "explanation": "The notification period for termination is reduced from 60 days to 30 days. This now contradicts the previous requirement, making it unclear which notice period is valid and enforceable. This causes uncertainty about the conditions to terminate the contract.",

                "explanation": "The statement now says there is no sell-off period following termination, directly contradicting the previous sentence that references the sell-off period defined in APPENDIX 2. This contradiction makes it unclear if the company is supposed to have a sell-off period or not, as well as generating further confusion because APPENDIX 2 defines one.",

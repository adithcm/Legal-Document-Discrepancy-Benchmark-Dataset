                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement and during any sell-off period, MusclePharm shall pay Lender a royalty (the \"Royalty\") of 10% on Net Sales (as defined below) of Licensed Products sold through its wholesale Distribution Channels or retail Distribution Channels, as the case may be and 10% on Net Sales of the Training Video and any Products sold in connection with any Training Video as contemplated pursuant to the last sentence of Section 4(a)(i) above. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Net Sales\" shall mean MusclePharm's gross sales (the gross invoice amount billed customers) of the Licensed Products, less discounts and allowances actually shown on the invoice (except cash discounts, transportation costs and commissions not deductible in the calculation of Royalty) and less any bona fide returns (net of all returns actually made or allowed as supported by credit memoranda actually issued to the customers not to exceed 5% in any reporting cycle), the aggregate of which discounts and allowances shall not exceed 5% in any reporting cycle. No other costs incurred in the manufacturing, selling, advertising, and distribution of the Licensed Products shall be deducted nor shall any deduction be allowed for any uncollectible accounts, allowances or bad debt.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the definition of \"Net Sales\". The original clause limits bona fide returns to 5% per reporting cycle and total discounts to 5%, while the modified clause reduces bona fide returns to 2% and increases the total discounts to 8%. This creates ambiguity and disputes over the correct method for calculating royalties, especially concerning allowable returns and discounts.",

Each such royalty payment shall include an itemized statement showing the nature and source of such royalties, including (i) the number of units of Licensed Products sold (by country and customer); (ii) the total number of units returned for which credit was given and the total dollar amount of such credits, and (iii) the total gross sales and the total royalties due with respect to such gross sales, and each itemized statement shall be certified by a duly authorized officer of MusclePharm.

Such statements shall be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit \"B\" and furnished to Lender whether or not any Licensed Products were sold during the Royalty Period.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by modifying the payment deadline for royalty payments. The original clause mandates payment within 30 days of the end of each quarter, while the modified clause extends this deadline to 60 days. This directly conflicts with the original payment terms, creating uncertainty and potential disputes regarding when payments are considered late.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by adding a condition to the usage of the trademark after the expiration or termination of the agreement.

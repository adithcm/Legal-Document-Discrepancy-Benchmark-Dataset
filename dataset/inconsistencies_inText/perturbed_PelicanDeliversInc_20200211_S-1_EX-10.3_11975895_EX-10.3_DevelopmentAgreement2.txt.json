Any Change Request shall be sufficient to identify, with clarity, any objection, correction, change or amendment to such Milestone Deliverable. In the absence of a Change Request from Client within the time periods detailed herein, the Milestone Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",

Any Change Request shall be sufficient to identify, with clarity, any objection, correction, change or amendment to such Milestone Deliverable. In the absence of a Change Request from Client within twenty (20) days of such Milestone's Acceptance Test Date, the Milestone Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the deadline for the client to submit a Change Request. Originally, the deadline was ten (10) days after the Acceptance Test Date. The changed text extends this deadline to twenty (20) days. This contradicts the original intent of having a quick acceptance process, creating ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction regarding the client's payment obligations upon termination. The original text states that the client will pay fees up to the date of termination. The altered text extends this payment obligation to thirty (30) days *after* the termination date.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by modifying the routing and account numbers for the developer's bank. If the original bank details are valid and another section refers to this payment information, then the altered payment information will lead to confusion in which bank the client has to make the transfer to. This could lead to delayed payments, disputes and a potential breach of contract.",

Subject to the provisions of Article 6.1, the Operating Company shall annually declare and pay by March 15 a distribution to each Party equal to the larger of the two estimated annual tax liabilities as reflected on the approved Party Tax Estimates (the \"Minimum Distribution\"). A portion of the Minimum Distribution shall be paid in advance on a quarterly basis should either Party be required to pay periodic mandatory payments of estimated taxes during any given year. In the event that such estimated taxes are required to be paid by either Party, such Party shall notify the Operating Company of the date of such required payments and the Operating Company shall pay to each Party, no later than 5 business days prior to the due date of each quarterly estimated tax payment specified in the notice above, an amount equal to 25% of the estimated Minimum Distribution. In the event that such distributions of estimate taxes are made within a given year, then the distribution on March 15 of the subsequent year shall be adjusted to reflect the advance distributions of related estimated taxes made prior to that date.",

                "original_text": "In the event that Oceanic Time Warner Cable removes the above content and or terminates this agreement prior to December 31, 2006, Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to pay a cancellation fee of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) per month multiplied by the number of months remain on the agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that Oceanic Time Warner Cable removes the above content and or terminates this agreement prior to December 31, 2006, Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to pay a cancellation fee of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) per month multiplied by the number of months remain on the agreement. However, Oceanic Time Warner Cable may terminate this agreement early without penalty provided they give Watchit Media 30 days written notice. The cancellation fee may be waived at Watchit Media's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by stating that Oceanic Time Warner Cable has to pay a cancellation fee if the agreement is terminated before December 31, 2006, but then adding that they can terminate early without penalty if they give 30 days written notice. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty in enforcement because it is unclear whether the cancellation fee applies if the 30-day notice is given. The last sentence adds further confusion, because Watchit may waive the fee, making it unclear when the cancellation is applied.",

                "changed_text": "Ocean Time Warner Cable will provide Watchit with data on viewership to both Channel 777 and specifically to the content provided by Watchit. However, Ocean Time Warner Cable is only required to provide summary data, and specific viewership data related to Watchit's content will only be provided if available and at Ocean Time Warner Cable's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a conflict. Initially, Oceanic Time Warner Cable *will* provide viewership data. The added sentence, however, states that they are only required to provide summary data, contradicting the initial statement by limiting the scope of the data provided. Furthermore, it makes providing specific data discretionary. This weakens the obligation and creates uncertainty regarding the data Watchit can expect to receive, impacting their ability to measure content performance and advertiser value. It is unclear now what Ocean Time Warner Cable is truly obligated to do.",

                "changed_text": "This agreement will be in effect until the end of 2006 and will be evaluated at that time. This agreement will automatically renew for a period of one year unless either party provides written notice of termination 30 days prior to the end of the initial term. Watchit Media reserves the right to terminate the agreement at any time.",
                "explanation": "The initial sentence states that the agreement ends at the end of 2006. The added sentence says that the agreement will automatically renew unless there is a notification of termination. The final sentence creates additional uncertainty because, on the one hand, the agreement can be automatically extended; on the other, Watchit Media reserves the right to terminate the agreement at any time, regardless of renewal.",

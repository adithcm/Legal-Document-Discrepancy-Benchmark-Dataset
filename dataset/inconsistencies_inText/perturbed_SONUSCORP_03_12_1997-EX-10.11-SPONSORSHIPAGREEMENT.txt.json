The initial payment of $10,000 is due upon signing this agreement, and the remaining balance will be paid within 90 days of the offering's completion.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment schedule for the Sponsor's fee. Originally, the text implied a single payment upon receipt acknowledgement. The modified text splits the payment into an initial payment and a final payment 90 days after the offering completion, which contradicts the original intention. The uncertainty on when to pay the full ammount can create dispute in the contractual obligation.",

The modified text states that these representations and warranties survive indefinitely from the date of signing the agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current term, provided that, in any event,  sections  3, 7 and 8 and, in the event that such  termination  occurs by virtue of paragraph  6.2(b),  subsection 2.5 shall not terminate  (except as set forth  therein)  and shall  continue in full force and effect for the benefit of the Sponsor or the other parties to this Agreement, as the case may be.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement terminates upon certain conditions in section 6.2. The modified text introduces an automatic renewal clause for successive one-year terms unless notice is given. This creates a direct contradiction about the agreement's termination; it can either terminate as described in 6.2 or automatically renew. This ambiguity could lead to disputes regarding the agreement's validity after the initial term.",

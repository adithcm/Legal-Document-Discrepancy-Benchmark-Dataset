                "changed_text": "The undersigned understands that as to GSMS he may or may not be considered an \"affiliate\" under Rule 145(c) as defined in Rule 405 of the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"1933 Act\"), depending on the interpretation of his relationship with the company post-merger. The determination of affiliate status will be at the sole discretion of PSS legal counsel.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by making affiliate status uncertain and dependent on PSS's interpretation, conflicting with the initial statement of understanding and agreement. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes regarding the affiliate's obligations and restrictions under the agreement.",

This could create uncertainty about whether PSS will take actions to allow the affiliate to easily dispose of their stock.",

However, PSS's failure to file such reports will not be considered a breach of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by stating PSS 'agrees' to file reports, then undermining that agreement by saying they are only intending to use 'reasonable efforts' and that failure to file is not a breach. This introduces ambiguity and weakens the affiliate's reliance on PSS fulfilling this obligation.",

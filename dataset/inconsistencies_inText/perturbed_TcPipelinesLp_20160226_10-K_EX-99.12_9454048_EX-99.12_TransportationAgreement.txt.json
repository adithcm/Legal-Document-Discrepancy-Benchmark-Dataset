                "changed_text": "6. TERM: November 01, 2014 to October 31, 2017\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, this agreement may be extended on a month-to-month basis after October 31, 2017, at the sole discretion of the Shipper.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the term of the agreement. Section 6 initially defines a fixed term ending October 31, 2017. The added clause allows the Shipper to unilaterally extend the agreement month-to-month after this date, creating uncertainty about the actual duration and potentially conflicting with provisions that assume a fixed end date. This introduces potential disputes over obligations beyond the initially defined term.",

INCORPORATION OF TARIFF INTO AGREEMENT:\n\nThis Agreement shall incorporate and in all respects be subject to the \"General Terms and Conditions\" and the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) set forth in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, as may be revised from time to time. Transporter may file and seek Commission approval under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) at any time and from time to time to change any rates, charges or provisions set forth in the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) and the \"General Terms and Conditions\" in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, and Transporter shall have the right to place such changes in effect in accordance with the NGA, and this Agreement shall be deemed to include such changes and any such changes",

INCORPORATION OF TARIFF INTO AGREEMENT:\n\nThis Agreement shall incorporate and in all respects be subject to the \"General Terms and Conditions\" and the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) set forth in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, as may be revised from time to time. Notwithstanding the above, should there be any conflict between the General Terms and Conditions outlined in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff and the specific terms in this Transportation Service Agreement, the terms outlined in this Transportation Service Agreement shall take precedence.",
                "explanation": "Section 12 initially states that the agreement is subject to the Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff. The addition of \"Notwithstanding the above...\" introduces a contradiction where the specific terms of the agreement take precedence over the FERC Gas Tariff in case of a conflict. This creates ambiguity about which terms govern in specific situations, undermining the initial incorporation clause and leading to potential disputes. This change can impact the enforceability of certain rights and obligations previously defined by the incorporated FERC tariff.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows for notices via mail, e-mail, fax, *or other agreed upon means*. The modified clause restricts it to mail or e-mail *only*, contradicting the allowance for other agreed means in the very same sentence. This creates uncertainty about the acceptable methods for communication and potential disputes about whether a notice sent via fax, for instance, is valid. There's an in-text contradiction in the accepted means.",

                "changed_text": "Party B will register a foreign-funded company in Fenyi County within 3 months of signing this agreement; Party A will offer all the preferential policies to the company as per local investment promotion policies for foreign investment introduction. However, if the company registration exceeds 6 months, the preferential policies will be subject to review and potential reduction by Party A.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction by initially stating that Party A will offer preferential policies as per local investment policies, but then introduces a condition where these policies could be reduced if the registration exceeds a 6-month timeframe. This contradicts the initial promise of 'all the preferential policies' and introduces uncertainty.",

However, Party A's guarantee is limited to facilitating necessary permits and does not cover delays caused by unforeseen circumstances or changes in national energy policy.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction because it starts by stating Party A 'guarantees' project construction and development but then limits the scope of that guarantee to facilitating permits. This means the project construction is not fully guaranteed as other delays that are outside of permit facilitation may occur. This creates uncertainty over Party A's true obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Party B promises that land nature will not be changed for building large-scale PV grid-connected power generation project in the plot; comprehensive development will be carried out according to relevant national stipulations, such commercial crops may be interplanted as agriculture and forestry as well as medicinal materials; local employees will enjoy the priority to be employed, contingent upon competitive skill assessment; local building materials will be adopted when economically feasible and relevant expenses will be paid within a reasonable timeframe deemed appropriate by Party B.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces several contradictions. Initially, interplanting commercial crops is described as a requirement ('will be carried out'). Changing 'will' to 'may' creates uncertainty about whether it's mandatory. The local employment clause initially prioritized local employees, however, it is now contingent on skill assessments. Finally, adoption of local building materials is now dependent on economic feasibility, which contradicts the original agreement to adopt without specifying limitations. Payment timeframe is also modified from paying 'on schedule' to paying 'within a reasonable timeframe' deemed appropriate by Party B, creating further uncertainty and conflict.",

Each party shall provide the other party with all amounts due under this Agreement for the prior calendar quarter within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Term. Each payment shall be accompanied by a statement detailing the amount of applicable gross revenue received, the calculation of the amount due to the other party and the amount of the payment accompanying such statement. All payments due to either party hereunder shall be made in immediately available U.S. funds, without set-off or counterclaim, free and clear of (and without deduction for or grossed up for, as applicable), any taxes, duties, charges, withholdings, restrictions or conditions of any nature imposed or levied by any governmental taxing or other authority.",

Each party shall provide the other party with all amounts due under this Agreement for the prior calendar quarter within 60 days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Term. Each payment shall be accompanied by a statement detailing the amount of applicable gross revenue received, the calculation of the amount due to the other party and the amount of the payment accompanying such statement. All payments due to either party hereunder shall be made in immediately available U.S. funds, without set-off or counterclaim, free and clear of (and without deduction for or grossed up for, as applicable), any taxes, duties, charges, withholdings, restrictions or conditions of any nature imposed or levied by any governmental taxing or other authority.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment term from 30 days to 60 days creates a conflict with the later clause regarding interest on late payments, as what constitutes a 'late' payment is now ambiguous. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement.",

However, if any payment remains outstanding after 90 days from the end of the calendar quarter, interest will accrue from the initial due date at a rate of 2% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower.",
                "explanation": "This edit directly contradicts the new 60-day payment term specified in section 7.5, creating confusion over when interest applies. It also creates a delayed penalty structure which contrasts with the immediate interest in the original term. The altered terms regarding interest accrual introduces potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "This edit modifies the cure period for breaches of payment obligations to 90 days. Given that the payment deadline (as modified) is 60 days, and interest only applies after 90 days, it is unclear whether there could ever be a breach of payment obligation that would allow for termination.",

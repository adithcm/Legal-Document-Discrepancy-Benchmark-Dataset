                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction. The original text allows any amendment to be filed on behalf of each party, while the changed text requires all parties to review and approve the amendments in writing before filing. This introduces uncertainty about the actual procedure for filing amendments, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows signing in counterparts without any constraint. The added sentence imposes a 5-day deadline for receiving all counterpart signatures, adding a condition for the agreement's validity. This creates uncertainty if some parties sign and return quickly, while others delay, potentially invalidating the entire agreement due to the new restriction.",

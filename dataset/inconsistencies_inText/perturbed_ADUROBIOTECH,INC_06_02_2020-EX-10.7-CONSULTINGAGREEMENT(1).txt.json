                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment deadline. Section 2 initially states that Aduro will pay within thirty days of receiving the invoice. This modification changes the payment deadline to sixty days after receiving the invoice, thus creating conflicting deadlines for payment.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the extension terms. Initially, the contract says that the agreement may be extended based on the mutual written agreement of both parties. This modified text states that the agreement can be extended solely based on Aduro's discretion, with notification to the Consultant, thus creating conflicting requirements for extending the agreement.",

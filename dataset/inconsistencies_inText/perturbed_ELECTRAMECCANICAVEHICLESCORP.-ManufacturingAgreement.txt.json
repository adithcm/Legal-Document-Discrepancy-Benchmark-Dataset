                "original_text": "5.1.2 Manufacturer will invoice EMV for Products net ten (10) days from when the parties sign the Quality Evaluation Form to confirm delivery of Products. 5.1.3 EMV shall pay 70% of total amount of a Purchase Order within ten (10) days of receipt of Manufacturer's invoice as provided in Section 5.1.2 above.",
                "changed_text": "5.1.2 Manufacturer will invoice EMV for Products net ten (10) days from when the parties sign the Quality Evaluation Form to confirm delivery of Products. 5.1.3 EMV shall pay 70% of total amount of a Purchase Order within thirty (30) days of receipt of Manufacturer's invoice as provided in Section 5.1.2 above.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict by stating that EMV has 30 days to pay the invoice in section 5.1.3, while section 5.1.2 implies that the payment should be received much sooner due to the 'net ten (10) days' invoicing term, creating ambiguity around the payment deadline.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by changing the auto-renewal term from one year to two years, creating uncertainty in the length of the contract term after the initial four years.",

                "original_text": "4.6      INTEREST. In the event any payment by Corio under this Agreement is not          made within thirty (30) calendar days of its due date, interest on any          such unpaid amount shall accrue at a rate of eighteen percent (18%) per          annum, or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is less.",
                "changed_text": "4.6      INTEREST. In the event any payment by Corio under this Agreement is not          made within thirty (30) calendar days of its due date, interest on any          such unpaid amount shall accrue at a rate of eighteen percent (18%) per          annum, or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is less.\n\nHowever, notwithstanding the previous statement, Corio shall not be charged any interest for the first 60 days of late payment.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces an in-text contradiction regarding interest on late payments. The original clause states that interest accrues after 30 days, while the added sentence creates an exception for the first 60 days of late payment. This ambiguity makes it unclear whether interest is charged after 30 days or only after 60 days, or not at all if paid between 30 and 60 days, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that Corio has 30 days to cure non-payment, while the modified text changes this cure period to 90 days. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the time allowed for Corio to rectify non-payment before the agreement can be terminated.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that Application Management Revenue fees begin accruing when the customer starts paying for Corio services. The altered text delays this accrual by 90 days. This is a contradiction, leading to uncertainty about when revenue sharing starts.",

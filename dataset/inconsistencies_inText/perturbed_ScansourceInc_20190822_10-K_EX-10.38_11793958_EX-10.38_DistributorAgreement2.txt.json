                "original_text": "Customer's license to use the Software shall be limited to, and Customer shall not use the Software in excess of, a single hardware chassis or card or that number of agent(s), concurrent users, sessions, IP addresses, port(s), seat(s), server(s) or site(s), as set forth in the applicable Purchase Order which has been accepted by Cisco and for which Customer has paid to Cisco the required license fee.",
                "changed_text": "Customer's license to use the Software shall be limited to a single hardware chassis or card. However, the Customer may exceed the number of agent(s), concurrent users, sessions, IP addresses, port(s), seat(s), server(s) or site(s), as set forth in the applicable Purchase Order, provided they pay an additional usage fee to Cisco within 30 days of exceeding the limit. Payment terms for additional usage will be outlined in a separate addendum.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly limits software usage based on the Purchase Order. The modified text introduces a contradictory clause allowing usage beyond these limits by paying an additional fee. This creates uncertainty as it is unclear if the original limitations still apply or if they are overridden by the possibility of paying for additional usage. The lack of detail on the additional usage fee and the undefined 'separate addendum' further increases ambiguity.",

Customer may terminate this Agreement and the license at any time by destroying all copies of Software including any Documentation. Customer's rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Cisco if Customer fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, Customer shall destroy all copies of Software and Documentation in its possession or control.",
                "changed_text": "Term and Termination. This Agreement and the license granted herein shall remain effective for a period of five (5) years, automatically renewing for successive one (1) year terms unless terminated as specified herein. Customer may terminate this Agreement and the license at any time by providing ninety (90) days written notice to Cisco. Customer's rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Cisco if Customer fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, Customer shall destroy all copies of Software and Documentation in its possession or control.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows the customer to terminate the agreement at any time. The modified text introduces a fixed term of five years with automatic renewals and a 90-day written notice requirement for termination. This directly contradicts the original provision for termination at any time, leading to confusion over the actual duration of the agreement and the conditions for termination. There is in-text contradiction now.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for enterprise customers with premium support agreements, the warranty period shall be one (1) year.",
                "explanation": "The original warranty period is the longer of 90 days or the period specified in the warranty card. The modified text shortens the default warranty period to 30 days but introduces an exception for 'enterprise customers with premium support agreements,' extending their warranty to one year. This creates a conflict because it is not clear which customers qualify as 'enterprise customers' or what constitutes a 'premium support agreement.' This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine the applicable warranty period, leading to potential disputes.",

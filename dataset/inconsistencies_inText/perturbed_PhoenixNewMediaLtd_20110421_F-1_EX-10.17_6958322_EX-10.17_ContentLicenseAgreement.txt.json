In the event that such dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) Business Days following such notice,  either Party may upon the expiration of the such 30-day notice period submit such dispute to arbitration by the Hong Kong International  Arbitration Centre in accordance with the arbitration rules of such centre then in effect. The arbitration shall be conducted in Hong  Kong in English and the arbitral award shall be binding upon both Parties. During the resolution (including the arbitration) of the  dispute, the Parties shall continue to perform other portions of this Agreement unaffected by such dispute.",

In the event that such dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) Business Days following such notice,  either Party may upon the expiration of the such 15-day notice period submit such dispute to arbitration by the Hong Kong International  Arbitration Centre in accordance with the arbitration rules of such centre then in effect.

                "explanation": "The original text states a 30-day negotiation period before arbitration, but the changed text reduces it to 15 days. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the required negotiation period, leading to potential disputes.",

However, the changed Section 9.2 adds that this agreement shall automatically renew for an additional five years unless terminated with six month's notice. This contradicts the terms of the original agreement and may result in legal disputes.",

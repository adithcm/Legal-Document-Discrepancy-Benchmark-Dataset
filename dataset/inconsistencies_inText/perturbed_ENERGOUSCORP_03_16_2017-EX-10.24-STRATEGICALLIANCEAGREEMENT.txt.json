From the date a payment is due, unless otherwise agreed, any late payment will accrue a late payment fee of [***] per month, or the highest interest rate permitted by law, whichever is less.",

From the date a payment is due, unless otherwise agreed, any late payment will accrue a late payment fee of [***] per month for the first 30 days, after which point the interest rate will increase to [***] per month, or the highest interest rate permitted by law, whichever is less.",
                "explanation": "The changed text introduces an inconsistency in the late payment fee structure. Initially, the late payment fee is set at [***] per month. However, after 30 days, the fee increases to [***] per month. This creates ambiguity regarding the applicable late payment fee and could lead to disputes over the correct amount due.",

However, ENERGOUS' insurance coverage must extend to five (5) years after the Term.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a consistent insurance requirement for both parties for three years post-term. The modification adds a contradictory requirement that ENERGOUS must maintain insurance for five years post-term. This creates uncertainty about the insurance obligations and may lead to disputes about the required coverage.",

The receipt or acceptance by KI, Inc. of any of the statements furnished pursuant to this Agreement, or of any royalties paid hereunder, or the cashing of any royalty checks paid hereunder, shall not preclude KI, Inc. from questioning the correctness of such statements or payments, provided all such questions are raised with Diplomat within six months of the date of KI Inc's receipt of the statement or payment in question.

The payments are non-refundable.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 If the FDA mandates that a second pivotal phase III clinical trial for the Combination Product is required for registration in the United States, GALEN agrees to pay 50% of the reasonable costs for said study, such costs to be invoiced by LEO on a quarterly basis. Payments should be made within 30 days of invoice receipt. The payments are non-refundable unless LEO fails to meet agreed-upon milestones in the clinical trial, in which case a pro-rata refund will be issued.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that payments are initially non-refundable, but then introduces an exception where refunds are possible if LEO fails to meet milestones. This creates uncertainty regarding the payment terms.",

This payment is non-refundable, except in cases of contract termination due to LEO's gross negligence or willful misconduct, where 50% of the payment will be refunded to GALEN.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction by initially stating the payment is non-refundable, but adding an exception where 50% can be refunded if the contract is terminated due to LEO's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by specifying that official notices must be sent via registered mail or email, but then adding a condition that email notices are only valid with a delivery receipt. The original text stipulated Fax or Registered Mail, where the addition of e-mail could be considered a leniency, this change now makes it unclear if registered mail is an equal substitute to a confirmed e-mail receipt.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Terms of payment will be 1/3 upon  placement  of order and 2/3  balance  net thirty (30) days  or as  mutually  agreed  upon in  writing  between  the  parties.",
                "changed_text": "Terms of payment will be 1/3 upon placement of order and 2/3 balance net sixty (60) days. No other payment terms shall be valid.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding payment deadlines. The original text states 'net thirty (30) days or as mutually agreed upon in writing'. The modified text changes the payment term to 'net sixty (60) days' and removes the clause about mutual agreement, creating an inconsistency that could lead to disputes about the agreed payment terms.",

                "explanation": "This changes the notice period for termination from 60 days to 30 days. This directly contradicts the original clause and introduces uncertainty as to the correct notice period required for terminating the agreement.",

                "explanation": "This change reduces the required insurance coverage amounts that SIERRA warrants it carries. This is a direct contradiction, as the clause now specifies lower coverage amounts than originally stated. This inconsistency creates confusion and potential disputes regarding the required insurance coverage.",

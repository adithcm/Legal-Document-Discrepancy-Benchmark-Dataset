                "explanation": "By adding 'conditionally' adopted, it creates ambiguity about whether the payment is due if the plan adoption has caveats or requirements. This introduces a contradiction with Article V, which doesn't specify conditions for payment stages.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states a full refund is due if the contract's failure is due to the architect. The modified text contradicts this by stating only 50% of the fees are to be refunded. This introduces uncertainty and a point of dispute.",

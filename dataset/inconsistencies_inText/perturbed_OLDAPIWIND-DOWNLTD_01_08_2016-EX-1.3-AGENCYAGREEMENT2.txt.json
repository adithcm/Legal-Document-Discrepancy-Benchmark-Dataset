If no definition is provided by the Agent, Schedule A's definition applies.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by allowing the Agent to define \"Accredited Investor\" differently than Schedule A of the Agency Agreement, potentially creating uncertainty about who qualifies as an Accredited Investor and undermining the intended compliance with securities laws. This uncertainty is especially problematic given the Agents Certificateâ€™s role in confirming Accredited Investor status.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradiction concerning the timing of disclosing Disqualification Events. The original text mandates that descriptions of the Disqualification Events must be furnished *prior* to the date of the certificate. The altered text allows the description to be furnished up to *5 business days after* the date of the certificate. This contradicts the requirement for pre-existing disclosure and creates uncertainty about whether compliance is determined before or after the certificate date. This also weakens the Corporation's ability to properly assess risks before the transaction.",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text by allowing the Agent to waive \"non-essential requirements\" of Schedule A. Since the original clause states that the offering *has been* conducted in accordance with Schedule A, this later exception creates an inconsistency. It is unclear what constitutes a \"non-essential requirement\" and who determines this, which injects ambiguity and potential disputes.",

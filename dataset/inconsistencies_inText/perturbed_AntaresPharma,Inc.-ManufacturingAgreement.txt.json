                "changed_text": "4.2 Invoices and Payment.\n\n(a) Antares shall submit to AMAG an invoice (each, an \"Invoice\") for all Products, sample Products and Trainers delivered to AMAG pursuant to this Agreement. All Invoices shall set forth in reasonable detail (i) the Products, sample Products and Trainers delivered, (ii) the quantity of Products, sample Products and Trainers delivered, and (iii) the applicable Transfer Price for the Products, sample Products and Trainers delivered. Unless otherwise mutually agreed, all Invoices shall be submitted by Antares to AMAG on or about the Delivery Date. AMAG shall pay all undisputed amounts set forth in an Invoice within [***] after the date of receipt of such Invoice. If AMAG disputes any amount set forth on any Invoice, AMAG shall notify Antares in writing of the basis for such dispute within [***] after the date of receipt of such Invoice, and AMAG shall pay all undisputed amounts on such Invoice within [***] after the date of receipt of such Invoice. The Parties shall work together in good faith to resolve any such dispute; provided, however, that AMAG shall not be entitled to offset any disputed amounts against any amounts due under any other Invoice. Late payments shall accrue interest at a rate of 1.5% per month, or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date the payment was originally due until the date payment is made. Payment shall be made in U.S. dollars by wire transfer or other means as may be agreed upon by the Parties.\n\n(b) Antares shall submit to AMAG an invoice (each, an \"Invoice\") for all Products, sample Products and Trainers delivered to AMAG pursuant to this Agreement.

Late payments shall not accrue interest under any circumstances.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding interest on late payments. Section 4.2(a) states that late payments will accrue interest, while a new subsection (b) indicates that late payments will not accrue interest, creating uncertainty about the applicable terms.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, AMAG's termination rights with respect to an Antares' failure to supply Products, sample Products or Trainers, including a Supply Failure, are not subject this Section 7.2(a) and are set forth in Section 7.2(b);\n\n(b) Subject to Section 12.4, if a Supply Failure remains uncured for [***] following written notice of such failure to Antares; provided, however, that AMAG may not terminate this Agreement if Antares' failure to supply Products, sample Products or Trainers is a result of Force Majeure Event under Section 12.4 or AMAG's breach of this Agreement including, but not limited to, failure to provide adequate quantities of Prefilled Syringe;",

                "explanation": "The addition of section 7.2(c) which allows AMAG to terminate the agreement for any reason with [***] written notice directly conflicts with sections 7.2(a) and 7.2(b) which outline specific conditions required for termination based on uncured breaches or supply failure. This introduces significant ambiguity as to what termination clauses hold, since in effect section 7.2(c) overrides the prerequisites defined in 7.2(a) and 7.2(b)",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by first excluding liability for indirect, incidental, consequential, etc. damages, but then stating that nothing limits liability for *any* direct damages. Since direct damages can often encompass items like 'loss of profits,' the effect is contradictory and ambiguous, because 9.4(a) excludes loss of profits, but 9.4(b) says that there is no limit of exclusion of liability for any direct damages.",

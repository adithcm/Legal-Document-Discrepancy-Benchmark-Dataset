                "changed_text": "5. Term Payments. No payment is due from Programmer to Licensee for broadcast of the Programs pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n5.1 Payment Schedule. Notwithstanding Section 5, Programmer shall pay Licensee an annual fee of $10,000 for the broadcast of the Programs, payable in quarterly installments of $2,500, due on the first day of each calendar quarter. Failure to make timely payments will result in a late fee of 5% per month.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction. Section 5 originally states that no payment is due. Section 5.1 is introduced and establishes a payment schedule and late fees. This creates ambiguity about whether payments are actually required under the agreement and introduces uncertainty about enforcement of late fees.",

The occurrence of the following will be deemed an Event of Default by Licensee under this Agreement: (a) Licensee fails to observe or perform its obligations contained in this Agreement in any material respect; or (b) Licensee breaches the representations and warranties made by it under this Agreement in any material respect.\n11.3 Cure Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Event of Default will not be deemed to have occurred until fifteen (15) days after the non-defaulting party has provided the defaulting party with written notice specifying the Event of Default and such Event of Default remains uncured.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Event of Default by the Licensee will not be deemed to have occurred until fifteen (15) days after the non-defaulting party has provided the defaulting party with written notice specifying the Event of Default and such Event of Default remains uncured. However, any Event of Default by the Programmer will be deemed to have occurred immediately without any notice or cure period.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the cure period for events of default. Initially, both parties have a 15-day cure period. The modified text states that the Licensee still has a 15-day cure period, but the Programmer's default is deemed to have occurred immediately with no notice or cure period. This creates an imbalance and contradiction in the default terms, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradiction regarding third-party rights. Section 15 explicitly states that the agreement is for the exclusive benefit of the parties and their successors/assigns, and no third-party rights are conferred. Section 15.1 then contradicts this by naming Emmis Communications Corporation as a third-party beneficiary with the right to enforce the agreement. This creates ambiguity about the scope of third-party rights and potential disputes about enforcement.",

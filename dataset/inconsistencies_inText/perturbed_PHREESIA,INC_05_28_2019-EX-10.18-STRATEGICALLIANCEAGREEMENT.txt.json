                "original_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 17.3, each party will pay all properly invoiced fees within [***] after its receipt of a proper invoice therefor. All payments hereunder will be invoiced in U.S. Dollars. All payments hereunder will be made by wire transfer to the account specified by each Party; provided that a Party shall provide at least [***] advance notice of any changes to its account. [***].",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 17.3, each party will pay all properly invoiced fees within [***] after its receipt of a proper invoice therefor. However, for invoices related to Merchant Processing Services, the payment term is strictly 15 days from the invoice date. All payments hereunder will be invoiced in U.S. Dollars. All payments hereunder will be made by wire transfer to the account specified by each Party; provided that a Party shall provide at least [***] advance notice of any changes to its account. [***].",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates a contradiction by specifying a standard payment term of [***] while introducing a shorter, conflicting payment term of 15 days specifically for Merchant Processing Services. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty in enforcement, as it is unclear which payment term should apply to Merchant Processing Services invoices.",

This restriction applies indefinitely and survives the termination of this agreement. [***].",
                "explanation": "By removing 'and for a period of [***] thereafter', the modified text eliminates the time limit on the non-solicitation clause. This change introduces an in-text contradiction since it implies the non-solicitation clause will remain in effect forever and it contradicts with the survival section which mentions the non-solicitation clause survives for [***] after the term. The original clause and the modified clause now present conflicting durations for the non-solicitation agreement.",

However, if either party has provided written notice of non-renewal, it is automatically renewed regardless.",
                "explanation": "The modified text adds an additional sentence that makes the non-renewal notice ineffective by automatically renewing the contract regardless, which contradicts the orginal section.",

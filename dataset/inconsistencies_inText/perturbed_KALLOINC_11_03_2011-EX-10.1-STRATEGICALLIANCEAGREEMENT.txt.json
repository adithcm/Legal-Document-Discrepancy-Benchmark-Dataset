                "original_text": "d) Payment terms: For each Kallo Mobile care suite of products license ordered by Agent from Kallo, Agent shall  pay to Kallo the transfer price set forth in Schedule A. 50% of the total amount to be paid with the signed purchase  order, 35% upon shipping of the goods to the carrier at Canadian port and 15% upon completion of the installation.  Upon delivery of the system the Agent is responsible for getting the signed EULA from the customer before the  installation process starts.",
                "changed_text": "d) Payment terms: For each Kallo Mobile care suite of products license ordered by Agent from Kallo, Agent shall  pay to Kallo the transfer price set forth in Schedule A. 50% of the total amount to be paid with the signed purchase  order, 35% within 30 days of the signed purchase order, and 15% upon completion of the installation.  Upon delivery of the system the Agent is responsible for getting the signed EULA from the customer before the  installation process starts.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding the payment deadline. Originally, the 35% payment was due upon shipping, but now it is due within 30 days of the signed purchase order. This creates uncertainty about when the payment should be made, leading to potential disputes over contractual obligations.",

Failure to comply  with this will be considered a material breach of this agreement. This also includes responsibilities for Kallo and the  project management entity (BASCIC) appointed jointly by Kallo and the Agent.",

Failure to comply  with this will be considered a material breach of this agreement. This also includes responsibilities for Kallo and the  project management entity (BASCIC) appointed jointly by Kallo and the Agent. However, BASCIC's actions cannot be considered a material breach of the agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradiction by stating that the agent's failure to comply with their responsibilities as outlined in Schedule C is considered a material breach of the agreement. Simultaneously, it indicates that BASCIC's actions, even though they are the project management entity appointed jointly, cannot be considered a material breach. This discrepancy introduces ambiguity as it is uncertain whether the responsibilities of BASCIC hold the same weight as others when evaluating a material breach.",

                "explanation": "This edit creates an in-text contradiction by asserting that the agent's rights cease immediately upon termination, yet simultaneously permitting the agent to retain Kallo products for up to 12 months to service existing clients. This creates ambiguity concerning the agent's entitlements and responsibilities during the post-termination period, leading to disputes.",

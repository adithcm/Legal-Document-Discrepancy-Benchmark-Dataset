                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction by stating that the payment will be made within 30 days, while Clause 5 previously mentioned payment would occur within 7 days. This creates uncertainty about the enforcement of payment deadlines.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original agreement period. The agreement initially states a maximum period of six months, but is now changed to twelve months, creating confusion and uncertainty about the actual duration of the contract. This is a clear contradiction regarding a key term.",

If the customer terminates the agreement, then VAL shall compensate the Developer up to the date of termination with a fee calculated on Pro-rata basis. Developer may also terminate this Agreement by giving two (2) weeks' notice in writing to VAL. It is applicable only when the project is not completed.

If the customer terminates the agreement, then VAL shall compensate the Developer up to the date of termination with a fee calculated on Pro-rata basis. Developer may also terminate this Agreement with immediate effect by providing verbal notice to VAL. In case Developer terminates the agreement, it shall handover the entire project related IPR, work done till date to VAL.",
                "explanation": "The original termination clause requires the developer to provide two weeks' notice in writing, and states 'it is applicable only when the project is not completed'. This has been modified to enable immediate verbal termination and removes the 'project is not completed' limitation. This creates conflicting termination procedures and impacts the protection that the two week period might afford VAL. Verbal vs written notice is contradictory.",

On delivery by Medica of a shipment of Cartridges in accordance with Section 3.3, Medica shall issue to Vapotherm an invoice for that shipment stating a price consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Vapotherm shall pay each such invoice in full within [* * *] Calendar Days from the date of invoice, unless Vapotherm has rejected the shipment in question in accordance with Section 4.2.",

Vapotherm shall pay each such invoice in full within [* * *] Calendar Days from the date of invoice, unless Vapotherm has rejected the shipment in question in accordance with Section 4.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vapotherm may, at its sole discretion, elect to defer payment of any invoice for up to [* * *] Calendar Days from the date of invoice, subject to a late payment fee calculated as described in Section 3.8.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict in payment terms. Section 3.7 initially states that invoices shall be paid within [* * *] Calendar Days. The addition allows Vapotherm to defer payment for up to [* * *] Calendar Days, creating uncertainty about the mandatory payment deadline.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict in Section 3.8. The original text imposes a penalty for late payments beyond [* * *] days, while the addition exempts Vapotherm from this penalty if they have elected the deferral option outlined in the changed Section 3.7. This contradicts the initial strict timeline for penalties.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the decay of rights and obligations after termination. Section 13.3(b) initially states that all rights and obligations decay after 2 years from termination. The added clause introduces an exception: 'unless otherwise agreed in writing by both parties at the time of termination.' This creates ambiguity about whether the 2-year decay is a hard rule or subject to negotiation, making it an in-text contradiction.",

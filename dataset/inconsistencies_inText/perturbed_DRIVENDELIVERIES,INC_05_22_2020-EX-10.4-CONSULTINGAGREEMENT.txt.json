                "explanation": "The original clause states a term of 'sooner of six months or replacement'. The modified clause sets a fixed term of twelve months, creating a contradiction. This introduces uncertainty as to how long the agreement is actually valid, leading to potential disputes regarding the duration of the consulting services and related obligations.",

Upon any termination, all rights and duties of the Company and Consultant toward each other shall cease except: (a) The Company will pay, within forty-five (45) days after the effective date of termination, all amounts owing to Consultant for Services completed and accepted by the Company prior to the termination date and related reimbursable expenses, if any, submitted in accordance with the Company's policies and in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 of this Agreement; and (b) Article 2 (Confidentiality), Article 3 (Ownership), Section 4.2 (Covenant Not to Compete), Section 4.3 (Non-Solicitation), Section 4.4 (Non-Circumvention), Article 5 (Return of Company Materials), Article 7 (Term and Termination), Article 8 (Independent Contractor Relationship), Article 9 (Indemnification), Article 10 (Limitation of Liability), Article 11 (Arbitration and Equitable Relief), and Article 12 (Miscellaneous) will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies payment within 'thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination'. The modified clause changes this to 'forty-five (45) days'. This creates a direct conflict regarding the payment deadline upon termination, causing confusion and potential disputes about when the final payment is actually due to the consultant.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states a flat monthly fee. The modified clause adds a condition: payment is contingent on CEO approval. This creates an inconsistency. The consultant is contracted for a flat rate, but the amendment introduces a subjective element that could delay or eliminate payments if approval is withheld. This introduces uncertainty regarding guaranteed compensation.",

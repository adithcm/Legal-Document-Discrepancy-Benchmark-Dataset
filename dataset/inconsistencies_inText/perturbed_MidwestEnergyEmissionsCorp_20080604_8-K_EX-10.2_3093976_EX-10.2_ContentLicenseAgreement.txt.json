                "original_text": "C. Subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable content agreement with such Licensor, the Net Advertising Revenue shall be calculated on a quarterly calendar basis (the \"Net Advertising Revenue Period\") and shall be payable no later than sixty (60) days after the termination of the preceding full quarter-annual period, i.e., commencing on the first (1st) day of January, April, July and October except that the first and last calendar periods may be \"short,\" depending on the effective date of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "C. Subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable content agreement with such Licensor, the Net Advertising Revenue shall be calculated on a quarterly calendar basis (the \"Net Advertising Revenue Period\") and shall be payable no later than thirty (30) days after the termination of the preceding full quarter-annual period, i.e., commencing on the first (1st) day of January, April, July and October except that the first and last calendar periods may be \"short,\" depending on the effective date of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by modifying the payment deadline for Net Advertising Revenue. Initially, the revenue was to be paid within 60 days after the quarter's end. The modified text reduces this period to 30 days, creating conflicting instructions regarding when payment is due, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes.",

All books and records relative to COMPANY'S obligations to a particular Licensor hereunder shall be maintained and made accessible to that Licensor for inspection at a location in Los Angeles, California for at least six (6) months after termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause. By reducing the record maintenance period from 12 months to 6 months after termination, it becomes unclear how long Company must retain these financial records, thus creating a conflict and potentially limiting the Licensor's audit rights and introducing enforcement ambiguity.",

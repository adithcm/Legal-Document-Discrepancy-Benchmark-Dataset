                "original_text": "1.1 \"Affiliate\" means any company which is directly or indirectly controlled by BKC, controls BKC, or is controlled by a company which in turn controls BKC, and \"control\" for these purposes means de facto control.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 \"Affiliate\" means any company which is directly or indirectly controlled by BKC, controls BKC, or is controlled by a company which in turn controls BKC. For the purposes of Section 15 concerning disposal, \"control\" means de facto control, while for all other sections, \"control\" means ownership of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the voting equity in such entity.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by defining 'control' differently for Section 15 (Disposal) compared to all other sections of the agreement. This creates uncertainty in enforcement regarding transfer of interest and stock ownership by principals, as the level of control required depends on which section of the agreement is being referenced.",

Franchisee shall be in default under this Agreement upon the occurrence of any of the following events or conditions (individually, an \"Event of Default\" and collectively, the \"Events of Default\"): (a) If the Franchisee fails to pay when due any amount owed to BKC under this Agreement, and does not cure such failure within ten (10) days of delivery of written notice of such failure.",

Franchisee shall be in default under this Agreement upon the occurrence of any of the following events or conditions (individually, an \"Event of Default\" and collectively, the \"Events of Default\"): (a) If the Franchisee fails to pay when due any amount owed to BKC under this Agreement, and does not cure such failure within ten (10) days of delivery of written notice of such failure. However, for the purposes of royalty payments under Section 9.1, the cure period shall be thirty (30) days.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation creates a conflict regarding the cure period for payment defaults. The main default clause states a 10-day cure period, but a specific exception is introduced for royalty payments, extending the cure period to 30 days. This causes ambiguity and uncertainty about which timeframe applies, potentially leading to disputes and selective enforcement.",

This Agreement shall become valid when executed and accepted by BKC in Miami, Florida; it shall be governed and construed under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida; U.S.A.; provided, however, that since the Franchisee is a corporation formed under the laws of the Republic of Poland which is not doing business in the State of Florida, the Florida Franchise Act, Florida Statutes Section 817.416(1971) shall not apply to this Agreement.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes related to intellectual property rights shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of Poland.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction regarding the governing law. The main clause states that Florida law governs the agreement, but an exception is added specifying that intellectual property disputes are governed by the laws of the Republic of Poland. This introduces confusion and uncertainty about which jurisdiction's laws apply to different aspects of the agreement, especially considering the importance of intellectual property in a franchise agreement.",

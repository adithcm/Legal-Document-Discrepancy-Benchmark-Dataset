Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the properties Robots and Ice Age II only, the term shall extend to December 31, 2008.\"",
                "explanation": "This creates an inconsistency in the term. It states that the term ends on March 31, 2008 for all listed properties. However, it then states that for Robots and Ice Age II specifically, the term extends to December 31, 2008, contradicting the initial statement. This creates uncertainty as to the actual expiry date of the license for Robots and Ice Age II.",

However, Section 5 regarding payment terms is explicitly not ratified and shall be subject to renegotiation within 30 days of this amendment.",
                "explanation": "This amendment explicitly ratifies the entire agreement except as amended. However, it then singles out Section 5 (payment terms) as not ratified and subject to renegotiation. This directly contradicts the earlier statement of full ratification, creating confusion about which payment terms are in effect during that 30-day renegotiation window or if section 5 is valid at all.",

                "explanation": "By adding the phrase \"with the exception of any terms found to be against Licensor's best interest,\" this introduces a significant contradiction. The initial statement asserts that both parties agree to ALL terms and conditions. The added exception allows Fox (Licensor) to unilaterally reject any term they deem unfavorable, effectively negating the mutual agreement and undermining the enforceability of the entire contract.",

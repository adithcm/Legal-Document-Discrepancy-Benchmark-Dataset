                "explanation": "Adding \"with a further 30-day grace period\" to the payment terms creates a contradiction. The original text implies payments are due within 30 days of the previous payment, while the addition suggests a grace period exists, which could be interpreted as extending the deadline. This introduces ambiguity regarding the actual due date and when late payment penalties would apply.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'this includes unlimited consultation calls', a contradiction is created. The overall support is limited to 40 hours/220 emails, yet unlimited consultation calls are promised. This creates uncertainty on whether calls are separate from the hour/email limits, leading to potential disputes on what constitutes 'reasonable technical support'.",

However, if there is a significant lack of communication regarding the status of the Deliverables, then this can be deemed a violation of this Agreement, at the discretion of On2.",
                "explanation": "The original text provided clear deadlines after which failure to deliver would be a violation. The modified text removes those deadlines, stating that delayed delivery is *not* a violation, but then contradicts itself by saying a lack of communication *can* be a violation (with no specific measure), placing the decision solely at On2's discretion. This lacks clarity and creates an enforcement conflict.",

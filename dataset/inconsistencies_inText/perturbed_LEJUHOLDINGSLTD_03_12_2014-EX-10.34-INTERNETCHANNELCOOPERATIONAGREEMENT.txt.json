The cooperation fee will be payable in four installments as follows   (a) Within 15 business days after the date hereof, Party B will pay RMB50 million to Party A.   (b) Within 15 business days after the end of the first cooperation period, Party B will pay another RMB50 million to Party A.   (c) Within 15 business days after the end of the second cooperation period, Party B will pay another RMB50 million to Party A.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment deadlines. Initially, the payment for the first installment is due within 15 business days, but it changes to 30 business days, 10 business days for the second installment, 20 business days for the third installment and 25 business days for the last installment. This in-text contradiction creates uncertainty and ambiguity in enforcing the payment schedule. Thus, it leads to disputes over payment dates.",

The original text states that Party C is severally and jointly liable for all obligations of Party B, meaning Party C can be held responsible for all or any part of Party B's obligations. The modified text states that Party C is severally liable for 50% of the obligations, limiting their liability. This contradiction creates uncertainty in enforcement, as it is unclear whether Party C is responsible for all obligations or only half.",

                "original_text": "5. This Contract, when attached to a purchase order, shall consist of the entire agreement between the parties and shall  supersede any conflicting or contrary terms and conditions of any purchase order or other order form whether supplied  by Purchaser or Supplier.",
                "changed_text": "5. This Contract, when attached to a purchase order, shall consist of the entire agreement between the parties. However, specific terms outlined in a mutually agreed-upon purchase order will take precedence over conflicting terms in this contract regarding quantity and delivery dates.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that the contract is the entire agreement but then allowing purchase orders to supersede certain terms (quantity and delivery dates). This creates uncertainty about which document governs in case of conflicting terms related to quantity and delivery, thus impacting enforcement.",

This Contract may not be modified or terminated except in writing, and no claimed modification, termination or waiver  shall be binding unless also signed by an authorized representative of Playboy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser reserves the right to unilaterally amend the contract with 30 days written notice to Supplier if required to comply with regulatory changes.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that the contract can only be modified in writing with Playboy's signature, but then grants the Purchaser the right to unilaterally amend the contract under certain circumstances. This creates ambiguity about the modification process and who has the ultimate authority to change the agreement, impacting enforcement.",

VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT BY SUPPLIER MAY RESULT IN PROSECUTION FOR PLAYBOY PROPERTIES INFRINGEMENT, UNFAIR COMPETITION AND OTHER CAUSES OF ACTION AND THE  IMPOSITION OF FINES AND/OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES. However, minor deviations from the specified product quality standards will only result in a warning, unless the deviations are deemed intentional.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that any violation may result in prosecution and fines but then states minor deviations in product quality will only result in a warning unless intentional. This introduces subjectivity and differing levels of penalties for violations creating enforcement uncertainty.",

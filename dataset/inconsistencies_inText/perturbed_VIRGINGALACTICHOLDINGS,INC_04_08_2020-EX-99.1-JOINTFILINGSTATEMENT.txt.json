However, each party is fully responsible for the completeness and accuracy of all information contained herein, including information concerning other parties, regardless of knowledge or belief of inaccuracy.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction. The original text states that each party is only responsible for their own information, unless they know or suspect inaccuracies in others' information. The revised text makes each party fully responsible for all information, regardless of knowledge, creating uncertainty about the extent of their liability.",

All subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G must be filed individually by each of the undersigned, and a separate joint acquisition statement is required for each amendment.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the filing of amendments. The original text states that amendments will be filed on behalf of all parties without requiring additional joint acquisition statements. The revised text mandates individual filings and new joint acquisition statements for each amendment, contradicting the initial agreement and creating confusion regarding the correct filing procedure.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this agreement may be terminated by any party with 30 days written notice regardless of whether other parties agree to the termination.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the termination of the agreement. The original clause implies that revocation only affects the revoking party, while the added sentence allows any party to terminate the entire agreement with 30 days' notice, regardless of other parties' consent. This creates uncertainty about the conditions under which the agreement can be terminated and whether unanimous consent is required.",

                "changed_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate. However, all parties are jointly and severally liable for any misstatements or omissions in the filing, irrespective of individual knowledge.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a direct conflict regarding liability for inaccuracies. The original text limits responsibility to the individual's own information, unless they have knowledge of inaccuracies in others' information. The added sentence introduces joint and several liability, meaning each party is liable for the entire filing, regardless of their individual knowledge or contribution to the error. This contradiction creates uncertainty regarding the extent of liability for inaccurate information within the joint filing.",

However, individual parties reserve the right to file independently if they deem the joint filing process to be detrimental to their individual interests.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement mandates joint filing. The added clause allows parties to file independently if they believe the joint filing is detrimental, creating a conflict. This undermines the agreement's purpose and raises questions about enforcement and whether joint filing is truly mandatory.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment deadline. The original text specifies payment within 30 days, while the modified text extends this to 60 days, creating uncertainty regarding the agreed-upon payment timeframe. This could lead to disputes over late payment fees or breach of contract.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by reversing the order of precedence between the Master Service Agreement and the Project-specific Addenda. The original text states that the Agreement prevails unless otherwise specified in the Addenda, while the modified text gives precedence to the Addenda unless the Agreement states otherwise. This directly contradicts the original intent and creates confusion about which document controls in case of conflicting terms, leading to potential legal disputes and uncertainty of enforcement.",

In the event of termination by Client for reasons other than default by CRO, Client shall pay all sums owing to CRO, but unpaid, for work performed to date of receipt of termination notice, and all reasonable and necessary costs associated with the termination itself or to which CRO is committed to pay.",
                "changed_text": "4.2. Client may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days written notice without cause. In the event of termination by Client for reasons other than default by CRO, Client shall pay 50% of all remaining fees owed to CRO under the project addenda, regardless of work performed to date of receipt of termination notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by altering the payment terms upon termination by the Client without cause. The original clause specifies payment for work performed to date, plus reasonable termination costs. The modified clause replaces this with a fixed payment of 50% of all remaining fees. This creates an inconsistency, as it is unclear whether the Client must pay for completed work or just the fixed percentage, irrespective of completion status, leading to disputes about the amount owed and creates uncertainty of enforcement.",

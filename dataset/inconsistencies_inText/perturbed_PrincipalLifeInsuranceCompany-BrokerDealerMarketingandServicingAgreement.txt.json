                "original_text": "18. Issuer and Distributor may change the compensation schedules set forth in the attached Exhibits at any time and will notify Broker Dealer of the revised compensation schedules electronically or by other writing in advance of the effective date of the change. Any change to the compensation schedules will affect only commissions payable on Annuity Contracts with an effective date on or after the effective date of the change, unless otherwise provided or required by law. Issuer or Distributor may discontinue the issuance of any form of Annuity Contract and fix the amount of compensation on Annuity Contracts issued in exchange for previously issued Annuity Contracts.",
                "changed_text": "18. Issuer and Distributor may change the compensation schedules set forth in the attached Exhibits at any time and will notify Broker Dealer of the revised compensation schedules electronically or by other writing in advance of the effective date of the change. Any change to the compensation schedules will affect only commissions payable on Annuity Contracts with an effective date on or after the effective date of the change, unless otherwise provided or required by law. However, any decrease in compensation will only affect new annuity contracts purchased 90 days after the notification. Issuer or Distributor may discontinue the issuance of any form of Annuity Contract and fix the amount of compensation on Annuity Contracts issued in exchange for previously issued Annuity Contracts.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction. The original clause states changes affect contracts with an effective date 'on or after' the change, while the modification adds that decreases only apply to contracts purchased '90 days after notification'. This creates uncertainty about when decreased compensation applies, especially to contracts effective soon after the change is announced.",

Servicing agent means the broker dealer or Registered Representative appointed by us and accepted by the contract owner as the  servicing agent. If the contract owner requests a change in the servicing agent or if we decide that a change would be in the best  interests of the contract owner, trail commissions will be paid to the new servicing agent or his/her broker dealer where appropriate.  No trail commissions are paid after termination of this Agreement.",

Servicing agent means the broker dealer or Registered Representative appointed by us and accepted by the contract owner as the  servicing agent. If the contract owner requests a change in the servicing agent or if we decide that a change would be in the best  interests of the contract owner, trail commissions may be paid to the new servicing agent or his/her broker dealer where appropriate.  No trail commissions are paid after termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, trail commissions will continue to be paid to the original servicing agent even after a change of servicing agent if the change was initiated by the Issuer for a period of 1 year.",
                "explanation": "This adds a contradictory condition regarding trail commissions. The first part suggests commissions switch to the new servicing agent, but the added sentence says commissions remain with the original agent for a year if the Issuer initiated the change. This creates confusion about who receives trail commissions in such a scenario, leading to potential disputes.",

In addition, Distributor and Issuer reserve the right   to terminate this Agreement in the event that any producer of Broker Dealer is suspended, disciplined or   found to be in violation of governing insurance or securities laws, rules or regulations.

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction to the termination clause. The original clause allows for termination if a producer is disciplined. The modification adds a 30-day cure period before Distributor/Issuer can terminate. This now creates ambiguity about whether immediate termination is permitted upon a producer's suspension/discipline, or if the cure period must always be applied, impacting enforcement of the termination clause.",

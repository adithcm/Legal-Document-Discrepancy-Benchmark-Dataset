(a) If there has been a successful Remarketing, the Company shall pay to the Remarketing Agent for the  performance of its services as Remarketing Agent hereunder on the Remarketing Settlement Date, by wire transfer to an account designated by the  Remarketing Agent, a fee in an amount equal to 25 basis points (0.25%) of the Accreted Value of the Remarketed Securities.",
                "changed_text": "Section 4. Fees and Expenses. (a) If there has been a successful Remarketing, the Company shall pay to the Remarketing Agent for the  performance of its services as Remarketing Agent hereunder within 10 business days of the Remarketing Settlement Date, by wire transfer to an account designated by the  Remarketing Agent, a fee in an amount equal to 25 basis points (0.25%) of the Accreted Value of the Remarketed Securities.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the payment deadline. Initially, the fee was due *on* the Remarketing Settlement Date. Now, it's due *within 10 business days* of that date. This creates uncertainty because both clauses define the payment deadline, leading to ambiguity about the actual due date.",

This Agreement shall terminate (i) the Business Day immediately following the Remarketing Settlement Date, (ii) at 5:00  p.m., New York City time, on the last date of the Remarketing if the Remarketing is not successful or (iii) on the effective date of the resignation or  removal of the Remarketing Agent and the appointment of a new Remarketing Agent.",

This Agreement shall terminate (i) 30 days after the Business Day immediately following the Remarketing Settlement Date, (ii) at 5:00  p.m., New York City time, on the last date of the Remarketing if the Remarketing is not successful or (iii) on the effective date of the resignation or  removal of the Remarketing Agent and the appointment of a new Remarketing Agent.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the termination date. Initially, the agreement terminates the business day immediately following the settlement date. Now, it terminates 30 days after that business day.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by limiting the survival period. Initially, the agreement states that the indemnities, representations, warranties survive the remarketing indefinitely, which means it remains in full force. Now, it is limited to 1 year. This introduces ambiguity about how long obligations from the original agreement remain in effect.",

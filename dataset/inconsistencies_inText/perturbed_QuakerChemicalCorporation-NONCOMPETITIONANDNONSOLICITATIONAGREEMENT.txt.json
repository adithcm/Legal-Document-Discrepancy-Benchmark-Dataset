Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope.",

                "explanation": "By removing the $25,000,000 limitation on net sales from product lines within the definition of Company Business for acquired businesses, this change directly contradicts the original clause. The original clause restricts Sellers from engaging in businesses that compete with the Combined Business if the acquired business received more than $25,000,000 in net sales from product lines included within the definition of Company Business. The modified text removes this restriction, creating uncertainty as to whether acquired businesses are subject to the non-compete restrictions. This conflict makes the enforceability of the non-compete clause ambiguous.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former 3 employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"shall not permit\" to \"shall permit\", we create a direct contradiction regarding the ability of the Seller to hire employees they solicited via general solicitation. The original text forbids hiring those employees during the Non-Solicit Period. The modified text allows it, creating an inconsistency that is difficult to enforce, and undermines the purpose of the Non-Solicit Period.",

                "explanation": "This introduces several contradictions regarding notice. First, it removes the distinction between normal business hours and after hours for email notices, implying they are effective immediately regardless of when sent. Second, it changes the mail delivery method from certified/registered mail with return receipt requested to standard mail, significantly increasing delivery uncertainty, and extends the delivery timeframe from 3 days to 10 days. This creates an inconsistent and unreliable system for providing notice, making it more difficult to determine when notice is legally effective and undermining the contractual requirements.",

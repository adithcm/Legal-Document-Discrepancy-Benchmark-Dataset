                "original_text": "\"Affiliate(s)\" shall mean with respect to any Party to this Agreement any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Party. An entity controls another entity when it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the equity share capital issued and outstanding of the other entity or when it controls, on its own or jointly, the majority of the composition of the Board of Directors of such other entity.",
                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate(s)\" shall mean with respect to any Party to this Agreement any entity that is affiliated with, works in conjunction with, or has a strategic partnership with such Party. Affiliation will be determined on a case-by-case basis and may or may not include ownership or control.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by changing the definition of \"Affiliate\" to include strategic partnerships and loosely affiliated entities, rather than just entities under majority control. This contradicts other contract sections that rely on the original definition (51% ownership) to determine rights and obligations. Additionally, allowing case-by-case determination undermines the original intent, introducing legal uncertainty and potential disputes over obligations.",

IMPCO and MINDA agree to assist the JVC in adopting the most economical methods of procurement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original clause states IMPCO 'may' assist the JVC with quotations, implying no obligation. The modified clause states IMPCO 'is obligated' to assist with quotations, creating a direct conflict regarding IMPCO's responsibilities. This creates uncertainty about enforcement, as it's unclear whether IMPCO is required to provide such assistance.",

However, in no event the agreement shall be terminated before 7 years.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction. The original clause specifies an indefinite term. The modified clause specifies a fixed five-year term. The last sentence prohibit any termination before 7 years. This creates uncertainty about the agreement's duration and conditions under which it can be terminated.",

                "original_text": "The rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Exhibit A shall survive the termination or expiration of this endorsement agreement, regardless of cause or circumstances of the termination or expiration.",
                "changed_text": "The rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Exhibit A shall survive the termination or expiration of this endorsement agreement, regardless of cause or circumstances of the termination or expiration. However, sections (a) and (b) of Exhibit A concerning confidentiality shall expire concurrently with the expiration or termination of the endorsement agreement.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction. The original clause states that *all* rights and obligations in Exhibit A survive termination. The added sentence states that *some* (specifically, confidentiality obligations in sections a and b) do *not* survive termination, creating uncertainty as to which terms are enforceable after the contract ends.",

However, recipient can retain a copy of the information for archival purposes.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction concerning the return of Information. One clause states that all Information must be returned, whereas the added text allows the Recipient to retain a copy. This contradiction makes it unclear whether the Recipient is obligated to return *all* Information or whether they can keep a copy, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "There is a contradiction regarding rights to intellectual property. The original clause requires full assignment of rights to the Company. The addition of the sentence allowing the recipient to use the IP for non-commercial purposes directly contradicts this full assignment, potentially leading to disputes about the extent of the company's ownership and control over its intellectual property.",

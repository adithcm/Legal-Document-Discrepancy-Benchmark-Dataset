These minimum annual royalties shall be due within thirty (30) days of each anniversary of the EFFECTIVE DATE beginning with the first anniversary. Running royalties accrued under Paragraph 4.3 and paid to JHU during the one year period preceding an anniversary of the EFFECTIVE DATE shall be credited against the minimum annual royalties due on that anniversary date.",

These minimum annual royalties shall be due within sixty (60) days of each anniversary of the EFFECTIVE DATE beginning with the first anniversary. Running royalties accrued under Paragraph 4.3 and paid to JHU during the one year period preceding an anniversary of the EFFECTIVE DATE shall be credited against the minimum annual royalties due on that anniversary date.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that minimum annual royalties are due within 30 days, while the modified text changes this to 60 days, creating a contradiction and uncertainty regarding the actual payment deadline. This is the first conflicting deadline created.",

Each such royalty payment when made shall be accompanied by all interest so accrued. Said interest and the payment and acceptance thereof shall not negate or waive the right of JHU to seek any other remedy, legal or equitable, to which it may be entitled because of the delinquency of any payment.",

Each such royalty payment when made shall be accompanied by all interest so accrued. Said interest and the payment and acceptance thereof shall not negate or waive the right of JHU to seek any other remedy, legal or equitable, to which it may be entitled because of the delinquency of any payment.",

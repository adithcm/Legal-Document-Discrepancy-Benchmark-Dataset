During the initial one year period beginning on the Amendment Date,          Distributor shall be the only distributor appointed by NETGEAR in [*],          subject to Distributor conducting mutually agreed to marketing          activities as described in the Marketing Plan for [*] to be developed          and agreed to by and between the parties and which shall be attached to          and made a part of this Agreement as Exhibit 4a. For the purposes of          this provision, distributor shall mean a company acquiring products          directly from NETGEAR for resale or license to dealers or other second          tier resellers which in turn resell or license the products to end use          customers.",
                "changed_text": "2.       During the initial one year period beginning on the Amendment Date,          Distributor shall be the only distributor appointed by NETGEAR in [*],          subject to Distributor conducting mutually agreed to marketing          activities as described in the Marketing Plan for [*] to be developed          and agreed to by and between the parties and which shall be attached to          and made a part of this Agreement as Exhibit 4a. For the purposes of          this provision, distributor shall mean any entity reselling or licensing NETGEAR products, regardless of the source or distribution tier.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'distributor' is limited to companies acquiring products directly from NETGEAR. The modified definition expands this to include any entity reselling or licensing NETGEAR products, regardless of the source. This creates a contradiction, as the exclusivity granted in the first part of the clause is undermined if any reseller, even those not buying directly from NETGEAR, is considered a distributor. This makes the enforcement of the exclusivity clause uncertain.",

                "changed_text": "3.       The terms and conditions of this Amendment, shall amend and supersede          any conflicting terms of the original Agreement. All other terms of the          original Agreement shall remain unchanged. However, NETGEAR reserves the right to unilaterally modify any term of the original agreement with 30 days notice. These modifications will be binding unless explicitly rejected by Ingram Micro within those 30 days.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that 'All other terms of the original Agreement shall remain unchanged', while simultaneously granting NETGEAR the right to unilaterally modify any term of the original agreement. This creates ambiguity regarding which terms are truly fixed and enforceable and which are subject to change, causing uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the amendment is valid for the current and any renewal term. The modified text contradicts this by stating it terminates automatically after the current term, creating a contradiction regarding the amendment's lifespan and potentially affecting long-term obligations.",

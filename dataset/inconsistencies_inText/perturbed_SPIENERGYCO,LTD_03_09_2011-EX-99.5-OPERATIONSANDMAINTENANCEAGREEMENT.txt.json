                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction with the payment terms. The original text specifies payment within 30 days, while the modified text allows 60 days after the invoice date. This creates ambiguity about the actual payment deadline, leading to potential disputes.",

It initially states ten business days following performance but this becomes twenty business days. The second clause requires reports within ten business days upon request, then changes to five.

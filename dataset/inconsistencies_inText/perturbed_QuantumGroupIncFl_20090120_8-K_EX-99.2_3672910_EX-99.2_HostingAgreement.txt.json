                "original_text": "Payment IBM invoices will specify the amount due. Payment is due and payable by month end for any invoice received by the 10th of the month, otherwise payment is due thirty (30) days from receipt of invoice. Customer agrees to pay accordingly, including any late payment fees. Payment will be made in United States dollars.",
                "changed_text": "Payment IBM invoices will specify the amount due. Payment is due and payable by month end for any invoice received by the 10th of the month, otherwise payment is due forty-five (45) days from receipt of invoice. Customer agrees to pay accordingly, including any late payment fees. Payment will be made in United States dollars.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment terms. Originally, if an invoice is not received by the 10th of the month, payment is due 30 days from receipt. Now, it is due 45 days from receipt, conflicting with the original payment term. This creates ambiguity in enforcement, as the exact payment deadline is now unclear.",

IBM will charge for additional hourly support in thirty (30) minute increments.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by changing the billing terms for additional hourly support. Previously, these charges were due as incurred and billed in 15-minute increments. Now, they are due Net 60 and billed in 30-minute increments. This introduces uncertainty about payment timing and billing practices, potentially leading to disputes.",

The breaching party will have thirty (30) days from receipt of notice to cure such breach, except for nonpayment by Customer, which must be cured within five (5) days from receipt of notice. If such breach has not been timely cured, then the non-breaching party may immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice.",

If such breach has not been timely cured, then the non-breaching party may immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the cure period for material breaches from 30 to 15 days, and for non-payment from 5 to 10 days. This contradicts the original clause, introducing ambiguity and potential disputes regarding the time allowed to remedy a breach before termination can occur, and creating legal uncertainty and potential disputes over obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Prime will, during the term of the Credit Agreement, maintain liquidity consisting of unused revolver availability under the Credit Agreement dated December!, 2002, as amended, with Prime et al and Guaranty, and/or unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $25,000,000. This required liquidity will reduce dollar-for-dollar with any additional shareholder advances and increase dollar-for-dollar to a maximum of $30,000,000 with any repayment of shareholder advances. To the extent that shareholder repayment has occurred, Prime is not required to fund additional shareholder loans unless mutually agreed upon with Guaranty.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the maximum liquidity Prime must maintain. The original text states a maximum of $21,000,000 after shareholder repayment, while the modified text increases this to $30,000,000. Additionally, the obligation to fund additional shareholder loans is removed and made conditional upon mutual agreement, conflicting with the original mandatory language and creating uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in force until all Project Fields generate a minimum of 1000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for a continuous period of 90 days, or until Guaranty provides written notice of termination, whichever occurs first. Once a component is satisfied, Prime's warranty to Guaranty to fund the payment to Offshore of all costs that exceed the available commitments under the Credit Agreement for that component, including interest, may be reduced or terminated at Guaranty's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement remains in force until project completion and the warranty expires once a component is satisfied. The modified text introduces two contradictions: (1) It changes the condition for the agreement's duration to a production threshold or Guaranty's termination notice, and (2) it makes the warranty's reduction or termination discretionary by Guaranty, rather than automatic upon component satisfaction, creating ambiguity and uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that Prime 'absolutely and unconditionally warrants' the assumption of all project completion costs if Offshore defaults. The modified text introduces a contradiction by making Prime's assistance discretionary ('may, at its sole discretion'), limiting the liability to $5,000,000, and making it 'subject to the availability of funds' thus conflicting with the initial absolute and unconditional obligation.",

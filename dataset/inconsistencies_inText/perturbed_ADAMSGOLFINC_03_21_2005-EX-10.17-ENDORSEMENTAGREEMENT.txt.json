For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT  achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",

However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT  achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by allowing the consultant to delay repayment for up to 90 days under vaguely defined 'extenuating circumstances,' while the original text specifies a strict one-month deadline. This creates uncertainty regarding the actual due date for repayment.",

FAILURE TO PLAY\n\nNotwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
                "explanation": "The added clause creates a contradiction by stating that no repayment is required if the inability to play is due to an injury during an Adams Golf event, directly contradicting the original statement that repayment is always required upon termination due to the consultant's inability to play. This creates ambiguity about repayment obligations.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT, unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A.

                "explanation": "This change adds an exception to the repayment obligation upon termination for cause. If Adams Golf fails to supply adequate product, the consultant is not required to repay.

The invoice shall include all purchase order details. The invoice will be quoted in US Dollars. 14.2 Contractor and Customer agree to terms of payments of current plus thirty (30) days from the date of invoice. Payment shall be affected in US Dollars.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment terms from 'current plus thirty (30) days' to 'current plus sixty (60) days'. This directly conflicts with the original clause, creating uncertainty about the actual payment deadline and potentially leading to disputes over late fees and contractual obligations.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation creates a contradiction within the termination clause. The cure period for a default is changed from thirty (30) days to fifteen (15) days, and the notice period for termination is changed from sixty (60) days to thirty (30) days. This conflicts with the 'Termination without cause' provision, creating confusion and uncertainty about the correct procedure for terminating the agreement.",

                "original_text": "Unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof, the initial term of this Agreement (\"Initial Term\") will be ten (10) years from the Effective Date, provided that at any time following the 7th anniversary of such date, either party may terminate such strategic alliance upon not less than 60 days' prior written notice to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "Unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof, the initial term of this Agreement (\"Initial Term\") will be ten (10) years from the Effective Date, provided that at any time following the 3rd anniversary of such date, either party may terminate such strategic alliance upon not less than 30 days' prior written notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding when the agreement can be terminated. The original text specifies termination after the 7th anniversary with 60 days' notice, while the modified text specifies termination after the 3rd anniversary with 30 days' notice. This creates uncertainty about the actual termination terms.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of termination to the other party, which termination will be effective immediately upon such notice, if the other party defaults in the performance of any of its material obligations provided for in this Agreement and fails to cure such default within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice from the other party of such default, unless a plan for remedying such default has been proposed by the defaulting party and accepted by the non- defaulting party within such period.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the cure period for defaults. The original text allows 60 days to cure a default, while the modified text shortens this period to 30 days. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes over what constitutes sufficient time to remedy a breach of contract.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the jurisdiction for dispute resolution. The original text specifies Tel Aviv, Israel, while the modified text specifies New York, USA. This creates a conflict over where legal proceedings must be initiated, potentially leading to jurisdictional challenges and increased legal costs.",

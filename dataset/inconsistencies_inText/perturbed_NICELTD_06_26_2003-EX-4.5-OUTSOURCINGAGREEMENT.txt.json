                "original_text": "     (ix) \"AFFILIATE\" - A corporation, partnership or other business entity           which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control of a           Party. For the purposes hereof, \"CONTROL\" shall mean the holding of           more than 50% of the voting rights in the entity in question.",
                "changed_text": "     (ix) \"AFFILIATE\" - A corporation, partnership or other business entity which is associated with, provides services to, or is strategically aligned with a Party. The term \"control\" is irrelevant for the purposes of defining an affiliate.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by redefining \"Affiliate\" to include associated or strategically aligned entities, removing the 50% ownership requirement. This conflicts with other sections that rely on the original, stricter definition of \"Affiliate\" to determine rights, obligations, and access to confidential information, creating uncertainty about which entities are actually covered by those clauses. The removal of the control definition makes the term affiliate extremely broad which is against the original intent of the document.",

Payment by NICE is due current thirty (30) Days from the                     date of receipt of the invoice, on the 2nd or 16th of the                     month, whichever is following the invoice date and may be                     made by check or wire transfer.",
                "changed_text": "          8.4.1. Payment by NICE is due current sixty (60) Days from the                     date of receipt of the invoice, without exception, and must be                     made via wire transfer only. A late payment fee of 10% will be charged for any payment after 30 days.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original payment terms. The original clause specifies 30-day payment terms with options for check or wire transfer, and the payment dates are flexible (2nd or 16th of the month). The modified clause extends the payment term to 60 days, mandates wire transfer, and introduces a late fee if payments are not made after 30 days. This creates confusion regarding the actual payment deadline and acceptable payment methods, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "changed_text": "     16.2. Notwithstanding the aforesaid in Section 16.1. and any possible           implication to the contrary herein or as a result of the course of           conduct of the parties, NICE shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement only if the Contractor does not meet the quality requirements listed in Appendix J for three consecutive months. Notice of intent to terminate must be given 90 days in advance.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by severely restricting NICE's termination rights. The original clause grants NICE the right to terminate the agreement at any time with 45 days' notice. The modified clause removes this right, only allowing termination if the Contractor fails to meet quality standards for three months and requires 90 days' notice. This creates confusion as to when and under what conditions NICE can terminate the contract.",

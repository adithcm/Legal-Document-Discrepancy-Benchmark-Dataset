Each party shall keep a record of all sales and shall submit, together with the royalty statements, a quarterly summary report of such sales. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to Paragraphs 7(b) (2) and 7(b)(3), Fox shall make all payments of revenue remitted directly by VGSL or any other CSP with whom the parties prospectively agree Fox will receive revenue directly, within thirty (30) days of receipt of such revenue.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. The original text states that royalty payments are due within 30 days after the close of each calendar quarter, but then specifies that Fox shall make payments of revenue remitted directly by VGSL or any other CSP within 30 days of receipt of such revenue. The modified text extends the payment deadline for Fox to 60 days, creating uncertainty regarding which deadline applies to payments from Fox to Licensee.",

TERM: The rights granted hereunder shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2006 (the \"Term\"); provided, however, that with respect to each Property, all rights and licenses granted herein will continue in full force and effect for a period of eighteen (18) months after the initial theatrical release of that Property.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the term length. The original text specifies that the term expires on December 31, 2006, but then states that rights for each property continue for 18 months after its initial theatrical release. The modified text reduces this period to 12 months, leading to ambiguity as to whether rights extend for 12 or 18 months post-release. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, because it is ambigious if it is 12 or 18 months.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction regarding inventory destruction post-termination. The original clause mandates the destruction of remaining inventory after the sell-off period. The modified clause states that the licensee is NOT required to destroy remaining inventory, but the agreement still requires Fox to require that any Licensed CSP do the same. This is a contradiction between the obligations for each party. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, because the contract states one thing then the opposite.",

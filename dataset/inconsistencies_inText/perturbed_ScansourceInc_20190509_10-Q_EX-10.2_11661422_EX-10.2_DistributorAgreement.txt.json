                "original_text": "Distributor has the right to cancel, reschedule or modify all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such cancellation or modification request is made within [*****] business days of PO acceptance or rescheduling request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non- cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.",

Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Distributor retains the right to cancel or modify a purchase order, subject to a cancellation fee of 10% of the order value, even after Xplore acceptance. Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non- cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting conditions regarding order cancellation and modification. The initial text outlines specific timelines where cancellations are free, but then states purchase orders are non-cancellable. The added sentence allows cancellation with a fee, creating a contradiction about the possibility of cancellation after acceptance. It is unclear whether the initial timelines apply or if the 10% fee is always applicable.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding Xplore's obligation to replenish stock. The original text states that after 60 days below the target, Xplore will replenish to an amount 'agreed by both parties'. The modified text first dictates that Xplore will replenish the stock immediately to thirty (30) days of inventory, but then says that they are not required to replenish the stock again if it falls below the agreed amount again. It is unclear if Xplore should do the replenishment immediately or if it will replenish the stock at all if it falls below the target.",

It is unclear which party is responsible for these payments, which is a conflict.",

Payment and Delivery.\n4.1 Subject to Section 2.2, NTC shall use all reasonable commercial efforts to fill orders placed by ALFA AESAR with all reasonable promptness provided, however, that NTC shall have no obligation to furnish any Products hereunder which have been discontinued. In the event any order is not filled within thirty (30) days of receipt by NTC, ALFA AESAR has the right, but not the obligation, to seek alternative sourcing from a third- party without liability to NTC.\n4.2 NTC shall ship Products FOB/FCA its facilities and will arrange delivery of the Products to ALFA AESAR using a nationally recognized carrier. Title to the Products, and the risk of loss or damage to the Products, each will pass to ALFA AESAR upon shipment from NTC's dock in compliance with United States D.O.T. requirements and all applicable laws and regulations.\n4.3 NTC shall invoice ALFA AESAR for payment of Products delivered to ALFA AESAR on a Net 30 day basis. Excepting any amounts disputed in good faith, balances unpaid after such period will be subject to a finance charge of 1% per month or may be offset against any balances owed by NTC to ALFA AESAR. The parties agree to work in good faith to resolve any disputed invoice. In the event such efforts do not resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days, either party may initiate Arbitration proceedings pursuant to Section 16.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. The original clause states that balances unpaid after 30 days are subject to a finance charge, while the modified clause states balances unpaid after 45 days are NOT subject to a finance charge, creating uncertainty about when finance charges apply.",

This Joint Filing Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant and subject to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D to which this Joint Filing Agreement is attached. Amendments thereto require separate individual filing agreements for each amendment. This Joint Filing Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the filing of amendments. The original text states that amendments can be filed without additional joint filing agreements. The modified text states that each amendment requires a separate individual filing agreement. This creates uncertainty about the procedure for filing amendments.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that the agreement's execution is not an admission of group status. The modified text implies the opposite, stating it's an implicit admission they *may* be considered a group, especially concerning investment strategies. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the legal interpretation of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows for counterparts, each considered an original. The changed text expressly forbids counterparts and deems the agreement invalid if they are used. This is a clear contradiction regarding the acceptable format of the agreement and introduces uncertainty about compliance.",

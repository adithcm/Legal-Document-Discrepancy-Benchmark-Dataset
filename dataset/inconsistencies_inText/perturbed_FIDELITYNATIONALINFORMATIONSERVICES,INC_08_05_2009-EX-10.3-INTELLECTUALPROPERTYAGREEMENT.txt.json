                "changed_text": "(n) \"Control\" means the ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting shares of an entity, or other possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, or the power to veto major policy decisions of any such entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities by contract, or otherwise. In some specific instances detailed in Exhibit Q, control can also be established with a 25% ownership stake coupled with contractual agreements granting significant operational influence.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by defining \"Control\" differently in two sections of the contract. The original definition specifies 50% ownership, while the added text introduces a possibility of control with only 25% ownership under certain conditions outlined in Exhibit Q. This contradicts other sections of the contract that rely on the original 50% definition to determine rights and obligations, creating legal uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces an in-text contradiction. Section 4.1(a) initially grants a \"perpetual\" license, but the added text stipulates that the license terminates after five years. This directly contradicts the \"perpetual\" term, creating uncertainty and a potential dispute over the duration of the license.",

Parties in Interest.\n\n     Neither of the parties hereto may assign its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each other party.

Parties in Interest.\n\n     Neither of the parties hereto may assign its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each other party, except that Certegy may unilaterally assign this agreement to a subsidiary company that demonstrates the capacity to fullfill the obligation of the contract. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer any benefits, rights or remedies upon any person or entity other than members of the Equifax Group and the Certegy Group and the Equifax Indemnitees and Certegy Indemnitees under Articles VII and VIII hereof.",
                "explanation": "The original text in Section 11.5 restricts assignment of rights without prior written consent from both parties. However, the added clause grants Certegy a unilateral right to assign the agreement to a subsidiary, creating a contradiction. This inconsistency introduces uncertainty about the enforceability of the assignment clause and could lead to disputes if Equifax disagrees with Certegy's choice of assignee.",

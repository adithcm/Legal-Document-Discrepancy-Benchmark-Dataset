                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Contractor reserves the right to change rates with 30 days notice to Company.",
                "changed_text": "Contractor reserves the right to change rates with 30 days notice to Company. However, any rate changes for ongoing Statements of Work will require mutual written consent from both parties.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding rate changes. The original text allows the contractor to change rates with 30 days' notice, while the modified text introduces a requirement for mutual written consent for ongoing projects. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the process for rate changes and could lead to disputes.",

                "changed_text": "At any time that there is no uncompleted Statement of Work outstanding, either party may terminate this Agreement for any or no reason upon fifteen (15) days advance notice to the other. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company may only terminate for cause.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the grounds for termination. The original text allows either party to terminate for any reason with 15 days' notice, but the modified text restricts the Company to terminating only 'for cause.' This inconsistency makes it unclear under what circumstances the Company can terminate the agreement.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the event of termination under either section 6(a) or 6(b) of this agreement, Contractor shall be paid all fees and expenses that have been incurred or earned in connection with the performance of the Services through the effective date of such termination. Upon receipt of final payment Contractor shall provide to Company, and will assigns to Company, all right, title and interest to any Works in progress.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of termination under either section 6(a) or 6(b) of this agreement, Contractor shall be paid all fees and expenses that have been incurred or earned in connection with the performance of the Services through the effective date of such termination, *except if terminated due to contractor's negligence or willful misconduct*. Upon receipt of final payment Contractor shall provide to Company, and will assigns to Company, all right, title and interest to any Works in progress.",
                "explanation": "This change adds an exception to the contractor's right to be paid upon termination. The original clause states the contractor will be paid in full in the event of any termination listed in 6(a) or 6(b), but this change says they will not be paid if the termination is due to their negligence or misconduct. This contradicts the original clause and introduces uncertainty about payment obligations upon termination.",

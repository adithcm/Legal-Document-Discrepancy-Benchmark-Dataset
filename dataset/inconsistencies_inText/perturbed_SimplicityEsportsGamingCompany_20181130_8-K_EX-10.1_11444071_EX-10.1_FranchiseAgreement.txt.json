Franchisee or third party sub -franchisees shall be under an obligation to set up at least 6 (six) Smaaash Centres during the first Contract Year. Franchisee shall have complete discretion regarding the time period to establish these centers.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the timeline for setting up Smaaash Centres. The original text states a minimum of 6 centres in the first year or another period set by the Franchisor, but the modified text removes the Franchisor's control over the timeframe, giving the Franchisee complete discretion. This creates uncertainty regarding the enforcement of the setup timeline.",

Franchisee has the right to use promotional materials that it deems appropriate, without modification or approval by Franchisor.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces a direct contradiction. Originally, the Franchisee needed approval from the Franchisor on promotional materials. The modified text gives the Franchisee the right to use promotional materials without needing to modify or obtain approval. This causes a contradiction and creates uncertainty on promotional requirements.",

                "explanation": "The edited text directly contradicts the original condition of termination related to the Franchisee failing to use its best efforts to market and promote the Smaaash Centres. By stating the Franchisee is free to operate as they deem fit regardless of the original point (c), introduces a conflict that would be difficult to enforce. Since the Franchisee is free to not market which leads to Franchisee can not be terminated. This leads to uncertainty about termination conditions.",

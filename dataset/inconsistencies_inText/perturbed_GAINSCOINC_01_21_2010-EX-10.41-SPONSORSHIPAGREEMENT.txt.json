The Sponsor shall pay to Racing a sponsorship fee in the amount of $750,000.00 for the term of this Agreement, payable  in an initial installment payable on or before February 1, 2010 in the amount of $350,000.00 and ten installments of $40,000.00 on or before the first  day of each month commencing March 1, 2010 and ending with the installment due on December 1, 2010 (unless this Agreement is sooner  terminated pursuant to Section 14 hereof, in which case Sponsor shall have no obligation to make any payments after the date of termination).",

If the sponsor is more than 30 days late with any of the monthly installments, they are not required to pay the late fee.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding late payment fees. Section 3 originally specifies a payment schedule. The added sentence provides a contradicting scenario where, despite late payments, the sponsor would not be subject to late fees, creating ambiguity and uncertainty.",

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1 hereof, the Sponsor shall have the right at any time prior to  December 31, 2010 to terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of such termination to Racing.

In the event of such a termination, (i) the  Sponsor shall have no further obligation to make payments toward the sponsorship fee contemplated in Section 3 hereof, unless the termination occurs after Racing has already secured additional sponsors due to the commitment of the Sponsor.

While the original clause states the Sponsor has no further payment obligations, the added condition introduces a scenario where the Sponsor may still be obligated to pay if Racing secured other sponsors based on the initial agreement, creating ambiguity about the termination terms.",

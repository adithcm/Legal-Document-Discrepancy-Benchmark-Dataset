                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Unless otherwise approved by Company, Level I, II and III terms for payment to Company are Net 30 days on Technology licensed from Company.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise approved by Company, Level I terms for payment to Company are Net 30 days. Level II and III terms for payment to Company are Net 60 days on Technology licensed from Company.",
                "explanation": "This change creates conflicting payment terms for different purchase levels. One section states Level I, II, and III have Net 30 payment terms, while the other states Levels II and III have Net 60 payment terms. This contradiction introduces uncertainty and potential disputes regarding payment deadlines, specifically if the MA operates at Levels II or III. This could lead to confusion about which deadline should be followed and could cause disputes over late payment fees and contract compliance.",

                "original_text": "This agreement shall begin upon the date of its execution by MA and acceptance in writing by Company and shall remain in effect until the end of the current calendar year and shall be automatically renewed for successive one (1) year periods unless otherwise terminated according to the cancellation or termination provisions contained in paragraph 18 of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This agreement shall begin upon the date of its execution by MA and acceptance in writing by Company and shall remain in effect until the end of the current calendar year and shall be automatically renewed for successive one (1) year periods. This agreement can only be terminated according to the cancellation or termination provisions contained in paragraph 18 of this Agreement, or by mutual written consent of both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for termination based on paragraph 18, while the modified text adds the requirement of mutual written consent for any termination not covered in paragraph 18. This creates a contradiction, as it is unclear if parties can terminate without mutual consent under certain circumstances beyond those in paragraph 18. This adds uncertainty to termination rights and clauses, potentially leading to disputes and issues of contract compliance.",

                "changed_text": "MA shall report periodically in writing, upon request to Company the status of the following:\n\nLeads provided by Company Marketing activities in progress Sales forecasts Implementations in progress\n\nMA is not required to appoint one of its employees to be responsible for such reporting; instead, reporting responsibilities can be handled by any individual or department designated by MA, and the designation is not necessarily to be disclosed to Company.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that MA *shall* appoint an employee and make their name available, whereas the modified text states that MA is *not required* to appoint an employee and the designation is not necessarily to be disclosed to Company. This creates a direct contradiction regarding a required action, leading to potential disputes regarding compliance with reporting requirements. This directly impacts the Company's ability to ensure consistent communication and tracking of leads, marketing activities, and sales forecasts.",

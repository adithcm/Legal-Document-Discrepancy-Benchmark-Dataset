                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by modifying the payment deadline for royalty payments. The original text specifies a payment date of 'January 30st', which is assumed to mean January 30th. The modified text changes this to 'April 30st', again assumed to mean April 30th. This directly conflicts with the original payment deadline, creating uncertainty about when Dr. Murray is entitled to receive royalty payments.",

The Services Term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive two-year terms thereafter unless written notice is given by either party to the other, indicating that party's intention not to renew the Services Term of this Agreement, at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the initial Services Term or any renewed Services Term. (b) Except as otherwise stated herein as pertaining only to a Services Term, this Agreement shall remain in effect for ten years, unless terminated in accordance with Sections 6.1 (a) or 6.2(b).

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a conflict in the termination clause. The original agreement requires a 90-day written notice for non-renewal of the Services Term. The modified text reduces this notice period to 30 days. This directly contradicts the original term, making it unclear which notice period applies for terminating the Services Term. This uncertainty can lead to disputes regarding the validity of termination notices.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction concerning when notices delivered via overnight carrier are considered 'received.' The original clause states that such notices are deemed received 'on the next day.' However, the modified clause alters this to 'on the third day.' This in-text contradiction creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the effective date of notices delivered by overnight carrier. For example, if a notice of termination is sent by overnight carrier, the recipient might claim that it was not effectively received until the third day, potentially affecting the timing of termination and creating disputes.",

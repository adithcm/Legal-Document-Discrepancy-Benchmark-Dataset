                "original_text": "5. Duration and Termination.\n\n(a) Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the effective date first above written and shall continue until terminated by mutual agreement of the parties hereto or by either party on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party hereto.",
                "changed_text": "5. Duration and Termination.\n\n(a) Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the effective date first above written and shall continue until terminated by mutual agreement of the parties hereto. Either party can terminate this agreement with 60 days written notice, or immediately, if they pay a termination fee of 10% of the total value of the services provided up to the termination date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the termination clause. Section 5(a) originally states that the agreement can be terminated with 60 days' written notice. The modified text adds the possibility of immediate termination with a termination fee. This creates ambiguity as to whether the 60-day notice is still required or if immediate termination is always an option if the fee is paid, even if 60 day notice was not provided. It is not clear if both conditions need to be satisfied.",

All invoices must be paid within 30 days of receipt. Failure to remit payment within 30 days will result in a 1.5% late fee assessed monthly.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a specific payment deadline and late fee provision in Section 2. Exhibit B governs calculation and payment of service fees. By adding the sentence in Section 2, it is unclear whether the payment terms of 30 days are separate or override any potentially different payment terms that may be set forth in Exhibit B. This introduces uncertainty about which terms should be enforced in the event of a conflict between Section 2 and Exhibit B.",

                "explanation": "The original text grants the Account or its representatives access to the books and records 'at all times during FASC's normal business hours'. The modified version contradicts this by requiring 'FASC's prior written consent, which may be withheld at FASC's sole discretion.' This creates a direct conflict regarding the Account's right to access records, making it uncertain whether access is a guaranteed right during business hours or subject to FASC's approval. This gives FASC discretionary control and goes against the original intent.",

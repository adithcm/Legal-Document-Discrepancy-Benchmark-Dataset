Distributor will not reduce any payment to Tripath to account for anticipated or unauthorized credits (except for short shipments and non-receipt of Products), either at the time of the payment of original invoice, or at the time of providing a credit request. Credit requests should be submitted by Distributor within one month after the date of Distributor's invoice for the related transactions.",

Distributor may reduce any payment to Tripath to account for anticipated credits, either at the time of the payment of original invoice, or at the time of providing a credit request. Credit requests should be submitted by Distributor within three months after the date of Distributor's invoice for the related transactions.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding credit handling. The original text states that the distributor will *not* reduce payment for anticipated credits, while the modified text says the distributor *may* reduce payment. It also changes the timeframe for credit requests from one to three months, leading to a conflict about how long the distributor has to submit the request.",

Distributor will supply supporting documentation showing Products listed by part number, date of transaction, end customer name and address, and the appropriate special pricing details, not later than two weeks after shipment to the associated customer.",

Distributor will supply supporting documentation showing Products listed by part number, date of transaction, end customer name and address, and the appropriate special pricing details, not later than six weeks after shipment to the associated customer.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the validity period of special pricing quotes and the deadline for submitting supporting documentation. The original text states quotes are valid for one month and documentation must be submitted within two weeks, while the modified text extends these periods to three months and six weeks, respectively. This creates ambiguity on which timeline is correct.",

                "explanation": "The change in notification timeframe for used or damaged returned products introduces a contradiction. The original text mandates notification within one month, while the modified text extends it to three months. This inconsistency causes confusion regarding when Tripath must inform the distributor about the condition of returned products.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that regulatory approvals are delayed, the Settlement Date shall be extended to the 10th Japan Business Day following the last day of the Offer Period.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the Settlement Date. The original definition specifies it as the 5th Japan Business Day, but the added sentence allows for extension to the 10th Japan Business Day if regulatory approvals are delayed. This creates uncertainty regarding when settlement must occur.",

However, the Company is permitted to disclose confidential information to potential future acquirers of the Company, subject to a less restrictive confidentiality agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction within the confidentiality clause. While the initial part strictly prohibits the Company from using or disclosing confidential information, the added sentence allows disclosure to potential future acquirers under a less restrictive agreement. This contradicts the original intent of strict confidentiality and creates ambiguity regarding which confidentiality terms apply in the context of a potential acquisition.",

No Party shall assign or transfer or purport to assign or transfer (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, that Acquiror may assign this Agreement and its rights and interests herein without any such consent as collateral to the Lenders in connection with the Financing.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may also assign its rights and obligations under this agreement to any subsidiary without prior consent. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.",
                "explanation": "This change creates conflicting assignment provisions. The initial part states that no party can assign their rights without consent, but then grants an exception to Acquiror for assigning to lenders as collateral. The added sentence then grants an exception for the Company to assign to any subsidiary, contradicting the need for consent stated in the initial sentence. This makes it unclear whether the initial restriction on assignment still applies and increases chances for conflict.",

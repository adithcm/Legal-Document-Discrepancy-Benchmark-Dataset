                "original_text": "2.1. Milestone Payments. (a) First Payment. Integra shall pay PcoMed $*** ( *** US dollars) upon full execution of this Agreement. (b) Second Payment. Integra shall pay PcoMed $*** ( *** US dollars) within 30 days after Notice of Initial Acceptance of First Product Order. Integra shall place the First Product Order within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement.",

Integra shall pay PcoMed $*** ( *** US dollars) within 60 days after Notice of Initial Acceptance of First Product Order. Integra shall place the First Product Order within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting deadlines for both the second payment and the placement of the First Product Order. The original text specifies 30 days for the second payment and 60 days for the First Product Order, while the modified text reverses these deadlines, creating uncertainty about the correct payment and order placement schedule and leading to potential disputes.",

The Minimum Payment applicable to each Minimum Payment Period shall be due annually on or before 90 days after the last day of each Minimum Payment Period.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the deadline for Minimum Payments. The original text states that the Minimum Payment is due 45 days after the end of each Minimum Payment Period, while the modified text extends this deadline to 90 days. This difference creates ambiguity and could result in disputes about when payments are considered late.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline in a different section. Section 6.1 originally states payments under 2.2 are due within 45 days of the quarter's end, but the modified version extends it to 60 days. Since Section 2.2 and 6.1 are connected, this contradiction creates ambiguity on the true deadline of payments, therefore leading to potential disputes.",

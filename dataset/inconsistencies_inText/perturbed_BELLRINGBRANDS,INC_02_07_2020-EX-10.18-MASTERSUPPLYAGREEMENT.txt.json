Supplier will confirm or reject Purchase Orders within [***] of receipt of the Purchase Order. Orders not rejected verbally within such time will be deemed confirmed and accepted by Supplier.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict by altering the time when purchase orders are considered 'received' and how rejections can occur. The original text considers orders received after 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time as received the following business day. The modified text changes this to two days later. Also, original text says that orders not rejected in writing will be deemed as confirmed but the modified one says that rejections can occur verbally. These creates uncertainty about when the supplier is obligated to fulfill the order and whether an oral confirmation is valid.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict by altering the renewal period and notification period. The original text says that it will automatically renew for additional periods of five years, but the modified text says that the agreement will renew for additional periods of one year. Also, the original text states that a party has to notify the other of its intention not to renew no less than 12 months, whereas the modified text changes this to 6 months.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict by altering the details of the insurance policy, specifically regarding CGL policy, contributory nature and waiver of subrogation. The original text says that the supplier's CGL policy is primary and buyer's CGL policy is non-contributory, but the modified text says the opposite, meaning that the supplier's CGL policy is secondary and buyer's CGL policy is contributory. Also, original text states that waiver of subrogation should be provided in favor of the buyer on the policies, whereas the modified text says that this should not be provided. These create uncertainty regarding which party's insurance bears primary responsibility and what the liability is. Finally, it changes the cancellation notice period from 10 to 30 days.",

MediaNet Group Technologies will remit payment as directed by Reseller within 90 days of invoice receipt, notwithstanding any conflicting time frames noted in the Compensation Schedule attached hereto.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict by stating payments will be made within 90 days, overriding potentially shorter timeframes outlined in the Compensation Schedule. This creates uncertainty regarding the actual payment deadline.",

The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for a period of 1 year after the Effective Date, unless earlier terminated as set forth herein (the \"TERM\"). This Agreement shall renew for successive 1-year periods, after the initial 1 Year Term, if agreed by both parties in writing within 30 days of license expiration. Either party may terminate the Agreement on 60-days written notice during a renewed term. However, in no event shall termination of this Agreement by MediaNet Group Technologies relieve it of the obligation to remit payment to Reseller for sales or Portals, Hosting Services or other products and services to or through Buyers contracted by Reseller prior to such termination.

                "explanation": "This edit contradicts the original clause which stated payment obligation would cease 30 days after termination. By changing it to cease immediately upon termination, it creates confusion on when payment obligations end, potentially leading to disputes about commissions earned before termination.",

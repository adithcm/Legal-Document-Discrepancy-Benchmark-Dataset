                "changed_text": "All payments due Microgenics under this Agreement shall be made by Achaogen in United States dollars within [***] ([***]) days after receipt of the applicable invoice by ACH transfer to the credit and account of Microgenics at the following account: [***]. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for invoices exceeding $[***], Achaogen shall have the option to extend the payment term to [***] days, provided Achaogen notifies Microgenics in writing within [***] days of invoice receipt.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. The original text states that all payments will be made within [***] days. The modified text adds a clause that allows Achaogen to extend the payment term to [***] days for invoices exceeding $[***], creating ambiguity and potential dispute over the payment deadline for larger invoices.",

Without limiting the foregoing, Microgenics agrees to maintain a safety stock of rare reagents sufficient to meet each applicable Binding Forecast for the Assay. Microgenics shall provide Achaogen at least [***] ([***]) months (or [***]) prior written notice of any possible shortfall in meeting each applicable Binding Forecast or other commercial demand for the Assay, and the Parties shall promptly meet and discuss all reasonable commercial resolutions if Microgenics is unable to assure supply as needed to meet each applicable Binding Forecast pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 4.3.2.2.",

Without limiting the foregoing, Microgenics agrees to maintain a safety stock of rare reagents sufficient to meet each applicable Binding Forecast for the Assay. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Microgenics's obligation to supply the Assay is contingent upon Achaogen providing accurate Binding Forecasts, and Microgenics shall not be liable for any shortfalls resulting from Achaogen's failure to provide such accurate forecasts. Microgenics shall provide Achaogen at least [***] ([***]) months (or [***]) prior written notice of any possible shortfall in meeting each applicable Binding Forecast or other commercial demand for the Assay, and the Parties shall promptly meet and discuss all reasonable commercial resolutions if Microgenics is unable to assure supply as needed to meet each applicable Binding Forecast pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 4.3.2.2.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction regarding Microgenics's obligation to supply the Assay. While the original text states that Microgenics 'shall ensure' supply to meet Binding Forecasts, the added text makes this obligation contingent on Achaogen providing 'accurate' forecasts. This creates ambiguity regarding Microgenics's responsibility for shortfalls and could lead to disputes over what constitutes an 'accurate' Binding Forecast and who bears the risk of forecast inaccuracies.",

                "explanation": "The inconsistency here stems from modifying the financial burden for a lawsuit. Originally the party initiating the legal proceedings covered all expenses, however the new changed text makes both parties cover the expenses. This can be problematic because it opens the door for legal dispute between which party must cover expenses, or if certain expenses were agreed upon to split.",

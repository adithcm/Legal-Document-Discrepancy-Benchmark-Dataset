Within seventy-five (75) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that BCF for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months of such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is greater than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to 50% of BCF for such month; provided, in the first month of each calendar year in which this sentence applies, the fee with respect to the portion of BCF for such month which, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is exactly equal to the Minimum BCF, shall equal thirty-five percent (35%) of such portion rather than fifty percent (50%).",

Within forty-five (45) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that BCF for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months of such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is greater than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to 50% of BCF for such month; provided, in the first month of each calendar year in which this sentence applies, the fee with respect to the portion of BCF for such month which, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is exactly equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of such portion rather than fifty percent (50%).",
                "explanation": "The change introduces an inconsistency by specifying different payment deadlines depending on whether the BCF is above or below the minimum.

                "explanation": "The change replaces 'promptly' with '90 days', which directly conflicts and creates ambiguity about the actual payment timeline. There is no clear 'promptly' definition, and 90 days is explicit. However, it still causes a conflict.",

                "original_text": "With respect to any royalty payments due hereunder from Licensee to Licensor in excess of the amount of Royalty Advances made by Licensee from time to time hereunder, such payments shall be payable on the later of (i) sixty (60) days after the date of the applicable invoice to a Redistributor or Customer, as the case may be, or (ii) five (5) business days following Licensee's receipt of payment from a Redistributor or Customer, as the case may be. Any royalty payment that is not paid when due will bear interest from the date such amount is due until the date payment is made at a rate equal to ten percent (10%) per annum.",
                "changed_text": "With respect to any royalty payments due hereunder from Licensee to Licensor in excess of the amount of Royalty Advances made by Licensee from time to time hereunder, such payments shall be payable on the later of (i) sixty (60) days after the date of the applicable invoice to a Redistributor or Customer, as the case may be, or (ii) five (5) business days following Licensee's receipt of payment from a Redistributor or Customer, as the case may be. Any royalty payment that is not paid when due will bear interest from the date such amount is due until the date payment is made at a rate equal to fifteen percent (15%) per annum.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces a conflict by altering the interest rate on late royalty payments from 10% to 15% per annum. This creates an inconsistency within the payment terms, making it unclear which interest rate should be applied to late payments, thus resulting in potential disputes.",

                "changed_text": "Upon the expiration of this Agreement, Licensor shall repay to Licensee the aggregate amount of all Royalty Advances then outstanding. However, in the event of termination due to Licensee's breach of contract, Licensor shall not be obligated to repay any outstanding Royalty Advances.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradiction regarding the repayment of Royalty Advances upon termination. The original text states that Licensor *shall* repay advances in all cases. The modified text adds an exception: if termination is due to Licensee's breach, Licensor is *not* obligated to repay. This inconsistency regarding the repayment obligations introduces ambiguity and potential disputes.",

Upon the expiration of such term, this Agreement will renew automatically for successive terms of one (1) year each unless either party to this Agreement delivers written notice of termination to the other party to this Agreement at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the original or any renewal term.",

Upon the expiration of such term, this Agreement will renew automatically for successive terms of one (1) year each unless either party to this Agreement delivers written notice of termination to the other party to this Agreement at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the original or any renewal term.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the notice period for non-renewal from 60 days to 30 days creating ambiguity and conflict. The original text stated a 60-day notice period but the changed text states a 30-day notice period, leading to uncertainty about which deadline is enforceable.",

Kierland Blvd., Suite 230, Scottsdale, Arizona 85254, Attn: Steve Loy. Payments shall be made 15 days from the end of each quarter.

However, if TDA experiences a net loss in any given quarter, payment shall be deferred until the next quarter in which a profit is realized, at which point payment shall be made within 30 days of the end of that profitable quarter. In such cases, no interest will accrue.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in payment terms. The original clause states payments are due 15 days after the end of each quarter with interest on late payments. The modified clause introduces a condition where payment can be deferred if TDA experiences a net loss, and sets a new payment deadline 30 days after a profitable quarter, while also waiving interest. This creates ambiguity: does the 15-day deadline always apply, or only when TDA is profitable? If there's a loss, which deadline and interest rate is applicable? This creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

I am removing that portion to create in-text contradiction.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for projects SP11, SP12, and SP13 the agreement term will end December 31, 2005.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating the agreement ends on July 20, 2006 for most projects, but for SP11, SP12, and SP13 it ends December 31, 2005. This creates uncertainty regarding the actual term length for specific partners and could lead to disputes.",

In addition to the other rights provided to Manager hereunder to disconnect the Projects of the Partners (or their Partner Affiliates), Manager shall disconnect the Projects of Alpha Willow, SP11, SP12, SP13, SP14 and SP21 (together with their Partner Affiliates, the \"LIFO Partners\") in the following circumstances.",

However, the Manager shall never disconnect SP14 and SP21 regardless of the circumstances described below.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a contradictory statement that the Manager *shall never* disconnect SP14 and SP21, despite the initial statement that the Manager *shall* disconnect the LIFO Partners (which include SP14 and SP21) under certain circumstances. This creates a direct conflict in the obligations of the Manager and introduces uncertainty about whether SP14 and SP21 are subject to disconnection.",

Such curtailment shall continue for a fixed period of 30 days, regardless of whether the Manager determines that reconnecting the Projects of the LIFO Partners shall not result in the recurrence of the event giving rise to the curtailment.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction in the duration of the curtailment. The original text states the curtailment continues until the Manager determines reconnection is safe. The modified text imposes a fixed 30-day duration, irrespective of the Manager's assessment. This creates uncertainty regarding the duration of curtailment and potentially forces premature reconnection, risking recurrence of the initial problem, or prolongs curtailment unnecessarily.",

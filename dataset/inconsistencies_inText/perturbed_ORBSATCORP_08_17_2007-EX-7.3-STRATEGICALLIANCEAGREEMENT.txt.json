In consideration for the services to be provided, AVDU agrees that it will remit the agreed upon stock certificate within five (5) days of both parties executing this Agreement.\n\n  B. AVDU agrees that UTK shall be entitled to compensation as follows:\n\nSEE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE CONFIDENTIAL TERM SHEET (EXHIBIT A) ATTACHED AND MADE A PART HEREOF.",

In consideration for the services to be provided, AVDU agrees that it will remit the agreed upon stock certificate within ten (10) days of both parties executing this Agreement.\n\n  B. AVDU agrees that UTK shall be entitled to compensation as follows:\n\nSEE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE CONFIDENTIAL TERM SHEET (EXHIBIT A) ATTACHED AND MADE A PART HEREOF.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by modifying the payment deadline in Section V.A to ten days, while Exhibit A later specifies a five-day deadline, creating ambiguity regarding the actual payment term.

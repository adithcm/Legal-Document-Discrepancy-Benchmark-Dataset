                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment deadline for the monthly installments. Originally, payments were due on or prior to the fifteenth day of each month. Now, one section states they are due on or prior to the last day of each month, creating ambiguity as to when payments are considered late.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradiction by changing the payment deadline. The original text specifies the 15th day of each month, while the altered text requires payment within ten business days of invoice receipt. This uncertainty can lead to disagreements regarding payment schedules and potential late fees.",

The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant will always be paid by NetGrocer, regardless of any discrepancy found during the audit.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict concerning the conditions for auditing payment records. Initially, NetGrocer had to provide 30 days' notice, and Excite would cover audit fees if a discrepancy exceeding 5% was found. The modified text reduces the notice to 15 days and makes NetGrocer responsible for all audit fees irrespective of audit findings, creating uncertainty and potential disputes regarding audit procedures and costs.",

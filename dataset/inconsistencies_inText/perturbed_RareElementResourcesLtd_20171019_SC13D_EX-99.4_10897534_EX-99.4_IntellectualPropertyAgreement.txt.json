If Company fails to cure the identified breach within thirty (30) days after the date of the notice, Investor may terminate this IP Agreement by written notice to Company.",
                "changed_text": "16.01 Investor at any time may provide written notice to Company of a material breach of this IP Agreement. If Company fails to cure the identified breach within sixty (60) days after the date of the notice, Investor may terminate this IP Agreement by written notice to Company.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces a contradiction regarding the cure period for a material breach. Originally, the Company had 30 days to cure a breach. The modified text extends this period to 60 days, creating uncertainty about the applicable cure period and potentially leading to disputes over the termination rights.",

If the Parties cannot resolve any Dispute for any reason, including, but not limited to, the failure of the Parties to agree to enter into mediation or agree to any settlement proposed by the mediator, within sixty (60) days after the Escalation to Mediation Date, either the Company or the Holder may file suit in a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Article 18.04.",

                "explanation": "Here, the time frame to enter into litigation is changed from 60 to 30 days after the Escalation to Mediation Date, creating another contradiction with article 18.01, where mediation is supposed to occur, but this may also be undermined.",

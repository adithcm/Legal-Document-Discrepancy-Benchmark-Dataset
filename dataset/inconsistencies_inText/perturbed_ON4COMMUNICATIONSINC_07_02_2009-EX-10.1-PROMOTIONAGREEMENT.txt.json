                "changed_text": "The Fee shall be payable to Charity Tunes in two equal installments of $58,802.80 (plus applicable taxes). The first installment is due to Charity Tunes on October 1, 2009, payable upon receipt of invoice. The second installment is due to Charity Tunes on November 15, 2009, payable 30 days after receipt of invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. The original text states the second installment is due November 1, 2009, payable upon receipt of invoice. The modified text states it's due November 15, 2009, but payable 30 days after receipt of the invoice. This creates uncertainty about the actual due date for the second installment.",

                "explanation": "The original text warrants immediate provision of music downloads. The modified text changes this to 'commercially reasonable efforts' and disclaims responsibility for delays due to circumstances beyond Charity Tunes' control. This weakens the original warranty, creating a contradiction and making it less clear what Charity Tunes is actually obligated to provide, leading to potential disputes about breach of warranty.",

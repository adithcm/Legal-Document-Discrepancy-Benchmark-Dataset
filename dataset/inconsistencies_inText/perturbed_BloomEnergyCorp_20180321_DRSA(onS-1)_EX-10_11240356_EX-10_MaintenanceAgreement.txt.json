With respect to each year of such Facility's Warranty Period, the Service Fees shall be invoiced not later than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the calendar month in which the anniversary of the date of Commencement of Operations for such Bloom System occurred, and shall be payable within thirty (30) days of invoice.

With respect to each year of such Facility's Warranty Period, the Service Fees shall be invoiced not later than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the calendar month in which the anniversary of the date of Commencement of Operations for such Bloom System occurred, and shall be payable within sixty (60) days of invoice.

                "explanation": "The change introduces a contradiction by stating that service fees are payable within *sixty (60) days* of the invoice, while the original text specifies a payment term of *thirty (30) days*. This creates confusion about the actual payment deadline, potentially leading to disputes and uncertainty regarding when late fees apply. This is a clear instance of conflicting deadlines within the contract.",

                "explanation": "This change modifies the timeframe for dismissing bankruptcy petitions or vacating court orders related to receivership from ninety (90) days to sixty (60) days. This creates an in-text contradiction and uncertainty regarding the conditions that trigger an Operator Default, potentially leading to disputes over whether a default has occurred. If the petition in bankruptcy is not dismissed in ninety (90) days as in the original or sixty (60) days as in the edited text, the Operator is in default, which causes uncertainty about the termination of the contract in this scenario.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'provided that any claims under this Agreement that accrued before such termination shall survive such termination until the resolution of those claims,' this creates a direct contradiction. The original text allows claims accrued before the warranty termination to survive until resolution. The changed text states that no claims survive warranty termination. This creates significant ambiguity about claim resolution after the warranty period ends.",

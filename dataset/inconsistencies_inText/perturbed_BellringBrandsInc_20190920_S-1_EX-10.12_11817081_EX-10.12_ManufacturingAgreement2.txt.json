The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",

                "explanation": "By adding 'Premier's obligation to purchase MAOV will be at their discretion for any Contract Period,' we introduce a contradiction.

By adding the sentence 'However, any clause referencing a 'Contract Period' is now subject to renegotiation at Premier's request,' a contradiction is introduced. This allows Premier to potentially alter previously agreed-upon terms related to 'Contract Period,' creating conflict and uncertainty about enforcement of the original agreement.",

                "original_text": "5.4 Payment terms Unless separate payment terms are agreed to outside of this Agreement by both parties in writing, payment terms will be as follows: (i) 50% of the Total Order Cost must be paid on placement of the customer's order. (ii) The remaining 50% of the total order cost must be paid prior to the goods leaving the warehouse of the manufacturer. The Manufacturer will notify the Customer when the goods are ready for shipment prior to the goods leaving the warehouse.",
                "changed_text": "5.4 Payment terms Unless separate payment terms are agreed to outside of this Agreement by both parties in writing, payment terms will be as follows: (i) 50% of the Total Order Cost must be paid on placement of the customer's order. (ii) The remaining 50% of the total order cost must be paid within 30 days of the customer receiving the invoice. The Manufacturer will notify the Customer when the goods are ready for shipment prior to the goods leaving the warehouse.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding when the final 50% payment is due. The original text states it's due 'prior to the goods leaving the warehouse,' while the modified text states it's due 'within 30 days of the customer receiving the invoice.' This creates uncertainty as to which payment deadline is enforceable, potentially leading to disputes.",

A six (6) months notice must be given by either party of their intention to terminate relations due to any reason other than breach of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "1.2 Term This agreement is for a term of ten (10) years. 1.3 Renewal This agreement will be automatically renewed at the end of every ten (10) year term, with each subsequent term of renewal being for a five (5) year term. A six (6) months notice must be given by either party of their intention to terminate relations due to any reason other than breach of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The renewal term is changed from ten years to five years. This introduces a contradiction, as the first clause says the renewal is for a ten year term while the second states the renewal is for a five year term. This causes uncertainty on the contract length.",

                "explanation": "The initial term for the exclusive rights granted to the customer is changed from ten years to five years. This directly contradicts section 1.2, where the contract's term is specified as ten years. This ambiguity leaves the duration of the exclusive rights open to interpretation and potential disputes.",

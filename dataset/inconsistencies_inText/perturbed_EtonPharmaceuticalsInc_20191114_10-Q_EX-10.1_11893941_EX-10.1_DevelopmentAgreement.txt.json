                "explanation": "This change creates inconsistencies in the payment deadlines for licensing fees. Initially, the contract stipulates payments within 'five (5) days', 'thirty (30) days', and 'thirty (30) days' for different milestones. By modifying these to 'fifteen (15) days', 'forty-five (45) days', and 'fifteen (15) days' respectively, the sections now contradict the exact timeframe for each milestone payment, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over when each payment is due.",

Section 11.2(a) is changed to state that termination is effective 'forty-five (45) days' after notice for non-payment breaches, while the subsequent clause still mentions a 'thirty (30) or sixty (60) day period' for curing breaches.

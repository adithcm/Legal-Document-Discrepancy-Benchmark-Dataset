For any Government Sales brought by VET TECH COOL TECH agrees to be held to the same billing and payment terms as is dictated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines and requirements; otherwise, COOL TECH will bill the client directly.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, VET TECH may, at its election, bill the client directly for COOL TECH Services and under such circumstances COOL TECH shall bill VET TECH the pre-agreed amount for the engagement as adjusted by any client-approved change orders, with payment due within 15 days of invoice. For any Government Sales brought by VET TECH COOL TECH agrees to be held to the same billing and payment terms as is dictated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines and requirements, with payment due within 45 days of invoice; otherwise, COOL TECH will bill the client directly.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting payment terms. For COOL TECH services billed through VET TECH, payment is due in 15 days, whereas Government sales follow FAR guidelines which typically allow for 30 days or more. This creates an in-text contradiction regarding the payment deadline.",

This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive one year periods unless either party gives written notice of termination to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of expiration.",

This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive one year periods unless either party gives written notice of termination to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of expiration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may terminate this agreement with written notice of termination to the other party at least ninety (90) days prior to the date of expiration.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation creates an in-text contradiction regarding the period of notice required for termination. The original text specifies thirty (30) days notice for termination to prevent automatic renewal, while the added sentence requires ninety (90) days notice for termination in general. This leads to confusion as to which notice period applies, creating uncertainty about the termination process.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding responsibility for client relationships. One sentence states that VET TECH has ultimate responsibility for client relationships when billing for COOL TECH services, while the added sentence says that COOL TECH has ultimate responsibility for client relationships when billing for VET TECH Services. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes regarding client management.",

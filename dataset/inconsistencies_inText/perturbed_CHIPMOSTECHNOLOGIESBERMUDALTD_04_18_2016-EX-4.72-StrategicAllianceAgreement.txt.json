                "original_text": "2.1 Term of Agreement Except as otherwise provided herein, the term of this Agreement is three (3) years from the Execution Date (\"Cooperation Period\"). The Parties may negotiate for an extension of this Agreement six (6) months before the expiration of the Cooperation Period.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Term of Agreement Except as otherwise provided herein, the term of this Agreement is three (3) years from the Execution Date (\"Cooperation Period\"). The Parties may negotiate for an extension of this Agreement six (6) months before the expiration of the Cooperation Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tsinghua Unigroup shall have the unilateral right to extend the agreement for an additional two (2) years by providing written notice to ChipMOS at least three (3) months prior to the initial expiration date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the extension of the agreement. Section 2.1 initially states that both parties must negotiate for an extension. However, the added sentence grants Tsinghua Unigroup the unilateral right to extend the agreement, creating uncertainty about whether ChipMOS's consent is required for an extension. This will cause disputes over the legalities of extending the contract.",

The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (\"Dispute Notice\") to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall each select one (1) arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. All language used in such proceedings shall be Mandarin Chinese. The Parties agree to keep the content of the dispute and the proceeding of the arbitration confidential. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney's fees).",

The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (\"Dispute Notice\") to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute.

However, any intellectual property dispute will be resolved through litigation in the People's Court of Beijing, China.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the dispute resolution process and governing law. Initially, all disputes are governed by Taiwan law and resolved through arbitration in Hong Kong. The added text specifies that intellectual property disputes are governed by PRC law and litigated in Beijing courts. This creates ambiguity on which jurisdiction and method applies if a dispute involves both contractual and intellectual property elements. This can cause serious legal issues when either party wants to initiate dispute proceedings.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding the assignment of rights and obligations. The original clause states that neither party can assign their rights or obligations without the other party's written consent. The added clause allows Tsinghua Unigroup to assign its rights and obligations to its affiliates without ChipMOS's consent, as long as Tsinghua Unigroup guarantees the performance of the assignee. This gives Tsinghua Unigroup more flexibility and power than ChipMOS when it comes to this term of the contract and is contradictory.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict by stating that Schedule C dictates pricing, while simultaneously indicating that Schedule D will supersede it for orders after a certain date. This creates uncertainty about which pricing schedule applies, especially if Schedule D is not fully consistent with Schedule C. This contradiction could cause disputes over invoice amounts and payment terms.",

Upon expiration, this Second Amendment shall be of no further force or effect, and the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall as they were before the Second Amendment Effective Date.

                "changed_text": "This Second Amendment shall be effective from The Second Amendment Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2021. Upon expiration, this Second Amendment shall be of no further force or effect, except for payment obligations, which shall continue indefinitely. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Party's right to enforce the terms and conditions of this Second Amendment shall survive the Second Amendment's expiration, but only for a period of 90 days.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict by stating the amendment expires on a certain date but then contradicting itself. The first contradiction is stating the payment obligations will continue indefinitely even after the expiration date, and the second conflict is that the party has the right to enforce the term but only for a period of 90 days. It is therefore unclear which terms remain enforceable after the expiration date and creates ambiguity regarding post-expiration payment and enforcement rights, which can lead to disputes.",

The products shall also conform to Post Holding's Quality Expectations Manual attached hereto as Schedule E, unless those expectations have changed in the 6 months since the last review, and shall conform in all material respects to samples previously supplied to Premier by Heritage, except in extenuating circumstances.\"",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict by allowing deviations from the specifications, the Post Holding's Quality Expectations and samples even though it states that products *shall conform* to said specifications and manual. By adding 'but may deviate up to 10%', 'unless those expectations have changed' and 'except in extenuating circumstances', it introduces subjective criteria. It creates uncertainty about what constitutes an acceptable product. This conflict could lead to disputes about product acceptance and payment obligations.",

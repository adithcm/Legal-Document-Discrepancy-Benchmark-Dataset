                "original_text": "On the first Business Day of each month, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the Contractor shall provide  the Company with a written invoice for the previous month's fees and expenses that are payable with respect to Notes issued up to the  last day of such month.. Such fees and expenses will be due and payable by the later of the fifteenth (15 ) day of every month or fifteen  (15) days after the date such invoice is received.",
                "changed_text": "On the first Business Day of each month, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the Contractor shall provide  the Company with a written invoice for the previous month's fees and expenses that are payable with respect to Notes issued up to the  last day of such month.. Such fees and expenses will be due and payable no later than thirty (30) days after the invoice is received.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict with the original payment terms. Initially, payment was due by the later of the 15th of the month or 15 days after invoice receipt. The modification extends the payment deadline to 30 days after invoice receipt, creating ambiguity and a contradiction on when payments are due.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by changing the termination notice period required from the Contractor. The original text specifies a 90-day notice, while the modified version reduces it to 30 days. This discrepancy creates uncertainty and conflict regarding the actual notice period required for termination by the Contractor, potentially leading to disputes over contract compliance.",

Company shall be responsible for the accuracy, completeness and propriety of information concerning its products and services  that it furnishes to Contractor in connection with the performance of the services.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the words \"any material breach by Company of this Agreement or\" from the original text directly contradicts the intent and purpose of an indemnification clause. By removing these words, the company indemnifies the contractor only for gross negligence, and the wording is contradictory. The indemnification clause is to protect contractor from damages from a breach or wrongful act by the company. ",

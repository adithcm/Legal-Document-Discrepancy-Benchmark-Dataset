PAPA JOHN'S shall pay ABG a cash payment of: One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars (USD$1,250,000) for Contract Year 1, One Million Three Hundred Seventy Five Thousand U.S. Dollars (USD$1,375,000) for Contract Year 2, and One Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (USD$1,500,000) for Contract Year 3 (such cash payments for Contract Years 1-3 referred to herein as the \"Cash Payment\") for the services and rights provided hereunder. In addition to the Cash Payment and any other compensation payable to ABG (and, as applicable, CELEBRITY) hereunder, PAPA JOHN'S shall pay without limitation, usage of the union-covered materials produced hereunder, with usage applied against the Cash Payment at double scale (or such other applicable rate). Each of such Cash Payments shall be paid in four equal installments, as set forth in Section 5.A.3 below, as follows:\n\n(A) The first payment is due on the Effective Date for the First Contract Year, and March 1 for subsequent Contract Years;\n\n(B) The second payment is due June 1 for each Contract Year;\n\n(C) The third payment is due September 1 for each Contract Year; and\n\n(D) The fourth payment is due December 1 for each Contract Year.",

                "explanation": "The modification changes the due dates for the second and third payments. Originally, the second payment was due June 1, and the third was due September 1. The modified text changes these dates to July 1 and October 1, respectively. This creates an in-text contradiction because if a payment falls after the date initially agreed upon in Section 5.A.1, it causes ambiguity regarding which deadline should be enforced and thus creates legal uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that upon termination by ABG, Papa John's must pay all unpaid amounts for the next eighteen (18) months. However, the modified clause shortens this period to six (6) months. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the duration for which Papa John's is obligated to pay, leading to potential disputes. If ABG terminates, it is unclear which period applies, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The change states that if Papa John's terminates the agreement, Celebrity shall NOT be entitled to vest in a pro-rata share of RSUs. This contradicts the original statement, which explicitly states that Celebrity WILL be entitled to vest in a pro-rata share of the RSUs. This alteration creates uncertainty about the vesting of RSUs upon termination by Papa John's and thus creates legal uncertainty.",

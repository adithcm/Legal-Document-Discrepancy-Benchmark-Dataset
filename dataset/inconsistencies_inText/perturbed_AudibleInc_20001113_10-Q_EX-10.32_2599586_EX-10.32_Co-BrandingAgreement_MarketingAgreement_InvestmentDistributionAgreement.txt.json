                "original_text": "Payments called for by this Section 5 which are not received within five (5) business days after the date upon which payment is due will bear interest at a rate equal to the lesser of one and one-half percent (1- 1/2%) per month or the maximum legal rate permitted under the controlling Laws. Payment of such interest shall not cure or excuse any breach of any underlying payment obligation.",
                "changed_text": "Payments called for by this Section 5 which are not received within ten (10) business days after the date upon which payment is due will bear interest at a rate equal to the lesser of one percent (1%) per month or the prime rate. Payment of such interest shall not cure or excuse any breach of any underlying payment obligation.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by modifying the payment deadline from five business days to ten, the interest rate from 1.5% to 1%, and changing the benchmark rate from the maximum legal rate to the prime rate. This creates uncertainty regarding when late fees apply and how they are calculated, making the enforcement ambiguous.",

Company will not modify or terminate any coverage without giving at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to ACSI. Upon request from ACSI, Company will furnish to ACSI certificates of insurance and such other documentation relating to such policies as ACSI may reasonably request.",

Company may modify or terminate any coverage with written notice to ACSI but without needing ACSI's consent. Upon request from ACSI, Company is not obligated to furnish to ACSI certificates of insurance and such other documentation relating to such policies as ACSI may reasonably request.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the obligations regarding insurance policies. The original text requires 30 days' notice before modification or termination of coverage and obligates the Company to furnish insurance documentation upon request. The modified text removes the obligation to maintain 30 days written notice and states that Company is not obligated to furnish ACSI with proof of requested documents. This makes enforcement of consistent insurance coverage uncertain.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces contradictions regarding press releases and public disclosures. The original text requires mutual approval for press releases and prevents unilateral disclosures about the agreement. The modified text allows either party to independently issue press releases and disclosures, only requiring notification instead of prior written consent. This creates ambiguity about the level of control each party has over public statements about the partnership.",

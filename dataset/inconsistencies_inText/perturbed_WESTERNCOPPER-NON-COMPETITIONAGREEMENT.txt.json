                "original_text": "Definitions\n\n1.1 In this Agreement, including the recitals, except as expressly provided or unless  the context otherwise requires,\n\n(a) Affiliate means, in respect of a party hereto, a corporation which is the subsidiary  of the party or vice versa or where each of the party and the corporation is controlled by  the same person,",
                "changed_text": "Definitions\n\n1.1 In this Agreement, including the recitals, except as expressly provided or unless  the context otherwise requires,\n\n(a) Affiliate means, in respect of a party hereto, any entity with a business relationship to the party, regardless of ownership structure.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' is based on corporate control (subsidiary, parent, or common control). The modified definition broadens this to any entity with a 'business relationship', contradicting the specific control-based definition and creating ambiguity. This impacts sections relying on the original definition for rights and obligations, especially clause 1.3",

                "explanation": "Section 4.1 states 'Time is of the essence,' a standard legal clause emphasizing strict adherence to deadlines. Adding a clause that deadlines may be extended introduces a contradiction. This creates uncertainty, especially in clauses like 2.2 (Right of First Offer) where strict timelines are defined.",

                "explanation": "Clause 4.7 states the agreement is binding on successors and permitted assigns of each party. Adding a restriction that Western Copper cannot assign without approval creates a contradiction. While it doesn't explicitly prohibit assignment, it introduces a requirement for Glamis's approval, conflicting with the original clause implying free assignability (subject to typical legal constraints).",

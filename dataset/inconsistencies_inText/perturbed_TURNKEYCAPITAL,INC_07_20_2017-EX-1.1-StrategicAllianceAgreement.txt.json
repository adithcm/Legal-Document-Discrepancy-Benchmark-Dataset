                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement is twenty-four (24) months. The Agreement may be renewed, subject to mutual written approval.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is twenty-four (24) months. The Agreement may be renewed, subject to mutual written approval. However, TKCI has the option to extend the agreement for an additional twelve (12) months by providing written notice to SIC at least thirty (30) days before the initial term expires.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the renewal of the agreement. Initially, renewal requires mutual written approval. The added sentence grants TKCI a unilateral option to extend, conflicting with the mutual agreement requirement. This creates uncertainty about whether SIC's approval is needed for an extension and under what conditions the agreement can be extended.",

                "original_text": "Net revenue from business operations created by Holding Company for the alliance will be distributed by Holding Company equally - 50/50 - to TKCI and SIC:",
                "changed_text": "Net revenue from business operations created by Holding Company for the alliance will be distributed by Holding Company to TKCI and SIC as follows: 50% to TKCI and 40% to SIC, with the remaining 10% allocated at the discretion of TKCI for operational expenses related to the alliance.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 50/50 split of net revenue. The modification changes the distribution to 50% for TKCI and 40% for SIC, with 10% allocated at TKCI's discretion. This contradicts the initially agreed-upon equal distribution and creates ambiguity regarding the actual revenue-sharing terms, potentially leading to disputes over financial entitlements.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement may be terminated early if mutually agreed to by both parties in writing, or for cause, which is defined as conviction of either party of a criminal offense, actions in bad faith, and knowing or intentional misconduct, failure to perform as determined by SIC, or a material breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated early if mutually agreed to by both parties in writing, or for cause, which is defined as conviction of either party of a criminal offense, actions in bad faith, and knowing or intentional misconduct, failure to perform as determined by SIC, or a material breach of this Agreement. However, TKCI reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time with thirty (30) days written notice, regardless of cause.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires mutual agreement or 'cause' for early termination. The added clause grants TKCI the unilateral right to terminate with 30 days' notice, irrespective of cause. This directly contradicts the initial termination terms, creating uncertainty regarding the conditions under which the agreement can be terminated and potentially exposing SIC to termination without any fault on its part.",

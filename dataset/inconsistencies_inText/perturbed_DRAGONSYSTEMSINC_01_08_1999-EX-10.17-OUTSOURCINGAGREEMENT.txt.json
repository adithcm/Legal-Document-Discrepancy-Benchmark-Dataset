                "original_text": "Payments will be due in US dollars within 30 days after delivery, or when agreed after delivery of installments or the receipt of invoice by Dragon Systems, which ever is later.",
                "changed_text": "Payments will be due in US dollars within 30 days after delivery, or when agreed after delivery of installments or the receipt of invoice by Dragon Systems, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for invoices exceeding US$100,000, payment will be due within 60 days of the receipt of invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. The original text specifies payment due within 30 days or upon receipt of invoice, whichever is later. The added clause extends the payment term to 60 days for invoices exceeding US$100,000, creating ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the applicable payment deadline for large invoices.",

                "changed_text": "Should MMI not supply the Services as agreed or should the Services become defective within 6 months from their delivery to Dragon Systems, Dragon Systems may at its option require MMI to complete or re-perform the Services within a reasonable period of time, rescind the contract or refuse payment of the compensation in part or in total, notwithstanding any damage claims. However, for software-related services, the defect liability period shall be limited to 3 months.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradiction in the warranty terms. The original clause states a 6-month warranty period for defective services. The added clause reduces this period to 3 months for software-related services, creating confusion about the warranty duration based on service type.",

                "changed_text": "Dragon may terminate this agreement without cause by giving sixty (60) days written notice to MMI. However, if Dragon terminates the agreement within the first year, a termination fee of $50,000 will be applied.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction regarding termination rights. The original text allows Dragon to terminate without cause with 60 days' notice. The added clause imposes a termination fee if the agreement is ended within the first year. This creates inconsistency as the unconditioned right is limited with a fee. This creates confusion over conditions for no-cause termination.",

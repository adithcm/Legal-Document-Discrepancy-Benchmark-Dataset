The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a thirty-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, ESSI may terminate this agreement at any time, with no notice period, if Talent's public image is tarnished.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the termination clause. The original clause requires a 30-day notice for termination by either party. The added sentence allows ESSI to terminate immediately under specific, subjective conditions (tarnished public image), creating uncertainty about the applicable termination procedure.",

Equity Payment: ESSI will provide Talent with one-million (1,000,000) shares of restricted common stock issued within ten business days of execution of this Agreement.   B. Cash Payments:\n\n(1) ESSI will provide monthly payment of Ten Thousand and NO/100 Dollars ($10,000) made payable to Talent for Talent's social communications with its followers on popular social media venues, including, but not limited to, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snap Chat where Talent may communicate about the ESSI product suite (\"Social Communication\"). The monthly Social Communication schedule will be mutually agreed upon by Talent and ESSI one month in advance of the actual month of communications. Once the monthly Social Communication schedule is set, the volume of Posts, Tweets and Snaps will determine the total amount of monthly compensation available to Talent. ESSI's Social Media Manager will keep track of Talent's activity pursuant to ESSI's Company quarter to determine the amount of Cash Payment due for the quarter.",

The monthly Social Communication schedule will be mutually agreed upon by Talent and ESSI one month in advance of the actual month of communications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ESSI reserves the right to withhold cash payments in any month where the company's revenue targets are not met.",
                "explanation": "This introduces an inconsistency regarding cash payments. While the original text outlines a schedule and process for monthly payments, the added sentence gives ESSI the right to withhold payments based on revenue targets. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes over whether Talent is entitled to the agreed-upon cash consideration, regardless of fulfilling the communication schedule.",

Said written approval must be given within five (5) business days of Talent's receipt or said usage shall be deemed unapproved. Any such usage featuring Talent in the Commercial Placements and/or press releases shall be and remain the property of ESSI; however, ESSI shall have the right to use said Commercial Placements and/or press releases solely as outlined in Paragraph 3 and only during the Term. Talent may use said materials in whole or in part solely for the purpose of presenting Talent's work in Talent's personal portfolio, website or otherwise and/or on Talent's agent's website.

Said written approval must be given within five (5) business days of Talent's receipt or said usage shall be deemed unapproved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ESSI can proceed with the commercial placement regardless of Talent's approval if ESSI reasonably believes the placement will benefit the company.

                "explanation": "The added sentence contradicts the requirement for Talent's prior written approval. While initially stating that all uses are subject to Talent's approval, it then allows ESSI to bypass this approval if it believes the placement will benefit the company. This creates a conflict and ambiguity about whether Talent's approval is truly required, leading to uncertainty in enforcement and potentially disagreements about what constitutes a 'benefit' to the company.",

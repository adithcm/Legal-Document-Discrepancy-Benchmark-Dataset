                "original_text": "Any payments required to be made by either party under this Agreement shall be made in United States dollars via wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as the other party shall designate in writing prior to the date of such payment.",
                "changed_text": "Any payments required to be made by either party under this Agreement shall be made in United States dollars via wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as the other party shall designate in writing no later than 30 days after the invoice date, unless otherwise specified.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original clause states that bank account details should be designated *prior* to the payment date. The modified clause adds 'no later than 30 days after the invoice date', creating a contradiction on when the information should be provided. This creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Within ninety (90) days following the end of each Agreement Quarter, King shall provide the JCC with a status report, which report will summarize King's Promotional activities pursuant to this Agreement for such prior Agreement Quarter and on a calendar year-to-date basis, including, to the extent King customarily creates the following reports for King's other products which are promoted by or on behalf of King: (a) the number of P1, P2 and P3 Details made and recorded by King's standard record keeping procedures; (b) the names and addresses of the Professionals called upon; (c) the percentage of Professionals Detailed who were provided with Samples; (d) the average number of such Samples delivered on each Detail; (e) a breakdown of all information required to be contained in each report on an aggregate basis; (f) any Professionals added to the King Physician List during such quarter; and (g) such other information as may be required in the then- current Annual Plan. However, detailed reports with sensitive data, such as names and addresses, will be provided within thirty (30) days, as previously agreed.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the reporting timeline. The initial statement says the report, including specific details, is due in 30 days. The modification extends the deadline to 90 days but then adds 'However, detailed reports with sensitive data, such as names and addresses, will be provided within thirty (30) days, as previously agreed,' thus creating uncertainty and contradicting the 90-day extension. This uncertainty can lead to enforcement issues.",

                "changed_text": "The Term of this Agreement shall be extended for subsequent one year periods upon the mutual agreement of the parties, which agreement shall be set forth in writing (in which event a party that desires to so extend the Term of this Agreement shall notify the other party at least 120 days prior to the termination of this Agreement). However, if neither party provides notice, the term shall automatically renew for one year unless either party objects within 30 days of the original termination date.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires 'mutual agreement' in writing to extend the term. The modification introduces an 'automatic renewal' if neither party gives notice, contradicting the 'mutual agreement' requirement. It then creates further ambiguity by allowing a party to object *after* the termination date, which makes enforcement unclear.",

Further, if Sponsorship Fees have been paid in advance, Allied shall retain all such fees, regardless of the termination date.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by stating that Allied retains all pre-paid sponsorship fees upon termination, regardless of the termination date, directly conflicting with the initial clause of prorating and refunding the unused portion.

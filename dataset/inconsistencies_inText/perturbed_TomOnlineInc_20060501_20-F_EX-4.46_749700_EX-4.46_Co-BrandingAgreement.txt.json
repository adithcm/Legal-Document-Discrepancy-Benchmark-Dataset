In the event that Skype provides any Payment Services hereunder, within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, Skype shall furnish to the Company complete and accurate Statements in a form acceptable to Online BVI, certified to be accurate by an officer of Skype, showing with reasonable detail (i) the Gross Revenue actually received and collected by Skype, or if applicable, its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (including, without limitation, a Subsidiary or other Affiliate of Skype Holding), licensee, distributor or reseller thereof, during the preceding calendar quarter and on a cumulative basis, (ii) the Direct Expenses incurred thereby, during the preceding calendar quarter and on a cumulative basis, and (iii) the calculation of Adjusted Net Revenue. The respective Parties shall use their best efforts to accompany each respective Statement with payment, to Skype, if provided by the Company or Online BVI (or their associated third parties set forth above), or to the Company (or Online BVI, as applicable), if provided by Skype (or its associated third parties set forth above), as applicable, of 50% of the Adjusted Net Revenue shown on the respective Statements. Provided that the respective Parties utilize their best efforts to provide such payments together with the respective Statements, no Party shall be deemed in breach hereof for delivering late payment until the date which is sixty (60) days following the last day of the respective applicable calendar quarter. All payments shall be paid in Euros, and in the event revenue is earned by a Party (or its associated third parties set forth above) in currencies other than in Euros, then such Party shall convert said amounts each month into Euros based upon the exchange rate published by the Wall Street Journal as of the fifteenth day of such month or if such day shall fall on a non-business day then as of the first business day following said fifteenth day.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradiction in the acceptable methods for delivering legal notices. The original clause outlines three methods (personal delivery, certified mail, express courier), whereas the added sentence specifies that revenue statement and payment notices must be delivered via email to the CFO. This introduces confusion as to which method applies to revenue statements and payment notices, potentially leading to disputes over the validity of delivered notices.",

                "explanation": "In this perturbation, I have changed the interest rate charged on late payments from the highest rate of interest quoted as the \"prime rate\" in The Wall Street Journal to 0%. This creates an in-text contradiction as to what the interest rate on late payments will be as well as ambiguity.",

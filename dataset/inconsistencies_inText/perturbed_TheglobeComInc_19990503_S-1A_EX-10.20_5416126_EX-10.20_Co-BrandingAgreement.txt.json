                "explanation": "This change introduces multiple conflicts: shortening the record-keeping period from 3 years to 1 year, decreasing audit frequency from every 12 months to every 36 months, removing the restriction that audits not unreasonably interfere with business activities, providing a 30-day grace period for overdue payments without interest (contradicting Section 6.1), and stating that the inspecting party always bears the audit cost. These create substantial ambiguities and contradictions regarding audit procedures, grace periods, and payment obligations.",

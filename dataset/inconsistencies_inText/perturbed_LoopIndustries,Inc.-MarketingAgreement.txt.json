                "original_text": "1.3 \"Affiliate\" means, with respect to a Party, any corporation or other entity that is directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under the common control with such Party. For the purpose of this definition, \"control\" means the direct or indirect ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or other voting rights of the subject entity to elect directors (or, in the case of an entity that is not a corporation, for the election of the corresponding managing authority), or if not meeting the preceding, any entity owned or controlled by or owning or controlling at the maximum control or ownership right permitted in the country where such entity exists.",
                "changed_text": "1.3 \"Affiliate\" means, with respect to a Party, any corporation or other entity that is directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under the common control with such Party. For the purpose of this definition, \"control\" means the direct or indirect ownership of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the outstanding shares or other voting rights of the subject entity to elect directors (or, in the case of an entity that is not a corporation, for the election of the corresponding managing authority), or if not meeting the preceding, any entity owned or controlled by or owning or controlling at the maximum control or ownership right permitted in the country where such entity exists.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by altering the definition of 'Affiliate' by modifying the percentage of ownership that constitutes 'control'. The original text specifies 50%, while the modified text lowers it to 25%. This contradicts other sections of the contract that rely on the original 50% threshold to determine rights, obligations, and liabilities related to affiliates, causing uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original text references Section 2 for the meaning of 'control', however, control is defined in Section 1.3. This creates an in-text contradiction as section 2 does not define what control is, therefore generating uncertainty about which term to use to define subsidiary. ",

                "explanation": "This introduces a direct conflict regarding the cure period for a material breach. The original text specifies 30 days, whereas the changed text extends it to 60 days. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the time allowed to rectify a breach before termination can occur.",

All invoices shall be paid in full by wire transfer in accordance with the invoice's instructions.",
                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction by allowing the buyer to defer payment with a late fee, directly conflicting with the initial requirement to pay within the timeframe outlined in Attachment E.

                "explanation": "This introduces a direct contradiction regarding pricing. The original clause states the price is 'Seller's price...as of the date of shipment.' The added text introduces the concept of a 'fixed price' without clarifying the conditions for establishing such a price, leading to ambiguity. This contradiction creates uncertainty regarding the price determination mechanism, potentially leading to disputes. This adds a third conflicting price terms.",

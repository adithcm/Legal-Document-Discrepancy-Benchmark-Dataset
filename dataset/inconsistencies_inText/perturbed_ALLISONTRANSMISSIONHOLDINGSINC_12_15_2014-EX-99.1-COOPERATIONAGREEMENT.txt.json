                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by changing the obligatory \"shall work together\" to the permissive \"may choose to fill\". Furthermore, it weakens the requirement for the replacement nominee to meet historical standards and criteria, making it optional. Finally, it allows acceptability to either the ValueAct Group or the company rather than both. This creates uncertainty regarding the procedure for filling a vacancy and the qualifications of the replacement, potentially leading to disputes.",

Now, the modified text states they *may* engage in proxy solicitation.

The ValueAct Designeeâ€™s resignation from the Board for material breaches will be determined at the sole discretion of the ValueAct Group and will not be required to commence on the original date or any other fixed date. Should the breach not be cured, remedies will be limited to monetary damages only. Each party may take actions in opposition to another party seeking relief. Each of the parties hereto does not agree to waive any bonding requirement under any applicable law, in the case any other party seeks to enforce the terms by way of equitable relief.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the remedies provision. First, 'any of the provisions' is changed to 'some of the provisions', making it less clear when irreparable damage is assumed. Second, monetary damages 'would not be adequately compensable' is changed to 'may be adequately compensable', weakening the justification for equitable relief. The right to an injunction is negated by stating that parties 'may not be entitled' to one, and specific enforcement is disallowed. Resignation due to breach is made discretionary. The waiver of bonding requirement is also negated. All these changes collectively create substantial in-text contradiction, undermining the ability to enforce the agreement through equitable remedies and greatly increasing uncertainty.",

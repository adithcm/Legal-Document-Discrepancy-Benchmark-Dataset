The total sum of non-paid invoices (estimated to be approximately $80,000) payable to Marv Enterprises, LLC, previously owed by Premier to Marv up until the effective date of this Agreement, payable in total by no later than July 20, 2020. Notwithstanding the foregoing, THI shall have until August 15, 2020, to remit such payment without penalty.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict in payment terms. The original clause specifies a payment deadline of July 20, 2020, for the outstanding invoices. The added sentence extends this deadline to August 15, 2020, without penalty, creating uncertainty about the actual due date and potential consequences of late payment.",

The payment will be for developing fluorescently-conjugated antibodies in the Field of Covid-19 Treatments.  However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the deadline for this payment is extended to July 5, 2020, provided THI submits a written request for extension by June 15, 2020.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a conditional extension to the payment deadline. While the initial deadline is June 20, 2020, THI can extend it to July 5, 2020, by requesting it beforehand. This creates a contradiction, as it's now unclear whether the payment is due on June 20 or July 5, depending on whether THI submits a timely extension request.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, THI shall maintain the exclusive license regardless of payment status provided THI provides Premier Biomedical, Inc. with verifiable proof of ongoing research and development activities related to the Covid-19 Licensed Products.",
                "explanation": "This edit creates a direct contradiction. Originally, failure to meet payment deadlines in 3(a) results in license reversion. The added sentence states that THI maintains the license, regardless of payment, if R&D activity is verifiable. This conflicting information creates ambiguity regarding the conditions under which the exclusive license is maintained, potentially leading to disputes.",

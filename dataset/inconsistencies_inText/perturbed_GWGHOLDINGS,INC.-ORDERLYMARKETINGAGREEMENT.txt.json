                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the deadline for reselling all shares. The original text states that resale should be completed 'as soon as practicable,' which is open to interpretation. The modified text imposes a hard deadline of 'three (3) months after the Effective Date.' This creates uncertainty because 'as soon as practicable' could extend beyond three months, resulting in a breach if the original intent is enforced, or if it is taken literally it would not make sense with commencing 'not earlier than six (6) months after the Effective Date'.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction regarding the termination clause. The original text allows termination 'with or without cause' and 'without liability or continuing obligation.' The modified text stipulates termination 'with cause' only, imposing 'liability and continuing obligation'. This creates uncertainty as the termination terms are now inconsistent. Additionally the original text says the Trust Advisors can terminate in their sole discretion whereas the modification states that all parties must be in agreement.",

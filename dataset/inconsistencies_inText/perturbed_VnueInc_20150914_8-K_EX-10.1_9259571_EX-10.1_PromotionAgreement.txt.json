For providing services as set forth herein, VNUE will compensate Promoter i) Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) for each One (1) Year contract Promoter secures per venue and Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000,00) for each Two (2) Year contract Promoter secures per venue, with payment due to Promoter within Thirty (30) Days from the date on which each such contract is countersigned; and ii) through the issuance of VNUE common stock as set forth below, and for the purposes of Rule 144 such shares of stock shall be deemed to have fully earned by Promoter upon the date of each issuance of such stock certificates by VStock Transfer:",

                "explanation": "This perturbation creates an in-text contradiction by changing both the frequency of expense reports (weekly to monthly) and the reimbursement timeframe (30 days to 15 days). This could lead to disputes regarding the appropriate timing for submitting and receiving expense reimbursements.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'Either party may terminate this agreement with thirty (30) days written notice.' creates a conflict, as the original clause states the agreement continues for one year but now allows either party to terminate with 30 days notice. This contradicts the original one-year term commitment, and creates ambiguity.",

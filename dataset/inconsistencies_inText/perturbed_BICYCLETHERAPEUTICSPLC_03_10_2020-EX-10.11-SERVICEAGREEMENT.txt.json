                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the notice period. While it initially states a six-month notice period for all employees, it then carves out an exception for senior management, reducing their notice period to three months. This creates ambiguity about whether the employee (CBO) falls under senior management and is subject to a shorter notice period.",

That is, if the compensation committee (the \"Compensation Committee\") of the board of directors (the \"Board\") of the Company's parent company, Bicycle Therapeutics plc (\"BTL\") determines that you have completed all such corporate and personal objectives to its satisfaction in a given year, your bonus would be 35% of your Earned Salary in that year, excluding any other bonuses in this offer. Such bonus may be payable in cash or, in whole or in part, in share options in BTL, as agreed by you and the Compensation Committee following notification by you of your preference at least 90 days prior to the normal payment date (and in the case of share options with the appropriate HMRC valuation process (if required by the Compensation Committee) and Board approval so as to be compliant with BTL's share option plan rules), with due consideration for the operational requirements of the Company at that time in your role as CBO.\n\nAny Annual Performance Bonus paid will not be pensionable and are subject to statutory applicable tax and National Insurance deductions. Performance will be assessed by the Compensation Committee at the end of each calendar year, against annual corporate and personal performance objectives agreed between you and the Board at the start of each calendar year, with any such bonus being payable in the first quarter of the following year. Qualification for your Annual Performance Bonus will require that you are employed by the Company (and have not served notice of termination of your employment to the Company) on 31 December of the year to which your bonus entitlement applies.",

                "explanation": "This creates a conflict in the annual bonus terms. The original clause states the employee must be employed on December 31st to qualify for the bonus. The modified text introduces an exception where a pro-rated bonus will be paid upon termination without cause. This makes it ambiguous whether the December 31st employment requirement is absolute, or whether the pro-rated payment applies regardless.",

                "explanation": "The restrictive covenant initially prohibits outside business interests without prior consent. The modification creates an exception for passive investments in publicly traded companies, stating no prior consent is needed. This change creates ambiguity. Is there a limit to the holding in publicly traded companies? If the employee's actions in trading shares causes harm to the company, will summary dismissal apply? It is unclear whether prior written consent is required if holdings in publicly traded companies exceed 3%.",

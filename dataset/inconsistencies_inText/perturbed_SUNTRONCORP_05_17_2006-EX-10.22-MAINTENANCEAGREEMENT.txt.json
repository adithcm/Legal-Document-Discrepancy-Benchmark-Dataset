The Required Capital Contributions shall be made within forty-five (45) days following the last day of each Fiscal Quarter, unless the last day of such Fiscal Quarter is the same as the fiscal year end, and in such case, ninety (90) days following such fiscal year end.",

The Required Capital Contributions shall be made within forty-five (45) days following the last day of each Fiscal Quarter, unless the last day of such Fiscal Quarter is the same as the fiscal year end, and in such case, ninety (90) days following such fiscal year end. However, for the fiscal quarters ending in December, the Required Capital Contributions shall be made within thirty (30) days.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the payment deadline. Most fiscal quarters allow 45 days, and fiscal year-end allows 90 days. Now fiscal quarters ending in December are subject to a 30-day deadline. This creates uncertainty about the correct deadline for December payments.",

Section 10(b) initially allows a 15-day grace period for any failure. The addition now states that there is no grace period if the failure pertains to timing of contributions, removing it from 10(b).",

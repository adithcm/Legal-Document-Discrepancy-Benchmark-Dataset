Payment to the Distributor for the sale of the Products to Customers shall be as follows: (i) Company will pay Distributor (or its Assignee) Ten Percent (10%) of the Master Distributor Override generated by each Customer Kiosk Location. (Master Distributor Override (\"MDO\") shall mean Total Revenue per Customer Kiosk Location collected by SRXS from third party payors and patient cash payments). This 10% of the total revenue generated is payable only if the EBITDA is a positive EBITDA and exceeds the 10% of the revenue. In cases of a positive EBITDA but shortage of funds compared to the 10% of the revenue, Distributor will take less than 10%. If the EBITDA is negative, no payments will be made to Distributor. Additionally, it will be the sole responsibility of Distributor to make a full disclosure of the 10% MDO to all its clients. (ii) The MDO will be payable within ninety (90) days from the date of the transaction (First Month payable by the end of ninety (90) days from the end of the month).",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the 10% MDO is only payable if the EBITDA is positive and exceeds 10% of revenue. The changed text removes this condition, stating the 10% is payable *regardless* of EBITDA. This creates a direct contradiction and uncertainty about when the Distributor is entitled to payment. Furthermore, changing the payment terms from ninety (90) days to thirty (30) days creates further inconsistencies.",

Upon Customer's acceptance of any order, Distributor shall submit to Customer via wire transfer at least Twenty-Five Percent (25%) of the total order price.

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction in how notices are to be sent and when they are considered 'given'. Email is removed as an acceptable form. The original text says notice is given on the date of receipt, while the modified text states it's given on the date of dispatch. This introduces ambiguity and potential disputes, specially if there are delays in mail. Moreover, the time for informing the addresses changes from 7 to 14 days, adding to inconsistency.",

                "changed_text": "1.3  \"Control\" or \"Controlled\" means, with respect to Intellectual Property, that SpinCo or a member of the SpinCo Group has influence over such Intellectual Property, and/or has the right to negotiate a license to Parent with respect to such Intellectual Property. The specifics of control and licensing will be determined on a case-by-case basis by a joint committee comprised of members from both Parent and SpinCo. If no agreement is reached, the final decision will rest with Parent.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and contradiction in the definition of \"Control\". The original definition provides a clear standard based on ownership and the right to grant licenses. The modified definition introduces subjective elements like \"influence\" and a case-by-case determination by a joint committee, ultimately giving Parent the final say. This contradicts the initial clarity and creates uncertainty in enforcement, as the original terms may be superseded by the committee's decisions.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SpinCo hereby grants to each individual member of the Parent Group, on behalf of itself and the other members of the SpinCo Group, and shall cause the other members of the SpinCo Group to grant to each individual member of the Parent Group, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license, for use in the Parent Field, to (i) use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, make Improvements and exploit the Licensed SpinCo IP, and (ii) make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import any goods and services incorporating, embodying or utilizing the Licensed SpinCo IP. The foregoing license shall be transferable or sublicensable by Parent Group solely to a Permitted Party, and, subject to the restrictions herein, with any sale or transfer of a Parent business that utilizes the Licensed SpinCo IP. Any such transfer or sublicense shall require the Permitted Party or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, to agree pursuant to a written agreement to maintain any trade secrets and Information included in the Licensed SpinCo IP in strict confidence. Such agreement shall prohibit any further sublicensing or transfer of rights by the Permitted Party, or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, or any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP outside the scope of the license granted to Parent herein. Parent shall remain responsible and liable for the Permitted Parties' exercise of any rights sublicensed hereunder and any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP by such Permitted Party outside of the permitted scope of the license. Parent shall enforce material breaches of the terms of any such sublicense of rights and notify SpinCo of any material violation thereof by a Permitted Party. If Parent enters an agreement to transfer the license granted to it under this Section 3.1 in connection with any sale or transfer of a Parent business, then SpinCo and members of the SpinCo Group shall be made third party beneficiaries under such transfer agreement to enforce breaches of the license.",

This license shall be for a term of five (5) years, renewable at Parent's option for additional one-year terms, subject to renegotiation of royalties if SpinCo deems necessary. The foregoing license shall be transferable or sublicensable by Parent Group solely to a Permitted Party, and, subject to the restrictions herein, with any sale or transfer of a Parent business that utilizes the Licensed SpinCo IP.

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the \"perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free\" nature of the license originally granted to Parent. By introducing a limited term of five years with renewal options and the possibility of royalty renegotiation, the modified text undermines the original intent of a permanent and unconditional license. This creates significant uncertainty about the long-term rights of Parent to use the Licensed SpinCo IP and opens the door for potential disputes upon renewal.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the delivery of Tangible/Intangible Information. While the original text mandates delivering possession \"without retaining any copies\", the modified text allows for retaining copies for 'internal archival purposes' and ongoing lawsuits. This creates ambiguity as to what extent copies can be retained and under what circumstances, potentially leading to disputes about compliance with the delivery obligation. The inclusion of 'ongoing lawsuits' further complicates matters, as it is unclear what constitutes 'related' information and how long it can be retained.",

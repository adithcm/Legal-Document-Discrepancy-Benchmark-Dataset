                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of information is shared, contradicting the original clause that limits responsibility to information concerning only the undersigned. This creates uncertainty about who is liable for inaccuracies.",

Amendments to Schedule 13G will be filed independently by each Reporting Person. This agreement may be included as an exhibit to such joint filing and also to any individual filings.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction by stating that amendments to Schedule 13G will be filed independently. The original text states the agreement covers statements on Schedule 13G. This change could lead to disputes regarding who is responsible for filing amendments to 13G filings and whether they are subject to joint liability.",

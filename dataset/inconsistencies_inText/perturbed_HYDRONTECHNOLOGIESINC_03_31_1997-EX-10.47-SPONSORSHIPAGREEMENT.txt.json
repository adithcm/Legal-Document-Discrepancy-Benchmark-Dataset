The Dolphins agree to provide written notice to Hydron of the failure to receive any payment, and Hydron shall have a five (5) business day period following delivery of written notice in which to cure the payment default before the Dolphins may elect to terminate this Agreement and pursue applicable remedies. It is agreed by Hydron that any such election of remedies does not waive any other remedies for breach of contract available to the Dolphins.",

The Dolphins agree to provide written notice to Hydron of the failure to receive any payment, and Hydron shall have a twenty (20) business day period following delivery of written notice in which to cure the payment default before the Dolphins may elect to terminate this Agreement and pursue applicable remedies. It is agreed by Hydron that any such election of remedies does not waive any other remedies for breach of contract available to the Dolphins.",
                "explanation": "Changing the cure period from five business days to twenty creates a direct contradiction. It is unclear which cure period applies, leading to potential disputes over default and termination rights.",

                "explanation": "Changing the cure period for payment default from five business days to fifteen business days creates a contradiction with section 3.2 (which now states 20 business days). This introduces uncertainty regarding the actual cure period Hydron has for payment defaults, which could result in a conflict of interpretation and potential litigation.",

Upon termination of this Agreement by the Dolphins pursuant to paragraph 8.1(a), any and all payments then or later due to the Dolphins shall\n\nbecome due and payable in full immediately, and no portion of any prior payments made to the Dolphins shall be refundable.",

Upon termination of this Agreement by the Dolphins pursuant to paragraph 8.1(a), any and all payments then or later due to the Dolphins shall\n\nbecome due and payable in full immediately, and 50% of prior payments made to the Dolphins shall be refundable.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that upon termination by the Dolphins due to Hydron's breach, no prior payments are refundable. The modified text contradicts this by stating that 50% of prior payments are refundable under the same termination scenario. This direct contradiction creates ambiguity regarding the refund policy, leading to disputes.",

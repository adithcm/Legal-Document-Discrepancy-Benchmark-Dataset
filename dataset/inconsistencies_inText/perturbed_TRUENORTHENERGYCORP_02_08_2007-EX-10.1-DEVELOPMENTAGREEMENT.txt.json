                "original_text": "Company shall have forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) from receipt of the notice to elect, by written notice, whether it will participate in accordance with Section 2.3. BP shall not Complete the Initial Well until Company has notified BP in writing whether or not it will participate or until forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) have elapsed since Company's receipt of BP's notice. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in the Completion of the Initial Well.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall have seventy-two (72) hours (inclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) from receipt of the notice to elect, by written notice, whether it will participate in accordance with Section 2.3. BP shall not Complete the Initial Well until Company has notified BP in writing whether or not it will participate or until forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) have elapsed since Company's receipt of BP's notice. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in the Completion of the Initial Well.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by stating two different deadlines for the Company to respond to the completion notice. The first sentence indicates seventy-two hours (inclusive of all days) while the second refers to forty-eight (exclusive of weekends and holidays). This creates ambiguity regarding the actual deadline and could lead to disputes.",

                "changed_text": "Company shall have fifteen (15) days from receipt of such written notice to elect whether it shall participate in such Substitute Well. However, if BP requires a faster decision, Company shall only have 7 days to respond. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in the Substitute Well.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an inconsistency by setting two different deadlines (15 days and 7 days). The clause stating \"if BP requires a faster decision\" is vague and subjective, leaving room for interpretation and dispute over which deadline applies. This creates legal uncertainty as BP can impose the shorter period at its sole discretion.",

The Operating Agreement shall not apply to any Additional Wells. In the event of any conflict between the Operating Agreement and this Agreement, the Operating Agreement shall govern.",
                "explanation": "This introduces multiple contradictions. The effective date of the Operating Agreement is changed, creating conflict about when it comes into force. Additionally, the clause stating the Operating Agreement 'shall apply to all Additional Wells' is removed and negated, as well as the statement about this agreement governing, thus now stating that the Operating Agreement will govern conflicts.",

Attachment C to Master Franchise Agreement MULTI-STATE ADDENDUM CALIFORNIA APPENDIX 1. California Business and Professions Code Sections 20000 through 20043 provide rights to you concerning termination or non-renewal of a franchise. If the Master Franchise Agreement contains provisions that are inconsistent with the law, the law will control. 2. The Master Franchise Agreement provides for termination upon bankruptcy. This provision may not be enforceable under Federal Bankruptcy Law (11 U.S.C.A. Sec. 101 et seq. ). 3. The Master Franchise Agreement contains covenants not to compete which extend beyond the termination of the agreement. These provisions may not be enforceable under California law. 4. Section 31125 of the California Corporation Code requires the franchisor to provide you with a disclosure document before asking you to agree to a material modification of an existing franchise. 5. Neither the franchisor, any person or franchise broker in Item 2 of the Disclosure Document is subject to any currently effective order of any national securities association or national securities exchange, as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.A. 79a et seq., suspending or expelling such persons from membership in such association or exchange. <*$p$*>6. The Master Franchise Agreement requires non-binding mediation. The mediation will occur in New York with the costs being borne by equally by the parties. Prospective franchisees are encouraged to consult private legal counsel to determine the applicability of California and federal laws (such as Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281) to any provisions of a franchise agreement restricting venue to a forum outside the State of California. However, the franchisor may, at its sole discretion, elect to have binding arbitration in California, with all costs borne by the franchisee, if the dispute is regarding a violation of intellectual property rights.<*$p$*> 7. The Master Franchise Agreement requires application of the laws of New York. This provision may not be enforceable under California law. <*$p$*>8. You must sign a general release if you renew or transfer your franchise. California Corporation Code 31512 voids a waiver of your rights under the Franchise Investment Law (California Corporations Code 31000 through 31516). Business and Professions Code 20010 voids a waiver of your rights under the Franchise Relations Act (Business and Professions Code 20000 through 20043). Notwithstanding the above, the signing of a general release shall constitute a full and complete waiver of all claims, known and unknown, that the franchisee may have against the franchisor, including but not limited to claims arising under the Franchise Investment Law or the Franchise Relations Act.<*$p$*> 9. THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE INVESTMENT LAW REQUIRES THAT A COPY OF ALL PROPOSED AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE SALE OF THE FRANCHISE BE DELIVERED TOGETHER WITH THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT. <*$p$*>10. The Master Franchise Agreement contains a liquidated damages clause. Under California Civil Code Section 1671, certain liquidated damages clauses are unenforceable. However, the parties agree that the liquidated damages clause is a reasonable estimate of the actual damages that would be incurred by the franchisor in the event of a breach by the franchisee, and therefore the clause is fully enforceable regardless of California Civil Code Section 1671.<*$p$*> 11.

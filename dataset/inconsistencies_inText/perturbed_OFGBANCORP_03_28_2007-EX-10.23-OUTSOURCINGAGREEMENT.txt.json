Any and all other amounts payable under this Agreement shall be due thirty (30) days following the date of invoice, unless otherwise provided in the Services and Charges Schedule. Undisputed charges not paid by the applicable due date shall be subject to annual interest at the prevailing U.S. prime rate published by Citibank, N.A., from time to time or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. Customer shall also pay any collection fees, court costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, and other fees, costs, and charges incurred by Metavante in collecting payment of the charges and any other amounts for which Customer is liable under the terms and conditions of this Agreement and which shall be due thirty (30) days following the date of invoice. Customer agrees to maintain a depository account with Oriental Bank and Trust for the payment of amounts payable hereunder and hereby authorizes Metavante to initiate debit entries to such account for the payment of amounts payable hereunder. Customer agrees to provide Metavante with any and all information necessary for Metavante to initiate such debit entries via the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment terms. The first sentence indicates that all amounts are due 60 days after the invoice date, while a later sentence states that collection fees, court costs, etc., are due 30 days after the invoice. This creates ambiguity about the actual payment deadlines and uncertainty in enforcement, as one part of the section states 60 days while another states 30 days.",

Except as provided in Section 4.1 C, a party may terminate the Agreement in accordance with the foregoing if such party provides written notice to the defaulting party and either (a) the defaulting party does not cure the Default within sixty (60) days of the defaulting party's receipt of notice of the Default, if the Default is capable of cure within sixty (60) days, or (b) if the Default is not capable of cure within sixty (60) days, the defaulting party does not both (i) implement a plan to cure the Default within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice of the Default, and (ii) diligently carry-out the plan in accordance with its terms. The parties acknowledge and agree that a failure to pay any amount when due hereunder shall be a Default that is capable of being cured within thirty (30) days. Except as provided in the Service Level Schedule, the parties acknowledge and agree that any error in processing data, preparation or filing of a report, form, or file, or the failure to perform Services as required hereunder shall be satisfactorily cured upon the completion of accurate re-processing, the preparation or filing of the accurate report, form, or file, or the re-performance of the Services in accordance with applicable requirements, respectively.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the cure period for a 'Default'. The first sentence states that if a default is capable of cure within sixty (60) days, the defaulting party has sixty (60) days to cure the Default. However, I changed (a) to state that the cure period is thirty (30) days of the defaulting party's receipt of notice of the Default, creating an in-text contradiction. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement, as the overall section states the defaulting party has sixty (60) days while sub-section (a) states 30 days.",

                "explanation": "In Section 10.2, I changed the text in A to change the clause from 'pay any final judgments awarded against Metavante' to 'pay any claims, losses, expenses, and liabilities' whereas Clause B still retains the language 'pay any final judgment awarded against Customer'. This creates a contradiction in the scope of indemnification. Clause A broadly covers various forms of financial burdens arising from claims, while Clause B specifically limits coverage to final judgments, potentially excluding pre-judgment settlements or other related costs.",

                "original_text": "The license granted to the Licensee under this Agreement shall continue perpetually. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall expire if the Investment Advisor or one of its affiliates ceases to serve as investment adviser to the Licensee.",
                "changed_text": "The license granted to the Licensee under this Agreement shall continue perpetually unless terminated as outlined below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall expire if the Investment Advisor or one of its affiliates ceases to serve as investment adviser to the Licensee.",
                "explanation": "This change adds ambiguity to the term'perpetually' in the license grant. While the original states a perpetual license, it also includes a condition for expiry (Investment Advisor ceasing to serve). The modified text further emphasizes the 'perpetual' nature but then introduces a contradictory qualifier which creates uncertainty regarding the actual duration of the license.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be terminable (a) by the Licensor (i) at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that the Licensor or the Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of the Licensee's use of the Licensed Mark or (ii) upon thirty (30) days' written notice by the Licensor to the Licensee or (b) by the Licensee (i) at any time in the event such Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of the Licensee's rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Licensor or (ii) upon sixty (60) days' written notice by the Licensee to the Licensor.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by altering the notice period required for termination by the Licensor from sixty (60) days to thirty (30) days. This conflicting information makes it unclear what the valid termination notice period is, creating uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "For twenty-four (24) months following termination of this Agreement, the Licensee shall specify on all public- facing materials in a prominent place and in prominent typeface that the Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with the Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by the Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",

However, If termination occurs due to a Third Party Claim, this period extends to twenty-four (24) months.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding the duration the Licensee must disassociate themselves from the Licensor post-termination. The initial period is shortened to twelve months but then is extended back to twenty-four months under a certain condition (Third Party Claim). This results in uncertainty regarding the required duration, as it is now conditional and dependent on the reason for termination.",

All representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall survive the Closing of this Agreement, except that any party to whom a representation or warranty has been made in this Agreement shall be deemed to have waived any misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty of which such party had knowledge prior to Closing. Any party learning of a misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty under this Agreement shall immediately give written notice thereof to all other parties to this Agreement. The representations and warranties in this Agreement shall terminate one year from the Closing Date, and such representations or warranties shall thereafter be without force or effect, except any claim with respect to which notice has been given to the party to be charged prior to such expiration date. LEADER hereby agrees to indemnify and hold EZJR, it successors, and assigns harmless from and against any and all damage or deficiency resulting from any material misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant, or nonfulfillment of any agreement on the part of LEADER under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction regarding the survival of representations and warranties. The original text states they terminate one year from the Closing Date, except for notified claims. The added sentence states that intellectual property representations and warranties survive for the full term of the agreement. This creates ambiguity about the effective period for IP-related claims, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding jurisdiction. The original clause specifies exclusive jurisdiction in Nevada State Courts. The added exception implies that claims exceeding $500,000 may be heard elsewhere, creating uncertainty about the proper venue for disputes, and thus introducing a conflict.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a contradiction to the attorneys' fees clause. The initial addition states that neither party can recover attorney's fees. However, the original final sentence of the paragraph states that the prevailing party *will* be entitled to recover them. This creates a direct conflict, making it unclear whether attorney's fees can be recovered.",

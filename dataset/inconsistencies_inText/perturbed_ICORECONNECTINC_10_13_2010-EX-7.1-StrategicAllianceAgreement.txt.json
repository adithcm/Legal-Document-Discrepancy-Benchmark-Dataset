                "original_text": "●All revenue sharing will be reconciled monthly and funds distributed by the 20th of each month by wire transfer for all net collected revenues for the previous month (net of returns and refunds, if any). ●IMedicor will make its records available for audit purposes at any time by USA MCO during regular business hours at the headquarters of iMedicor.",
                "changed_text": "●All revenue sharing will be reconciled monthly and funds distributed by the 20th of each month by wire transfer for all net collected revenues for the previous month (net of returns and refunds, if any). However, for the first quarter of each calendar year, funds will be distributed by the last day of the following month. ●IMedicor will make its records available for audit purposes at any time by USA MCO during regular business hours at the headquarters of iMedicor.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict in payment terms. Originally, all revenue sharing was to be distributed by the 20th of each month. The modified text adds a condition where, for the first quarter, payment is delayed until the end of the following month, causing uncertainty about the actual payment deadline.",

Notification of termination must be provided via certified mail, return receipt requested, no less than 120 days before renewal, but no more than 150 days before the renewal. A new Agreement signed between the USA MCO and IMedicor will then invalidate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by specifying two different notice periods for termination (60/90 days originally, and 120-150 days modified). This creates ambiguity about the exact timing required for valid termination notice, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict in the reimbursement period for legal fees and costs. Originally, it was 60 days for all claims. The modified text introduces a 30-day reimbursement period specifically for intellectual property disputes, creating ambiguity and potential disputes about which timeframe applies.",

                "explanation": "By removing parts (b) and (c) of the original definition, the scope of what constitutes a 'Change of Control' is severely restricted. Later sections referencing 'Change of Control' will now only apply to the sale of assets, potentially excluding other events that should trigger related clauses, creating uncertainty in enforcement and a contradiction in intent.",

                "explanation": "By removing the qualifier 'in a format suitable for digital download and/or streaming', the definition of Exclusive Spoken-Word Audio Products becomes ambiguous.

Later clauses relying on these definitions, such as the scope of the license and infringement clauses, become ambiguous and difficult to enforce consistently. The original definition specified the exact services covered, and the geographic region. This omission makes both uncertain.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause \"in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee's own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee,\" this creates a vaguer license. However, the contract still references compliance regarding Licensed Services and the Territory elsewhere, particularly within Quality Control and Infringement clauses. This contradiction makes determining the scope of appropriate use ambiguous and harder to enforce uniformly.",

The Licensee's obligations are now less flexible. However, other sections on infringement still give the Licensor full control over defense which implicitly relies on the removed language. This creates an inconsistency; the Licensor is obligated to defend the trademark, but cannot specify protective notices to the public, if necessary.",

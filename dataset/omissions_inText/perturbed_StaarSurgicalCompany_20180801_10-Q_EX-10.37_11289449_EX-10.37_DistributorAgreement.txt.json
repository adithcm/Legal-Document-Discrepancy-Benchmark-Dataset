                "original_text": "1.5 The term \"Products\" shall mean those certain products, specified by brand name, manufactured and marketed under the Trademarks by STAAR that are listed on Exhibit A-1 hereto. STAAR may from time to time modify or change the Products on Exhibit A-1 in its sole discretion, and if so, will notify Distributor promptly thereof. In the event that STAAR discontinues a Product, it will provide at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Distributor. Distributor shall not modify, disassemble or reverse engineer any Product, in whole or in part.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 The term \"Products\" shall mean ophthalmic products manufactured and marketed by STAAR. STAAR may change the Products. Distributor shall not modify, disassemble or reverse engineer any Product, in whole or in part.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to 'Exhibit A-1' as the definitive list of products and the requirement to notify the distributor of changes, the contract now lacks a clear definition of what constitutes the 'Products.' While it mentions ophthalmic products manufactured and marketed by STAAR, it is vague. If Section 4.1 discusses pricing which should be based on the list in Exhibit A-1, this omission creates an internal contradiction because the price for 'Products' is undefined.",

The Minimum Purchase Quantities for the Contract Year are as set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto. Within ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of each Contract Year, the parties will discuss in good faith and agree on the Minimum Product Quantities for the successive Contract Year; provided, however, that, if the parties fail to reach agreement on or otherwise specify the Minimum Purchase Quantities for the successive Contract Year, the Minimum Product Quantities for such successive Contract Year shall be __________ percent (___%) of the Minimum Purchase Quantities for the existing Contract Year. \"Contract Year\" means for the first Contract Year of the Agreement, the period commencing on the Effective Date hereof and ending one year thereafter and for subsequent Contract Years, the successive twelve (12) month period thereafter. Failure of Distributor to purchase the Minimum Purchase Quantities for any Contract Year, shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Removing the reference to 'Exhibit B' for Minimum Purchase Quantities and the specific default percentage if no agreement is reached introduces ambiguity. Section 14.2 refers to failing to meet the Annual Minimum Volume as set forth in Section 7.2 which is a false reference. Now, there's no clear method to determine the 'Minimum Product Quantities,' leading to uncertainty in enforcement and a potential contradiction. The removal of 'material' from describing the breach further compounds the uncertainty.",

Specifically, Distributor shall not (a) violate any applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws; or (b) offer, pay or promise to pay, give or promise to give, or authorize the payment or giving of, anything of value to any official representative of any Governmental Entity or authority or any political party or officer thereof or any candidate for office in any jurisdiction (individually and collectively, a \"Government Official\"), (i) for the purpose of (A) influencing any act or decision of such Government Official in his official capacity, (B) inducing such Government Official to do or omit to do any act in violation of his lawful duty, (C) securing any improper advantage, or (iv) inducing such Government Official to influence or affect any act or decision of any Government Entity, or (ii) in order to assist Distributor in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to Distributor or any of its affiliates.

Distributor shall maintain for at least two (2) years and make readily available to STAAR or its duly authorized representatives' books, records and accounts prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that accurately and completely reflect the nature of every transaction related to the sale of the Products.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to complete and sign the Foreign Corrupt Practices Certification (Exhibit C), the enforceability of the anti-corruption clause is weakened. The requirement to adhere to generally accepted accounting principles and the availability of records for STAAR review has also been removed. The statement 'Distributor shall maintain books, records and accounts that accurately and completely reflect the nature of every transaction related to the sale of the Products' does not have the same legal weight, nor the oversight from STAAR. The internal contradiction arises because the Distributor is still held to anti-bribery standards, however Exhibit C, which is supposed to be signed, is no longer required and STAAR does not have access to the Distributor's records to make sure that the Distributor is abiding by the anti-bribery policy.",

                "original_text": "6.2 Royalty Fee.\n\nYou agree to pay us a continuing franchise royalty fee (\"Royalty Fee\") in the amount of seven percent (7%) of the gross revenues of the Franchise for all periods, with a minimum monthly amount of Seven Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($700.00). This fee will be payable on the 1st and 16t h of each month based on the Franchise's gross revenues. If the 1 st or 16t h of the month fall on a weekend or holiday, then the fee is payable on the next business day. If, at the end of any calendar month, the total Royalty Fee collected for the preceding month is less than $700.00, the difference between the amount collected and $700.00 shall be due on the tenth (10th) day of the following month. The terms \"gross revenues\" shall, for purposes of this Agreement, mean the total of all revenue and receipts derived from the operation of the Franchise, including all amounts received at or away from the site of the Franchise, or through the business the Franchise conducts (such as fees for chiropractic care, fees for the sale of any service or product, gift certificate sales, and revenue derived from products sales, whether in cash or by check, credit card, debit card, barter or exchange, or other credit transactions); and excludes only sales taxes collected from customers and paid to the appropriate taxing authority, and all customer refunds and credits the Franchise actually makes. For the avoidance of doubt, you specifically acknowledge that \"gross revenues\" includes the gross revenues of any P.C. or any of P.C.'s clinics that are managed by you pursuant to a Management Agreement, even if those revenues are not recognized on your books, and that you are responsible for determining those revenues and paying the Royalty Fee as if those revenues were recognized on your books. You and we acknowledge and agree that the Royalty Fee represents compensation paid by you to us for the guidance and assistance we provide and for the use of our Marks, Confidential Information (as defined herein), know-how, and other intellectual property we allow you to use under the terms of this Agreement. The Royalty Fee does not represent payment for the referral of customers to you, and you acknowledge and agree that the services we offer to you and our other The Joint Corp. franchisees do not include the referral of customers.",
                "changed_text": "6.2 Royalty Fee.\n\nYou agree to pay us a continuing franchise royalty fee (“Royalty Fee”) in the amount specified in the Operations Manual. This fee will be payable as outlined in the Operations Manual. The terms \"gross revenues\" shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be determined at the discretion of The Joint Corp.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific calculation and payment dates, and indicating royalty payments are controlled by the Operations Manual which may or may not exist, and then defining 'gross revenues' as determined by the Joint Corp, the financial obligations of the franchisee become highly ambiguous. This introduces an internal contradiction by referencing 'gross revenues' for unspecified calculations, but reserving discretion over its calculation to the Joint Corp. This change allows for unpredictable enforcement and dispute.",

If we establish such prices for any services or products, you agree not to exceed or reduce that price, but will charge the price for the service or product that we establish. You hereby agree to apply any pricing matrix or schedule established by us. If you wish to offer an alternate pricing matrix, you must obtain our prior written approval. In states where you must enter a Management Agreement (Section 2.3), this provision shall be modified, to the extent legally permissible, and/or legally construed to conform to the laws of the state where your Franchise location will be located.",
                "changed_text": "10.10 Pricing.\n\nYou agree to maintain prices for your services and products that are competitive within your local market. The Company may make suggestions regarding pricing strategies.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows the franchisor to set prices. The modified clause emphasizes competitive pricing and suggests the franchisor only offers 'suggestions'. If the Operations Manual (or other directive) still insists on fixed prices, this creates a direct contradiction between the agreement and actual operating procedures, leading to enforcement uncertainty and potential legal challenges. The reference to Management Agreements has also been removed.",

Best rating of A-VIII or better approved by us, and in such amounts as we may determine from time to time: (1) comprehensive public, professional, product, medical malpractice and motor vehicle liability insurance against claims for bodily and personal injury, death and property damage caused by or occurring in conjunction with the operation of the Franchise or otherwise in conjunction with your conduct of the Franchise Business pursuant to this Agreement, under one or more policies of insurance containing minimum liability coverage amounts as set forth in the Operations Manual; (2) general casualty insurance, including theft, cash theft, fire and extended coverage, vandalism and malicious mischief insurance, for the replacement value of the Franchise and its contents, and any other assets of the Franchise; (3) worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance as required by law, with limits equal to or in excess of those required by statute; (4) business interruption insurance for a period adequate to reestablish normal business operations, but in any event not less than six (6) months; (5) any other insurance required by applicable law, rule, regulation, ordinance or licensing requirements; and (6) umbrella liability coverage with limits of not less than $1,000,000/$3,000,000 or such other amounts that we may establish in the Operations Manual. You must purchase such insurance coverage(s) only from our approved or designated supplier(s). We may periodically increase or decrease the amounts of coverage required under these insurance policies, and/or require different or additional kinds of insurance, including excess liability insurance, to reflect inflation, identification of new risks, changes in law or standards of liability, higher damage awards, or other relevant changes in circumstances.",
                "changed_text": "10.8 Insurance.\n\nDuring the term of this Agreement, you must maintain insurance as directed by The Joint Corp. You must purchase such insurance coverage(s) only from our approved or designated supplier(s). We may periodically alter insurance requirements.",
                "explanation": "This simplifies the clause but removes specific coverage types and amounts and the A.M. Best rating for insurance carriers. If the Operations Manual or later directives specify insurance policies that are not available or commercially reasonable, it introduces an internal contradiction. The lack of clear definitions opens the door to arbitrary and unreasonable insurance requirements that could bankrupt a franchisee. The section makes it a condition that The Joint Corp can alter Insurance requirements during the agreement period.",

                "explanation": "The amended text removes the definition of 'massive variations in prices' and eliminates the objective criteria for price adjustments. This creates uncertainty, as the term 'reasonable notice' is not defined, potentially leading to disputes over whether EMV was given adequate notice and whether the manufacturer's actions align with the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The amended text removes the reference to section 4.3 where the assessments is detailed and the 180 days timeline. This creates uncertainty, as there are no clear instructions when EMV can terminate the contract.",

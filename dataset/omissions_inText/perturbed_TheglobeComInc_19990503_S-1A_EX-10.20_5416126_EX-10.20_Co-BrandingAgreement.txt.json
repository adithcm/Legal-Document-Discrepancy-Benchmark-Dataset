(b) \"Boxlot Content\" means any content or information (including without limitation any text, music, sound, photographs, video, graphics, data or software), in any medium, provided by Boxlot to theglobe (other than Boxlot Banners), as part of the Service or on the Co-Branded Pages, including any content specified in Exhibit A.

(f) \"Domain Name\" means the domain name described in Exhibit A. (g) \"Launch Date\" means the first date on which the Service is made publicly available. (h) \"Marks\" means the Boxlot Marks or theglobe Marks, as applicable. (i) \"Net Revenues\" means all monetary consideration theglobe actually receives for CPM- or CPC-based advertisements and promotions (other than those for its commerce partners) delivered in connection with the Co-Branded Pages, less a sales and administration fee of 15%.

                "explanation": "The perturbation lies in the extreme generalization of the definitions. While the original definitions provided specific details (e.g., 'Boxlot Banners' meaning any banner, button, text or similar ads'), the modified definitions are vague and lack substance (e.g., 'Boxlot Banners' meaning 'promotional materials provided by Boxlot'). This lack of specificity introduces ambiguity. For example, 'Net Revenues' no longer contains the detailed calculation method (deducting a 15% sales and administration fee), making revenue sharing unclear. 'Service' removes the reference to Exhibit A, where the actual services are described, creating ambiguity regarding the scope of services covered under the agreement. This vagueness contradicts sections that rely on precise definitions, leading to potential disputes and difficulties in enforcement. The original definitions were essential for creating boundaries, especially with financial and deliverables sections.",

Boxlot shall provide Boxlot Content to Users via the Co-Branded Pages, except that Boxlot shall deliver to theglobe those elements of Boxlot Content residing on theglobe's servers in accordance with the terms of Exhibit A. Unless otherwise directed by theglobe, the Co-Branded Pages shall include all of the content displayed on the Boxlot Site, and the Boxlot Content shall be updated to keep the Co-Branded Pages in parity with the Boxlot Site.

Any nonconformance with the content updates shall permit theglobe to terminate immediately if the breach is not cured within 12 hours.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduces ambiguity and potential unenforceability. By replacing 'Boxlot Content' with 'general content,' the type of content Boxlot is required to provide becomes vague. The phrase 'shall deliver to theglobe those elements of Boxlot Content residing on theglobe's servers in accordance with the terms of Exhibit A' is removed, eliminating a specific obligation for Boxlot and referencing 'Exhibit A', where the details would be specified. Later, the removal of  'terms of the frequency/quantity columns of Exhibit A' makes the requirement for content parity with the Boxlot Site unenforceable, as the frequency and quantity are no longer defined. The threat of termination is now based on unclear grounds, leading to an in-text contradiction. Section 8 can discuss this term",

                "explanation": "The changes create a contradiction between the stated intention of delivering User data and the lack of specificity about the method. Originally, there was a clear obligation to deliver 'all information about Users' on a 'weekly' basis in a 'electronic format specified by theglobe using a process reasonably specified by theglobe'. The altered version removes the requirements of ALL, WEEKLY, and specifics process. While the intent remains, the absence of details makes the obligation vague and potentially unenforceable. 'Periodically in a format to be discussed by both parties' implies an ongoing negotiation. Given that theglobe's business model may rely on prompt and comprehensive User data, this uncertainty undermines the agreement's intent.",

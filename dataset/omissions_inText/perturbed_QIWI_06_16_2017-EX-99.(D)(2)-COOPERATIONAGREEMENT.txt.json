                "explanation": "The removal of the clause 'provided that, for the purposes of this Agreement, neither QIWI nor any of its subsidiaries is to be regarded as an Affiliate of Otkritie;' creates a contradiction. Later clauses might rely on this exclusion, and without it, QIWI and its subsidiaries could be considered Affiliates of Otkritie, leading to unforeseen legal and financial implications.",

Each of Otkritie and QIWI Group shall have the exclusive right to remove and replace any of its designees to the Steering Committee at any time by notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specification of required representatives like the CEO, the effectiveness of the Steering Committee is reduced. Later clauses still refer to the 'Committee Member', but now, there is no required position to be part of the committee. This omission contradicts the original intention of having specific high-level representatives present for strategic cooperation.",

                "explanation": "Removing clause (b) 'for the avoidance of doubt, must not be sent by electronic mail;' introduces ambiguity and a potential contradiction. If other sections of the contract implicitly accept electronic communication, the absence of this explicit prohibition opens the door to disputes about acceptable means of communication. The contract refers to notices, but removing the negative constraint generates a lot of potential issues.",

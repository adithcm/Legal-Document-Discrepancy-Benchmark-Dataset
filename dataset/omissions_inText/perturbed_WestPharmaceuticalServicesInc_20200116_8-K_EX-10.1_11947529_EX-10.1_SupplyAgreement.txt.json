                "explanation": "This change omits the specific payment timeframe defined by Attachment E. While the agreement still requires payment via wire transfer, the omission of the 'not later than the days set forth in Attachment E' clause creates uncertainty regarding the acceptable payment period, potentially leading to disputes. This contradicts the purpose of having specific payment terms outlined in Attachment E.",

Seller has the right to review each purchasing specification and needs to accept in writing before such purchasing specifications become effective. Seller has the right to take exceptions to terms and provisions in these purchasing specifications if in contradiction with Seller's Sales specifications, General Terms and Condition of Sales or other Seller's procedures and policies.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the product must meet ExxonMobil's sales specifications and outlines a process for Buyer to create purchasing specifications, subject to Seller's review and acceptance. The modified text removes the explicit reference to ExxonMobil's sales specifications, replacing it with a vague statement about 'general industry standards.' This omission creates an inconsistency because the rest of the contract implicitly assumes adherence to Seller's specific standards; by removing it enforcement becomes uncertain since there's no defined metric.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that payment should be made via EFT using the ACH through CTX format which further directs to Attachment E for more information on payment terms. By removing the requirement for the CTX format as well as the the description of payment terms in Attachment E, the modified text creates ambiguity as the rest of the contract refers to the attachment while there's nothing there creating uncertain enforcement.",

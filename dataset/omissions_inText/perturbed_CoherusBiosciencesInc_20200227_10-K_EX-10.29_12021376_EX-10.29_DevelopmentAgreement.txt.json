                "explanation": "The original definition provides a detailed, objective standard for 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts'. The modified definition replaces this with a subjective standard based on a Party's internal business strategy. This creates a contradiction because several clauses rely on the original objective definition to define obligations. Now it is up for interpretation, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original definition refers to 'Schedule 1.38' which lists the Licensed Patents. By removing the sentence referencing the schedule, but still maintaining references to 'Licensed Patents' throughout the agreement, it creates ambiguity.

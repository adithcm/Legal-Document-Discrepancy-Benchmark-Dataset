                "original_text": "12. \"Purchase Order\" means any of the following (a) a written purchase order issued to the Company by third party buyers for the purchase of certain Products; (b) a written purchase order issued by the Company to a Supplier for a quantity of the Product.",
                "changed_text": "12. \"Purchase Order\" means a request made by the Company to its Suppliers.",
                "explanation": "The change to the definition of 'Purchase Order' creates uncertainty. The original definition specifically mentions both purchase orders from third-party buyers and those issued to suppliers, clarifying the scope of the agreement. The modified definition only refers to 'requests made by the Company to its Suppliers'. This raises questions about whether Purchase Orders from third parties are still covered by the agreement, potentially impacting the exclusivity of the outsourcing arrangement.",

Payments for Products delivered in accordance with the Purchase Orders, and any other to be made by the Company to Suppliers hereunder, shall be made in the Applicable Currency within [***]from the shipment of the applicable Products delivered.",

Payments for Products delivered in accordance with the Purchase Orders, and any other to be made by the Company to Suppliers hereunder, shall be made in the Applicable Currency.",
                "explanation": "By removing the payment timeframe (within [***]), the modified text introduces ambiguity. While the obligation to make payments remains, the absence of a specified timeframe makes it difficult to enforce timely payments, potentially leading to disputes and impacting the suppliers' cash flow. This also creates a contradiction if other sections of the agreement assume a payment timeframe exists.",

                "explanation": "The abbreviated definition of 'Intellectual Property Rights' excludes key components such as foreign patents, trade secrets, and mask work rights. This poses an in-text contradiction if Article 8 Indemnification still references the broader scope of IPR protection, which now lacks corresponding definition. It also creates uncertainty in determining liability should a dispute arise involving omitted forms of Intellectual Property. Essentially, the contract now states IP rights are limited while also claiming to protect a wider range of IP, an internal contradiction.",

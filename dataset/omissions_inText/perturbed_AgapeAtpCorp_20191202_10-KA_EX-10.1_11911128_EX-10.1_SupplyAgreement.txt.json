SHIPPING AND PAYMENT TERMS 5.1 Shipping Products delivered pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be suitably packed for shipment in the Manufacturer's standard shipping cartons, marked for shipment to the destination specified in the Customer's Purchase Order, and delivered to the destination Ex Works. The Customer agrees to pay freight, insurance and any associated expenses. The Customer agrees to help the Manufacturer select the most appropriate carrier for each of the Territories.

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence 'The Customer agrees to pay freight, insurance and any associated expenses. All freight, insurance, and other shipping expenses shall be paid by the Customer.' creates ambiguity about who is responsible for the shipping costs. Later clauses might assume the customer pays without explicitly stating it, creating an internal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement to request destruction or an RMA number after notifying the Manufacturer of defective products introduces ambiguity. The clause that requires the manufacturer to credit shipping costs associated with the defective product implies that a return or destruction request had to be made, but the explicit steps were removed. This contradiction makes enforcement difficult.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of \"BCF\" (Broadcast Cash Flow) is detailed and refers to specific calculations and exhibits. By replacing this with a very basic definition, it creates ambiguity. Section 2(a) and other sections still refer to the original calculation method, resulting in a contradiction since the contract now defines \"BCF\" differently. This makes enforcement uncertain because the precise financial metric to determine payments is now undefined.",

                "original_text": "f. Insurance. WYZZ shall maintain replacement cost casualty and liability insurance and property insurance on all of its assets and properties used and useful in the operation of WYZZ-TV, general liability insurance and workers compensation insurance in such amounts and on such terms and conditions that are ordinary and customary in the broadcast industry and that are reasonably acceptable to Nexstar.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the specifics regarding 'replacement cost', 'general liability', 'workers compensation' and 'ordinary and customary amounts acceptable to Nexstar', the clause becomes vague. While WYZZ is still obligated to maintain insurance, the lack of detail introduces ambiguity. Section 25, which discusses indemnification and liabilities, references insurance coverage, but the modified clause fails to define the extent of that coverage, potentially affecting risk allocation and dispute resolution.",

All severance liabilities and all COBRA liabilities for any Terminated Employee terminated on or after the Effective Date shall be prorated between the Parties, in accordance with Section 4 hereof and Exhibit D hereto.",
                "changed_text": "All severance liabilities and all COBRA liabilities for any terminated employee shall be determined by the parties.",
                "explanation": "By deleting the reference to exhibit I, section 4 and Exhibit D, and making all employee termination determination between the parties, it means that the calculation is now ambiguous. This impacts section 4 which discusses the expenses and capital expenditure, because it does not explicitly state what the liabilities will be for each party. ",

                "explanation": "By removing 'the Company shall have all the liabilities of the project in relation to finance and operation with HGF having no liability in relation to the project', uncertainty is introduced as Article 22.1 (Indemnification) mentions 'each parties' activities'. Without clear liability assignment for the Joint Venture, responsibility for indemnification becomes ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific percentage (30%) and replacing it with a vague 'percentage of Company income, as determined by NVOS', the obligation becomes less defined. Article 12 discusses dividend distribution based on a 70/30 split. The change contradicts the explicitly stated split, creating uncertainty around HGF's actual financial return.",

                "changed_text": "10.6 To provide acreage for the Primary Project, as identified in subsequent communications.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific acreage (7000 acres) and the reference to SCHEDULE A creates a contradiction because SCHEDULE A is mentioned as being crucial for acreage identification. The new statement means the land amount is not determined in the text and up to new terms. This introduces potential disputes over the extent of HGF's commitment and the allocation of resources.",

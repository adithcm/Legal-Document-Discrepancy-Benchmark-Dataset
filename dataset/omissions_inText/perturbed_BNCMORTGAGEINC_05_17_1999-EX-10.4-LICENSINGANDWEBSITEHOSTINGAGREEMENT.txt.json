                "explanation": "The original definition provided a very specific description of Credit Data, including its source and limitations on its use. By replacing this with a vague reference to 'prevailing industry standards,' we create uncertainty. 'Prevailing industry standards' is undefined and could be interpreted differently by each party. This contradicts section 8(d) that references specific limitations on use of 'Credit Data' as originally defined. The original specific definition of Credit Data limited TrueLink's rights granted in 8(d), with a new definition that is very wide that limitation is not clear anymore",

Client will pay TrueLink's fees for requested Hosting Services and Support Services pursuant to the schedule of charges set forth on Exhibits \"A\" and \"B\" attached hereto, (but not less than $____ per month for the Hosting Services and $____ per month for Support Services). For any other services agreed to between the parties, Client will pay TrueLink fees which will be determined by the parties and will vary depending on the services utilized. TrueLink will provide Client with an invoice for the requested Hosting Services and Support Services and any other agreed-upon services on a monthly basis.

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Exhibits A and B and the minimum monthly fees, the contract no longer explicitly defines the costs for Hosting and Support Services.

This creates uncertainty in the enforcement of payment terms, as the actual amount owed is now ambiguous.",

If Client decides to discontinue its Hosting Service, Client is responsible for arranging for a new name server within 30 days.

By removing these conditions, the modified text implies that the Agreement can *only* be terminated at the end of each 1-year term by providing 30 days' notice, thus contradicting the earlier provision. This omission introduces uncertainty regarding the circumstances under which TrueLink can terminate sections 2 and 3 of the agreement early, creating potential disputes.",

                "original_text": "B. Celebrity will serve as a member of the Clotamin/HDS Board of Advisors, whose members' sole responsibility  is to be listed as a Clotamin brand ambassador on the Website and/or Clotamin related press releases. With  respect to the Board of Advisors, Celebrity will not be responsible for any additional services such as  attending meetings, corporate functions, etc.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause that specifies the Board of Advisors' sole responsibility is being a 'Clotamin brand ambassador on the Website and/or Clotamin related press releases', the contract now lacks a clear definition of the Celebrity's duties as a board member. This creates ambiguity and makes enforcement difficult, as it is unclear what the Celebrity is actually expected to do.",

                "changed_text": "A. In-kind Payment: HDS will provide Celebrity with a one (1) year complimentary supply of Clotamin product during the Term.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clarification '(i.e., at least 365 caplets)', the exact quantity of the 'complimentary supply' becomes undefined. This creates a potential contradiction if HDS provides a supply significantly less than what would reasonably be understood as a 'one-year supply,' leading to disputes about fulfillment of consideration.",

Such termination shall relieve HDS of its obligation to provide any further consideration  pursuant to this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'Such termination shall relieve HDS of its obligation to provide any further consideration pursuant to this Agreement', this suggests that HDS might still need to fulfil payment, even if Celebrity doesn't perform duties or breaches the contract. This introduces a contradiction because without the clause, it is vague whether the company still needs to pay Celebrity when they fail their required duties.",

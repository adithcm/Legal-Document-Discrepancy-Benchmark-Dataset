The modified version removes this condition and introduces a 'separate agreement,' creating ambiguity. If other sections still refer to the annual fee, this constitutes an in-text contradiction.",

The modified version removes the specifics and makes stock options discretionary, determined by the Board. This contradicts any other section that assumes the original stock option plan remains in effect based on sales volume and annual dues payment. Additionally, by eliminating the precise stock option grants, there is a missing clause that would create uncertainties.",

For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may not recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific royalty rate (*****%), the modified text creates ambiguity regarding the actual royalty amount. While the text still refers to a royalty, the absence of a defined percentage makes the clause unenforceable and contradicts the initial intention of specifying payment terms. Other parts of the agreement references the \"IA2 Audio and Video Royalty\" which is no longer specifically defined.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'Paragraphs 7(b)(ii) and 7(b)(iii) of the Agreement', the modification creates a contradiction. The original text explicitly directs how VGSL and CSP payments should be handled according to specific paragraphs in the Agreement. Now, it says that these shall be treated in a fair manner, which opens to an interpretation and creates uncertainty in enforcement as the method of dealing with those payments is no longer clearly defined.",

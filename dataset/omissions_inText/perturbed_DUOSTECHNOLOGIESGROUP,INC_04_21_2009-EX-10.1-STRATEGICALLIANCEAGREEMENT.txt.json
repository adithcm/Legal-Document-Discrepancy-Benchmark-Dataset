                "original_text": "1.3 Day Rate shall mean the daily rate at which Rubicon will provide services to ISA or ISA Clients. The Day Rate for each type of service  provided will be as per the rate card set out in Exhibit C, such rates to be subject to annual review by the Parties on the anniversary of this  Agreement provided that such rates may be reviewed on an ad hoc basis at any time should the Parties become aware of specific information  which impacts on the validity or feasibility of the Day Rate.",
                "changed_text": "1.3 Day Rate shall mean the daily rate at which Rubicon will provide services to ISA or ISA Clients. The Day Rate for each type of service  provided will be determined by mutual agreement, such rates to be subject to annual review by the Parties on the anniversary of this  Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'Exhibit C' and the ad hoc review clause, the 'Day Rate' definition becomes vague. Section 4.1 mentions using the 'Day Rate', creating uncertainty on how the Commission Rate is derived, since the original anchor for calculation has been omitted. The new definition is too open and subject to later disagreements.",

In consideration of the services set forth in Section 2, ISA will sell or market the Rubicon Offerings at pre agreed list prices,  and shall receive a commission on the gross revenues paid for the Rubicon Offerings less VAT if applicable of the Commission Rate; provided,  however, that in the event that Rubicon proposes to charge at other than the Day Rate for the software development the Parties shall use all  reasonable endeavours to agree an equitable adjustment to the Commission Rate.",
                "changed_text": "4.1 ISA Fees. In consideration of the services set forth in Section 2, ISA will sell or market the Rubicon Offerings at prices deemed appropriate by ISA,  and shall receive a commission on the gross revenues paid for the Rubicon Offerings less VAT if applicable of the Commission Rate; ",
                "explanation": "Removing 'at pre agreed list prices' gives ISA full freedom to set prices which affects revenues; this contradicts the fact that Rubicon receives profits from projects (4.2.3), and it impacts 1.4 where the Commission Rate is subject to annual review depending on external factors. Removing also the 'Day Rate' provision creates uncertainty since 'Day Rate' definition has been perturbed previously and the Commission Rate now becomes ambiguous. These changes affect payment structure and creates a contradiction.",

                "explanation": "By removing the original clause of the Intellectual Property Infringement, Section 5 about Intellectual Property is now contradicted, as Rubicon is not liable to indemnify ISA for intellectual property infringements. Section 5.3 indicates that Rubicon owns its Intellectual Property, and now its actions that relate to it cannot be challenged with an indemnification in this section. This introduces a contradiction, causing ambiguity in liability for intellectual property-related losses.",

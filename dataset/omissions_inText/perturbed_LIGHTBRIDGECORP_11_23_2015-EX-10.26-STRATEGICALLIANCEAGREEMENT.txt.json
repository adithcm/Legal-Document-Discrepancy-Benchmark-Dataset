                "original_text": "\"Confidential Information\" shall mean, as to any Party as a Recipient, (a) all non-public written,  graphic, oral, electromagnetic or other information (including technical, financial and business information regarding models, market studies, business plans. clients' names, reports, plans. projections, data or any other  information) relating to the business, strategy, prospects or plans of the other  Party or any of the other Party's Affiliates and (b) any reproductions, copies,  notes, analyses, work papers. compilations, studies, interpretations or any  other document or information derived from any of the foregoing.",
                "changed_text": "\"Confidential Information\" shall mean information designated as such by either party. The procedure for designating information as confidential will be outlined in Schedule A.",
                "explanation": "By changing the definition of \"Confidential Information\" and referencing a non-existent \"Schedule A,\" the contract introduces an inconsistency. Section 4.1 still refers to 'Confidential Information' as previously defined, but the primary definition has been altered, and the 'Schedule A' is never provided. Thus, the mechanism for defining what 'Confidential Information' actually *is* is now missing, leading to uncertainty in enforcement of Article IV.",

With respect to any Project, regardless of which Party identified such Project, the Parties agree that Lloyds shall act as prime contractor on any Project and that Lightbridge shall have a right of first refusal to participate in such Project as a sub- contractor to Lloyds, and shall be entitled to perform such work which would generate up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the total fees payable to Lloyds as general contractor under the Project.",
                "changed_text": "Section 2.2 Relationship of Parties. With respect to any Project, regardless of which Party identified such Project, the Parties agree that Lloyds shall act as prime contractor on any Project. The terms of Lightbridge's participation will be governed by a separate agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives Lightbridge a 'right of first refusal' and specifies the percentage of fees they are entitled to. The modified text removes these specifics, stating that participation will be governed by a 'separate agreement.' However, if no such separate agreement exists, and other clauses still reference Lightbridge's role on a project, it creates an ambiguity. The contradiction lies in the fact that Lightbridge is still mentioned as a potential participant, but the defining details of that participation have been excised and deferred to a missing agreement.",

                "original_text": "Section 5.2 Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, the non-Defaulting Party may immediately terminate this Agreement by giving notice  to the Defaulting Party. The non-Defaulting Party's remedy set forth in the  immediately preceding sentence is not intended to be exclusive and is in addition to, and may be exercised concurrently with, any other right or remedy that may otherwise be available to the Non-Defaulting Party at law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, the Non-Defaulting Party may recover damages against the Defaulting Party even if this Agreement is terminated (including damages arising out of such termination).",
                "changed_text": "Section 5.2 Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, the non-Defaulting Party may pursue remedies as outlined in Schedule B. The non-Defaulting Party may recover damages against the Defaulting Party even if this Agreement is terminated (including damages arising out of such termination).",
                "explanation": "This change removes the specific remedy of immediate termination upon an Event of Default and replaces it with a reference to a non-existent 'Schedule B.' While the right to recover damages is retained, the critical power to immediately terminate is now tied to an undefined schedule. This creates an inconsistency, as the contract implies a defined set of remedies exists (in Schedule B), but that schedule is missing, leaving the actual remedies unclear.",

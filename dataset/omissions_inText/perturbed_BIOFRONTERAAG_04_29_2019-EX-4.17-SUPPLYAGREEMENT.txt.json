                "original_text": "1.9 Specifications \"Specifications\" means, with respect to the Products, the critical quality standards that include test attributes, analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria and Manufacturing procedures for which such Product should conform to be considered acceptable for its intended use and conform to quality standards approved by Governmental and Regulatory Authorities and as provided in the NDA for the Products, and required for the Manufacture and supply of such Product(s).",
                "changed_text": "1.9 Specifications \"Specifications\" means, with respect to the Products, general guidelines and manufacturing procedures.",
                "explanation": "By removing the detailed definition of 'Specifications,' including specific testing, analytical procedures, and regulatory approval requirements, and replacing it with a vague reference to 'general guidelines and manufacturing procedures,' this change introduces ambiguity. Later sections referencing 'Specifications' for product acceptance and quality control become unenforceable because the precise requirements are undefined.",

                "explanation": "The clause \"to determine whether or not said Products meet the Specifications\" is removed. This contradicts the earlier change to the definition of 'Specifications.' Even though products are still subject to inspection, the basis for the acceptance or rejection of products is no longer clearly defined. This undermines the purpose of the 'acceptance/rejection' section.",

                "explanation": "By replacing \"in accordance with the Specifications for the release of the Product\" with \"will be of reasonable quality\", it weakens the obligation on the supplier. Because the detailed definition of specifications was removed earlier, this warranty is no longer based on objective criteria, making it difficult to enforce. The term 'reasonable quality' is open to interpretation and may not align with regulatory requirements or CUTANEA's expectations.",

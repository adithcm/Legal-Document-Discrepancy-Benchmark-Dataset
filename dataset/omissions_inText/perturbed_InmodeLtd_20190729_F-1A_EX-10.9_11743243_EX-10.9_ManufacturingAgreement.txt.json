Contractor shall apply for and receive the ISO13488 standard for the production facility, by no later than . During the term of this Agreement, the manufacturing services provided by the Contractor hereto shall confirm in all material respects with the ISOl3488 standard.",

                "explanation": "By removing the obligation to obtain ISO13488 standard, the agreement becomes vague and unenforceable. Later sections referring to ISO13488 compliance (e.g., Section 9.2 Quality) now lack a concrete foundation, creating a contradiction between the stated goal of compliance and the absence of a requirement to achieve the standard.",

Contractor shall maintain in inventory certain quantities of LLI. \"LLI\" shall mean Long Lead Item materials required in order to complete manufacture and supply of Products. For the avoidance of doubt Customer shall have no additional liability with respect to the holding of LLI other than the liability provided herein below. The usage of LLI by Contractor for the manufacture of Items shall be by a written order by Customer in accordance with this Agreement, stipulating the quantity Customer wishes Contractor to use. If Contractor holds LLIs based on any written requirement for more than three (3) months, Customer shall be required to purchase such LLIs at their direct costs plus a handling fee of 2% of Product price. The purchase terms of such LLI's, set forth in Section 8.2 hereof.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of \"LLI\" (Long Lead Items) and all mentions of direct costs and handling fee, while retaining the obligation for the customer to purchase, the section becomes ambiguous and contradicts the intent. Section 8.2 refers to the Purchase Orders, but there is no clear definition of the condition of \"LLI\", creating internal conflicts.",

                "original_text": "10. Express Limited Warranty For the purpose of this Agreement, \"Warranty Period\" shall mean twelve (12) months as of the date of delivery to Customer. Contractor represents and warrants that, for the Warranty Period, the Products (i) will be free from defects in workmanship, material (only to the same extent as the original manufacturer of the material warrants the Contractor), and manufacture; (ii) will comply the Specifications IPC610.B standard (in all material respects and unless otherwise was instructed by Customer). Contractor further represents and warrants that the Product will consist of new materials. The warranty provided in this Section shall not apply to (1) Customer's materials, tooling and equipment (2) Products modified by Customer or any third party without Contractor's prior written consent, (2) Products installed or operated by Customer or any third party in a manner inconsistent with the Specifications or the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or (3) Products damaged, abused, altered or misused by Customer or any third party, or as the result of fire, casualty, or other external cause (4) defects resulting directly or indirectly, wholly or partially, from Customer's Specifications or the design of the Products, (5) First articles, prototypes, pre-production units, test units or other similar Products. Upon any failure of a Product to comply with the above warranty, Contractor's sole obligation, and Customer's sole remedy, is for Contractor, at its option, to promptly repair or replace such Product and return it to Customer freight prepaid. Customer shall return Products covered by the warranty freight prepaid after completing a failure report and obtaining a return material authorization number from Contractor to be displayed on the shipping container. Customer shall bear all risks, costs and expenses, associated with Products that have been returned to Contractor for which there is no defect found and/or with Products not covered under the warranty above.",

                "explanation": "By removing key details about the warranty period and specific standards like IPC610.B, the warranty becomes vague. The phrase \"promptly address the issue\" replaces specific obligations like repair or replacement, and removes the prepaid freight condition, creating uncertainty and contradicting the detailed nature of other warranty clauses. This creates inconsistency regarding cost allocation and defect identification.",

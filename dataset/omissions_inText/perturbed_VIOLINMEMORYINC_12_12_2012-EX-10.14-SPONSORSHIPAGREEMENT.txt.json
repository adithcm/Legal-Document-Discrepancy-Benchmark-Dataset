                "explanation": "By narrowing the definition of 'Product and Services Category' to exclude 'video surveillance products', this alteration may cause contradiction if other sections of the agreement still grant rights related to video surveillance, creating uncertainty in enforcement. For instance, if Schedule 1 outlines sponsorship rights that cover both flash data storage and video surveillance, this limited definition creates an inconsistency.",

Any payment required to be made by Sponsor hereunder that is not paid within fourteen (14) days from the date such payment becomes due and owing shall bear interest at an annual rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum or, if lower, the maximum allowed by law from the due date to the date payment is actually made. The right of Forty Niners SC to receive interest under this Section 5(f) shall be in addition to all other rights it may have as a result of Sponsor's failure to make payments when due.",

The right of Forty Niners SC to receive interest under this Section 5(f) shall be in addition to all other rights it may have as a result of Sponsor's failure to make payments when due.",
                "explanation": "The clause detailing the specific interest rate for late payments has been removed. While the obligation to pay interest on late payments is retained, the specific amount is no longer defined, leading to uncertainty in how this provision would be enforced. This introduces a contradiction, as the contract acknowledges interest is due, but omits how that interest is to be calculated.",

Sponsor shall receive *** thirty-second (:30) advertisements on the Stadium 360-degree LED ribbon in Stadium at each Forty Niners home game in the Stadium. Sponsor shall also receive (i) advertising in a mutually-determined number of thirty-second (:30) units and (ii) one (1) mutually-determined co-branded feature, played on a minimum of *** high-definition monitors located in the Stadium at each Forty Niners home game.",

                "explanation": "The specific number of thirty-second advertisements and the quantity of high-definition monitors is omitted. Leaving only a general agreement that they will receive the said benefits with out concrete numbers. If the other clauses of the agreement specify that the sponsor shall receive specific quantities for each of these, then those sections will be contradictory. For example, if Section 3 outlines quantities, this omission will cause uncertainty.",

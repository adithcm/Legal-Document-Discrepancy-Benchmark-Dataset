The undersigned agrees that he          ----------------------------------                                  will not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of his interests in, or reduce his risk relative to, any of the shares of PSS Common Stock into which his shares of GSMS Common Stock are converted upon consummation of the Merger until such time as PSS notifies the undersigned that the requirements of SEC Accounting Series Release Nos. 130 and 135 (\"ASR 130 and 135\") have been met. The undersigned understands that ASR 130 and 135 relate to publication of financial results of post-Merger combined operations of PSS and GSMS. PSS agrees that it will publish such results as promptly as practicable following the Merger in the sole discretion of PSS, but in any event within 45 days after the end of the first fiscal quarter of PSS containing the required period of post-Merger combined operations and that it will notify the undersigned promptly following such publication.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to SEC Accounting Series Release Nos. 130 and 135 (ASR 130 and 135), the specific criteria for lifting the initial restriction are removed. This creates ambiguity because while a restriction still exists, the metric of knowing when it lifts are gone.",

In    addition, the shares represented by this certificate may not be sold,    transferred or otherwise disposed of except or unless (1) covered by an    effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as    amended, (2) in accordance with (i) Rule 145(d) (in the case of shares issued    to an individual who is not an affiliate of PSS) or (ii) Rule 144 (in the                            ---\ncase of shares issued to an individual who is an affiliate of PSS) of the    Rules and Regulations of such Act, or (3) in accordance with a legal opinion    satisfactory to counsel for PSS that such sale or transfer is otherwise    exempt from the registration requirements of such Act.\"",

                "explanation": "By omitting the specific conditions under which the shares can be sold, transferred, or disposed of, the contract becomes vague. This contradicts the purpose of the restrictions, which were initially defined to ensure compliance with securities laws. The new statement means that any sale would need a separate agreement, which is not stated anywhere.",

The filing has a missing term which creates uncertainty if an audit happened since the original clause ensures the affiliate has access to necessary public information for potential stock transfers under SEC rules. With the removal of the end date, there is an issue with how long this lasts, the term for the filing is missing.",

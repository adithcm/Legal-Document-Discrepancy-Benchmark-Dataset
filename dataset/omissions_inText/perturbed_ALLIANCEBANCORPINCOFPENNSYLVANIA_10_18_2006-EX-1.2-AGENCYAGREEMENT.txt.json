                "original_text": "If at least the total minimum of Securities, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus, are sold, the Company agrees to issue or have issued the Securities sold and to release for delivery certificates for such Securities at the Closing Time against payment therefor by release of funds from the special interest-bearing accounts referred to above. The closing shall be held at the offices of Elias, Matz, Tiernan & Herrick L.L.P., at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, or at such other place and time as shall be agreed upon by the parties hereto, on a business day to be agreed upon by the parties hereto. The Company shall notify the Agent by telephone, confirmed in writing, when funds shall have been received for all the Securities. Certificates for Securities shall be delivered directly to the purchasers thereof in accordance with their directions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certificates for Securities purchased through Selected Dealers shall be made available to the Agent for inspection at least 48 hours prior to the Closing Time at such office as the Agent shall designate. The hour and date upon which the Company shall release for delivery all of the Securities, in accordance with the terms hereof, is herein called the \"Closing Time.\"",

The Company shall notify the Agent by telephone, confirmed in writing, when funds shall have been received for all the Securities.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, certificates for Securities purchased through Selected Dealers shall be made available to the Agent for inspection prior to release.

                "explanation": "By removing the clause specifying the Closing Time, the modified text introduces uncertainty regarding when and where the closing will occur. Other sections still refer to 'Closing Time' which creates an internal contradiction since there's no specific definition of Closing Time.",

(\"NASD\") member firm (other than Sandler O'Neill) in the Syndicated Community Offering, (i) the compensation payable to Selected Dealers, (ii) any sponsoring dealer's fees; and (iii) a management fee to Sandler O'Neill of one percent (1.0 %) of the aggregate purchase price of the Securities sold in the Syndicated Community Offering. Any fees payable to Sandler O'Neill for Securities sold by Sandler O'Neill under any such agreement shall be limited to an aggregate of six percent (6.0 %) of the purchase price of the Securities sold by Sandler O'Neill and other NASD member firms.",

The amount and manner of compensation will be determined at a later date, subject to mutual agreement between the Company and the Agent.",
                "explanation": "The altered Section 2 omits specific details about the agent's compensation, such as the percentage of the purchase price and fees related to the different offerings. Although the section mentions that the Agent will receive compensation, it does not specify how this compensation is calculated. This omission can lead to uncertainty in enforcement, particularly if disputes arise over the amount or method of payment later on.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the precise percentage and specific exclusion criteria for share purchases, the modified Section 2 introduces vagueness. The terms 'certain tax liabilities' and 'percentage' lack specificity, which could create discrepancies during enforcement, particularly concerning which taxes are covered and the accurate commission rate.",

                "changed_text": "1.22 \"Royalty\" means a potential payment on Net Sales.",
                "explanation": "By removing the direct reference to Article Three, the definition of 'Royalty' becomes vague. Later mentions of specific royalty rates in Article Three now lack a solid definitional anchor, potentially leading to disputes regarding the calculation and payment of royalties. This creates uncertainty in enforcement since the method is not directly defined.",

ArTara will, no later than […***…] following the close of each calendar quarter, pay tiered Royalties based on annual Net Sales of Product in the Indication as set forth below:\n\nAnnual Net Sales of Product for the Indication Annual Royalty Rate Percent Net Sales\n\n$0 - $25,000,000 1.75%\n\n>$25,000,000 - $50,000,000 2.25%\n\n>$50,000,000 2.50%",
                "changed_text": "3.3 Royalties. If and when royalties are applicable, the percentages are at the sole discretion of ArTara.",
                "explanation": "By replacing the fixed royalty rates with discretionary amounts at the sole discretion of ArTara, this modification creates a contradiction with the initial definition of 'Royalty' (as potentially in the Net Sales) as well as rendering the intent of royalty provision unenforceable. This is because the specific royalty structure, that was previously defined, is now subject to ArTara's discretion, leading to uncertainty. This also directly contradicts 1.22 in terms of what is laid out. The milestone is still referenced, but the calculation of the royalty can be modified.",

                "explanation": "By changing this to require mutual agreement, creates an inconsistency. Originally the royalty reduction was triggered by Regulatory Authority determination and was set in stone. Now, it is subject to a mutual agreement, which could be prevented by either party. Creates conflict in section 3, and uncertainty for article three.",

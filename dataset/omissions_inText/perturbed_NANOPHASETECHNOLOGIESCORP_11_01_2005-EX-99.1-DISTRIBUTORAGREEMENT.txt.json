                "explanation": "The original text provides specific quantity limits for research and commercial quantities, creating a clear distinction. The modified text removes these limits and gives ALFA AESAR the discretion to define \"Research Quantities,\" creating uncertainty. Later sections that refer to specific quantities for pricing or referral commissions are now ambiguous.",

Subject to the protocol described below, ALFA AESAR shall have the right to return at NTC's expense, and for full credit of ALFA AESAR's cost, any Products (i.) for which a legitimate and credible allegation is made that the use of such Products infringes on any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of privacy or publicity, or any other tangible or 3 intangible proprietary or intellectual property right; (b) that are not manufactured, packaged, or labeled in accordance with specifications or industry standards; (c) that are shipped in error or in non-conformance with ALFA AESAR's purchase order; or (d) that are damaged or defective. In the event that ALFA AESAR believes that it is entitled to return any Products delivered under this Agreement, the parties will adhere to the following protocol: (w) ALFA AESAR will contact NTC's Quality Director and then forward to the Quality Director, via a carrier selected by and at NTC's expense, a sample of the Product that ALFA AESAR believes is non-conforming; (x) upon receipt of the sample, NTC will test it and then notify ALFA AESAR of the test results; (y) where the test results confirm that the sample is non-conforming, NTC will provide ALFA AESAR with NTC's Return Authorization Number (\"RAN\"); and (z) any returned non-conforming Product must be in its original container, with original labels in act, and all paperwork concerning the returned Product must include NTC's RAN.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies clear conditions and a detailed protocol for product returns. By replacing it with a vague reference to 'NTC's return policy' (which is not included in the document), the contract becomes internally inconsistent. Later clauses referencing the detailed return protocol (e.g., Section 9.2) are now impossible to enforce, as that protocol no longer exists within the document.",

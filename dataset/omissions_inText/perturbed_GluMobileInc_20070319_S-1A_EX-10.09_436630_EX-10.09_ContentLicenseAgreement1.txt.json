                "explanation": "By removing the parenthetical definition of 'Deductions' (monies retained by CSPs), this clause now contradicts later sections that reference 'Deductions' in the royalty calculation.

The Right of First Negotiation shall be exercised as follows. Whenever Fox desires to grant to any third party any licensing rights for a Major Release (each such instance, an \"Opportunity\"), Fox shall request that Licensee submit a bid regarding the Opportunity. If Licensee intends to exercise its Right of First Negotiation, it must submit a bid in response to Fox's request within 10 business days. If Licensee does submit a bid, both parties shall negotiate in good faith over the bid for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 10 additional business days. If the parties have not reached agreement in writing regarding the terms and conditions for the exploitation of the Opportunity within said time period, or if Licensee fails to submit a bid in a timely manner, Fox shall be free to accept any bid from any other party with respect to the Opportunity, or Fox shall be free not to exploit the Opportunity at all. Should Licensee choose to exercise its Right of First Negotiation, its floor bid shall be at least US$***** for each Major Release (as defined in Exhibit N).",

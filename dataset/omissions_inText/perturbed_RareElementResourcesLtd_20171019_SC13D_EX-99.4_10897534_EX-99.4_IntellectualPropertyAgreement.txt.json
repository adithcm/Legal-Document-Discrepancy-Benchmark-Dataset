                "changed_text": "2.10 \"Improvement\" or \"Improvements\" means any enhancement.",
                "explanation": "By broadly defining 'Improvement' as 'any enhancement,' we remove the crucial link to Patents and Technical Information. This creates uncertainty when Article V refers to Company Improvements, Investor Improvements, and Joint Improvements, as it's no longer explicitly tied to the core intellectual property, impacting ownership and licensing.",

The non- exclusive rights granted to Investor under this Article 3.02 do not include the right to grant sublicenses to Third Parties. The amount and parameters of the annual licensing fee shall be commercially reasonable, as determined by an independent expert who is mutually agreeable to the Parties and whose determination shall be final and binding; provided, however, that if the Parties cannot agree on the independent expert, each Party shall designate an expert of their choice and the two experts designated by the Parties shall work together in good faith to identify and designate a third, independent expert whose determination shall be binding.",

The non- exclusive rights granted to Investor under this Article 3.02 do not include the right to grant sublicenses to Third Parties.",
                "explanation": "By removing the mechanism for determining the annual licensing fee after the Option Period, this creates ambiguity. While a fee is mentioned, there is no process described for establishing what is 'commercially reasonable'. This creates uncertainty for both parties and will create dispute.",

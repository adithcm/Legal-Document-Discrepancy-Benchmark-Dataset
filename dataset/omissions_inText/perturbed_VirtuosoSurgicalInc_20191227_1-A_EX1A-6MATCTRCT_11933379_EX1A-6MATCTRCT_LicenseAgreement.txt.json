                "explanation": "By removing the specific deductions (trade discounts, refunds, returns, recalls, and sales taxes) from the definition of \"NET SALES\", the contract creates an ambiguity. While the definition still refers to gross sales revenues and fees, the absence of explicit deductions will cause in increased revenue that the JHU will gain royalties on.",

The license fee is nonrefundable and shall not be credited against royalties or other fees. 4.2 Minimum Annual Royalties: Company shall pay to JHU minimum annual royalties as set forth in Exhibit A.

                "explanation": "Removing the second half of section 4.2, where 'Running royalties accrued under Paragraph 4.3 and paid to JHU during the one year period preceding an anniversary of the EFFECTIVE DATE shall be credited against the minimum annual royalties due on that anniversary date.' clarifies a contradiction. The company will now have to pay the minimum annual royalties every year without crediting the running royalties. ",

JHU shall be listed as an additional insured in Company's said insurance policies.', it is creating a contradiction because section 9.7 states, 'The Company shall indemnify, defend with counsel reasonably acceptable to JHU, and hold JHU, The Johns Hopkins Health Systems, their representatives including but not limited to present and former, trustees, officers, Inventors, agents, faculty, employees and students harmless as against any judgments, fees, expenses, or other costs arising from or incidental to any product liability or other lawsuit'. The removal of the section will allow the company to have product liability insurance without listing JHU in its said insurance policies.",

                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.16  \"Drilling Costs\" means the actual costs and expenses incurred in drilling a well subject to this Agreement beginning with the initiation of preliminary site preparation activities through and including logging, testing and evaluating the well prior to recommending whether to attempt a Completion. Drilling Costs shall include, but shall not be limited to, the costs and expenses associated with permitting, preparing the site, drilling to the Objective Zone, and evaluating any Zone(s) in such well to which a Completion may be attempted, as well as any unplanned or unforeseen events such as fire, explosion, or loss of well control. Drilling Costs shall also include brokerage, abstracting, and reasonable attorney fees related to the preparation of drilling title opinions for such well. Drilling Costs shall not include the cost to plug and abandon any well, including a dry hole, and shall not include any Completion Costs.",
                "changed_text": "1.16  \"Drilling Costs\" means the initial payment made by Company. Further details about coverage are outlined in Section 2.1.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition radically changes 'Drilling Costs' to only the initial payment. However, subsequent references to drilling costs throughout the document, especially concerning unforeseen events and allocations, will create confusion because these items are no longer clearly addressed in the revised definition, creating an internal contradiction.",

All such insurance set forth in Exhibit \"G\" shall specifically name BP as an additional insured or provide that the insurer shall waive all rights of subrogation against BP.",
                "changed_text": "5.8 At all times while this Agreement is in effect, Company shall maintain a general liability insurance policy.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'Exhibit G' and specifying only a 'general liability insurance policy', the specific insurance requirements are removed. However, the later phrase, 'All such insurance set forth in Exhibit \"G\" shall specifically name BP as an additional insured', which remains, now contradicts the changed text. If Exhibit G is missing, naming BP as an additional insured is impossible to define.",

                "explanation": "This removes the specific guidance for the tax partnership, replacing it with a general statement about individual obligations. If Exhibit H is removed but the contract still refers to the tax partnership, this will cause legal ramifications. For example, if another clause dictates how revenue is split per Exhibit H, now exhibit H is gone and the revenue is split in a non-defined way.",

The proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting shall include language describing the general intention to grant equity awards.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a timeframe tied to the fourth-quarter earnings call. The revised version removes this specific timeframe, delegating the decision to the Compensation Committee and changes from an 'obligation' to a 'general intention'. This introduces uncertainty and contradicts the earlier sections if they assume awards are tied to earnings calls.",

The Marathon Parties shall provide written evidence of such vote to the Company no later than ten (10) business days prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting.",

The Marathon Parties shall provide written evidence of such vote to the Company no later than ten (10) business days prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting.",
                "explanation": "By removing the definition of 'Support Period' based on the advance notice period for the 2021 Annual Meeting, the contract fails to clearly define when the voting obligations of the Marathon Parties cease. If the Support Period is referenced in other sections, such as the Standstill Covenants, then that section becomes difficult to enforce due to the undefined timeframe. This introduces uncertainty about when the standstill restrictions apply, directly contradicting assumptions in other clauses reliant on a clearly defined Support Period.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 'independent' qualification weakens the requirement for independence. This creates a potential conflict with provisions in other sections of the agreement that are designed to ensure that the New Director is independent (like attending meetings of the compensation committee). It creates ambiguity about whether the company intended an independent director or if this was merely a suggestion.",

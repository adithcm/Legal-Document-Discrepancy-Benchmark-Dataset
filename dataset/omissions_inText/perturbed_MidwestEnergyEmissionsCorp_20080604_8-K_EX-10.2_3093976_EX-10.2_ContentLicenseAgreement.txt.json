In consideration for the license of rights granted hereunder in the Current Content, COMPANY hereby agrees to issue to YGP 16,200 shares of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for which YGP will pay COMPANY the sum of $1.00 per share or $16,200 in the aggregate; NCM 3,000 of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for which NCM will pay COMPANY the sum of $1.00 per share or $3,000 in the aggregate and TWK 12,000 of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for which TWK will pay COMPANY the sum of $1.00 per share or $12,000 in the aggregate.

The phrase 'mutually agreed location' puts the obligation on the Licensors to travel and meet with COMPANY and agree on the location, where the original location was already specified.",

In the event that any person or entity shall make any claim or institute any suit or proceeding, COMPANY shall notify CONTENT PROVIDER in writing, and CONTENT PROVIDER must assume, at it own cost and expense, the defense thereof; provided, however, that COMPANY'S failure to provide such notice shall not affect this indemnity unless CONTENT PROVIDER has been materially prejudiced by such failure. COMPANY may, at its sole discretion, engage its own counsel in connection with any such suit, claim or proceeding, and the cost thereof (including reasonable fees and expenses) shall be borne by CONTENT PROVIDER provided that CONTENT PROVIDER shall in any event fulfill its obligation to undertake COMPANY'S defense. The final control and disposition of any claim, whether by settlement, compromise or otherwise, shall remain with COMPANY pursuant to the terms of this indemnification paragraph. In the event that CONTENT PROVIDER fails to promptly make any required payment to COMPANY, COMPANY shall have the right to withhold for its own account any royalties or other monies payable to CONTENT PROVIDER by COMPANY pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement between CONTENT PROVIDER and COMPANY. B. COMPANY shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, save and hold harmless CONTENT PROVIDER and its successors, subdistributors, sublicensees, assigns, agents, representatives and affiliates from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, liability, loss, damage, cost and expense (including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs) incurred or sustained by reason of or arising out of any breach or alleged breach of any of the warranties, representations or agreements herein made by COMPANY, or by reason of any action, claim or proceeding related to or arising out of such breach or alleged breach by COMPANY.

For example, CONTENT PROVIDER and COMPANY are not responsible for all attorney's fees and court costs. This significantly reduces the level of protection offered by the indemnity clause and creates uncertainty regarding the extent of financial responsibility. By omitting several other aspects, it creates the opportunity for lawsuits due to loopholes.",

                "original_text": "This agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Revocation details are subject to separate confidential addendums.",
                "explanation": "By removing the original clause specifying revocation via signed writing and replacing it with a reference to 'separate confidential addendums,' the contract creates uncertainty. If those addendums do not exist, or if their content contradicts the initial assertion of remaining 'in full force and effect,' it introduces a contradiction and ambiguity regarding how and when a party can withdraw from the agreement. The terms of the confidential addendums are not provided and can't be reviewed by all the parties.",

                "changed_text": "Each party hereto agrees to cooperate on filings as generally understood within standard industry practice. Specific obligations regarding filings are outlined in Exhibit A.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly refers to compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and its associated rules, specifying joint filing responsibilities. The modified version replaces this explicit reference with a vague commitment to 'standard industry practice' and refers to Exhibit A for 'specific obligations.' If Exhibit A is missing or incomplete, this creates an inconsistency. Furthermore, 'standard industry practice' is open to interpretation and can lead to disagreements, contradicting the original intent of precise compliance with established legal standards. If another section states full compliance with the Securities Exchange Act, this is a clear contradiction.",

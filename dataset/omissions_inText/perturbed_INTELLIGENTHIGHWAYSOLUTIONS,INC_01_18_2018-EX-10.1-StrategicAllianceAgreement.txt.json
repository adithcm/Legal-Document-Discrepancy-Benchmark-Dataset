                "original_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with Fazync via email to IHSI's CEO, Devon Jones, and delivered through Bravatek or a Fazync -designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by Fazync at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at Fazync bank account.",

                "explanation": "By removing the range (10%-20%) and the factors determining the exact fee (project sales margin and cost of development), the contract creates ambiguity in how the 'lead-finder fee' will be calculated. The clause still mentions a fee, implying it exists, but omits the crucial details of its calculation. Section 4 states, 'When custom Products are designed, developed and to be delivered to Bravatek-identified perspective clients, the parties shall agree to a proposed sales price for use during the project in writing prior to the commencement of each project.' and now, Bravatek's lead finder fee is undefined. This is a contradiction because a project sales price can be agreed, but the lead-finder fee based upon the sales price is not.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'in writing', there is no longer a mandate that the proposed sales price for the product need be recorded in writing, creating an internal contradiction. Section 11 states that 'No changes or modifications of this Agreement or any of its terms shall be deemed effective unless in writing and executed by the parties hereto.' but if there is no paper trail of the agreed upon sales price, section 11 could be interpreted in multiple ways and make enforcement uncertain.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'non-exclusive' and altering reporting from 'quarterly...monthly' and '3-month rolling', Bravatek's responsibilities are made unclear. Section 2 states, 'Fazync agrees to use its best efforts to promote and support project lead finding and after-sales support of Bravatek by: a. Listing Bravatek in all appropriate sales and marketing materials as a non-exclusive alliance partner (with focus of government customers)'. If Bravatek is no longer a non-exclusive lead finder, it creates a contradiction in which the listed relationship is no longer accurate.",

                "changed_text": "2.2. The definitions that apply in the present Agreement will be provided separately.",
                "explanation": "By stating that definitions will be provided separately, while the original agreement refers to Annex 1, creates confusion and uncertainty regarding where key definitions can be found. This makes it harder to interpret other clauses relying on these definitions. The enforcement is weakened since the meaning of core terms is not immediately accessible or clear.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Annex 2, the quantitative metrics for 'high availability' and 'proper performance' are undefined. Later sections referencing these performance obligations now lack a clear standard for evaluation. It creates uncertainty about the service level expectations, making it difficult to enforce performance standards.",

                "explanation": "Removing reference to Annex 3 means there's no specific list of servers EIT is responsible for. Later clauses detailing responsibilities for 'Servers' become vague since the precise servers covered are unknown. Enforcement of server-related duties is uncertain due to lack of clarity about which servers fall under EIT's purview.",

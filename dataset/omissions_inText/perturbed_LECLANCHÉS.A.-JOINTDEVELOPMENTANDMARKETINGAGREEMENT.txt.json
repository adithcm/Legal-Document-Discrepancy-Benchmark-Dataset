                "original_text": "The term \"Affiliate\" as used herein with respect to a party means any partnership, joint venture, corporation of other form of enterprise that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such entity or person. For purposes hereof, \"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person or entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "The term \"Affiliate\" as used herein with respect to a party means any partnership, joint venture, corporation of other form of enterprise. For purposes hereof, \"control\" will be determined solely by the Board of each company.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the detailed definition of 'control' and the addition of 'will be determined solely by the Board of each company' creates ambiguity. The original text provides a clear guideline based on ownership and contractual power, while the altered text introduces a subjective element dependent on each company's board decision, leading to potential disputes regarding affiliate status and enforcement of obligations tied to affiliates.",

                "changed_text": "Oak Ridge may explore product liability and warranty insurance options.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall arrange' to 'may explore' creates an omission because it removes the obligatory nature of Oak Ridge securing insurance. This weakens the contract and introduces ambiguity about whether product liability is actually covered, which can lead to disputes later if liabilities arise. This omission contradicts the intent of defining responsibilities.",

                "changed_text": "In the absence of a specific payment schedule, payment terms will be determined on a project by project basis.",
                "explanation": "By changing from a definitive '30 days net' to 'project by project basis', the payment terms become vague and negotiable, thus changing the responsibilities of all parties with respect to money. It makes the contract uncertain about when payments are actually due.",

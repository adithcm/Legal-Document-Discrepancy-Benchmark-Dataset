                "original_text": "All revenue sharing will be reconciled monthly and funds distributed by the 20th of each month by wire transfer for all net collected revenues for the previous month (net of returns and refunds, if any). ●IMedicor will make its records available for audit purposes at any time by USA MCO during regular business hours at the headquarters of iMedicor.",
                "changed_text": "All revenue sharing will be reconciled monthly. ●IMedicor will make its records available for audit purposes at any time by USA MCO during regular business hours at the headquarters of iMedicor.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause specifying distribution by wire transfer and the calculation of 'net collected revenues' creates an inconsistency. While revenue sharing is still mentioned, the method and specifics of how it's distributed are now undefined, creating uncertainty in enforcement. It is expected for IMedicor to share revenue but, it is never explicitly defined when and how that will happen.",

                "original_text": "USA MCO will have the option to take all or part of its revenue share in equity up to a maximum of 4.9% ownership in iMedicor on a fully diluted basis. For the purposes of this proposal, fully diluted means all issued and outstanding stock warrants priced at 15 times the average 5 day closing price at the day previous to reconciliation of revenues, which will be the 20th of the month for the prior calendar month.",
                "changed_text": "USA MCO will have the option to take all or part of its revenue share in equity up to a maximum of 4.9% ownership in iMedicor.",
                "explanation": "By removing the definition of 'fully diluted basis', the contract becomes ambiguous about how equity share is calculated. This omission creates an internal contradiction as the equity option remains, but the calculation method is removed, making enforcement uncertain.",

Thereafter, this Agreement shall be renewed automatically on a five (5) year basis, unless one party notifies the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement at least sixty 90 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or then current renewal term, as applicable, or unless a new Agreement is signed between the USA MCO and IMedicor which will then invalidate this Agreement.\n\nIn such an instance, all compensation will continue for a extended period of five years from the date of termination for all subscriptions tagged as USA MCO.",

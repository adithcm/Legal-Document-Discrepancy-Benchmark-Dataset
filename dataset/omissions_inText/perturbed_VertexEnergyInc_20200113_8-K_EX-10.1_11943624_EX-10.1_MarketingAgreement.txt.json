                "explanation": "By simplifying the definitions of 'Hedging Profit,' 'Hedging Loss,' and 'Interest Rate,' uncertainty is introduced. The original text provides specific calculations. The modified text uses vague language such as 'gains on hedging transactions,' 'losses on hedging transactions,' and 'a commercially reasonable rate to be determined,' creating ambiguity and potential disputes about the actual values, which is inconsistent with other clauses relying on these terms for financial calculations.",

                "explanation": "By removing the exact percentages for payments, ambiguity arises. Although it is specified payments have to be made, it is not clarified the exact amount to be paid, which contradicts the overall financial clarity the contract intends to provide, making enforcement uncertain.",

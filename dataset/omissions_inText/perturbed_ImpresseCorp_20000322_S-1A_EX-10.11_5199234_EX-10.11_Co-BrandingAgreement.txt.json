CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall mean, subject to the provisions of Section 7.2  [EXCLUSIONS], all proprietary and confidential information of a party, including, without limitation, trade secrets, technical information, business information, sales information, customer and potential customer lists and identities, product sales plans, sublicense agreements, inventions, developments, discoveries, software, know-how, methods, techniques, formulae, data, processes and other trade secrets and proprietary ideas, whether or not protectable under patent, trademark, copyright or other areas of law, that the other party has access to or receives.

For purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement may not be considered Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "By removing specific examples and replacing them with the vague \"all information a party considers confidential,\" the definition becomes subjective. Simultaneously changing 'shall' to 'may' creates an internal contradiction regarding the confidentiality of the Co-Branding Agreement itself. This undermines the enforceability of Article 7 [CONFIDENTIALITY] because it's unclear what specifically is protected.",

During the term of this Agreement and for one year thereafter, VerticalNet shall have the right to appoint a certified public accountant to audit Impresse's financial records relating to such payment to verify the accuracy of Impresse's financial records in order to verify the amount of the payments owed and/or paid hereunder, but no more frequently than once per year. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was underpaid, the additional amount owed shall be paid to VerticalNet within 15 days of notice of such underpayment to Impresse. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was underpaid in excess of 10% of the amount owed, the fees of such audit shall also be paid to VerticalNet within 15 days of notice of such to Impresse. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was overpaid, the excess amount paid shall be returned by VerticalNet within 15 days of notice of such overpayment. VerticalNet shall give reasonable advance notice to Impresse of such audit and each audit shall be conducted in a manner that does not cause unreasonable disruption to the conduct of business by Impresse. The results of any such audit shall be deemed to be Confidential Information and may not be disclosed by either party or its certified public accountants except as may be necessary to enforce such party's rights.",

The results of any such audit may be disclosed by either party.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specificity around the scope of the audit and the repercussions of under/overpayment, and replacing it with generic audit rights and the ability to disclose the results, the clause is heavily weakened. The original text specified that the audit's aim was to \"verify the amount of the payments owed\", whereas, in the modified version, it can be for any purpose. Also, the results are no longer considered Confidential Information. This directly contradicts Article 7 [CONFIDENTIALITY], and renders the audit clause difficult to enforce with any precision.",

If another part of the contract assumes or states outright that both parties are in full compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations, this change will directly contradict that statement.

Such amounts shall be billed on a bi-monthly basis by Equidata and are due and payable in  full by Marketing Affiliate 30 days from the invoice date. The prices set forth in Exhibit A do not include regulatory  fees, sales tax, excise tax or any other fees or taxes that may be charged by states or local taxing authorities nor does it  include additional fees or surcharges, including specific area Affiliate charges that may be accessed by the Credit  Reporting Agencies (CRA's). Said amounts charged to Equidata will be billed separately to Marketing Affiliate and are  due immediately upon receipt.",

Such amounts shall be billed on a bi-monthly basis by Equidata and are due and payable in full by Marketing Affiliate 30 days from the invoice date. The prices do not include regulatory fees, sales tax, excise tax or any other fees or taxes that may be charged by states or local taxing authorities nor does it include additional fees or surcharges, including specific area Affiliate charges that may be accessed by the Credit Reporting Agencies (CRA's). Said amounts charged to Equidata will be billed separately to Marketing Affiliate and are due immediately upon receipt.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific reference to 'Exhibit A attached hereto' where the compensation amounts are detailed, while still mentioning that amounts are due, creates uncertainty. There's now no clear method for determining the correct compensation, which introduces a contradiction. The phrase 'mutually agreed upon amounts' is also vague and subject to interpretation, which introduces ambiguity in how the pricing schedule can be modified and whether or not those changes have to be in writing.",

The demand shall set forth a statement for the nature of the dispute and the amount involved. If Equidata and Marketing Affiliate cannot resolve the dispute on their own within 10 days after Equidata receives said dispute, the dispute will be escalated to senior management.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines a clear arbitration process if a dispute cannot be resolved. By removing the arbitrator clause while retaining the dispute resolution process, but replacing it with 'escalated to senior management' creates a contradiction. The contract now provides no clear method for resolving disputes beyond initial negotiation, making any enforcement actions unclear. The arbitrator process is completely removed.",

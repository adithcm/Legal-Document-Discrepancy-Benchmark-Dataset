                "explanation": "By removing the explicit mention of modifying the provisions regarding '[***]' (presumably a key term duration, payment or intellectual property rights), the agreement becomes ambiguous. Later sections might refer to changes regarding '[***]' without a clear foundation, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

This removal makes it impossible to understand the updated terms of the agreement as referenced later and creating uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "By explicitly exempting Section 2.A and B from prevailing over conflicting provisions, and Section 2.A and B have been changed to empty string, the agreement creates a direct contradiction. The text says that 'this Second Amendment shall prevail' but also 'Except for Section 2.A and B' which leads to confusion. This ambiguity opens the door to disputes about which version of the agreement is to be used as a base. ",

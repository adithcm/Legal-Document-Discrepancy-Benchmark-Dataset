                "explanation": "The original text provides specific definitions for 'Fund Investment Income' and 'Fund Operating Expenses,' which are then used to calculate 'Net Investment Income.' The modified text removes these specific definitions and replaces them with vague terms like 'as generally understood' and 'as reported.' Later sections of the contract still refer to the original defined terms, creating an internal contradiction. Furthermore, it removes the definition of Expense Waiver which creates a contradiction as this term is later used in the document.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the Expense Waiver definition in an earlier section of the document, and retaining references to it, there is a contradiction as the term lacks a formal definition within the modified contract while being referenced in this section.

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit mention of 'Rule 12b-1' fees, the modified text creates ambiguity regarding which fees the Underwriter can waive.

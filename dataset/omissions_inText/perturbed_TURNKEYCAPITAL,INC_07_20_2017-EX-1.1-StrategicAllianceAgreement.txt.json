                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'who are not Reserved Investors (or Rejected Investors)', SIC could solicit investment from such investors. This change creates an ambiguity in the definition of acceptable investors, thereby altering the scope of SIC's freedom regarding potential investors and impacting TKCI's rights.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit 50/50 split of net revenue, the distribution becomes ambiguous and can lead to disputes. Other sections will still reference net revenue distributions, however, the precise method is now undefined, creating a contradiction and uncertainty of enforcement.",

If arbitration fails to render a mutually agreement resolution the Courts of the State of Florida will be deemed to have jurisdiction. In addition to all other remedies provided in this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to all costs and expenses reasonably incurred as a result of said breach, including arbitration and court costs, and reasonable attorney's fees.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'before a single arbitrator' and 'including arbitration and court costs, and reasonable attorney's fees', the terms of arbitration are not defined, and the costs the prevailing party is entitled to are restricted. This change creates an ambiguity regarding the arbitration procedure and the extent of financial relief, contradicting the intention of fair dispute resolution. Other sections may refer to dispute resolution, but the process is now missing key components.",

XSPA shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to display, market, promote, offer for sale and sell the Products set forth on Exhibit A in all Stores throughout the Territory. The Products shall only be sold by XSPA at the retail price of the applicable Product as set forth on Exhibit A (the \"Retail Price\"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Retail Price for the Products at the Stores in the Territory (i) may only be modified by mutual agreement of the Parties, and (ii) does not include any discounts, promotions or applicable sales taxes.",

XSPA shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to display, market, promote, offer for sale and sell the Products set forth on Exhibit A in all Stores throughout the Territory. The Products shall be sold by XSPA at a price determined by XSPA. For the avoidance of doubt, the price for the Products at the Stores in the Territory may be modified at XSPA's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the definition of 'Retail Price' as being fixed in Exhibit A and modifiable only by mutual agreement, and instead stating the price is determined by XSPA at its discretion, this creates an internal contradiction. Later sections referencing the 'Retail Price' will be ambiguous, as the foundational agreement on price control has been altered. This is an in-text contradiction because the term is still used, but its original meaning is gone.",

Calm or its authorized designees shall be the sole suppliers to XSPA of XSPA's requirements for Products, Gifts, Shopping Bags, Uniforms and Inserts (collectively, \"Product Collateral\") for each Store throughout the Territory. Calm shall use reasonable efforts to fulfill all of XSPA's requirements for Product Collateral in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event that inventory of any Product Collateral in any Store falls below fifty percent (50%) of the initial amount of such Product Collateral provided to such Store, XSPA shall use best efforts to advise Calm in sufficient detail to enable Calm to ship additional inventory of such Product Collateral to such Store. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, as between the Parties, Calm shall retain legal title to any and all Product Collateral (other than Uniforms) until sold in a Store in the Territory or otherwise disbursed in a Store in the Territory (in the case of Gifts, Inserts and Shopping Bags) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event Calm identifies any issue with any Product Collateral making it unsuitable for use as contemplated by this Agreement or issues a recall with respect to any Product, XSPA shall promptly return any and all affected Product Collateral to Calm or its authorized designees upon receiving notice of such issue or recall.",

                "explanation": "By removing Calm as the sole supplier for all Product Collateral and stating that XSPA will source its own Uniforms, while keeping the other sentences intact, an inconsistency arises. The definition of Product Collateral includes Uniforms, but now XSPA is responsible for sourcing them. This creates confusion around whether Calm is still ultimately responsible for the quality and brand consistency of Uniforms, and how returns or recalls will be handled, which is later referenced.",

XSPA shall pay to Calm on a monthly basis an amount equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Retail Price for all Products sold in the Stores in the Territory during the applicable month minus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of any commission actually paid or payable to XSPA employee(s) or contractor(s) attributable to sales of such Products during such month; provided that in no event shall such commission be greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the Retail Price for the applicable Product.",

The amount should be commercially reasonable, taking into account the market conditions and sales revenue of XSPA. The commission paid to XSPA employee(s) or contractor(s) attributable to sales of such Products during such month will be based on employee contracts.",
                "explanation": "By removing the calculation based on a percentage of Retail Price and replacing it with a vaguely defined amount 'to be determined', and then removing the commission limit, creates ambiguity and inconsistency. Later references to payment calculations or audit based on 'Retail Price' are now problematic, as the very basis of the payment structure has been fundamentally altered, but the references to audits and the 'Retail Price' term is not removed.",

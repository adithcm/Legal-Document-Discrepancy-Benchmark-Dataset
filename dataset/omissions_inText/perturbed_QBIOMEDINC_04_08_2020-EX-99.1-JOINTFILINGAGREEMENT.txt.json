                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the statement on Schedule 13G with respect to the equity securities of Q Biomed, Inc. is, and any amendment thereto signed by each of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The undersigned hereby further agree that this Joint Filing Agreement be included as an exhibit to such statement and any such amendment.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to 'Schedule 13G' and 'Rule 13d-1(k) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended', the agreement becomes vague. Later references to the 'statement' lack clear definition, creating uncertainty about the specific regulatory filings covered. While the agreement mentions filing a statement, the absence of the original detailed clause introduces a level of discretion and ambiguity on the required filings. ",

The contract still requires that each party shall be responsible for making sure that the filings are done, but the individual accountability for the information within those filings is completely removed.

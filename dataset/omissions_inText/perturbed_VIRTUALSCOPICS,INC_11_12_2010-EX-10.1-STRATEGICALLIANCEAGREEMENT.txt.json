The prices and rates set forth in Exhibit B and the Discount and Booking thresholds set forth in Exhibit C shall remain in effect, without adjustment, during the Initial Term of this Agreement and may thereafter be updated to reflect changes in connection with any Renewal of this Agreement, as specified in Section 1 herein.",
                "changed_text": "c. The prices and rates for Preferred Services will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The Discount and Booking thresholds set forth in Exhibit C shall remain in effect, without adjustment, during the Initial Term of this Agreement and may thereafter be updated to reflect changes in connection with any Renewal of this Agreement, as specified in Section 1 herein.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Exhibit B as the source for 'pricing and rates', but still referencing it for 'Discount and Booking thresholds' and not providing an alternative source, there is now an ambiguity as to how preferred service prices are determined. This creates uncertainty and contradiction in the agreement, making it difficult to enforce.",

                "explanation": "By removing the initial agreement to use a 'separate written agreement' to define IP rights related to a Joint Solution, and instead stating it will be 'determined on a case-by-case basis', the contract introduces ambiguity and contradiction. The subsequent paragraph still refers to Intellectual Property Amendment, implying a specific process is in place, but the removed text eliminated such process. This creates conflict on how IP is assigned.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'regulatory authority' from this clause, VS is no longer required to inform PPD of audits by any regulatory authority. However, section 8 states that VS shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines. This creates an inconsistency and impacts auditing requirements",

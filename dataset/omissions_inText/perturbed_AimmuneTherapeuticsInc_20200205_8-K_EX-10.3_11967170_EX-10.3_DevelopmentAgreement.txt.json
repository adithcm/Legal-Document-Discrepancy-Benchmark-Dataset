                "original_text": "1.21 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means, with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective (e.g., Development Activities and Commercialization hereunder), the level of efforts consistent with the efforts and resources [***] of similar market potential, at a similar stage in development or product lifecycle, taking into account the stage of development or product lifecycle of other of [***] product candidates, safety and efficacy, product profile, cost of goods, the competitiveness of the marketplace, such company's patent position with respect to such product (including such company's ability to obtain or enforce, or have obtained or enforced, such patent rights), the Third Party patent landscape relevant to the product, the regulatory structure involved, the likelihood of regulatory approval, the likelihood and extent of anticipated or actual profitability of the applicable product, and other technical, legal, scientific and medical considerations. Without limiting the foregoing, Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires, with respect to such obligations, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such obligation to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) set objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",

Without limiting the foregoing, Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires, with respect to such obligations, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such obligation to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis.",
                "explanation": "By removing key considerations such as 'market potential', 'stage of development', 'product lifecycle', and 'profitability', the definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' becomes significantly weakened and more subjective. The original definition aimed to standardize expectations, whereas the revised version creates an internal contradiction if, elsewhere in the agreement, a Party is expected to take specific actions to maximize profits or secure regulatory approval (which would depend on the omitted factors). By only considering 'resources available to that Party', it creates contradiction in that party's obligation of maximizing resources with no regard for other metrics.",

Aimmune shall determine, [***], the contents and frequency of such reports, but in any event such reports will be made as [***] for Xencor to remain informed of the safety status of the Product to assess, monitor and report to Regulatory Authorities information relevant to the safety of Product in connection with Xencor's efforts to obtain Regulatory Approval of products that are not the Product and that [***], and comply with Applicable Laws.

                "explanation": "By removing the detailed requirements concerning the nature, timing, and purpose of safety reporting, the clause becomes vague. This creates an in-text contradiction, because the original clause ensured that Aimmune and Xencor would help each other remain informed, which would support them meeting their obligation to 'comply with Applicable Laws'. The modified version still mentions 'compliance with Applicable Laws', however by removing the requirements of providing assistance, both parties will be unable to comply.",

During the Term and for [***] ([***]) years thereafter, Aimmune shall keep, and shall cause its Affiliates and Sublicensees to keep and provide to Xencor, complete and accurate records pertaining to the sale or other disposition of Product in sufficient detail to permit Xencor to confirm the accuracy of payments due hereunder. Xencor shall have the right, upon [***] ([***]) days' prior written notice to Aimmune, to cause an independent, certified international public accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Aimmune or reasonably acceptable to its Affiliates or Sublicensees, as applicable, to audit such records during Aimmune's, or its Affiliate's or Sublicensees', as applicable, normal business hours to confirm the number of Product units sold, the gross sales and Net Sales of Product, the royalties payable, the method used to calculate the royalties payable, and the exchange rates used in accordance with Section 8.2. The audit shall be limited to pertinent records kept by Aimmune and its Affiliates and Sublicensees for any year ending not more than [***] ([***]) months prior to the date of the written notice. An audit under this Section 8.4 shall not occur more than [***] in any Calendar Year, except in the case of any subsequent \"for cause\" audit. The accounting firm shall disclose to Xencor only whether the reports are correct or incorrect and the specific details concerning any discrepancies. No other information shall be provided to Xencor. The accounting firm shall provide Aimmune with a copy of any disclosures or reports made to Xencor and Aimmune shall have an opportunity to discuss such disclosures or reports with Xencor and the accounting firm. Information, disclosures, or reports arising from any such examination shall be Confidential Information of Aimmune subject to the confidentiality and other obligations of ARTICLE 12. Prompt adjustments shall be made by the Parties to reflect the results of such audit. Xencor shall bear the full cost of such audit unless such audit discloses an underpayment of more than [***] percent ([***]%) of the payments due under this Agreement, in which case, [***].",

                "explanation": "By removing significant details about the audit process (e.g., the period for which records must be kept, the frequency of audits, specific items the audit can confirm, what must be disclosed), it creates an inconsistency with Section 8.1, which dictates that royalty payments must be calculated and reported with sufficient detail. If Xencor now has no means to properly audit the accounting records, the requirement of a sufficient accounting report becomes vague. While the 'accuracy of payments due' is still mentioned, the removal of the records Aimmune is to 'keep and provide to Xencor' and the details of the auditing process leads to internal contradiction.",

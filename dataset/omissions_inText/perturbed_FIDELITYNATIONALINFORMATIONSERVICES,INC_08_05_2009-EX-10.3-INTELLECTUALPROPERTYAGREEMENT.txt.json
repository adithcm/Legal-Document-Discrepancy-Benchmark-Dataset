                "explanation": "The removal of subsection (iv) creates an internal contradiction. Section 4.1(a) states that the license to Certegy is subject to the following, which should include the terms in (iv) about sublicensing to members of the Certegy Group and enforcing the agreement. Because this provision is removed, the enforceability of those restrictions of sublicensing by Certegy is put into question, as well as removing the mention of compliance with other sections.",

                "explanation": "By removing '(including without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses)', while keeping 'any and all damage, loss, liability and expense', makes it unclear what is exactly covered for expenses. This omission introduces ambiguity about whether investigation and attorney fees are covered, potentially contradicting the intention of a comprehensive indemnification clause.",

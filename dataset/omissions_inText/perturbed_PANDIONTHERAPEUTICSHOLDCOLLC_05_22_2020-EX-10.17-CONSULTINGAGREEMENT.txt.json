                "original_text": "During the Consultation Period (as defined below) and for a period of one year thereafter, except in connection with his performance of the Services, the Consultant shall not engage in any activity in the field described on Schedule A to this Agreement, and he shall not assist any other person or organization that engages in any such activity.",
                "changed_text": "During the Consultation Period and for a period of one year thereafter, except in connection with his performance of the Services, the Consultant shall not engage in any competitive activity. The specifics of 'competitive activity' will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Company's legal counsel.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific reference to 'the field described on Schedule A', the agreement introduces ambiguity regarding the scope of the non-compete clause. The original text clearly defines the restricted area. The modified version leaves the definition of 'competitive activity' open to interpretation and the discretion of the Company's legal counsel, creating uncertainty and potential for arbitrary enforcement. While Section 18 alludes to limiting any restriction that is too broad, it's now unclear what the original intended scope was.",

                "original_text": "(b) For purposes of this Agreement, Proprietary Information shall mean, by way of illustration and not limitation, all information, whether or not in writing, whether or not patentable and whether or not copyrightable, of a private, secret or confidential nature, owned, possessed or used by the Company, concerning the Company's business, business relationships or financial affairs, including, without limitation, any Invention, formula, vendor information, customer information, apparatus, equipment, trade secret, process, research, report, technical or research data, clinical data, know-how, computer program, software, software documentation, hardware design, technology, product, processes, methods, techniques, formulas, compounds, projects, developments, marketing or business plan, forecast, unpublished financial statement, budget, license, price, cost, customer, supplier or personnel information or employee list that is communicated to, learned of, developed or otherwise acquired by the Consultant in the course of Consultant's service as a consultant to the Company.",
                "changed_text": "(b) For purposes of this Agreement, Proprietary Information shall generally refer to confidential data. Specific examples of confidential data are not intended to limit the scope of Proprietary Information, and the Company reserves the right to classify information as Proprietary at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides an extensive list of what constitutes 'Proprietary Information', creating a relatively clear definition. The revised text replaces this with a vague reference to 'confidential data' and grants the Company the discretionary power to classify information as Proprietary. This creates a contradiction because while the agreement still uses the term Proprietary Information in other sections, its definition has been significantly weakened and made subjective. This makes enforcement more arbitrary and weakens the consultant's protection against overly broad claims of proprietary information, affecting sections 6.2 and 6.3.",

Subject to approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company shall issue and sell to the Consultant, and the Consultant shall purchase from the Company, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Restricted Stock Agreement, 1,990,000 shares (the \"Shares\") of common stock, $0.0001 par value, of the Company (\"Common Stock\"), at a purchase price of $0.0001 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $190. Such Shares are in addition to the 10,000 shares of Common Stock held by the Consultant as of the date hereof. The Consultant agrees that the Shares shall be subject to the terms of the Restricted Stock Agreement.",

The Consultant agrees that the Shares shall be subject to the terms of the Stock Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By changing “Restricted Stock Agreement” to “Stock Agreement” in section 3.1, and NOT updating it in further sections that reference the former, creates confusion. The agreement in Section 3.1 states that consultant agrees to be bound to the terms of the “Stock Agreement”, but Section 4 refers to termination where certain rights afforded to the consultant are subject to the “Restricted Stock Agreement”. This directly creates an internal contradiction which causes uncertainly in enforcement.",

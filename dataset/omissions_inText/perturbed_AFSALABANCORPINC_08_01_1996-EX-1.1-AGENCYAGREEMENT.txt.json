                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit fee structure. Later sections reference specific percentages and calculation methods for compensation. This lack of specific percentage creates an ambiguity about the payment due to Capital Resources. For example, Section 10 discusses how Capital Resources' percentage affects contribution.",

Whether or not this Agreement becomes effective,  the Conversion is completed or the sale of the Shares by the Company is consummated,  the Company and Association jointly and severally agree to pay directly for or to reimburse  Capital  Resources  for (to the extent that such expenses have been reasonably incurred by Capital Resources) (a) all filing fees and expenses  incurred in connection with the qualification or registration of the Shares for offer and sale by the Company under the securities or blue sky laws of any  jurisdictions  Capital  Resources  and the  Company  may agree upon pursuant to subsection  (i) of Section 6 above,  including  counsel fees paid or incurred by the Company, the Association or Capital Resources in connection with such   qualification   or  registration  or  exemption  from   qualification  or registration;  (b) all filing fees in connection with all filings with the NASD; (c) any stock issue or transfer  taxes which may be payable  with respect to the sale of the Shares to purchasers in the Conversion; (d) reasonable and necessary expenses of the Conversion,\n\n                                      -14-\n\nincluding but not limited to,  attorneys'  fees,  transfer agent,  registrar and other agent charges,  fees relating to auditing and accounting or other advisors and costs of printing all documents necessary in connection with the Conversion; and (e) out-of-pocket  expenses incurred by Capital Resources in connection with the  Conversion  or any  of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  including, without limitation,  the fees of its attorneys, and reasonable communication and travel expenses.",

                "explanation": "This revision simplifies expense reimbursement by removing the detailed list of covered expenses.

Capital Resources may terminate  this Agreement by giving the notice indicated below in this Section at any time after this Agreement becomes effective as follows:\n\n                  (a) In the event the  Company  fails to sell all of the Shares within the period  specified,  and in accordance with the provisions of the Plan or as required by the Conversion  Regulations and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon refund by the Association to each person who has subscribed for or ordered any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from such person, together with interest as provided in the Offering Prospectus,  and no party to this  Agreement  shall have any  obligation to the other  hereunder, except  for  payment  by the  Association  and/or  the  Company  as set forth in Sections 2, 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n                  (b) If any of the conditions  specified in Section 8 shall not have been  fulfilled when and as required by this  Agreement,  or by the Closing Date,  or waived in writing  by Capital  Resources,  this  Agreement  and all of Capital Resources  obligations hereunder may be canceled by Capital Resources by notifying the Association of such  cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the  Closing  Date,  and,  any  such  cancellation  shall be without  Liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise  provided in Sections 2, 7, 9 and 10 hereof.",

                "explanation": "The original text details specific termination scenarios, including failure to sell shares or unfulfilled conditions from Section 8. The new text is vague and removes the explicit conditions under which Capital Resources can terminate, particularly its reliance on Section 8 conditions. This makes Section 8's obligations and dependencies unclear because now, termination could occur for ANY reason. This contradicts the original contract's intent where termination was tied to specific performance criteria.",

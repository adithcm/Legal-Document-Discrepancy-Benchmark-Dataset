                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to the 'Statement of Work in the form set forth in Appendix A', but retaining the language implying a specific document outlines project details, the contract becomes internally contradictory if Appendix A does not exist or is later removed. Other sections may still reference the SOW, leading to confusion and potential disputes on project scope and budget.",

Due upon presentation of certain deliverables. 3.1.3 Final payment, due upon presentation of deliverables.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific payment amounts and the associated deliverables for each payment milestone, but retaining the framework for a three-payment schedule tied to deliverables, a contradiction is introduced. The contract mentions payments due upon deliverables, but fails to specify what those deliverables are, or the amounts of payment. This makes enforcement impossible as the core financial obligations are undefined.",

In the case of inadvertent disclosure of Confidential information that was not marked as Confidential, the Disclosing Party has ten (10) business days from the time they discover that the information should have been marked Confidential, to inform the other Party of such a designation, and the parties agree to retroactively mark any such information as Confidential. 7.7 The parties agree that limitations on disclosure of Confidential information under section 7.3 shall last 5 years from signing date.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'and all material containing Confidential Information must have a restrictive marking' from 7.6, while keeping the requirement in 7.3 for 'Confidential Information' to be marked, the document is no longer consistent. Section 7.6 now states information must only be identified, yet there is no explicit method for identifying information as 'Confidential', which may lead to breaches. Also, removing time limits introduces ambiguity.",

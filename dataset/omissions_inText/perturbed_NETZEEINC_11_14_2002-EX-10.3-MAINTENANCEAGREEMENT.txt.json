                "explanation": "By referencing 'Schedule A' but not including it, the actual fee structure is omitted, creating uncertainty and potential disputes. Later sections assume a fixed fee, which now contradicts this open reference.",

Specific details for support and availability are subject to Netzee's then-current service level agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modified text removes specific commitments (call-in support hours, uptime guarantees) and replaces them with vague references to 'then-current service level agreement,' which is not attached, creating an omission and contradiction if the Master Agreement referenced in section 6 assumes these specific commitments.",

                "explanation": "By limiting the sections of the Master Agreement that apply to *only Section X and Y*, it creates a contradiction if the Master Agreement contains other critical clauses like warranty or liability limitations relevant to the maintenance services described in this agreement. The original paragraph clearly references the entire document. This creates ambiguity as to what parts of the Master Agreement are still active within this maintenance agreement. If a warranty is not included in Section X or Y, it creates a direct contradiction with the assumed warranty based on the original text.",

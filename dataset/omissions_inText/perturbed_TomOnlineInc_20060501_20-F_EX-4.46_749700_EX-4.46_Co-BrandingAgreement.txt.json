                "changed_text": "1.2 \"Affiliate\" means in relation to any Person, any Subsidiary or Holding Company. The determination of what constitutes an affiliate will be made at the sole discretion of Skype.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific 30% ownership criterion and granting Skype sole discretion, this change introduces ambiguity and potential conflict. Other sections referencing 'Affiliate' now lack a clear, objective definition, creating uncertainty in enforcement, particularly regarding revenue sharing or non-compete clauses.",

If any provision of a Statement of Work conflicts with any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall take precedence.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'Deliverables, applicable fees, scope of work and appropriate project timelines' creates a contradiction. Section 2.7 mentions 'express terms contained in any Statement of Work' but the definition of Statement of Work no longer guarantees these terms. This creates uncertainty about the contractual obligations and potential for disputes.",

(ii) the Direct Expenses incurred thereby, during the preceding calendar quarter and on a cumulative basis, and (iii) the calculation of Adjusted Net Revenue,' and replacing it with 'showing high-level revenue,' it creates a contradiction. Other sections reference the need for detailed and accurate financial reporting to calculate payments, however the current definition does not guarantee they are available. This ambiguity affects the accuracy of payments.",

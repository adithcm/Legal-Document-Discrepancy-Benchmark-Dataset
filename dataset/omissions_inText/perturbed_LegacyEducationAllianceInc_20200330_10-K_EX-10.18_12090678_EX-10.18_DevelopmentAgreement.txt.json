                "explanation": "By removing the exclusions from the definition of 'Cash Sales,' specifically refunds, rebates, and bad debt, a contradiction is created in section 9.1, which calculates royalties based on 'Cash Sales.' Now, there is no clarity if the 'Cash Sales' used for royalty calculation include or exclude refunds, creating a significant uncertainty in enforcement and royalty payment.",

                "explanation": "This change omits the explicit tiered royalty structure defined in Section 9.1.1, creating a direct contradiction if Schedule 3 is missing or has a different structure than implied by the original section. The original section clearly dictates specific royalty rates based on cash sales thresholds, but the altered text only indicates calculation based on Schedule 3, making enforcement uncertain if no schedule is provided.",

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, LEA shall defend, hold harmless and indemnify T&B and T&B's agents and employees from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, disputes, causes of action or damages, including, without limitation, FTC actions or other regulatory actions, and/or attorneys' fees arising out of or relating to the promotion, distribution and/or sale of any financial education programs, products or services, including (but not limited to) live presentations, print advertising, radio advertising, direct mail, outbound calls, email marketing, affiliate marketing, online advertising, infomercials and other marketing methods, by or through LEA, In any instance to which such indemnities pertain, LEA shall obtain and maintain necessary insurance, including, without limitation, Commercial General Liability Insurance, including product liability insurance, trademark infringement, copyright infringement, defamation, contractual liability and personal and advertising injury liability insurance in an amount no less than ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00) per occurrence and ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00) aggregate combined single limit.

                "explanation": "The omission of the specific details of LEA's insurance obligations creates an inconsistency. While it mandates indemnification, the specific requirement for $10 million in Commercial General Liability Insurance and naming T&B as an additional insured are removed. The clause 'LEA shall obtain and maintain necessary insurance as deemed appropriate by LEA's internal risk management team' makes it ambiguous and potentially unenforceable. This creates uncertainty because the previous requirement to name T&B as an additional insured is gone, reducing their indemnification and protection level.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of 'SOFTWARE' from the PRODUCT(S) and by removing 2.4, the contract now refers to software licenses in Section 7 and Section 5 of Premier Addendum without explicitly defining what 'SOFTWARE' constitutes. This creates ambiguity as it becomes unclear what specific software falls under the agreement, impacting the enforceability of clauses related to software licenses and intellectual property.",

TRADEMARKS.\n\nSubject to McDATA's prior written approval, McDATA grants Reseller a limited, nonexclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use McDATA's Trademarks (defined as McDATA's name or any abbreviation thereof, its acronym, logotype or any other trademarks or trade names of McDATA) for the sole purpose of marketing and selling Products and End User Customer Services in the Territory during the term of this Agreement Reseller agrees to comply with McDATA's Logo Usage Guide, which is found at McDATA's web site, www.mcdata.com.

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit definition of 'Trademarks' and the reference to the 'Logo Usage Guide' on McDATA's website, the contract becomes vague regarding what constitutes McDATA's trademarks. This creates a contradiction because while the reseller is granted a license to use trademarks, the absence of a clear definition makes it difficult to determine the scope and limitations of that license. Enforcement becomes uncertain as disputes may arise over what exactly the reseller is authorized to use. If the CHANNEL NOTIFICATION DOCUMENTS are not clear, this creates a issue.",

This section requires the reseller to complete both Sales and Technical Foundation training. By removing section 5.3, there is nothing backing educational requirements, as they can't 'maintain its status as a McDATA authorized Reseller' without knowing if a requirement is there.",

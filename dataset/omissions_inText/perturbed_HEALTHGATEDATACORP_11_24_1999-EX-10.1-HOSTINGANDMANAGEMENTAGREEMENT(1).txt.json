                "explanation": "By removing the specific service levels (prompt query handling, fault identification, software enhancements), but retaining the general commitment to \"meet Service Levels\", an in-text contradiction is created. The altered clause references a generic commitment, but the specifics defining it are gone, leading to disputes over the actual service standards HealthGate must adhere to. It creates inconsistency with other sections that might depend on the more explicit former clause.",

The altered clause references the payment based on 'Use', but there's no definition, nor it is restricted to 'downloads', leading to ambiguity.

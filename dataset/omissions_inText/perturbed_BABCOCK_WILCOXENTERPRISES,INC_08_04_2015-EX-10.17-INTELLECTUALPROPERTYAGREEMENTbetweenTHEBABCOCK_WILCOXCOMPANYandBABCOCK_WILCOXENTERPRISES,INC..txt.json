                "explanation": "By removing the definitions of Copyrights, Trademarks, Software and Domain Names, the contract now contains a contradiction. Later sections refer to these terms (e.g., Section 3.1 House Marks relies on the Trademark definition, Section 5.4 depends on software definition) but the core definition is now absent, leading to ambiguity in enforcement. This creates uncertainty about the scope and protection of these IP assets.",

                "explanation": "By removing the word 'Copyrights', although the definition of Intellectual Property in Section 1.1 has been modified, it can be argued that the 'Shared Library Materials' may still contain copyrighted material, creating a contradiction. There is no explicit statement that the Shared Library Materials no longer include any copyrighted materials. This might lead to legal disputes regarding the use and ownership of materials within the 'Shared Library Materials'.",

The core definition in section 1.1 no longer mentions these services, leaving it open to misinterpretation. This could contradict other sections of the contract that might assign responsibility for these government contracts elsewhere.",

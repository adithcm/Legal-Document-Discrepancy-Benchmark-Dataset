The supplies costs are a flat fee of $0.75 per prescription filled). Operating costs exclude the cost of space and utilities.",
                "changed_text": "Operations Expense means operating costs incurred in the operations of the Pharmacy. Operating costs exclude the cost of space and utilities.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Operations Expense' is now vague. The original definition included specific costs and limitations (e.g., liability insurance capped at $100/month, miscellaneous expenses capped at $250/month, and supply costs at $0.75 per prescription). By removing these specifics, the agreement now contradicts itself because later clauses rely on the detailed expense calculation. This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty in enforcement, making it difficult to calculate Net Income accurately.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Section 4.1 for profit calculation, the contract omits the primary method for determining profits. While it allows for mutually agreed-upon calculations, it eliminates the original baseline, potentially leading to disputes and making financial auditing unclear. This omission introduces uncertainty and makes enforcing the profit-sharing arrangements subjective and open to interpretation.",

ARBITRATION: Any dispute arising over the terms and conditions of this Agreement or in any manner relating to this Agreement which the parties are unable to resolve informally between themselves or by mediation shall be submitted, upon the motion of either party, to arbitration under the appropriate rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). All such arbitration proceedings shall be administered by the AAA and held in Dallas, Texas. The parties agree that the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding as to each of them. The AAA administrative fee shall be advanced by the party initiating the proceeding, but shall be subject to final apportionment by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's fee shall be shared equally by the parties. The arbitrator's award may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Prior to invoking arbitration, the parties will make a reasonable effort to settle any dispute in an informal and expeditious manner. The parties separately and specially agree that if either shall contend that this Agreement is invalid or that grounds exist for its rescission or cancellation, that any dispute concerning such contention shall be submitted to arbitration in the manner provided in this section. Each party shall bear such party's own attorneys' fees in any arbitration proceeding; however, if either party commences an action in court to compel arbitration, enforce an arbitration award, or otherwise seek by judicial means to secure compliance with the arbitration provisions of this Agreement, then the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing party the prevailing party's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit incurred for such purpose.",

Prior to invoking arbitration, the parties will make a reasonable effort to settle any dispute in an informal and expeditious manner.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific details about arbitration rules, AAA administration, location (Dallas, Texas), fee apportionment, and enforcement, this clause creates ambiguity. The agreement now references arbitration without defining the process, location, or rules governing it. This omission contradicts earlier statements about binding arbitration and enforcement, making the arbitration clause significantly weaker and harder to enforce. Section 9.7 (viii) still references arbitration in Orlando, Florida, compounding the confusion. ",

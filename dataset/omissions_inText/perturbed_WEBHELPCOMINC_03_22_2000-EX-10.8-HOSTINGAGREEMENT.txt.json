                "explanation": "By removing the specific credit calculation for Downtime (a, b), the revised clause still mentions service credits but provides no method for calculating the amount.

                "explanation": "By omitting 'Except in the event of termination for Customer's breach, eGain shall provide Customer with an electronic copy of the final Reports (covering the month just prior to termination of this Agreement).' It suggests that the customer does not have any right to receive any report regardless of the reason of the termination. This contradicts the standard business ethic when customer paid for the service. It also makes the following clause about eGain keeping those records contradicting in text as there would no longer be an 'exception'.",

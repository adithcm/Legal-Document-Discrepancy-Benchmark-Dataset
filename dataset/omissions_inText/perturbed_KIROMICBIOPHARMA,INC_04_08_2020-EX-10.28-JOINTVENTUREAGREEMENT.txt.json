                "explanation": "The original text specifies that Kiromic's funding is contingent on a successful IPO. The edited text removes this condition, instead stating Kiromic will work in collaboration with Molipharma to secure funding. By removing the explicit IPO trigger, while other sections might still reference it, the contract's enforceability becomes unclear, especially if the IPO fails. Further, the text now says Kiromic will work in collaboration with Molipharma to secure funding, giving rise for doubts on which party shoulders the biggest burden. Also, this can cause problems with the economic rights for each party if they are not clear.",

                "explanation": "The original text dictates ICC arbitration for disputes. The modified text removes this, stating disputes are 'subject to negotiation'. This creates a contradiction because the following sentence still refers to the 'ICC' deciding the merits of the matter after an emergency injunction. Thus, it is unclear if disputes go to ICC arbitration or are just negotiated. The clause continues to reference the ICC while removing the requirement to use it. This creates uncertainty in dispute resolution.",

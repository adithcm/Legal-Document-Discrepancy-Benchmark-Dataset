                "original_text": "1.5 After the Parties have agreed on the strategy for the marketing, sale and distribution of a Tranche, the Seller Trusts shall offer the Bank the right to serve as the lead left joint-book-running manager in connection with a best efforts distribution. GWG shall be entitled to appoint, in its discretion, an additional bank as joint book-running manager to participate in the distribution. The Seller Trusts further agree that in the event the Bank accepts such role it will be paid customary fees for the performance of its services in connection with such transactions and that such engagement will involve the execution of a standard form agreement with respect to the distribution of each Tranche, which may be in the form of a placement agency agreement, underwriting agreement or other appropriate agreement (each, a \"Distribution Agreement\"); provided, however, that nothing contained in this OMA or Engagement Letter shall require the Bank to underwrite or purchase all or any portion of a Tranche of Stock for its own account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the Bank or its affiliates may, solely at its discretion and without any obligation to do so, purchase Stock in any Tranche as principal.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 After the Parties have agreed on the strategy for the marketing, sale, and distribution of a Tranche, the Seller Trusts shall offer the Bank the opportunity to participate in the distribution. GWG may consider appointing another bank to participate in the distribution. The Seller Trusts agree that if the Bank participates, it will be paid fees for its services, and such engagement will involve an agreement regarding the distribution of each Tranche. The specifics of the distribution agreements will be subject to further negotiation and mutual consent of all parties involved.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the specific requirement for a 'best efforts distribution' and the 'lead left joint-book-running manager' role. It also removes the mention of 'customary fees' and a 'Distribution Agreement'. This creates ambiguity about the Bank's role and compensation, contradicting later sections that assume these are defined.",

The Engagement Letter shall provide that the Bank shall not be entitled to any compensation for its advice hereunder or reimbursement of its expenses in connection with this OMA and shall only be entitled to compensation in connection with an Offering as provided in the Engagement Letter and related Distribution Agreement with respect to such Offering.",
                "changed_text": "Section 2. Compensation. The Engagement Letter will address the compensation, if any, that the Bank may be entitled to. The specifics of this compensation are detailed within the Engagement Letter.",
                "explanation": "The section mentions 'the Engagement Letter', but it removes the clear statement that the bank 'shall only be entitled to compensation in connection with an Offering as provided in the Engagement Letter and related Distribution Agreement'. By removing this specific clause but keeping the reference to the 'Engagement Letter,' the modified text creates uncertainty, suggesting that compensation might be possible outside of what is outlined later in the 'Engagement Letter.'",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this OMA may be terminated with or without cause at any time after the Effective Date and without liability or continuing obligation by any of the Parties hereto (i) by mutual written agreement of all of the Parties; and (ii) in writing by the Trust Advisors in their sole discretion.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the specific expiration date based on the anniversary of the Effective Date or the sale of all shares. By removing the defined 'Term' but keeping the reference to 'goals outlined herein', the section becomes vague. Since Schedule A defines those goals, removing it while implying its relevance creates uncertainty about the contract's duration and enforcement.",

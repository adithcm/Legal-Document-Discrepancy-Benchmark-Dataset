Each Party may disclose information which would otherwise be confidential if and to the extent:   (i) required by the law of any relevant jurisdiction; (ii) the information has come into the public domain through no fault of that Party; or (iii) the other Party has given prior written approval to the disclosure, provided that any such information disclosed shall be disclosed only after consultation with and notice to the other Party.",

                "explanation": "By omitting clauses (ii) and (iii) concerning information entering the public domain and prior written approval, the modified text contradicts the potential for legitimate disclosures under the original agreement. It creates uncertainty regarding acceptable disclosure practices, particularly if a party inadvertently or legitimately discloses confidential information that later becomes public knowledge, or when HPIL ET has given prior written approval to the disclosure. The remaining text states that both parties should consider all info as strictly confidential, but then allows disclosure if the law requires it. It implies that those are the only conditions. Omitting (ii) and (iii) creates a contradiction that would make the agreement unenforceable.",

While 9.2 remains the same stating the indemnity is the sole remedy, it now has a unclear definition. It does not explicitly include attorney and accountant fees as part of these damages. This impacts the indemnification clause, creating uncertainty in enforcement if attorney or accountant fees are incurred. It causes a contradiction where GINARES is protected by the indemnity clause, but may not have legal fees covered.",

The indemnity clause no longer clearly covers legal fees. It implies indemnity is the only route, but makes the route much more difficult, which could cause HPIL ET to not use indemnity to try to recoup damages, when the section explicitly states it. It creates a loop that makes the agreement uncertain to enforce.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to California Business and Professions Code Sections 20000 through 20043 and the statement that California law will control, the modified text implies that the Master Franchise Agreement is the sole authority on franchise termination and non-renewal. This contradicts any implied clause in the agreement where it says that external laws will take precedence over this agreement.",

Prospective franchisees are encouraged to consult private legal counsel to determine the applicability of California and federal laws (such as Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281) to any provisions of a franchise agreement restricting venue to a forum outside the State of California.",

                "explanation": "Removing the word 'non-binding' creates ambiguity. Later, if another section says the agreement is fully compliant with California Law, but the binding agreement isn't, there will be confusion.",

                "explanation": "By removing references to California Corporation Code 31512 and Business and Professions Code 20010, the text removes the explicit protection against waiving rights under California law. This introduces an ambiguity if the master agreement has an implied 'Full compliance with CA state law' clause, but it says signing the release is mandatory.",

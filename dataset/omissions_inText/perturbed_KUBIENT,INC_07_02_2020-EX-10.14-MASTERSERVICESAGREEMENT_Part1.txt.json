                "original_text": "Unless specified otherwise in an Exhibit, Kubient shall be responsible for contracting with all advertisers, agencies, media buyers, and/or sponsors (collectively \"Advertisers\") on Customer's behalf, including Advertisers with whom Customer has existing relationships. Pursuant to the doctrine of sequential liability, payment from Kubient to Customer shall be made within seven (7) days from Kubient's receipt of payment, regardless of when Customer submits an invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant to the doctrine of sequential liability, payment from Kubient to Customer shall be made within a reasonable timeframe of Kubient's receipt of payment, regardless of when Customer submits an invoice.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific 'seven (7) days' timeframe, the modified text introduces uncertainty. While it still refers to 'sequential liability,' the absence of a defined payment period contradicts the need for financial clarity, creating ambiguity in enforcement. It opens to interpretation, and parties could disagree on what is reasonable.",

                "changed_text": "Recipient will protect the Confidential Information by using at least the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent unauthorized use, disclosure or publication.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific duration of 'one (1) year from the date of disclosure,' the modified text introduces uncertainty about how long the recipient is obligated to protect the confidential information, potentially creating conflict if, for example, the disclosing party assumes indefinite protection. This also creates uncertainty in enforcement, as it may be hard to determine if the party broke the confidentiality agreement when the timeframe is not specified.",

                "original_text": "Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof",
                "changed_text": "Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules', the modification leaves the specific procedure by which the arbitration will be governed uncertain. This weakens the clause by not giving parties a clear understanding of rules for arbitration and introduces ambiguities in enforcement. The initial agreement has clear rules, but now, the rule set is not defined in the contract.",

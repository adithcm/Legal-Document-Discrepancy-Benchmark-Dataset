                "explanation": "By removing 'including if the usage of the Brand is not in compliance with the standards and policies,' Section 4.2 no longer explicitly connects the Brand's usage to the termination clause. However, other sections (e.g., Section 3.1 on Quality Control) still emphasize the importance of maintaining the Brand's quality, potentially creating a contradiction. It becomes unclear whether a minor deviation from quality standards, not explicitly severe enough for 'any reason,' could trigger termination, thus creating uncertainty in enforcement. There is an inconsistency with 3.1 with states the usage needs to be consistent with Licensor's high standards, yet the Licensor can terminate at any time.",

                "explanation": "By limiting the 'Prior Written Approval' clause to 'new advertising campaign', the contract creates ambiguity. Section 3.1 states that the Licensee's Permitted Activity shall be consistent with Licensor's high standards of and reputation for quality. By narrowing the scope of 3.2, there is ambiguity if Licensee needs to have prior approval for all other uses of the Brand other than new advertising campaigns.",

While it still links termination to the advisory relationship, it's unclear which 'Advisor' and which 'agreement' is being referenced. Other sections, such as the preamble that references investment advisory services provided by Licensor, still imply a specific advisory relationship. The omission of who the Advisor is causes an internal contradiction.",

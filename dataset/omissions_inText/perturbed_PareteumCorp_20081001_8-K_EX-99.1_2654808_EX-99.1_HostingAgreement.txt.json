                "changed_text": "1.31 \"SLA\" means a general understanding of service expectations.",
                "explanation": "By changing the definition of \"SLA\" from a specific, attached 'Service Level Agreement' in Appendix 6 to a vague 'general understanding,' the contract now refers to a formal agreement that effectively doesn't exist in a defined format. This creates an internal contradiction when other sections refer to the SLA and its specific terms.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'as listed in Appendix 1,' this removes the clear definition of which hosting services are applicable. However, in section 3.1, it says 'T-Mobile shall provide the Hosting Services, as described in Appendix 1, during the term of this Agreement from the Ready for Service Date.' This is contradictory because Appendix 1 is now not explicitly tied to the definition, but is still used to describe the parameters of the Hosting Services.",

However, section 2.9 states that Parties acknowledge that Dutch telecommunications market is regulated under both Dutch and EU law. This introduces ambiguity because the specific guidelines for number portability are missing.",

                "original_text": "ARTICLE ONE DEFINITION\n\n1.1 Unless otherwise referenced herein, each of the terms used herein shall have the meaning ascribed to it below:\n\n(i) \"Affiliate\", with respect to any Party hereto, shall mean any legal person, non-legal person economic organization, or natural person,  which owns a controlling interest in, or which is controlling, controlled by or under common control with, such Party, directly or  indirectly.\n\nAs used in this Agreement, \"control\" means the power of any person to direct or cause the direction of management and policies  of another party on account of such person's ownership of equity interest, voting right, the right to appoint directors, by contract  or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "ARTICLE ONE DEFINITION\n\n1.1 Unless otherwise referenced herein, each of the terms used herein shall have the meaning ascribed to it below:\n\n(i) \"Affiliate\", with respect to any Party hereto, shall mean any organization related to a Party. The scope of affiliation will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "By removing the detailed definition of 'Affiliate' and 'control,' the agreement now has a vague definition. This omission creates uncertainty because the original clear definition is replaced with a subjective assessment of 'related to' and 'case-by-case basis', especially the calculation of fees and liabilities which hinges on the definition of 'Affiliate'.",

(\"Phoenix  Online\").\n\n4.2 The Parties may enter into a separate agreement and establish specific fee rates in respect of services beyond this Agreement in accordance  with the principles set forth herein.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Attachment 1 and the 'Agreement Between Phoenix Satellite TV and Phoenix New Media,' the service fee calculation is now undefined. This creates an internal contradiction if other clauses assume a fixed or readily determinable service fee, as it moves from a defined structure to a negotiated outcome.",

The Parties shall decide through consultation whether performance of this Agreement, in  whole or in part, shall be relieved or delayed to the extent affected by such event.

The Parties shall decide through consultation whether performance of this Agreement, in  whole or in part, shall be relieved or delayed to the extent affected by such event. With respect to economic losses sustained by either Party as a  result of such event, neither Party shall be liable therefor.",
                "explanation": "The modified clause omits the specific examples of 'force majeure' events (earthquake, typhoon, etc.) and the requirement for a detailed report and certification from a public notary. While the general concept of force majeure is retained, the specific criteria for claiming it are removed. This omission introduces ambiguity because it is now unclear what events qualify as force majeure, potentially leading to disputes over whether a particular event excuses a party's non-performance. Also the detailed report is removed so it opens to speculation about if it's legitmate or not.",

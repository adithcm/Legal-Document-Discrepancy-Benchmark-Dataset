                "original_text": "2. Confidentiality. \"Confidential Information\" means any proprietary information technical data, trade secrets or know-how, including, but not limited to, research and product plans, products, services, markets, developments, inventions, processes, formulas, technology, marketing, finances or other business information disclosed to Consultant by Company either directly or indirectly in writing, orally or otherwise. Confidential Information also includes all Inventions (as defined below) and any other information or materials generated in connection with the Services.",
                "changed_text": "2. Confidentiality. Consultant acknowledges a duty to protect proprietary information disclosed by the Company. The extent of this duty will be defined by common business practice.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly defines 'Confidential Information.' The modified clause removes this definition, referring instead to 'common business practice'. This creates uncertainty because 'common business practice' is vague and subject to interpretation, potentially conflicting with later sections that assume a specific definition of Confidential Information exists. This ambiguity makes enforcement difficult.",

Consultant hereby irrevocably assigns to Company all right, title and interest in and to any information (including, without limitation, business plans and/or business information), technology, know-how, materials, notes, records, designs, ideas, inventions, improvements, devices, developments, discoveries, compositions, trade secrets, processes, methods and/or techniques, whether or not patentable or copyrightable, that are conceived, reduced to practice or made by Consultant alone or jointly with others in the course of performing the Services or through the use of Confidential Information (collectively, 111nventions\").",
                "changed_text": "3. Ownership. Consultant assigns to Company ownership of materials directly resulting from the Services. The specifics of this assignment are outlined in Appendix B.",
                "explanation": "The original clause precisely defines what constitutes 'Inventions' and assigns ownership to the company. The revised clause removes this definition and refers to 'materials directly resulting from the Services,' a much broader and less defined term. It also references 'Appendix B', creating a contradiction if 'Appendix B' is either missing or doesn't adequately define the scope of 'materials'. This weakens the company's claim to intellectual property and makes enforcement problematic since what 'directly resulting' means is unclear. The omitted definition of 'Inventions' means materials that would have been Inventions are now ambiguous as to who owns them.",

This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will continue until termination as provided below.\n\nEither Consultant or Company may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice thereof to the other party.\n\nUpon termination of this Agreement, all rights and duties of the parties hereunder shall cease except:\n\nCompany shall be obliged to pay, within thirty (30) days after receipt of Consultant's final statement, all amounts owing to Consultant for unpaid Services completed by Consultant and related expenses, if any, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 hereof, and Sections 2, 3, S(c), 6, 7, 8 and 10 shall survive termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "5. Term and Termination. This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will continue until terminated. Either Consultant or Company may terminate this Agreement upon mutual agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement, all rights and duties of the parties hereunder shall cease except:\nCompany shall be obliged to pay, within thirty (30) days after receipt of Consultant's final statement, all amounts owing to Consultant for unpaid Services completed by Consultant and related expenses, if any, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 hereof, and Sections 2, 3, S(c), 6, 7, 8 and 10 shall survive termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original allows either party to terminate with written notice, which provides a clear and enforceable mechanism. The changed text requires 'mutual agreement' for termination, making it contradictory if either party wishes to terminate unilaterally and potentially conflicts with provisions that imply the agreement can be terminated (i.e. in the event of debarment under Section 7). Section 7 becomes unenforceable if termination depends on mutual agreement. Requiring mutual agreement when one party has breached Section 7 makes the agreement internally inconsistent and impacts how all sections work after a breach.",

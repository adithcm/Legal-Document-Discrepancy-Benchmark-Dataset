                "explanation": "The original text implies a collaborative maintenance and modification process between JRVS and the Distributor. The modified text removes the distributor from that process and states JRVS can change product specifications without notice. This omission introduces uncertainty in product specification agreements.",

JRVS shall have the right to revise JRVS Price at any time. Price changes shall apply to all purchase orders received after the effective date with the notice, except that any price increase shall be effective immediately upon notice to Distributor and apply to those accepted but undelivered orders.",

JRVS shall have the right to revise prices at any time. Price changes shall apply to all purchase orders without prior notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text provided specific conditions for price changes, including when they would take effect. The modified text removes these restrictions, giving JRVS greater latitude in changing prices with no prior notice, contradicting the expectation of informed consent. This omission makes payment obligations ambiguous.",

Without that statement, there is no written contractual denial of warranty from JRVS to the distributor. The omission of the middle statement conflicts directly with the statement made just before it.",

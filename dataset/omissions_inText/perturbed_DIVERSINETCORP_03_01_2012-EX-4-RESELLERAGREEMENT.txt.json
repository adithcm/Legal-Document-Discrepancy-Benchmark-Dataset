                "explanation": "By removing the payment schedule for the Annual Minimum Commitment (AMC), the contract implies that an AMC is required but provides no details on how much or when it should be paid.  This directly contradicts later sections that reference the AMC and assume a defined payment schedule (e.g., termination clauses related to AMC payment failure).",

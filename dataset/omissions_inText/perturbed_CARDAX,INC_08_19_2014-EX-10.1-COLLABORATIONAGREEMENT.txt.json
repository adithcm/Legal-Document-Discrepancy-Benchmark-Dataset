                "changed_text": "1.26 \"Specifications\" shall mean the Product description and attributes generally understood within the industry for similar products. The parties acknowledge that specific specifications may evolve over time.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines 'Specifications' as a concrete document (Exhibit B) to be created upon completion of the Development Plan. The modified text introduces ambiguity by defining 'Specifications' as a general industry understanding and indicates specifications can 'evolve', contradicting the expectation of a fixed, agreed-upon document, creating uncertainty in determining compliance and liability.",

Both CARDAX and CAPSUGEL will agree upon a development plan, which shall be in writing and attached hereto as Exhibit A (the \"Development Plan\"), which shall describe various parameters including each Party's duties, obligations, time schedule and deliverables schedule.",

The plan should outline general parameters including each Party's duties, obligations, time schedule and deliverables schedule.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Development Plan (Exhibit A) 'shall be in writing' and defines its content and parameters. The modified text replaces this definitive statement with 'may or may not be formalized in writing', which contradicts the explicit requirement for a written plan. This creates uncertainty about the formal requirements for the development process, affecting each party's obligations and enforcement of the contract.",

CARDAX shall have the right to audit CAPSUGEL's facilities, quality systems and records from time to time upon reasonable notice and CARDAX shall have the right to have a third party accounting firm, subject to a non-disclosure agreement, audit CAPSUGEL's financials as they relate to Net Sales and Adjusted Net Sales. In the event that the amount of the Royalty Payment for any quarter is 10% or more than the amount reported by CAPSUGEL, then CAPSUGEL will pay the costs and expenses of the audit or investigation.",
                "changed_text": "6.3 CARDAX Inspection. CARDAX may request access to certain information related to CAPSUGEL's facilities and quality systems with reasonable notice. However, any audit of CAPSUGEL's financials is subject to CAPSUGEL's prior approval.",
                "explanation": "The original clause grants CARDAX a clear right to audit CAPSUGEL's facilities, quality systems, records, and financials. It also specifies that CAPSUGEL will pay for the audit if discrepancies exceed 10%. The modified clause removes the explicit right to audit financials and subjects any such audit to CAPSUGEL's approval, contradicting the initial right granted. This introduces uncertainty about CARDAX's ability to verify financial information and enforce royalty payment terms, creating an internal contradiction and ambiguity.",

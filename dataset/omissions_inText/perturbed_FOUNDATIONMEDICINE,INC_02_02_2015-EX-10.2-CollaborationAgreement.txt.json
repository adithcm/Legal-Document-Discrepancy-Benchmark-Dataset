                "original_text": "1.36 FTE The term \"FTE\" shall mean a full-time equivalent person-year, based upon a total of no less than one thousand eight hundred (1,800) working hours per year, undertaken in connection with the conduct of research in a Work Stream. In no circumstance can the work of any given person exceed one (1) FTE.",
                "changed_text": "1.36 FTE The term \"FTE\" shall mean a measure of effort applied to a workstream. The specific calculation and limitations will be as defined by the Joint Management Committee.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of FTE provided a concrete number of hours (1,800) per year. The modified definition removes the specific hour commitment and defers to the JMC. Since this is a very important item for the payment section, it creates uncertainty. The modified definition contradicts the payment sections that reference the original FTE definition, creating an enforcement ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'including standards with respect to classes of alterations detected and sequencing sensitivity and specificity (based on tissue requirements); provided, however, the Performance Specifications for the Molecular Information Platform Program are attached hereto as Exhibit 1.57' the definition of what is considered a Performance Specifications is less specific. It is now unknown what specific standards there are, or where they are listed, creates uncertainty in how to measure performance, leading to potential disputes regarding compliance with the agreement.",

By removing this part of the definition, the contract does not specifically say what is considered 'necessary'. This makes the section extremely vague and unauditable. This omission introduces ambiguity and contradiction.",

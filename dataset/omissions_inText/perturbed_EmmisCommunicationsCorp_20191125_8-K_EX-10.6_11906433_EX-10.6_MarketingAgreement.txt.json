The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") will begin on the date hereof (the \"Commencement Date\"), and will continue until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2022, (ii) the termination or expiration of the Studio Lease (defined below), (iii) election to terminate and notice thereof given by Programmer to Licensee, and (iv) mutual written consent of Licensee and Programmer (the \"Term\"), unless extended or earlier terminated pursuant to Section 11 hereof. The term \"Studio Lease\" means that certain Lease dated as of February 23, 1996 of certain real estate located on the 7th Floor of an office building located at 395 Hudson St., New York, New York.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of \"Studio Lease,\" the contract creates ambiguity. Section 1 references \"Studio Lease\" as a condition for term termination, but the agreement no longer specifies what that term refers to, creating uncertainty regarding enforcement of this termination clause.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'and compliance with the political broadcast rules of the FCC' is removed from the first sentence of section 8.2. This creates an internal contradiction, as later sentences in section 8.2 still require Programmer's cooperation to comply with FCC rules, but the Licensee's 'ultimate responsibility' has been diminished in the beginning of the section, creating a conflict.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Trade Secrets' is comprehensive, covering a wide array of information. The modified definition is narrowed, potentially excluding types of information originally covered. This creates a contradiction if other sections rely on the original, broader definition. For example, if section 3.02(d) refers to 'all SpinCo Trade Secrets' but only some secrets now meet the definition, enforcement becomes uncertain.",

This creates a contradiction because later clauses (e.g., regarding sublicensing or limitations on use) now apply to a less well-defined set of intellectual property.

In the event that either Party, acting reasonably, forms the view that another Party has caused a material breach of the terms of this Agreement, then the Party that forms such a view shall serve written notice of the alleged breach on the other Parties and the Parties shall work together in good faith to resolve any such alleged breach within 12 Source: GARRETT MOTION INC., 8-K, 10/1/2018 Table of Contents thirty (30) days of such notice (a \"Dispute\").

                "explanation": "By removing the 'acting reasonably' and 'material breach' clauses, the new text enables parties to instigate dispute resolution even in case of negligible breaches, or even if they aren't acting rationally. This could result in numerous frivolous disputes. This contradicts the underlying principles of dispute resolutions, which is solving issues. Because the resolution can now be used for even a breach that is not 'material', this creates uncertainty.",

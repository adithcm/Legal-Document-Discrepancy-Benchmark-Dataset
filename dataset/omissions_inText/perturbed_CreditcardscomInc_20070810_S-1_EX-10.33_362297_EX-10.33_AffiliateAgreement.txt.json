Approved Account\n\nFor purposes of determining Affiliate's Commission, an \"Approved Account\" means any Chase credit card application that is: (i) submitted by any user who clicks on an e-mail, banner or any other advertising material from Affiliate's Website; (ii) is approved by Chase; and (iii) is reported as approved by Chase to Affiliate.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specifics of how an 'Approved Account' is generated (i.e., through affiliate links), the definition becomes vague. Later sections reference the tracking and proper formatting of affiliate links to receive commission (Section 8), creating a contradiction. The changed text only specifies approval, but does not say how it is submitted.",

Affiliate is responsible for obtaining prior written approval from the Chase Affiliate manager or Linkshare Network to link any or all other sites owned or managed by the Affiliate, other than the site that was approved at the time of original registration. Affiliate may select or remove Links, at any time without prior approval from Chase. Affiliate is also responsible for removing and/or informing Chase of potential inactive or misdirected Links. Affiliate agrees to cooperate with Chase in establishing and maintaining Links.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of 'Links' being provided by Linkshare NetworkTM and needing written approval for other sites, the agreement loses its core mechanism for tracking and attributing referrals. This omission conflicts with Section 8 (Tracking of Sales) which heavily relies on the functionality of those 'Links' for Affiliate commission, since this is now undefined, the requirement in Section 8 becomes unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'LinkShare affiliate interface' and 'sub-affiliate network' and the Appendix, the agreement becomes internally inconsistent. Section 6 (Links) references Linkshare. Section 3 specifies payment based on the network's private offer terms. However, the Affiliate Responsibilities section removes the restriction relating to Linkshare, rendering those sections vague.",

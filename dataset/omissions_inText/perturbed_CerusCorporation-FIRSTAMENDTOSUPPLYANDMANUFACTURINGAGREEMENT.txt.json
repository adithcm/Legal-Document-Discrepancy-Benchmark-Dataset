From time to time, Cerus may submit to Porex written work orders substantially in the form of Schedule 3 that specify development activities, engineering analysis, part, material and/or fixture design and development, or other services or activities that Cerus requests Porex to perform that are not activities or services that are necessary for the then-current manufacture and production of Components for Cerus under the Agreement (collectively, as defined in each work order, the \"Services\"). Each work order shall set forth the terms and conditions (including specifications (if applicable), delivery and performance schedules, and fees) pursuant to which Porex will perform the Services. Upon acceptance of a work order by Porex (in writing), such work order shall become a \"Statement of Work.\" If Porex begins to perform services under a work order that has not been formally agreed in writing, then Porex shall bear the costs of any expenses incurred prior to formal written agreement of the Statement of Work. Cerus hereby consents to Porex's use of the Cerus Dedicated Space and Equipment, as specified in a Statement of Work, solely as necessary to perform the Services under that Statement of Work. Such consent shall automatically terminate upon the completion of the applicable Statement of Work and is limited by the terms of the Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the Agreement and a Statement of Work, the Agreement shall control unless the Statement of Work expressly refers to the Parties' intent to alter the terms of the Agreement with respect to that Statement of Work and shall not be construed as an amendment to the terms of the Agreement.\"",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for written work orders substantially in the form of Schedule 3, the detailed specifications, delivery schedules, fees, and the need for Porex's written acceptance, and by stating that the work becomes a statement of work 'upon Porex beginning the work' regardless of a formal agreement, this change introduces ambiguity and contradiction. Schedule 3 is the 'FORM STATEMENT OF WORK'. The removal of the reference to this form, but the continued usage of the term 'Statement of Work', now lacks a definition. This would create uncertainty in enforcement.",

A new Section 1.5.3 shall be added to the Agreement as follows:\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Porex will invoice Cerus monthly for Services performed by Porex during the prior month. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due [*] days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex. Payment information, including Tax Identification Number will be included on each invoice.\n\nCerus shall have the right to accept or reject the Services, or any portion thereof, in writing within [*] days from Porex's completion of the Services. Such acceptance or rejection shall be consistent with the criteria set forth in the Statement of Work, if any. If Cerus does not reject in writing within [*] days, the Services shall be considered accepted by Cerus. Within [*] days of any notice of rejection, Porex shall present a corrective plan of action to Cerus. Upon approval by Cerus of the corrective plan, Porex, at no additional expense to Cerus, shall then make the corrections and, where applicable, Porex shall resubmit the corrected Services to Cerus. For disputed invoices or the disputed portion of an invoice, Cerus shall use reasonable efforts to provide to Porex, in writing, within [*] days, a description of the disputed amounts. Cerus and Porex shall negotiate in a timely, good faith manner to resolve billing queries. Cerus will not have responsibility to pay for identified errors, incomplete or inaccurate items (collectively the \"invoice errors\") which result in increases to previously invoiced amounts if the aforementioned invoice errors are communicated to Cerus later than [*] days from the original invoice date.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the specific payment terms ([*] days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice) and replacing it with 'payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due upon agreement', an ambiguity has been introduced. It is not clear what constitutes 'agreement' or when the fees are actually due. Furthermore, removing the timeframe for acceptance/rejection and the process for corrective action and resubmission complicates dispute resolution. The original text refers to the 'Statement of Work' as criteria for acceptance/rejection, but now that has been rendered ambiguous, causing potential for contradiction.",

                "explanation": "By removing SCHEDULE 3, which defines the FORM STATEMENT OF WORK referenced in Section 3a and Section 1.5.3, while those Sections still reference it, an internal contradiction has been created. Those sections rely on this schedule for defining key terms like 'Services', and outlining specific requirements for project scope, deliverables, and payment schedules. Without Schedule 3, the contract now lacks concrete guidance on defining the Statement of Work, leaving it open to interpretation. Section 3a and Section 1.5.3 reference and expect this schedule to exist, which it now does not. Additionally, the removal of 'In full consideration for Porex's timely and satisfactory performance of the Services, Porex will be compensated as follows:' removes the mention of how Porex is paid for services rendered and replaces it with a blank space.",

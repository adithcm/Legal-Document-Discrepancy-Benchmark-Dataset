                "explanation": "The definition of the 'Co-Branded Service' is changed. The clause that specifies that the service will contain translation and healing application services substantially similar to those currently offered and sold on the PlanetCAD Web site(s) as of the Effective Date under the product name 3Dshare.com, and based upon the CBD Software is removed. This is an issue because later in the contract in Section 7, PlanetCad is prohibited from offering competitive services, but without this clause, the scope of the 'Co-Branded service' is unclear. This omission could create enforcement issues, and may be grounds to sue PlanetCAD for unfair competition.",

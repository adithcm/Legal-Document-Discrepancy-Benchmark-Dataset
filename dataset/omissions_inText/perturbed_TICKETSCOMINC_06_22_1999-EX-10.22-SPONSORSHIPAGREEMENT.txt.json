                "explanation": "By removing the guaranteed minimum number of impressions (3,000,000), this clause now contradicts Section 5 (Measurement). Section 5 outlines a process for auditing and disputing the 'Count' of impressions. Without a minimum guaranteed number, the basis for auditing the count becomes ambiguous, making the enforcement of section 5 uncertain and contradicting the implicit baseline for measuring performance.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month,' the amount of the service fee for late payments is undefined. This contradicts the expectation of a specific penalty and creates uncertainty. The contract still mentions a service fee, implying a concrete amount, but no amount is specified. This creates ambiguity in enforcement and disputes.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'by more than five percent (5%)' from the condition for a refund, the agreement becomes ambiguous. The contract still allows for an audit and refund but doesn't specify the threshold for triggering the refund. This creates a contradiction as the contract seems to allow refunds for any overstatement no matter how small, making enforcement unpredictable. This contradicts section 2 as well.",

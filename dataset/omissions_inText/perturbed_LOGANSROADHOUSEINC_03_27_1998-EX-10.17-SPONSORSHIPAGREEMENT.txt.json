                "explanation": "By removing 'secondary, associate or contingent decal sponsor', Section 4, which grants SRP the right to obtain these sponsorships, now contradicts Section 1. This creates uncertainty about the extent of Logan's exclusivity and SRP's rights, as the definition of sponsorship levels is now inconsistent.",

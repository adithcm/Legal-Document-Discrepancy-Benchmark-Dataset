COFS hereby grants, leases and lets unto STW the right to explore for, drill for, produce, utilize, transport, and treat groundwater from the CRA only from beneath the surface of the property more specifically described in Exhibit \"A,\" which is attached hereto and fully incorporated into this AGREEMENT (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Property\"). STW is further authorized to drill, deepen, and/or rework at its expense the Existing CRA Well on Section 112 of the Property from its current depth of approximately 3,500 feet to approximately 4,000 feet, so as to determine the following to be verified by a study to be performed by a hydrogeologist mutually agreed upon by both Parties (\"Post-Well Study\"): (a) the gallons per day (\"GPD\") of maximum water capacity of the Existing CRA Well or alternate well, as may be required under Section 5 of the AGREEMENT; and (b) the quality of the water to be obtained from the Existing CRA Well or alternate well. The rights granted to STW under this AGREEMENT also include the right of access to the Property to perform the activities authorized herein.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the 'Post-Well Study' requirements in Section 1 creates an internal contradiction because Section 4 and 5 still reference and rely on the 'Post-Well Study' for determining water capacity and suitability, but the initial definition and requirements for it have been removed, making its enforcement ambiguous and uncertain.",

For purposes of this section, the Post-Well Study must show that the Existing CRA Well or Replacement CRA Well can produce CRA water at a minimum of 1,200 GPM or more or a combination of 1,200 GPM from one or more wells on the Property in order for STW to proceed with the obligations set forth in this section (\"Critical Criterion\").",

STW agrees to coordinate reasonably with COFS with respect to location of any new wells, roadways, power infrastructure, and other improvements that are to be constructed or used on the Property. COFS shall provide STW rent free site leases for the commercially reasonable amounts of surface area required for CRA pumping and filling stations located on the Property. STW shall pay for or repair all actual damages to roads, fences, or improvements caused by its activities on the Property within sixty (60) days of the occurrence, and will fill and level all pits, mounds, ruts, and shall restore the surface to as near its original condition as is reasonably practicable within ninety (90) days after termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT related only to the Property. Upon termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT related to the Property only, STW, or its successors or assigns, shall transfer title of all water conveyance pipelines from the Property to COFS. STW shall administer and provide all necessary and reasonable insurance to insure its activities on the Property in relation to the AGREEMENT and shall list COFS as additional insured.",

                "explanation": "The omission of the clause requiring STW to repair damages and restore the surface of the property after their activities creates a contradiction. While STW is still responsible for coordinating with COFS and providing insurance, their obligation to remediate damages is removed. This contradicts the implied expectation that STW's activities should not permanently degrade COFS' property, making enforcement ambiguous regarding the extent of STW's responsibility for environmental or property damage.",

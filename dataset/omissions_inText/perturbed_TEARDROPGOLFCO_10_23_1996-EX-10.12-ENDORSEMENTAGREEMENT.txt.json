                "explanation": "By limiting the definition of 'Ogle Endorsement' to only the endorsement and removing 'name, likeness, photograph', it creates ambiguity in other clauses where Ogle's likeness/photograph is explicitly mentioned (e.g., photograph shoots). 'Endorsed Product' is now ambiguous, its defintion is reduced to a product is distributed and sold, creating a possible in-text contradiction. Similarly, restricting 'Contract Territory' to the United States contradicts later sections that discuss 'International Tournament' and sales to Australia and New Zealand. Also, removing 'British Open' and 'PGA Championship' contradicts tournaments bonuses.",

No costs incurred by TPC in the manufacture, advertisement, promotion or exploitation of any Endorsed Product shall be deducted as a cost in calculating the net sales.' leads to internal inconsistencies. The section defines 'Net sales' as 'gross invoice price billed to customers'. Since TPC is obligated to pay a percentage, leaving out the deductions and other calculations in 'net sales' would create an unfair and an in-text contradiction. This impacts how to enforce the royalty payment because of the uncertainty in 'Net sales' formula",

                "explanation": "By omitting the detail about Ogle's 'continued use of the Endorsed Product, the continued use of the Ogle Endorsement and the termination of this Agreement,' the clause becomes extremely vague. Removing also 'Tournament Bonuses, Money List Bonuses and any Royalty Compensation earned by Consolidated Artists prior to the effective date of termination.' create ambiguities. Now, it doesn't specify if consolidated artists gets those bonuses in the case of termination. Enforcing this section becomes problematic due to the unspecified outcomes.",

For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Retail Revenues\" means the retail revenues actually received by Rogers for each authorized exhibition of a Licensed Program on the ROD Service, less GST and applicable sales tax. For greater certainty, Retail Revenues shall not include any fees payable to Rogers for: (i) the purchase, rental or installation of a digital terminal; (ii) any basic or premium television services; or (iii) digital cable access.",

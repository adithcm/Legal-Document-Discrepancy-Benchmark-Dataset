Other clauses referencing these dates now lack a clear definition, creating uncertainty about when and how the Joint Venture concludes, and the implications for share ownership.",

                "explanation": "By heavily summarizing the actions requiring unanimous board approval, specific safeguards and controls are removed.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Put Option is the right of AFSL/FSL, and AFSL/FSL is not obliged to exercise the Put Option.\n9.1.6 Completion of the sale and purchase of the Put Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Put Option by AFSL/FSL shall take place on the date specified in the Put Exercise Notice (which shall be a date after at least sixty (60) days from the date of the Put Exercise Notice) (the \"Put Closing Date\") and on which date: (i) TPH-A shall, or shall cause its designees to, and TPH shall cause TPH-A or TPH-A's designees to, pay to AFSL the Put Option Price for the Put Shares by way of a bank transfer to the bank account as separately designated by AFSL; and (ii) in exchange for which, AFSL shall deliver to TPH-A or its designees duly executed a letter of request to enter in the shareholder register of the Company the information that is required to be registered with regard to the Put Shares; and\n9.1.7 AFSL and TPH-A shall cause the Board to approve the share transfer of the Put Shares on or prior to the Put Closing Date.",

                "explanation": "By replacing the detailed 'Put Option' clause with a vague right to 'discuss potential share transfers,' the contract removes any enforceable mechanism for AFSL/FSL to require TPH/TPH-A to purchase their shares. Clauses referencing the Put Option Price, Put Closing Date, and specific obligations related to the Put Option are now essentially meaningless because the fundamental right to trigger the sale has been removed. This creates a contradiction: The contract still mentions these elements but provides no way to enforce them.",

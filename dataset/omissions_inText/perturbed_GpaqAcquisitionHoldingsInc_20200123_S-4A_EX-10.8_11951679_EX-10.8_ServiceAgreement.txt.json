NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises herein contained, the Parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE 1\n\nSUPPLY OF PRODUCTS & SERVICES 1.1 Sale of Products & Services. (a) The HOF Entities shall consult with Constellation to develop a comprehensive energy strategy with respect to the Products & Services listing in Exhibit A, which reflects sustainable product solutions, competitive market pricing (incorporating completion of the Supplier Component Questionnaire in the form of Exhibit B hereof for the applicable HOF Entity or affiliate), periodic reporting and analytics, regulatory/market intelligence and infrastructure services and equipment.",

                "explanation": "By removing the references to Exhibit A and Exhibit B in this section, while keeping other references to Products & Services, we introduce ambiguity. The contract mentions \"Products & Services\" but removes the specific list defining them, creating an internal contradiction and making enforcement of supply obligations uncertain.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"as stated in the applicable Second Level Agreement\" from the definition of 'Warranty', the contract becomes unclear on where to find the specifics of the warranty. This creates uncertainty because the contract refers to a 'standard warranty' without defining where this warranty is actually described, potentially leading to disputes about its terms.",

Annual Activation Funds are to be used in each calendar year. Unused funds are not rolled into future contract years.

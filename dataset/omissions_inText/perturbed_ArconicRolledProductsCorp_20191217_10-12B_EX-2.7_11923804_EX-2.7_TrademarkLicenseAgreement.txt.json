                "original_text": "1.5 Quality Control, Licensor Approvals. Licensor, as owner of the Licensed Mark, shall have the right at all times to control and approve the nature and quality of the Licensed Products (and the Licensed Mark thereon), and to inspect Licensee's business operations upon reasonable prior notice for the purpose of ensuring that a high level of quality of the Licensed Products is being maintained by Licensee. At Licensor's reasonable request during each calendar year, Licensee shall submit samples to Licensor, at no cost to Licensor, and shall not materially depart therefrom without Licensor's prior express written consent. The Licensed Products, as well as all promotional, packaging and advertising material relative thereto, shall include all appropriate legal notices as required by Licensor. No more frequently than once per year, a third party auditor chosen by Licensor and approved by Licensee, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, shall be entitled at any time on reasonable notice to the Licensee to enter, during regular business hours, any premises used by the Licensee or its manufacturers for the manufacture, packaging or storage of the Licensed Products, to inspect such premises, all plant, workforce and machinery used for manufacture, packaging or storage of Licensed Products and all other aspects of the manufacture, packaging and storage of Licensed Products (\"Access Rights\"). Prior to exercising such Access Rights, the third party auditor shall enter into a nondisclosure agreement with Licensee that, among other terms deemed acceptable by Licensee and such third party auditor, shall: (a) limit the content of any report made by the third party auditor to Licensor to a description of the manner in which, and the conditions under which, the Licensed Mark are used by Licensee or its manufacturers; and (b) prevent the disclosure of any of Licensee's trade secrets and/or Confidential Information. To the extent reasonably practicable, all Licensed Products shall include notices on labeling and packaging for the Licensed Products stating that the Licensed Mark is owned by Licensor and used by Licensee under license from Licensor. The Licensed Products shall be of a quality commensurate with previous production or the samples approved by Licensor. If the quality of a class of the Licensed Products falls below such standards, Licensee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to restore such quality. In the event that Licensee has not taken appropriate steps to restore such quality within one-hundred twenty (120) days after notification by Licensor, Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 Quality Control, Licensor Approvals. Licensor, as owner of the Licensed Mark, shall have the general right to oversee the Licensed Products. The Licensed Products, as well as all promotional, packaging and advertising material relative thereto, shall include all appropriate legal notices as required by Licensor. To the extent reasonably practicable, all Licensed Products shall include notices on labeling and packaging for the Licensed Products stating that the Licensed Mark is owned by Licensor and used by Licensee under license from Licensor. The Licensed Products should be of reasonable quality. If the quality of a class of the Licensed Products falls below reasonable standards, Licensee should use reasonable efforts to improve such quality.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific details regarding Licensor's approval rights, sample submission requirements, third-party audits, and the specific process for addressing quality control issues, and replacing it with vague statements such as 'general right to oversee,' 'reasonable quality,' and 'should use reasonable efforts', the contract creates uncertainty regarding the enforcement of quality standards.  The removal of the defined 'Access Rights' and the auditor NDA requirements means that the later mentions of the licensee following legal notices for the licensed products create ambiguity, since there are no established standards by which quality or compliance can be verified by Licensor.",

Licensor and Licensee will be entitled to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the event the other party is in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder and shall fail to remedy any such default within one hundred twenty (120) days after notice thereof by the non-breaching party.",

Licensor and Licensee may terminate this Agreement with notification.",
                "explanation": "By removing the time periods set forth in Schedules 1 and 2, the contract introduces ambiguity regarding the duration of the license.  Changing 'will be entitled to terminate...in the event the other party is in material breach...and shall fail to remedy any such default within one hundred twenty (120) days' to 'may terminate this Agreement with notification' creates a contradiction. This change implies that either party can terminate the agreement at any time for any reason with a simple notification, negating the need for a 'material breach' and the 120-day cure period, which will be expected in schedules 1 and 2.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such consent of Licensor is required under this Agreement in the event of a Change of Control of Licensee so long as: (a) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person assumes all the obligations of the Licensee by operation of Law or pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Licensor; and (b) the licenses granted herein shall not be transferrable or sublicensable to Affiliates of such Person unless such Affiliates were Affiliates of Licensee prior to such Change of Control.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement may not be assigned, creating a condition that it requires consent to assignment. The term 'Notwithstanding the foregoing' means that it goes against everything previously stated, therefore the sentence 'This Agreement is transferrable' contradicts the beginning and creates uncertainty regarding the conditions under which the agreement can or can't be assigned.",

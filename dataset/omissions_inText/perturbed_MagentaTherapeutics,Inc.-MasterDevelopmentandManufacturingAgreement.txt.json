The Parties recognize that specifications for Product for a specific Project Plan are likely to change during the term of this Agreement, and the Parties agree to act in good faith and reasonably to effect such changes as may be required. Copies of such Specifications, as amended, shall be maintained by both Parties, and shall be incorporated into this Agreement and the Quality Agreement (as defined below).",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Applicable Laws, master batch record, current standard operating procedures and other attributes, the definition of 'Specifications' becomes vague and unilaterally controlled by Bachem.

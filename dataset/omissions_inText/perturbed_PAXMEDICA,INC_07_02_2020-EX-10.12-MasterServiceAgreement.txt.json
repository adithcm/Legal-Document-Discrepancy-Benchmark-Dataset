Confidential Page 1 of 7 Initials: CL MD Version Jan16_v1\n\n\n\nCertain identified information has been excluded because it is both not material and would likely cause competitive harm if publicly disclosed. 2.2 Routine telephone calls, mobile calls, faxes and photocopying will be included in the rate provided by CRO.

                "explanation": "By removing 'as agreed in each Project-specific Addendum' from 2.1, and modifying 2.2 and 2.4, we introduce ambiguity regarding payment terms. The removal of the Addendum reference from 2.1 creates uncertainty. Changing 'there shall be no payment obligations other than as agreed in each Project-specific Addendum' to 'all payment obligations will be determined at Client's discretion' and changing 'payable within 30 days of receipt of invoice by Client' to 'will be payable within 90 days of invoice approval by Client' in 2.4 contradict the initial intention of clearly defined, mutually agreed payment terms, potentially harming CRO.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days written notice if the other materially breaches this Agreement; provided, however that the party in breach shall have the right to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of the other party's intention to terminate. 4.2. Client may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days written notice without cause. In the event of termination by Client for reasons other than default by CRO, Client shall pay all sums owing to CRO, but unpaid, for work performed to date of receipt of termination notice, and all reasonable and necessary costs associated with the termination itself or to which CRO is committed to pay.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'all reasonable and necessary costs associated with the termination itself or to which CRO is committed to pay' from 4.2, and shortening to 'Client shall only be liable for work completed up to the date of the termination notice' , the contract now contradicts itself. The prior text suggests CRO will receive reasonable costs, while the latter limits it, potentially leaving CRO with significant uncovered expenses it had planned for, causing financial harm and uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "original_text": "5.4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each party's total liability in respect of damages under this Agreement, any regulation or common law shall be limited to the sum of all amounts received from Client in terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply with respect to any claims arising out of or relating to clause 6 (Inventions and Proprietary Information), indemnification obligations or damages arising from a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. 5.5. Neither Party shall be liable to the other Party in respect of any indirect loses or damaged, pure economic nature, loss of profits or income howsoever arising. 5.6. CRO will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Client and its directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) arising from any third party claim, action or lawsuit or other proceeding which is attributable to any negligent or willful act or omission or breach of this Agreement on the part of CRO or any of its agents or employees in the course of performing CRO's obligations hereunder.",

The removal of the exceptions from 5.4 now contradicts 5.6, which assumes some form of defense/indemnification. This ambiguity introduces uncertainty about the extent of CRO's liability for damages stemming from IP infringement, gross negligence or willful misconduct. This limits the Client's protections against potential significant liability. By modifying 5.6, we remove the specification of expenses and liabilities covered under the indemnification, leaving room for misinterpretation during enforcement.",

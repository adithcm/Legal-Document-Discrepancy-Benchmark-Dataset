At least one meeting per year will be conducted in person or by videoconference (including the kick-off meeting), with the location alternating between a site a selected by LBIO and a site selected by MD Anderson. LBIO will choose the location of the first such in-person meeting. Subject to Section 1.4 below, the JSC will decide on matters by unanimous vote; provided, however, that no action may lawfully be taken at any meeting unless at least two members from each Party (including for this purpose any proxy member appointed as provided below) are present at the meeting. If a member of the JSC is unable to attend a meeting, he or she may appoint, in writing, a proxy to participate and vote in his or her stead.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the 'at least quarterly' clause creates ambiguity. Later sections might rely on the assumption of regular meetings, and removing the frequency makes enforcement of coordinated research activities less certain. Removing the in person meeting requirements removes important face to face interaction requirements which could impact collaboration. ",

LBIO agrees to commit funding in an amount not to exceed $14,211,864.00 for the performance of the Studies during the Term (collectively, \"Initial Funding\"), with the Initial Funding specifically allocated as follows: (a) $[* * *] for an upfront payment, and a minimum of $[* * *] for enrollment and treatment of a minimum of 40 patients in the Study described in Exhibit I (i.e., the Minimum Enrollment Target as defined in Exhibit 1) or up to $[* * *] (an \"Individual Study Budget\") for enrollment and treatment of up to 60 patients in the Study described in Exhibit I (i.e., the Maximum Enrollment Target as defined in Exhibit 1); (b) $[* * *] (which shall also be considered an Individual Study Budget) for enrollment, manufacturing of product, and treatment of 30 patients in the Study described in Exhibit II; and (c) $[* * *] for the Study described in Exhibit III. LBIO shall pay the Initial Funding in accordance with Section 4.3. For clarity, the Initial Funding is Collaboration Funding. MD Anderson agrees that all costs of this Collaboration, with the sole exceptions of any costs to supply clinical-grade aldesleukin and 4-1BB agonist for use in the expansion of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (\"TILs\"), and in the case of aldesleukin, for use in the treatment of patients, are included in the Initial Funding.

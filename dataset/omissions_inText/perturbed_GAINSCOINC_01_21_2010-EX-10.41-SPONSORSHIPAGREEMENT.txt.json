Subject to payment by the Sponsor of the sponsorship fee provided for herein, during the term of this  Agreement Racing shall cause the Racing Team to provide for the Sponsor's benefit all of the benefits customarily associated with the  sponsorship of a Daytona Prototype Series racing team and consistent with the benefits provided to the Sponsor in 2005 - 2009 (individually, a  \"Benefit,\" and collectively, the \"Benefits\"), including but not limited to the following:   (i) displaying prominent identification of the Sponsor's name and/or logo in signage on the race car and racing suits and, where  appropriate, on other team equipment (subject to approval by the Sponsor);   (ii) making available for the use of the Sponsor (x) the personalities associated with the Racing Team, including without limitation  the name, voice, picture, portrait, likeness, persona and/or signature of each driver for endorsements, commercial advertising and  promotions in any and all media throughout the world during the term of this Agreement, (y) the Racing Team's home base facilities in  Texas, and (z) those facilities designated or assigned for the use of the Racing Team at each race and race location at which the Racing  Team actually participates in the race, all for appropriate public relations and other promotional and marketing purposes. Racing agrees  that it will actively participate in the Rolex 24 at Daytona in January, 2010. As it concerns (y) and (z) above, access shall be subject to  appropriate security and safety restrictions designated by the applicable racing location and the Racing Team;",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific details of the 'Benefits' and replacing it with 'certain benefits', it creates uncertainty regarding the actual deliverables from Racing. If other sections refer to specific benefits, there will now be a contradiction. For instance, this now contradicts section 6, which assumes Sponsor has right to receive 'the benefits'.",

Racing represents to the Sponsor that the Sponsor's aggregate obligation hereunder  will not exceed the amount of the sponsorship fee set forth in Section 3 hereof (or such lesser amount as is payable by the Sponsor in the event  that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 14 hereof), plus, if applicable, collection costs that may be reasonably incurred by Racing in  a legal proceeding to collect all or any part thereof (the \"Maximum Obligation\"). Racing agrees to indemnify the Sponsor and its officers, directors,  agents and employees and to hold them harmless from any loss, claim, cost, damage or liability in excess of the Maximum Obligation which (i) the  Sponsor shall incur as a result of this Agreement, or (ii) arises from any failure by Racing to perform any of its obligations hereunder.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of 'Maximum Obligation', and what it entails, it creates ambiguity in the indemnification clause. The indemnification extends to any loss exceeding 'Maximum Obligation,' but that term is now undefined within the indemnification context, leading to a potential contradiction between limiting the Sponsor's obligations and providing a comprehensive indemnity without a capped amount. This also contradicts the initial statement.",

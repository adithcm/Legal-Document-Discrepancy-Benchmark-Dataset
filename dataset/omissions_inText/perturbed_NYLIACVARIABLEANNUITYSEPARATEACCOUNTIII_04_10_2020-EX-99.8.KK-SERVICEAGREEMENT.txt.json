In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC, FIIOC agrees to pay Company a quarterly fee computed as follows:\n\nAt the close of each calendar quarter, FIIOC will determine the Average Daily Assets held in the Funds by the Company. Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter divided by the number of calendar days in the quarter. The Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that sum shall be divided by four. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for that quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month.\n\nShould any Participation Agreement(s) between Company and any Fund(s) be terminated effective before the last day of a quarter, Company shall be entitled to a fee for that portion of the quarter during which the Participation Agreement was still in effect, unless such termination is due to misconduct on the part of the Company. For such a stub quarter, Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter through and including the date of termination of the Participation Agreement(s), divided by the number of calendar days in that quarter for which the Participation Agreement was in effect. Such Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that number shall be multiplied by the number of days in such quarter that the Participation Agreement was in effect, then divided by three hundred sixty-five. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for the stub quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, compensation for each calendar quarter will not exceed [ ].",

In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC, FIIOC agrees to pay Company a quarterly fee. The specific calculation of this fee will be determined and agreed upon by both parties at the end of each quarter. This fee shall be paid to the Company during the following month.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, compensation for each calendar quarter will not exceed [ ].",
                "explanation": "By removing the detailed calculation method, the modified text creates ambiguity. It states a quarterly fee will be paid but provides no fixed formula. The phrase 'determined and agreed upon' introduces uncertainty. This contradicts the 'Recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC' part of the original section, as without a concrete fee, the 'recognition' is meaningless and unenforceable. Moreover, the original formula being removed can cause disagreements between both parties.",

FIIOC agrees to provide to Company, on a periodic basis, directly or through a designee, information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc. The content and format of such information shall be as FIIOC, in its sole discretion, shall choose. FIIOC may change the format and/or content of such informational reports, and the frequency with which such information is provided. For purposes of Section 4.2 of each of the Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, FIIOC represents that it is the designee of the Funds, and Company may therefore use the information provided by FIIOC without seeking additional permission from the Funds.",

                "explanation": "The omission of 'investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc.' creates a contradiction. The original text specifies the *type* of information FIIOC will provide. The changed text only states 'information about the Funds as FIIOC deems necessary.' If Section 2 states the company can provide the original type of information but that information is not provided anymore, the enforcement will be ambiguous because the ability to use information as part of larger sales pieces is now voided.",

                "explanation": "By removing the conditions under which FIIOC can immediately terminate the agreement (applicable law/regulation, Board of Trustees action, material breach), the remaining text creates a contradiction. While it retains the company's right to terminate and the automatic termination upon cessation of the Participation Agreement, the lack of FIIOC's ability to terminate immediately under certain conditions could violate implied duties. The implied duty of good faith and fair dealing suggests that both parties act reasonably. For example, the lack of a breach-related termination creates a contradiction if the agreement contains clauses on compliance and remedies for breach.",

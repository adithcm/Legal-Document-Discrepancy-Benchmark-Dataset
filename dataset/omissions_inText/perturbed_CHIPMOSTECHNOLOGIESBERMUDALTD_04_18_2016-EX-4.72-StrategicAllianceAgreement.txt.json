                "original_text": "1.1 Content of Strategic Alliance and Expected Benefits After the Closing Date (as defined in the Share Subscription Agreement), Tsinghua Unigroup and ChipMOS shall cooperate, expand, strengthen and stabilize the relationship with the related upstream, midstream, and downstream industries engaged in the assembly and testing services of LCD drivers, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), the Internet of Things (IoT) and Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) and/or wafer bumping services in Mainland China. Tsinghua Unigroup shall also introduce other potential suppliers, customers and business partners in Mainland China to ChipMOS.",

                "explanation": "This change omits the specific industries that the strategic alliance will focus on (LCD drivers, MEMS, IoT, RFIC, wafer bumping). However, section 1.2 (2)(b) refers to 'LCD driver and Specialty Memory IC assembly and testing services and/or wafer bumping services markets'. This creates a contradiction: 1.1 is now very general, while 1.2(2)(b) is specific. This makes it unclear if the alliance covers only those specific services or has a broader scope, creating enforcement uncertainty.",

The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (\"Dispute Notice\") to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall each select one (1) arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. All language used in such proceedings shall be Mandarin Chinese. The Parties agree to keep the content of the dispute and the proceeding of the arbitration confidential. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney's fees).",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a detailed arbitration process in Hong Kong, with ICC rules, three arbitrators, Mandarin Chinese language, confidentiality, and cost allocation. The modified clause removes nearly all details of the arbitration process. By omitting the arbitration specifics (location, rules, number of arbitrators, language, cost allocation), while still referencing the 'arbitration award,' the contract becomes contradictory. It implies arbitration will occur but provides no mechanism for it, leading to uncertainty on how to enforce dispute resolution.",

However, the foregoing restriction shall not apply to disclosure made to the board of the directors, management team, and relevant employees who need to know such information, attorneys, accountants, financial counsel, and competent authorities for the purposes of performing this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The omission removes the specific exceptions to confidentiality, namely disclosures to the board of directors, management team, relevant employees, attorneys, accountants, and financial counsel. This creates a contradiction: while the agreement states confidentiality, it no longer outlines who is exempt. This makes it ambiguous who can know about the agreement, potentially hindering the ability of ChipMOS and Tsinghua Unigroup to properly implement it internally, while section 3.11 still mention making an announcement to the public pursuant to the laws and the content thereof.",

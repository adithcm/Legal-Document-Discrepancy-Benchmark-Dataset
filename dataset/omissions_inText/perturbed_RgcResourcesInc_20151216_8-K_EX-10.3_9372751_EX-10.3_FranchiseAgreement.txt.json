It is understood that Grantee has or will enter into franchise agreements with the City of Roanoke (\"Roanoke\") and the City of Salem (\"Salem\") and the Town of Vinton (\"Vinton\") (Grantor, Roanoke and Salem being hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the \"localities\" and singularly as a \"locality\") with fee provisions identical to this one, and that the total annual Franchise Fee to be paid to the three localities in aggregate is $98,196 for calendar year 2016 (\"base year total annual Franchise Fee\"). Grantor's Franchise Fee shall be a percentage share of the base year total annual Franchise Fee, which shall be determined on a pro rata basis according to its percentage share of the total dollar value of Grantee's gas sales occurring within the localities during the calendar year. For each calendar year of the Franchise, each locality's percentage share shall be determined by the following formula:\n\ntotal dollar value of Grantee's gas sales within Locality's percentage share = the Territorial Limits of the locality total dollar value of Grantee's gas sales in the three localities\n\nFor calendar year 2016, the Franchise Fee shall be paid to Grantor on or before March 31, 2017.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the formula and the detail regarding the 'base year total annual Franchise Fee', the contract now states that a Franchise Fee will be paid, but removes the precise calculation method. This creates an internal contradiction, because while the obligation to pay remains, the means of determining the amount owed is gone, leading to uncertainty in enforcement. The original sentence specifying that agreements are identical is still present, yet the most important fee calculation clauses are absent.",

For each calendar year during the term of this Franchise, Grantor's percentage share shall be determined pursuant to this Section, and paid to Grantor on or before March 31 of the succeeding calendar year.",

For each calendar year during the term of this Franchise, Grantor's percentage share shall be paid to Grantor on or before March 31 of the succeeding calendar year.",
                "explanation": "By changing the method to determine the fee to a 'mutual agreement' the contract now contradicts its earlier, albeit incomplete, specification of a franchise fee calculation in the unmodified portions of 3(a). It introduces uncertainty and potential disputes, since there's no defined fallback if mutual agreement can't be reached. This contrasts with the original intent of having a fixed, calculable fee which is now removed.",

                "changed_text": "4. BUSINESS OFFICE. Grantee shall during the term of this Franchise maintain a presence within the Territorial Limits of Grantor. Such presence should accommodate the conduct of business between Grantee and its customers.",
                "explanation": "The change from a required 'business office open at least forty (40) hours per week' to a more ambiguous 'presence should accommodate' creates an internal contradiction. While the contract still stipulates that the Grantee maintain a 'presence', the concrete and enforceable requirement of a functional business office with specific hours is removed. This weakens the Grantor's ability to ensure accessibility for its residents.",

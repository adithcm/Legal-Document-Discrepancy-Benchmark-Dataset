                "original_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, \"Termination for Cause\" shall mean termination of this Agreement by the Company as the result of: (i) any act of fraud, dishonesty or neglect of services by CONSULTANT in connection with the services to be provided under this Agreement or against any Company customer, vendor or affiliated company; or (ii) the breach or prospective breach of any provision of this Agreement by CONSULTANT.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"neglect of services\" and \"breach or prospective breach of any provision of this Agreement\" from the definition of \"Termination for Cause\", the contract creates ambiguity. If CONSULTANT neglects services, it's unclear if this is grounds for termination, potentially contradicting other sections that require timely and professional service, creating uncertainty in enforcement. This is because the original definition stated that a breach of any provision was grounds for termination, but this has been removed from the definition.",

                "explanation": "Removing \"including any tenants of the Company's properties, (or was invested in real estate owned by the Company), within the last twelve (12) months of its consultancy with the Company\" from the customer definition creates ambiguity in Section 7.2. It is no longer clear if restrictions on soliciting customers apply to tenants of the Company's properties or customers the Consultant has not had contact with in the last 12 months, even though the solicitation of customers is still restricted. This contradicts the broader intent of restricting contact with anyone who was a customer in the past year.",

Now, the CEO or Board can assign duties that are not consistent with the bylaws of REIT. This omission could be perceived as inconsistent with the overall intent to have CONSULTANT manage the affairs of the Company.",

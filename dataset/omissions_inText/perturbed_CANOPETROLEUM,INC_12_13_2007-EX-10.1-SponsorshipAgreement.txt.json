Any notice provided for under the terms of this Agreement by either party to the other shall be in writing and may be effected by  personal delivery in writing or registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. Notice to Boyd shall be sufficient if made or addressed  to 2003 Navasota Cove, Westlake, Texas 76092. Notice to Cano shall be sufficient if made or addressed to Cano Petroleum, Inc., 801 Cherry  Street, Suite 3200,  Fort Worth, Texas 76102. Each party may change the address at which notice may be sent to that party by giving notice  of such change to the other party in accordance with the provisions of this Paragraph.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specifics of how notice can be delivered and the addresses where notice must be sent, this creates ambiguity. While it states notice must be in writing, the removal of 'personal delivery in writing or registered or certified mail, return receipt requested' makes it unclear if electronic notice is acceptable. The omission of the addresses creates a contradiction as other sections may assume the original addresses are still valid.",

In consideration of the services to be rendered under this Agreement as set forth above, the Company shall be  entitled to compensation in the amount of $150,000.00 (One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars), to be paid in equal installments of $37,500.00  (Thirty Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars) on January 1, 2008, April 1, 2008, July 1, 2008 and October 1, 2008. If Cano fails to make any  payment when required by this Agreement, the Company shall have the option of canceling this Agreement following the passage of ten  (10) days after having given Cano written notice of its default. While the Company shall have no further obligation to Cano following  cancellation of the Agreement, Cano shall remain liable for all unpaid installments for the then current term of the Agreement, which  installments shall be immediately due and payable.",

While the Company shall have no further obligation to Cano following  cancellation of the Agreement, Cano shall remain liable for all unpaid installments.",
                "explanation": "The omission of the compensation amount and the installment schedule creates a fundamental contradiction. The clause still discusses 'payment', 'installments', and 'compensation', but the contract now fails to define what amount is to be paid, or when payment is due, rendering the payment terms unenforceable. There may be another section referencing compensation or payment obligations based on these defined terms.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'up to 6 feet × 10 feet', the contract now implies Cano can place any size signage, which may be a violation of the appearances venues requirements and/or building codes. Some other section(s) of the contract might reference or rely on defined limitations for display size; by removing this restriction, we introduce contradiction and ambiguity regarding this term.",

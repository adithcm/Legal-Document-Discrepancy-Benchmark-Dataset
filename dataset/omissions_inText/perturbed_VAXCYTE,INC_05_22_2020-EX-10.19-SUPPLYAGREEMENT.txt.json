The COA/COC acceptance criteria for each Product shall be set forth in the Specification for such Product. Two of the tests and corresponding COA/COC acceptance criteria for the Extract shall be the performance of a productivity (Activity) test of the applicable Sutro protein (the \"Sutro Activity Test\" and \"Sutro Activity Criteria\") and the performance of a productivity (activity) test of the applicable Vaccine Composition (the \"SutroVax Activity Test\" and \"SutroVax Activity Criteria\"). Sutro shall perform the Sutro Activity Test to confirm that all shipments of Extract meet the Sutro Activity Criteria and SutroVax (or its designee) shall perform the SutroVax Activity Test to confirm that all shipments of Extract meet the SutroVax Activity Criteria. Sutro will also provide SutroVax with Material Safety Data Sheets (\"MSDS\") or an equivalent instrument recognized by the applicable Regulatory Authority as required for the Product(s), and updates of the same as necessary.",

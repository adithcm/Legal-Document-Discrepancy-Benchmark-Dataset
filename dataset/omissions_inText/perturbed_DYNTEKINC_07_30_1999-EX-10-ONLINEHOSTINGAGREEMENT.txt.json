In the event that Diplomat terminates this Agreement other than in accordance with Section 3, Diplomat shall be obligated to pay for the Services in accordance with the fee schedule contained on EXHIBIT A throughout the balance of the Period (as hereinafter defined) as though Tadeo continued to provide the terminated Services through the balance of the Period. Late payments shall accrue interest at a rate equal to fifteen (15%) percent per annum.",

Late payments shall accrue interest.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to EXHIBIT A for fee amounts and the specific interest rate, the agreement becomes contradictory. It states Diplomat will pay fees but provides no clear method to determine them. It also states interest will accrue on late payments but removes the defined interest rate. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, as the court would need to determine the fee amount and interest rate.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of \"Period\" and \"Additional Period\" and the clause stating that extension is only possible if neither party is in default, the agreement becomes contradictory. The contract refers to 'the current term' and 'the extended term' without defining the duration. This creates uncertainty about the automatic renewal and the conditions for extension. It no longer specifies the length of the initial term or the extension, which impacts obligations tied to specific periods. The removal of the 'not in default' clause makes the possibility of extension ambiguous if there are breaches of contract.",

Diplomat may, at its own expense, examine and copy those books and records as provided in this Section 4. Such books, records and accounts will be maintained in a manner that allows Diplomat to separate these matters from those relating to Tadeo's other operations. Such books, records and accounts will reflect such information as would normally be examined by an independent accountant in performing an audit pursuant to United States generally accepted auditing standards for the purpose of certifying financial statements, and to permit verification thereof by governmental agencies. Diplomat may make examinations pursuant hereto during Tadeo's usual business hours, and at the place in the continental United States where Tadeo regularly keeps these books and records. Diplomat will be required to notify Tadeo at least five business days before the date of planned examination. If Diplomat's examination is not completed within one month from commencement, Tadeo at any time may require Diplomat to terminate such examination on\n\n- 5 -\n\nseven days' notice to Diplomat; PROVIDED that Tadeo has cooperated with Diplomat in the examination of such books and records.",

The section is contradictory. It requires Tadeo to maintain records but is ambiguous about the scope of the audit and what standards Tadeo's accounting needs to follow and if Diplomat can copy. It also removes the expectation for Tadeo to cooperate, which makes their responsibilities unclear. This makes the audit enforcement problematic, since it is unclear if Diplomat pays for the cost of their audit, what accounting standards Tadeo is measured against, if Diplomat can copy their files, or if Tadeo is required to help with the audit.",

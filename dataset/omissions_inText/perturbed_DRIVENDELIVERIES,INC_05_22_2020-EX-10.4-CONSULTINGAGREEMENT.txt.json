                "original_text": "Consultant agrees that all right, title, and interest in and to any material, notes, records, drawings, designs, inventions, improvements, developments, discoveries and trade secrets conceived, discovered, authored, invented, developed or reduced to practice by Consultant, solely or in collaboration with others, whether or not patentable or copyrightable, during the term of this Agreement and arising out of, or in connection with, performing the Services under this Agreement and any copyrights, patents, trade secrets, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating to the foregoing (collectively, \"Inventions\"), are the sole property of the Company. Consultant also agrees to promptly make full written disclosure to the Company of any Inventions and to deliver and assign (or cause to be assigned) and irrevocably assigns fully to the Company all right, title and interest in and to the Inventions. Without limiting the foregoing, all Inventions shall be deemed Confidential Information of the Company.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant agrees that all right, title, and interest in and to any material, notes, records, drawings, designs, inventions, improvements, developments, discoveries and trade secrets conceived, discovered, authored, invented, developed or reduced to practice by Consultant, solely or in collaboration with others, whether or not patentable or copyrightable, during the term of this Agreement and arising out of, or in connection with, performing the Services under this Agreement and any copyrights, patents, trade secrets, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating to the foregoing (collectively, \"Inventions\"), are subject to further negotiation. Consultant also agrees to promptly make full written disclosure to the Company of any Inventions.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'are the sole property of the Company' to 'are subject to further negotiation', and omitting the clause regarding assignment, there is now an internal contradiction. Later sections still refer to 'Inventions' and the Consultant's obligations regarding them, but the ownership of the 'Inventions' is no longer clearly defined. This creates uncertainty about the Company's rights to the intellectual property created by the Consultant.",

                "explanation": "By changing the initial term from 'sooner of six (6) months' to be 'determined by the parties' introduces a contradiction, because Section 7.3(a) states The Company will pay, within thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination, all amounts owing to Consultant for Services completed and accepted by the Company prior to the termination date. This creates uncertainty in when these payements shall occur.",

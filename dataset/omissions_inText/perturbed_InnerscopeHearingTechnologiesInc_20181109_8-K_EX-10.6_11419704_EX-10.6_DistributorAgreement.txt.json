Erchonia agrees to provide Products to Distributor pursuant to orders placed by Distributor in the form of individual purchase orders issued by Distributor to Erchonia. Such purchase orders shall set forth the quantity of each product ordered, the required delivery date, and the point of delivery. The price for the Products shall be as designated in Schedule A. Erchonia may revise its prices from time to time and deliver a written 90 day notice of the reasonable price revision to Distributor; provided that Erchonia agrees that the prices listed in Exhibit A shall not be increased during the first 90 days of this agreement.\n\nb. Erchonia shall submit invoices to Distributor after or concurrent with shipment of Products to Distributor at the delivery address. Distributor shall pay half (1/2) of the purchase price prior to shipment and the remaining balance 30 days after shipment of the Products. Payments received after the 30 day calendar period will be subject to a late fee of 1.5% of the invoice amount. All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.\n\nc. Distributor is responsible for all shipping costs and applicable sales taxes. Distributor is also responsible for all customs and duties applicable to any sales of the Products outside the United States, to the extent such sales are authorized or permitted.",

                "explanation": "By removing the payment terms (half prior to shipment, balance 30 days after), and the late fee clause, while still referencing 'Schedule A' for pricing, creates an ambiguity. It introduces an internal contradiction with the later altered statement saying payments will be based on a 'schedule agreed upon separately' as this schedule doesn't exist in the agreement. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as the primary payment terms are removed and replaced with a vague clause, and late fee structure is not defined.",

Failure to meet these minimum performance goals for any period, shall, at Erchonia's option (i) be considered a breach of this agreement for which Erchonia shall have all the rights and remedies provided for herein upon a breach of this agreement, including termination of this agreement, or (ii) shall give Erchonia to terminate or limit the exclusivity provisions of this agreement",

Failure to meet performance goals for any period, shall, at Erchonia's option (i) be considered a breach of this agreement for which Erchonia shall have all the rights and remedies provided for herein upon a breach of this agreement, including termination of this agreement, or (ii) shall give Erchonia the right to terminate or limit the exclusivity provisions of this agreement",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'meet the minimum performance goals set forth in Exhibit C' with 'try to meet performance goals,' we introduce ambiguity. Exhibit C explicitly states that minimum performance goals won't be determined until FDA 50k market clearance is obtained. However, the altered clause now speaks of 'performance goals' without specifying what they are or when they are determined. This contradicts the original intent and Exhibit C by implying goals exist now, even though they don't. Furthermore, it creates uncertainty in enforcement as there's no defined metric for what 'try' means.",

Subject to the terms set forth in this agreement, Erchonia grants Distributor the exclusive, non- transferable right and license to promote, distribute and sell the Products identified in Exhibit A to those type of customer specified in Exhibit B and only within the Territory specified in Exhibit B.

Distributor shall only distribute or sell the Products to customers who are licensed health care professionals.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'exclusive' clause and the mention of Exhibits A and B, we introduce a significant contradiction. The contract still mentions 'the Products,' which are originally defined in Exhibit A. The 'Territory' and 'type of customer' requirements are also detailed in Exhibit B. Removing these references makes the scope of the license undefined. While Distributor must sell to licensed health care professionals, there is no exclusive territory. The omission of the references to exhibits directly impacts the scope and enforceability of the Grant of License and creates a contradiction. The removal of Exhibit A and B references contradicts the specific territory and customer types.",

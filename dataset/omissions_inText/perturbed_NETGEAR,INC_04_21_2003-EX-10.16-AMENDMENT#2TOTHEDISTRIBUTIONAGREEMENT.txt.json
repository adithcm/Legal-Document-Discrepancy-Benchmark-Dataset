Later sections may implicitly or explicitly refer to activities or rights within '[*]', but this amendment now excludes it, leading to uncertainty about the agreement's scope and enforceability in that omitted territory. If previous agreements outlined specific obligations within '[*]', those obligations are now unclear.",

The foregoing notwithstanding, during the [*] and any          subsequent period, NETGEAR reserves the right to sell or license          Products in [*] to customers other than distributors such as, but not          limited to resellers who procure Products at centralized locations for          resale to end-use customers solely through their wholly or majority          owned retail outlets, both store-front and catalog.

                "changed_text": "During the initial one year period beginning on the Amendment Date, Distributor shall be the exclusive distributor appointed by NETGEAR. For the purposes of this provision, 'distributor' shall mean a company acquiring products directly from NETGEAR for resale or license to dealers or other second tier resellers which in turn resell or license the products to end use customers. The foregoing notwithstanding, during any subsequent period, NETGEAR reserves the right to sell or license Products to customers other than distributors such as, but not limited to resellers who procure Products at centralized locations for resale to end-use customers solely through their wholly or majority owned retail outlets, both store-front and catalog.

                "explanation": "By removing all references to '[*]', the geographic exclusivity and marketing plan requirements specifically tied to that territory are eliminated. However, the agreement still refers to the distributor's appointment, implying obligations and rights. The original agreement references to the area '[*]' are completely removed but the general meaning of the sentences still exist, leading to potential conflicts in interpretation. This could lead to legal disputes regarding distribution rights and marketing responsibilities in that undefined location.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'and any renewal term' introduces ambiguity. If the original agreement specifies procedures for renewal, this change now contradicts or overrides those procedures. Without the specification of renewal term, the continued validity of the changes introduced by the amendment becomes uncertain after the initial term concludes, causing a contradiction if the original agreement had automatic renewal clauses.",

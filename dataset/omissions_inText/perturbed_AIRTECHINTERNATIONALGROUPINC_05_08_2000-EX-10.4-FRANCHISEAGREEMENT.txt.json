                "original_text": "E. \"Gross sales\" as used in this Section 3.01 shall mean the amount of gross revenues received by You from all sources, including without limitation sales of Products, services or other merchandise of every kind or nature from, at or in connection with the operation of the AIRSOPURE Center granted herein, excluding state, federal or local sales taxes collected from customers and paid to the appropriate taxing authority.",
                "changed_text": "E. \"Gross sales\" as used in this Section 3.01 shall mean the amount of gross revenues received by You from sales of Products. ",
                "explanation": "By removing 'services or other merchandise of every kind or nature' from the definition of Gross Sales, Section 3.01 now contradicts itself. Royalties, accounting, and advertising fees are still calculated based on a 'total' gross sales as detailed in 3.01 B, C, and D; however, the definition of what constitutes 'gross sales' is now narrower. This creates an ambiguity in how the royalties should be calculated and therefore impacts enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'and You will not offer or carry any products or services other than AIRSOPURE's Products and services specified by AIRSOPURE without written approval from AIRSOPURE', creates an in-text contradiction. While this clause is removed, other parts of the agreement assume franchisees only sell AIRSOPURE products and services, especially in relation to royalty payments and brand standards. Therefore, it is ambiguous whether or not they can sell third-party products or services, hindering enforcement of brand standards and royalty calculations.",

You shall procure and maintain in full force and effect during the term of this Agreement, at Your expense, insurance policies written by an insurance company satisfactory to AIRSOPURE in accordance with standards and specifications set forth in the Operations Manual or otherwise by AIRSOPURE in writing. Such policies shall name AIRSOPURE as an additional insured and shall include, at a minimum: A. Comprehensive general liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000.00. B. Comprehensive automobile liability insurance, including collision, comprehensive, medical and liability to satisfy state law requirements. C. Additional coverage's and higher policy limits may be required from time to time by AIRSOPURE.",

                "explanation": "By removing insurance limits specified in section 11.01 A and B, and removing the phrase 'including collision, comprehensive, medical and liability to satisfy state law requirements', there is now an in-text contradiction. You are required to have insurance, but there are no monetary minimums and types of insurance specified. Other clauses like 11.03 rely on the existence of specific insurance amounts and types, making it unclear if the insurance coverage will be valid/sufficient or not, or even enforceable, and gives AIRSOPURE greater power to determine the exact type of insurance, possibly causing over-insurance.",

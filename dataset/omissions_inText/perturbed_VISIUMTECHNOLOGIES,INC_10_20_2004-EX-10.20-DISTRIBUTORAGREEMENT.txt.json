                "original_text": "3.1. Subject to Section 3.6 below the price of the Product, excluding the Licensed Programs, is $[*] per Unit. The total price for both of the Licensed Programs together is $[*] per month per Product (\"License Fee\"). The License Fee shall begin on the date the Product is shipped to a customer and shall be paid by Power2Ship to WLI by the 7th of each month for the prior month (prorated if the Unit was shipped during the prior month) and shall continue for as long as the Product is active on any wireless network. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Power2Ship is obligated to pay the License Fee to WLI for a minimum of 36 months.",

                "explanation": "By removing the initial specification of License Fee calculation ($[*] per month per Product), we create uncertainty in how the 'License Fee' is derived. Later sections depend on this definition, potentially leading to disputes. The License Fee remains an obligation, but the method of its determination is now ambiguous, impacting enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the reference to 'Exhibit A' where the warranty return procedure is detailed, but keeping the statement that a procedure exists, a contradiction is created if Exhibit A is not provided or if another section references Exhibit A. The contract promises a defined procedure, yet provides no immediate means to access it, causing uncertainty.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of Exhibit A, WLI agrees, in its sole discretion, to repair or replace at its sole cost and expense, any defective Products or parts thereof which are returned to it within the applicable warranty period, provided that the Products have not been altered or repaired other than with authorization from WLI and by its approved procedures; that the Products have not been subjected to misuse, improper maintenance, negligence or accident; that the Products have not been damaged by excessive physical or electrical stress; and that the Products have not had their serial number or any part thereof altered, defaced or removed.",

                "explanation": "Removing the direct reference to 'Exhibit B' (and conditions from Exhibit A) significantly weakens the warranty's specificity. While a warranty is still mentioned, the exact terms, conditions, and limitations are omitted, creating ambiguity. Subsequent mentions of warranty obligations are now less enforceable because the defining document is not clearly identified.",

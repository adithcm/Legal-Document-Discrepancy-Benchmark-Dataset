                "explanation": "Removing the detail '5Mbs of storage space' creates an in-text contradiction. Later usage may assume or require a certain storage space is provided, even though it is no longer contractually guaranteed. This leads to potential disputes about whether the promised service is adequate.",

                "explanation": "The omission of 'in the amount of 10% interest per 30 days on the value of the shares based on the closing bid price of the Company's common stock on the 20th business day following the date it receives written notice from YourNetPlus.com or their nominee. The damages shall accrue until the transfer agent receives the opinion letter' creates an inconsistency. The contract states that if the Company doesn't provide an opinion letter in time, liquidated damages will be charged, but it no longer specifies how those damages are to be calculated. This creates ambiguity and makes enforcement difficult.",

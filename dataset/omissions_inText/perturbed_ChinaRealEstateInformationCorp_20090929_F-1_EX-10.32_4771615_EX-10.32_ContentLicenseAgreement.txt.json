                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'other day on which banks are required or authorized by Law to be closed in Beijing,' the definition becomes incomplete. Other clauses may rely on the original definition, thus creating ambiguity if there is a public holiday and this new definition is taken into consideration.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 'shall not' creates a contradiction because it makes the statement unclear and up to interpretation of when the fines will be imposed, contradicting the original intent and creating uncertainty and contradicting any clause that mentions liability.",

                "original_text": "Customer's license to use the Software shall be limited to, and Customer shall not use the Software in excess of, a single hardware chassis or card or that number of agent(s), concurrent users, sessions, IP addresses, port(s), seat(s), server(s) or site(s), as set forth in the applicable Purchase Order which has been accepted by Cisco and for which Customer has paid to Cisco the required license fee.",
                "changed_text": "Customer's license to use the Software shall be limited. The specifics of this license will be further outlined by Cisco's management team.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to specific limitations defined in the Purchase Order, the amended text causes uncertainty in enforcement. While the license is stated as limited, the criteria are no longer objectively defined, giving Cisco's management team absolute power, contradicting the original intention of a clearly defined agreement.",

                "changed_text": "In the event such audit reveals issues, further actions will be determined.",
                "explanation": "The omission of 'Customer shall promptly pay to Cisco the appropriate license fees' introduces a contradiction. The original text explicitly states the financial consequence of non-compliance, but now such consequences are removed and are subject to unspecified 'further actions'. This contrasts with the rest of the agreement that does specify the fees.",

                "changed_text": "Limited Warranty Cisco may provide a limited warranty. Terms and details of warranty are subject to change.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific terms (90 days or software warranty period) about the warranty, the agreement becomes vague. By adding 'Terms and details of warranty are subject to change' the agreement now has terms that are not solid and able to be modified at will. This creates a contradiction since there are still terms of the warranty listed earlier on in the original.",

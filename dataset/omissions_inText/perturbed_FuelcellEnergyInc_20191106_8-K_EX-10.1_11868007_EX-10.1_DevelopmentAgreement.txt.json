Research Costs of FCE paid for by ExxonMobil will be limited to FTE Costs for time actually spent on the Program and Direct Costs actually incurred and approved in advance by the Steering Committee. The cumulative Research Costs for the Program will not exceed forty-five million United States dollars ($45,000,000 USD) over the Term of the Agreement (\"Total Research Cost\"). ExxonMobil will reimburse FCE for Research Costs after receipt of invoices on a monthly basis. Invoices for Direct Costs will be supported by relevant third party invoices received by FCE documenting such costs. Materials shall be invoiced as incurred and subject to a thirty percent (30%) service fee. All such payments will be made after ExxonMobil's receipt of invoices in accordance with the invoicing procedures specified in Paragraphs 10.01(b)-(e) and in Paragraph 10.04 (Invoices).",

                "explanation": "Removing the service fee creates ambiguity regarding the total cost to be reimbursed. Section 10.04 discusses invoicing but doesn't specify what happens if a service fee is charged which conflicts with the removal of the clause. This creates an ambiguity and contradiction.",

                "explanation": "By removing the necessity to categorize information as 'Program Information' or 'Background Information', this introduces an inconsistency because Article 7 (License to Program Results) and Article 8 (License to Background Information and Patents) differentiate rights based on these categories. If information isn't clearly labeled, enforcing these clauses becomes problematic. This omission causes an internal contradiction by undermining the explicit categorization referenced later in the agreement.",

Paragraph 6.01 states ExxonMobil will solely own Program Patents and Information, creating a direct conflict with the omission of these obligations.",

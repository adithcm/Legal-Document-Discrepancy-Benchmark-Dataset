Such appearance shall be for the purpose of signing autographs, shall last for a period of up to three (3) hours, and shall be subject to KI's schedule and availability. Diplomat, at its own expense, shall provide KI with a hair and make-up assistant of KI's choosing for each personal or media appearance required under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The modified text removes the specific requirement of the appearance being at the Vision Expo in New York, and omits that the Diplomat is responsible for hair and make-up. This creates ambiguity as to the location and who is financially responsible for the appearance which has impact for contract enforcement.",

KI and the members of her entourage shall travel via first class air and portal-to-portal limousine ground transportation. In addition, KI and the members of her entourage shall be lodged in first class hotel accommodations and all of them shall be reimbursed for all meals and other incidental expenses in connection with such appearances.

Diplomat further agrees that (a) such products will be manufactured, sold and distributed in accordance with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, (b) that the policy of sale, distribution, and/or exploitation by Diplomat shall be to the best advantage of KI, Inc. and KI, and (c) that the latter policy shall in no manner reflect adversely upon the good name of KI and KI, Inc. To this end, Diplomat shall, before selling or distributing any of the products, furnish to KI, Inc. for its approval, free of cost, a reasonable number of samples of each product and the cartons, containers, packing and wrapping material for such products. The quality and style of such products, as well as of any carton, container or packing or wrapping material, shall be subject to the approval of KI, Inc., which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Failure to reject any product, carton, container, or packing or wrapping within 15 days of receipt of such item or items by KI, Inc. shall be deemed an acceptance of the quality and style of such item or items. After samples have been approved pursuant to this paragraph, Diplomat shall not depart therefrom in any material respect without KI, Inc.'s prior written consent. From time to time after Diplomat has commenced selling the products, and upon KI, Inc.'s written request, Diplomat shall furnish without cost to KI, Inc. not more than ten (10) additional random samples of each product being manufactured and sold by Diplomat under this Agreement, together with any containers and packing and wrapping material used in connection with such products.",

It also removes the need for the product to adhere to State and local laws. By removing the clause, there is no longer a way for KI, Inc. to regulate the product to its liking; this undermines the goodwill previously outlined in the agreement.",

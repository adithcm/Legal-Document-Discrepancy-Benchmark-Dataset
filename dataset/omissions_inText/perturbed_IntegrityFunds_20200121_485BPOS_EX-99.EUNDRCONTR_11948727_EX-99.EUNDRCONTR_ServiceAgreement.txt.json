The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the \"Plan\") adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan.",

The Fund shall also pay Integrity distribution and/or service fees as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the \"Plan\") adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines how Integrity is compensated, linking it to the sales price and net asset value outlined in the Fund's Registration Statement, and specifying that fees are payable according to the 'Plan'. The modified text removes the specific formula and the reference to how the fees are payable, making the calculation unclear. The modified text mentions that the compensation will be agreed upon by both parties, but doesn't specify when, how, or how frequently it will be set, nor how to resolve possible issues.",

This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) on 60 days' written notice, by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or (b) on 90 days' written notice by Integrity.

                "explanation": "The original text mandates annual approval for the agreement's continuation by both the Fund's Board of Trustees and a specific subset of 'Qualified Trustees'. The modified text omits the requirement for approval by the Fund's Board of Trustees and 'Qualified Trustees', removing the procedural safeguards that ensure the agreement is periodically reviewed and deemed beneficial to the Fund and its shareholders. This removal creates an internal contradiction, as the agreement now implies automatic renewal without explicit checks and balances, potentially conflicting with other sections that emphasize fiduciary responsibilities.",

For purposes of this Agreement, \"distribution expenses\" of Integrity shall mean all expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, including, but not limited to, office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services; (b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising; (c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund; (d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund; (e) costs involved in obtaining whatever information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and 2 Source: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020 (f) sales commissions and other fees paid, together with related financing costs to brokers, dealers or other selling entities with a dealer agreement in effect for the sale of Fund Shares.

                "explanation": "By removing the detailed list of Integrity's distribution expenses, the modified text creates an internal contradiction. The original text states that Integrity bears 'all expenses'. By changing it to 'reasonable expenses', and putting responsibility for the other expenses onto the Fund, it leaves ambiguity and potential for legal dispute. Also, by removing the definition of 'distribution expenses', it is undefined and hard to determine which are reasonable.",

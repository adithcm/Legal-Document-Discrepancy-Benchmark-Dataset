Zynga will pay to WPT ten percent (10%) of the cumulative Net Revenue (as defined in Section 3.b. of the Additional Provisions) (\"Royalty\") from the WPT-branded Zynga Poker Tournament Mode or other such use of the WPT brand on the Zynga platform. Zynga shall not be required to pay the Royalty to the extent offset by the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments previously paid to WPT during the Term. Conversely, Zynga shall not be required to make Annual Minimum Guarantee payments to the extent offset by the Royalty previously paid to WPT during the Term.",

Conversely, Zynga shall not be required to make Annual Minimum Guarantee payments to the extent offset by the Royalty previously paid to WPT during the Term.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'ten percent (10%)' and replacing it with 'a percentage', the exact amount to be paid as a royalty becomes undefined. Other sections referencing the Royalty amount will now be ambiguous. This introduces an internal contradiction because Section 3(b) defines 'Net Revenue' which is directly used in calculating 'Royalty'. However, without defining the percentage, Net Revenue cannot be reliably utilized.",

Zynga will pay to WPT three million U.S. dollars ($3,000,000) per year according to the following schedule (which the parties may alter upon mutual agreement) (the \"Annual Minimum Guarantee\"): a. Within thirty (30) days of executing this Agreement: $1.5M b. July 1, 2018: $1.5M c. January 1, 2019: $1.5M d. July 1, 2019: $1.5M e. January 1, 2020: $1.5M f. July 1, 2020: $1.5M",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific amount of three million U.S. dollars creates ambiguity. While the concept of 'Annual Minimum Guarantee' is still present, its monetary value is undefined. References to the 'Annual Minimum Guarantee' in other clauses (like Section 5 concerning Royalty offsets) now lack a clear numerical basis, leading to contradiction and enforcement problems.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'non-exclusive, non- assignable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free, paid up, limited worldwide', the characteristics of the license are not explicitly defined. This leads to ambiguity and contradicts the assumptions made in other sections regarding the nature of the license. For example, without being explicitly 'non-exclusive' WPT can assert exclusive rights, which is a contradiction. Without explicit mention of 'royalty-free', Zynga can later charge WPT for it.",

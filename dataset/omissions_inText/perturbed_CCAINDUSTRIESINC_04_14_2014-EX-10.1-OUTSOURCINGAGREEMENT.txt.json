                "explanation": "By simplifying definitions, we create ambiguity. For instance, 'Accounts Receivable' is now just 'accounts receivable,' removing the specifics about customer debt and product sales. 'Gross Invoiced Sales' simply 'gross selling price of all Products,' which removes the specifics of any deductions or adjustments. Section 4.02 depends on the original definition of accounts receivable. Also, Section 8.01(d) which specifies the termination fee amount depends on the original definition.",

During the Term of this agreement, and for a period of twenty four (24)months after Termination (the \"Withholding Period\"), Contractor may retain monies (collections in Accounts Receivable) against any reasonable anticipated deductions for product recalls, unsalables, rebates, allowances or any audits or other adjustments it deems necessary. The retention of monies shall only be to the extent that the reasonable anticipated deductions exceed the anticipated accounts receivables. At the end of the Withholding Period, Contractor shall remit to the Company the retained monies less any deductions charged by Customers against Company's Products.

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit specification of a \"Withholding Period\" of twenty-four (24) months after termination, and by removing the key definition of witholding monies against any reasonable anticipated deductions for product recalls, unsalables, rebates, allowances or any audits or other adjustments it deems necessary, the section becomes vague. While it still allows for money retention, the lack of a defined timeframe and deductions creates uncertainty and contradicts the explicit financial obligations laid out elsewhere, especially after contract termination. Now, deductions can mean anything, and there is no time limit.",

                "explanation": "By removing specifics such as material breach, time frame to cure, and eliminating the clause for the company to pay a Termination Fee when providing less than six months notice, the termination terms become significantly more ambiguous. Because material breach isn't defined, any breach can be the basis for termination. The removal of 30 days and 3 business days to cure any breach create an in text contradiction. Finally, the removal of the termination fee contradicts Section 1.01(x) where it is defined.",

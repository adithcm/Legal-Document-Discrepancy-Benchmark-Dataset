Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Amendment will have the meaning set forth for that term in the Non-Competition Agreement or the Master Framework Agreement, dated September 30, 2016, by and between the Parties (the \"Master Framework Agreement\").",
                "changed_text": "1. Definitions. Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Amendment will have the meaning as commonly understood in the industry.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit link to the Non-Competition Agreement and Master Framework Agreement for defining capitalized terms. Later sections might still reference terms defined in those agreements (which are now ambiguous in this amendment), creating an inconsistency and uncertainty in interpretation.",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the \"Sales Term\" as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC (the \"Term\").\"",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to the 'Sales Term' as defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement, and simply stating 'one year', this amendment creates potential conflict. The Non-Competition Agreement, which this amendment modifies, might still contain clauses dependent on the original 'Sales Term' definition. If the 'Sales Term' was longer than one year, there will be conflict and uncertainty on how long the Non-Competition agreement is still in effect.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the governance of the Master Framework Agreement. There might be references to the Master Agreement after this point in other Vivint Solar agreements, which have cross-contract implications for confidentiality. Now it is not clear how those sections hold up, or do not hold up, with this statement about solely being governed by the laws of the state of Delaware.",

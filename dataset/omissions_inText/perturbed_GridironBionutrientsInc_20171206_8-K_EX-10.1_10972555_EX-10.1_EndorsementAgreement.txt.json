                "explanation": "By removing the specific end date of the contract period (November 2nd, 2020) and the three (3) year duration, the duration of the 'Contract Period' becomes undefined. This creates an inconsistency, especially if other clauses rely on the contract's expiry date for calculating royalties or termination clauses. This omission also causes uncertainty in enforcement, as the duration is a key element of any agreement.",

It contradicts SECTION FOUR, E (Affiliated Partnership Commitment), where the company agreed to provide access to applicable health and wellness research. By removing the Resource Call Center, it introduces ambiguity about HOW the members will get access to such information and now it's at the company's discretion if it will actually happen.

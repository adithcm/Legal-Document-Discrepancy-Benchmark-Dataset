                "explanation": "By omitting clause 4. a., the contract describes *how* payments will be tracked and invoiced but removes the fundamental agreement about *how much* will be paid, creating a contradiction. Other clauses reference payment obligations, but now there is no defined calculation for the compensation, making enforcement uncertain. This causes uncertainty in how the compensation is calculated as the percentage and amount for the products are not defined.",

Any public appearance and/or photo shoot must be approved by the Talent prior to his agreement to attend, which shall not be unreasonably withheld providing the Talent does not have any prior professional or other commitments and reasonable and adequate notice is given and received by CSA on behalf of Talent.

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence 'The parties agree that Company will pay any necessary and reasonable travel and lodging expenses incurred by Talent in making such requested appearances as per \"part 1\" of the Primary Agreement.' the obligation to pay Talent's expenses for appearances is removed while the contract still stipulates the appearance. While it is still agreed the talent is responsible to attend those events the clause removing the compensation of travel and lodging created an unclarity.",

                "explanation": "By removing the statement 'shall extend for a period of twenty four (24) months', the term is undefined creating an inconsistency. The contract still refers to the 'Term' in other clauses (e.g., Clause 2, Grant of Rights), but without a defined period, the duration of these rights becomes ambiguous. This would lead to disputes of contract length and when the contract should be ended.",

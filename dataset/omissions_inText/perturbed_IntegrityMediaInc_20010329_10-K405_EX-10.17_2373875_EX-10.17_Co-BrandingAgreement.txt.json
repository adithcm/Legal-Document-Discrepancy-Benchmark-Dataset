Mechanical rates will not exceed [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the then-current statutory rate, and Print licenses will not exceed a prorated portion of [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the retail selling price, Integrity will also manufacture the Product and sell to TL its requirements for resale.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific limitations on Mechanical and Print license rates, the contract now lacks clarity on cost controls. Later sections referencing Integrity's cost obligations become ambiguous, as there are no set upper bounds on licensing fees.",

It is no longer clear at what price TL can purchase promotional products or what the limit of products that can be purchased. This affects cost calculation and revenue.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific royalty amount and the alternative calculation based on net receipts eliminates a key financial term. The section still mandates royalty payments, but the absence of a defined amount creates a significant point of contention, making royalty calculations and audits impossible.

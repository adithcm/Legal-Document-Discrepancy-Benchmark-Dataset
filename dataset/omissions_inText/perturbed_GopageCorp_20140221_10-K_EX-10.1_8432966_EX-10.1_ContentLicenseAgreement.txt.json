Other terms defined in the body of the Agreement shall have the meanings so given.   \"Affiliate\" of a Person means any other Person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person. The term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty percent (50 %) of the voting securities of a Person.   \"Confidential Information\" means any information that is treated as confidential by a party, including, without limitation, trade secrets, technology, information pertaining to business operations and strategies, and information pertaining to customers, pricing and marketing, in each case to the extent it is: (a) if in tangible form, marked as confidential; or otherwise, identified at the time of disclosure as confidential, or (b) would be considered as confidential information by one who is reasonably knowledgeable and experienced in the field to which the information relates. With respect to each party, the terms of this Agreement are Confidential Information of the other party.",

Other terms defined in the body of the Agreement shall have the meanings so given.   \"Affiliate\" of a Person means any other Person.   \"Confidential Information\" means any information.",
                "explanation": "Removing the detailed definitions of 'Affiliate' and 'Confidential Information', including specific thresholds for 'control' and the criteria for identifying confidential information, creates ambiguity. Later sections referencing these terms will be difficult to interpret and enforce consistently, especially regarding the scope of confidentiality obligations and affiliate restrictions.",

In consideration of the licenses granted and other undertakings by Licensor hereunder, Licensee shall pay Licensor a License Fee in the amount of two hundred thousand dollars (US$200,000) (\"License Fee\"). The License Fee shall be due and payable as follows:   (a) US$50,000 upon signing the Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") between the Parties (provided, however, that Licensor hereby acknowledges receipt of this portion of the License Fee);   (b) US$50,000 upon signing of this Agreement; and   (c) US$100,000 upon on or before March 28, 2014.

                "explanation": "By removing the specific monetary amount of 'License Fee' and payment schedule, a conflict is created. The edited Section 5.1 states that a License Fee shall be paid but omits the amount and the payment milestones. Section 5.2 depends on the specific payment amount, so its effect is less clear now.",

In the event of a dispute arising out of this Agreement, the parties shall first negotiate in good faith in an effort to reach a settlement of the dispute. If having negotiated in good faith, the parties are unable to resolve their dispute, the parties shall submit the dispute to binding arbitration by a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall take place at an agreed location, or if the parties cannot agree on a venue in Reno, Nevada or Vancouver, BC, as determined by the flip of a coin. The arbitrator shall have jurisdiction over the conduct of discovery prior to the hearing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 11.13 shall be construed to prohibit either party from seeking appropriate injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.",

If having negotiated in good faith, the parties are unable to resolve their dispute, the parties shall submit the dispute to a method agreed upon in writing.",
                "explanation": "Deleting the specific arbitration clause removes the pre-defined method for resolving disputes, creating uncertainty. The remaining text references an agreed-upon method in writing, but does not specify any procedure for arriving at such agreement, potentially leading to disagreements about the dispute resolution process itself. It removes a key pre-agreed process.",

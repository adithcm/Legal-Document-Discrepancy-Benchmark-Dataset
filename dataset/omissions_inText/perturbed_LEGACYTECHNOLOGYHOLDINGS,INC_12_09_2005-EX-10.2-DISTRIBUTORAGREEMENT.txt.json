ENVISION is the manufacturer of certain nutritional  supplements and is          desirous of becoming an  exclusive  distributor  for the Product in any          blend  with  Krill Oil  (hereinafter  \"the  Finished  Product\")  in all          distribution  channels in the Territory on the terms and conditions set          forth herein.\n\nC.

                "explanation": "By removing 'joint health' from the definition of 'SierraSil,' the definition of 'the Product' becomes vague. By removing the word 'exclusive' and 'in any blend with Krill Oil', the agreement becomes less defined which will cause future potential issues. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement regarding product scope and exclusivity.",

The  parties          mutually agree to the Purchase Price of:\n\n         Product                          Purchase Price          -----------------------------------------------          A.

                "explanation": "Removing the word exclusively changes the nature of the agreement. The removal of 'mutually' and 'wholesale price list' and replacing it with 'negotiate the purchase price' introduces a contradiction, as the contract initially specified a fixed pricing mechanism. This makes enforcement uncertain, as the price is now subject to negotiation without a clear fallback if an agreement isn't reached. By removing the price, it creates a lack of specificity to the contract. This means there's no longer a clear agreement on how purchase requirements are defined.",

                "explanation": "Removing the terms 'non-exclusive' and 'non-royalty bearing' creates ambiguity regarding the nature of the trademark license granted to ENVISION. Also, omitting 'Upon termination, ENVISION shall have eighteen (18) months to exhaust any inventories, packaging and advertising materials bearing the \"SierraSil\" trademark and SIERRA shall have first option to buy back any inventory at ENVISION's net purchase price.' introduces a contradiction as there is no direction regarding what happens to their inventory once the contract ends.",

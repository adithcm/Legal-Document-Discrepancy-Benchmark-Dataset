                "explanation": "By removing \"copyright, trade secret, patent, and all other rights\" from the definition of \"Intellectual Property Rights,\" it creates ambiguity because section 8 mentions that the release of Material to Licensee will not act as assignment of any Intellectual Property Rights that the Owner possesses in Material. The removal of schedules 1 and 2 in 1.4 creates an uncertain definition of Material. Also, changing the definition of \"Standard Verification Service\" creates further uncertainty as 'from time to time' is no longer included.",

These schedules provide explicit details about the 'Material' that needs to be provided in the escrow, and the technical information required.

Specifically, the lack of a confidentiality undertaking is problematic because Clause 7 is about confidentiality and specifically refers to a 'confidentiality undertaking in the form contained in Schedule 3'. If a licensee is never asked for such an undertaking, it introduces further ambiguity to 7.1 since there is no confidentiality agreement in place.",

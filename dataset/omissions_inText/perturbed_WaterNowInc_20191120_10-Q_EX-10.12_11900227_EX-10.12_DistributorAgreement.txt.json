                "explanation": "By removing the specific numbers (25 new locations, 7,500 barrels) and the 'approved in advance by Hydraspin' qualifier, the definition of 'Performance Benchmarks' becomes vague. Section 2.1 still refers to 'satisfaction of the Performance Benchmarks' but now there's no clear, objective standard to determine if they are met. This introduces an internal contradiction because the original intention was clearly to have quantifiable benchmarks, yet those benchmarks are now absent, thus making it difficult for a judge to interpret and enforce the agreement regarding exclusivity.",

                "original_text": "5.1 Orders. Distributor shall order Products from Hydraspin by submitting purchase orders and an installation plan identifying the number(s) and type(s) of Products ordered, the requested delivery date(s) (each, an \"Order\"). The requested delivery date shall be no less than 120 days from the date the Order is accepted by Hydraspin. Hydraspin will not unreasonably reject any Order for Products. Hydraspin will accept or reject each Order submitted by Distributor within ten (10) days after receipt of the Order. Any Orders not expressly rejected by Hydraspin within such ten (10) day period shall be deemed accepted by Hydraspin. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributor may cancel any Order for Products that are not delivered within sixty (60) days after the delivery date specified therein.",

Distributor may cancel any Order for Products that are not delivered after the delivery date specified therein.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 120 days' notice and the specific acceptance/rejection timeframe (ten days), the contract now lacks clarity on how far in advance orders must be placed and when they are considered approved. The clause 'Hydraspin will accept or reject each Order submitted by Distributor after receipt of the Order' makes no sense, as no timeline is specified, creating ambiguity and potentially allowing Hydraspin to indefinitely delay order fulfillment. Section 4.4 mentions 'Supply of Products' but is affected by this change, since it's unclear when a supply is legitimately ordered. This omission creates a contradiction because the original intention to specify order timelines has been removed, yet the basic obligation to fulfill orders remains.",

                "explanation": "By removing all references to 'Hydraspin Share of Net Revenue', a key financial arrangement of the contract is eliminated from this section. However, the terms 'Distributor Share' and 'Hydraspin Share' are still referenced in Section 6.2 and 6.4. This creates a contradiction: Section 6.1 states Products are provided at no cost, while other sections imply a revenue-sharing arrangement, but the definition and mechanism for that arrangement are no longer present in the initial section. This would affect how a court could interpret the payment responsibilities of both parties.",

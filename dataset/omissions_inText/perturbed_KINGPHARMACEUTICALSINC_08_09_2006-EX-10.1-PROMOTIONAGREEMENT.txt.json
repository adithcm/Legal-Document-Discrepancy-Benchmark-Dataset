(a) King agrees that from and after the Promotion Commencement Date, the King Sales Force will be staffed with at least [***] full-time Sales Representatives (subject to vacancies consistent with average vacancy rate experienced by King across its total sales force) who are actively promoting the Product in accordance with the Launch Plan or Annual Plan (the \"Minimum Sales Force Level\"); provided that King may meet such requirement to actively promote the Product by promoting the Product through P2 Details and P3 Details. Throughout the remainder of the Term, King shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the number of Sales Representatives comprising the King Sales Force meets or exceeds the Minimum Sales Force Level, including by promptly filling all vacant positions in the King Sales Force resulting from resignations or terminations.",

At least 30 days prior to the beginning of each Agreement Quarter ending after the Promotion Commencement Date, King shall submit to the JCC a written forecast by month of the number of Units of Product expected to be sold in the Territory during the twelve (12) month period beginning with such Agreement Quarter, which forecast shall be prepared by King in good faith. In order to assist King in developing such forecasts, Depomed shall give King trade wholesaler stocking levels information within ten days following the beginning of each Agreement Quarter ending after the Promotion Commencement Date (or, if later, within two business days after such information becomes available to Depomed). The JCC shall review and discuss such forecast and shall make such modifications thereto as may be necessary for such forecast to be unanimously approved by the JCC and to be consistent with the forecasting and purchasing provisions of Depomed's Third Party supply agreement relating to the Product (as so modified and approved for the applicable twelve (12) month period, the \"Volume Forecast\"). Depomed shall use reasonable best efforts to manufacture and distribute, or cause to be manufactured and distributed, Product consistent with the Volume Forecast.

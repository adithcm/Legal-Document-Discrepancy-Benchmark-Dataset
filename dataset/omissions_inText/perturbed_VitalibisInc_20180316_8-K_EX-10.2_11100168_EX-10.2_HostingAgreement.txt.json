                "original_text": "2.5 Credit for Interruption of Services. In the event of any loss or interruption of Services solely due to VOTOCAST controlled activities. Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy and VOTOCAST'S sole and exclusive liability for any loss or interruption of Services shall be as follows. For loss or interruption of Services which is not due to scheduled maintenance, and is caused by VOTOCAST, and such loss or interruption of Services exceeds a continual period of one (I) hour per Exhibit C, Licensee shall receive a credit against future Services equal to one-thirtieth (1/30) of the monthly fees for the Services for each cumulative hour, up to a maximum total of the fees charged for Services for the applicable month of the affected Services.",

Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy and VOTOCAST'S sole and exclusive liability for any loss or interruption of Services shall be as determined at the sole discretion of VOTOCAST.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding compensation for service interruptions. The original text specifies a clear formula for credit calculation based on Exhibit C and the duration of the interruption. The modified text replaces the formula with a statement that the credit will be determined at VOTOCAST's 'sole discretion,' which is contradictory to the intent of a defined service level agreement and also references Exhibit C in section 2.6. This creates uncertainty and the potential for disputes, as the Licensee has no guaranteed or predictable remedy for service interruptions.",

(For clarity, if the current version is 1.7. we would also warrant 1.6 and 1.5.); (f) Configuration and Customization Services — Licensee has a 15 business day period directly after the production release to report any defects related to the customization services; these defects are covered under the warrant and are corrected at \"no cost\" to the customer; and (g) Licensee's use of any VOTOCAST Materials provided on the Mobile Apps does not and v. ill not, to VOTOCAST'S knowledge, contain any content, materials, advertising or services that are materially inaccurate or that infringe on or violate any applicable law, regulation or right of a third party. including, without limitation, or any proprietary, contract, moral, or privacy right or any other third party right, and that VOTOCAST owns the content or otherwise has the right to place the content on the Mobile Apps.

                "explanation": "By removing the specific warranties related to software versions, configuration, customization services and non-infringement, the modified text weakens VOTOCAST's obligations. The original section provides detailed assurances about the quality and legality of the Services. The modified version replaces all those warranties with a vague statement that the 'Services will be provided with reasonable care,' and continues to refer to section 6.2 (e) which no longer exists. This creates an internal contradiction because Section 7.2 outlines remedies based on the items removed from 6.2.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the sentence 'Regardless of the term, Licensee can terminate Agreement with at least one hundred eighty (180) days written notice with no further obligation.' creates an in-text contradiction, since this sentence allows the licensee to exit the agreement regardless of the term stated previously in the section. The licensee now is locked into the term of the agreement with no ability to exit, unless a 'material breach' occurs in section 10.2. This creates a situation where section 10.2 is the only allowable termination clause, creating an in-text contradiction and also potential future conflict.",

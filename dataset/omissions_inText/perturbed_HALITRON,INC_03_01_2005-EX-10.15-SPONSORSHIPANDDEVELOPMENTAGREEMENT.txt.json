                "changed_text": "As used herein, the term \"Golf Instruction Related Product\" shall mean any product. All references to the term are considered invalid and non-binding.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Golf Instruction Related Product' is initially defined, but the change renders the definition invalid and non-binding. This introduces a contradiction since multiple clauses still rely on this definition for royalty payments and exclusivity, thus creating enforcement ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "The changed name of the Exclusivity Obligations to simply 'Obligations' broadens the scope and creates confusion. Other contract clauses that reference the Exclusivity Obligations are now ambiguous, as they may inadvertently pertain to duties beyond the intended exclusivity. Thus, if Smith undertakes actions which were supposed to be exclusive but now 'Obligations', it would be hard to enforce.",

                "explanation": "By changing the payment process to email-based notification of addresses, this clause directly contradicts the initial terms requiring payments to a specific agent. This introduces potential payment disputes and enforcement difficulties should Smith fail to provide/update the address correctly, as there is no formally agreed-upon address recorded anywhere. It weakens the enforcement because TDA can claim they weren't given an address.",

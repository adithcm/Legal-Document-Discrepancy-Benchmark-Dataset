The modified definition omits these specifics, creating ambiguity.

                "explanation": "The original text specifies the license as 'fully paid-up, perpetual and irrevocable, transferable (subject to ARTICLE VIII), sublicensable (subject to Section 3.01(g))' and restricts its scope to products/services of the SpinCo Business within the SpinCo Field of Use. The modification removes these critical limitations, potentially implying the license is not fully paid, not perpetual, not transferable, not sublicensable and extends beyond the intended field of use. This directly contradicts the intentions outlined in the recitals and other sections, creating uncertainty about the license's extent and conditions.",

Without limiting the terms set forth in Section 6.09 of the Separation Agreement, none of Nuance, SpinCo or any other member of either Group shall in any event have any Liability to the other or to any other member of the other's Group under this Agreement for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages, whether or not caused by or resulting from negligence or breach of obligations hereunder and whether or not informed of the possibility of the existence of such damages.",

None of Nuance, SpinCo or any other member of either Group shall in any event have any Liability to the other or to any other member of the other's Group under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the qualification relating to 'indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages,' the modified text implies a complete exclusion of all liability, regardless of the type of damage. This contradicts the rest of the agreement, which outlines specific obligations and remedies, implicitly accepting that liability could arise. The original section acknowledges specific limitations mentioned in Section 6.09 of the Separation Agreement, but the modified text eliminates this reference. This omission contradicts the potential conditions or exemptions detailed in the referenced section, causing inconsistencies.",

This copy omits the information subject to the confidentiality request. Omissions are designated as [***].

                "changed_text": "1.13 \"Specifications\" means the general guidelines for Bromelain SP quality. These guidelines may be updated periodically by CBC. MediWound acknowledges that CBC may modify these guidelines as needed to improve manufacturing efficiency. MediWound will be notified of significant changes.",
                "explanation": "The original definition explicitly ties the 'Specifications' to Exhibit 1.13 and requires mutual consent for amendments. The modified text removes the reference to the exhibit and allows CBC to unilaterally update the 'Specifications,' creating a contradiction. Section 5 still refers to compliance with the ‘Specifications’ as defined here.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with specific quality standards (cGMP, GACP, ISO 22000) and applicable regulations. The modified text replaces the mandatory compliance with a 'reasonable efforts' clause and removes explicit reference to the standards, implying a lower level of commitment. Other sections still discuss batch testing based on GACP/cGMP standards, but there's no direct requirement they be followed.",

MediWound shall have the right, for a period of [***] days following receipt, to reject any Bromelain SP sample which: 6.4.1 fails to comply with MediWound's purchase order; or 6.4.2 fails to comply with the sample incoming inspection Specifications.",

If MediWound finds any issues with the sample, CBC will attempt to correct them. CBC is responsible for ensuring the samples reach MediWound.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives MediWound a clear right to reject samples that don't meet purchase order requirements or specifications. The modified text removes MediWound's explicit right to reject and replaces it with a vague 'feedback' process. The obligation of CBC is reduced from adhering to 'Specifications' to 'attempting to correct them'. Other sections still contain a general statement that the final product should fit the specifications, so this can be considered an internal contradiction.",

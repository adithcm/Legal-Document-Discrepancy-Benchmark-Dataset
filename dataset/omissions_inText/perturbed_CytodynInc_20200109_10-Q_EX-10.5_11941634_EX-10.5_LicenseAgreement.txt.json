                "explanation": "By removing the specific section (b) on how to measure efforts and resources for Development and Commercialization, the definition becomes vague. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement, particularly concerning the level of investment and dedication required from Vyera. Later sections depend on this full definition, making it an in-text contradiction because the standard is undefined.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed', CytoDyn now has absolute discretion over modifying the Minimum Requirements.

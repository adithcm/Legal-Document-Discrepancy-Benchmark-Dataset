For EDP Services provided pursuant to this Agreement, BNL will pay to VIP the charges set forth in the Payment Schedule attached hereto as Schedule B: provided however and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.

                "explanation": "By removing the specific minimum monthly fee of $5,000 and stating the monthly fee is subject to negotiation, introduces ambiguity about the financial obligations of BNL. Other clauses relying on 'Minimum Fee' now lack a concrete reference point, creating a contradiction.",

Such charges include but are not limited to the following:     1. Cost of all business forms, continuous or non-continuous used by BNL;     2. All telephone calls initiated on behalf of BNL business and operations;   3.

Specific billing details will be provided separately' all specifics are removed. This contradicts the original intent of the agreement by making enforcement uncertain. The specific examples no longer have explicit backing.",

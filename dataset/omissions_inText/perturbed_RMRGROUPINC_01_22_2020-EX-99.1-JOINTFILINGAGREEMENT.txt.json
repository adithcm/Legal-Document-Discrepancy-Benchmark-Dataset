                "explanation": "By removing the specific date and reference to Rule 13d-1(k), the agreement loses its defined scope, creating ambiguity as to which filings are covered. Later references to 'the Schedule 13G/A' imply a specific document, but without a clear definition of what that specific document is. This is because the exact type of filing which is specified is no longer defined. ",

                "explanation": "Omitting the date creates uncertainty about when the agreement came into effect. Subsequent clauses that refer to 'this agreement' lack a concrete starting point, making enforcement and interpretation difficult. The document still references signature, so the date of that signature, which has been eliminated, is important. ",

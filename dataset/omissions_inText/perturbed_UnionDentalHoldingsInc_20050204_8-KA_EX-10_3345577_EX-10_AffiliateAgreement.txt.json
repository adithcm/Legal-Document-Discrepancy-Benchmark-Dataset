                "changed_text": "A Confidential Information@ shall mean any and all information shared in verbal and written form.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' includes the expectation of privacy and legal protection. The revised definition broadens it to 'any and all information shared,' regardless of whether it's meant to be confidential or is legally protected. This contradicts sections that outline specific duties regarding Confidential Information, as the definition now lacks the element of confidentiality. This introduces ambiguity about what the contract intends to protect.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'and retain no copies or back-up tapes' from Section 3(g), the text now contradicts the intention of maintaining confidentiality post-termination. If the Business Affiliate can retain copies of 'Confidential Information', the confidentiality agreement is undermined. This creates a direct contradiction within the contract, making enforcement difficult.",

                "changed_text": "Business Affiliate acknowledges that the Business Affiliate will review the UDC's Business Affiliate manual.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states the manual's terms are incorporated by reference into the agreement, meaning they are legally binding. The revised clause only acknowledges a review; it does not bind the affiliate to the manual's terms. This contradicts any other section that assumes adherence to those manual terms, as there's no longer a clear contractual obligation. This creates uncertainty as to which policies in the manual the affiliate is actually bound by.",

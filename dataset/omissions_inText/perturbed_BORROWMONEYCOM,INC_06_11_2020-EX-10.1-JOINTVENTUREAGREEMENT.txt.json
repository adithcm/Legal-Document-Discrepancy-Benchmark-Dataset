                "explanation": "This change removes the specific definition of the 'Purpose' of the Venture, but later sections like 10, 12 still reference the 'Purpose'. Without a clear definition, the scope of the Managers' authority and the limits of their actions become uncertain, creating an internal contradiction.",

Sections 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 59a still refer to Capital Contributions. Without the details outlined, it's unclear what constitutes a Capital Contribution, making enforcement of obligations related to it ambiguous.",

If the dispute is not resolved within a reasonable period then any or all outstanding issues may be submitted to mediation in accordance with any statutory rules of mediation. If mediation is not successful in resolving the entire dispute or is unavailable, any outstanding issues will be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. The arbitrator's award will be final, and judgment may be entered upon it by any court having jurisdiction within the State of Florida.",

                "explanation": "This modification removes the binding arbitration clause while still referencing the possibility of mediation. By eliminating the clear path to arbitration, it introduces uncertainty about how unresolved disputes will be settled. This contradicts the implicit expectation of a final resolution mechanism.",

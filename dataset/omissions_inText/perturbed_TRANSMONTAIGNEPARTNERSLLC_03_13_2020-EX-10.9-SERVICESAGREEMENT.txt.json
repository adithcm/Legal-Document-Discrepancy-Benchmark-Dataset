                "original_text": "1.2 Reimbursement and Allocation. The Operating Company shall reimburse EmployeeCo for all direct or indirect costs and expenses incurred by EmployeeCo in connection with performing its obligations under this Agreement including, but not limited to:\n\n(a) salaries of the Services Employees;\n\n(b) the cost of employee benefits for the Services Employees, including 401(k), pension, bonuses and health insurance benefits (whether through insurance policies provided by third-parties or self-insurance);\n\n(c) costs associated with workers' compensation claims and other disputes or liabilities associated with the Services Employees;\n\n(d) severance costs with respect to any terminated Services Employees; and\n\n(e) all sales, use, employment, excise, value added or similar taxes, if any, that may be applicable from time to time with respect to the Services.\n\nSuch reimbursements shall be made by the Operating Company to EmployeeCo in advance or immediately upon such costs being incurred, or otherwise in accordance with historical practice, unless otherwise agreed between the Operating Company and EmployeeCo.",
                "changed_text": "1.2 Reimbursement and Allocation. The Operating Company shall reimburse EmployeeCo for certain costs and expenses. Such reimbursements shall be made according to a mutually agreed upon schedule between the Operating Company and EmployeeCo.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific list of reimbursable expenses (salaries, benefits, worker's comp, severance, taxes), the modified text creates ambiguity. While a 'mutually agreed upon schedule' is mentioned, the original specific categories are now absent. If other sections or historical practices referenced these specific categories, a contradiction arises, making enforcement uncertain as the contract no longer explicitly covers them.",

As an additional fee, the Operating Company shall also pay to EmployeeCo an amount equal to 1% of the amount of all reimbursements made under Section 1.2, payable at the same time as such reimbursements, unless otherwise agreed between the Operating Company and EmployeeCo.",

                "explanation": "The deletion of 'an amount equal to 1%' creates a contradiction because Section 1.3 now only references 'a percentage', however, the exact amount to be paid as an additional fee is no longer clearly defined. This could create uncertainty if the intention was to keep the rate constant.",

This Agreement may be terminated by (a) the written agreement of the Parties. All payment obligations hereunder shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause (b) that allows either party to terminate with 5 days written notice creates a contradiction. The agreement can now only be terminated by mutual written agreement. This creates an inconsistency with the original understanding that either party can exit the agreement unilaterally with notice, potentially making another section harder to execute on if there was a disagreement about payment after one party tried to terminate without agreement.",

                "original_text": "For the Initial Term of this Agreement, iVillage agrees that Ford shall be the exclusive automobile manufacturer sponsor and advertiser throughout the Network, with respect to entities whose primary business is that of an automotive manufacturer and/or retailer. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"retailer\" shall refer to an entity which sells new and/or used vehicles.",

For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"retailer\" shall refer to an entity which sells new and/or used vehicles.",
                "explanation": "The phrase \"with respect to entities whose primary business is that of an automotive manufacturer and/or retailer\" has been removed. The contract now states Ford is the exclusive advertiser without clarifying the scope of exclusivity. This creates uncertainty because it is unclear whether Ford's exclusivity extends to entities that are not primarily automotive manufacturers/retailers, leading to potential disputes regarding what constitutes a conflicting sponsorship.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'listed on Exhibit A' and not providing a list of the third party traffic auditors, it creates a contradiction when section 3 mentions the auditors are selected by the 2.C.(ii). This creates a contradiction as it states the third party traffic auditor will be audited, but this will not be possible. Enforcement becomes difficult because the specified auditors are undefined.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the details [*] for each [*] impressions which were not delivered, the formula to calculate the refund is undefined. This creates a contradiction as section 5 mentions payments from FMC, but the refund formula is not included. Enforcement will become difficult because the amount to pay back has been ommited.",

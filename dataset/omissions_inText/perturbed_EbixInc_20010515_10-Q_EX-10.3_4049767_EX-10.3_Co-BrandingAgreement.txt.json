The sample format of the application form is enclosed in Exhibit J. If ebix wishes to increase the length of the Filled Application Form by more than 10% during the Term, About must approve such change.",

If ebix wishes to modify the Filled Application Form during the Term, About must consider such change.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific requirement of completing all fields and clicking the \"Submit\" button, the definition of \"FILLED APPLICATION FORM\" becomes vague. Additionally, Exhibit J, which contains a sample format, is no longer referenced. Changing 'increase the length' to 'modify' is also problematic. Other clauses may rely on a precise action constituting a filled form, and this change introduces ambiguity regarding when ebix is entitled to fees or when About has met its obligations.",

Notwithstanding Section 7.1, all the above links on the About.com Home Page and Channels listed above, in addition to the Partnership Box integration on the Guide Site Home Pages and all the subsequent Guide Site Sub-Pages shall be maintained by about, until the termination of this agreement as detailed in Section 2.1",

                "explanation": "The specific requirements regarding link placement (Home Page, Channel Home Pages, Guide Sites) and references to Exhibits C, D, and E are removed. This eliminates About's obligation to place links in the locations described. This creates uncertainty. Section 4 may depend on these links.",

In the event of any downtime and/or maintenance in excess of the aforementioned amount, such shall be deemed a material breach and ebix shall have twenty four (24) hours in which to cure such breach. If such breach is not cured to About's reasonable satisfaction, About may remove the ebix Links after informing either the President, CFO or CTO of ebix until About reasonably determines that the ebix Web Site is operational and fully functional.",

                "explanation": "The specific uptime guarantee (99.0%), the allowance for scheduled downtime (1 hour per month), and the definition of a material breach related to uptime are removed. The required notification to specific executives is also removed. Without these metrics, it becomes difficult to determine if ebix is in breach of contract and if About is justified in removing the links. About's discretion is significantly broadened. A later section may rely on the definition of a 'material breach'.",

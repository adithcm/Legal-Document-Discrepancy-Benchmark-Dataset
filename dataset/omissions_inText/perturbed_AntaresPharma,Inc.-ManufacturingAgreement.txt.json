Other sections of the agreement still refer to AMAG and Antaresâ€™ responsibilities, creating a contradiction about who is responsible for what.",

The initial Forecast is attached hereto as Exhibit H.

[***] of each Forecast shall be non-binding (the \"Non-binding Forecast\"). The Non-binding Forecast shall be prepared in good faith by AMAG and represent AMAG's reasonable expectation of its requirements of Product, sample Product and Trainers for [***] of such Forecast. Each Forecast shall include an estimated delivery date of the Prefilled Syringes to Antares or its Subcontractor (such estimate to be provided by AMAG in good faith).",

The Non-binding Forecast shall be prepared in good faith by AMAG and represent AMAG's reasonable expectation of its requirements of Product, sample Product and Trainers for [***] of such Forecast,' the updated language implies that all forecasts are binding.

                "explanation": "By changing the definition of 'Titles' to be determined solely by the Licensee, it contradicts later sections that reference 'Titles' as being pre-defined in Schedule A, specifically Section 5 which discusses amending Schedule A.

                "explanation": "By removing 'Share Consideration, royalty-free, perpetual and non-perpetual license (subject to the duration for which Licensor has the rights to each Title as specified in Schedule A1-A5 of Schedule A)', the contract no longer specifies consideration for the license. This introduces a fundamental problem, as a contract requires consideration to be valid. Moreover, removing 'duration for which Licensor has the rights to each Title' creates contradiction with Section 7, Term and Termination, and Schedule A since it is mentioned there are titles rights that are specified there.",

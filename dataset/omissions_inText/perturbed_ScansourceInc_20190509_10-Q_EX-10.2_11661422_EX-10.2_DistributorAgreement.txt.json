                "original_text": "5. Product Return and Stock Rotation. The terms of Section 3 of Schedule 2 of the Distribution Agreement will apply to Xplore Products, provided however that stock rotation allowance for Xplore Products will be based on the net dollar value of Distributor's purchases in each calendar quarter of Xplore Products and such allowance will be calculated separate and apart from all other Products purchased by Distributor during such period.",
                "changed_text": "5. Product Return and Stock Rotation. The terms for product returns will be subject to Xplore's discretion. Stock rotation may be permitted based on mutual agreement between Xplore and the distributor.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Section 3 of Schedule 2 of the Distribution Agreement and the specific calculation of stock rotation allowance, the modified text creates uncertainty. The original text clearly defines how stock rotation is handled. The changed text makes it vague and subject to Xplore's discretion, potentially conflicting with any general return policies outlined elsewhere in the Distribution Agreement. The ambiguity introduces potential disputes over returns and stock rotation.",

To order the Xplore Products, Distributor shall place a purchase order via sending an email to xpldistributors@zebra.com. Each purchase order shall specify the bill-to address, ship-to address, quantity and description of each Xplore Product ordered, the unit price for each Xplore Product, the requested ship date, the preferred means of delivery, and tax-exempt certifications, if any. Orders received without this information or which contain any discrepancy may be returned to Distributor for completion or revision as applicable. Each purchase order placed by Distributor, as well as each invoice sent by Xplore, shall be governed by the terms of this Addendum and the Distribution Agreement and any additional or different terms within the purchase order or invoice shall have no effect. Each purchase order for the Xplore Products shall be subject to Xplore's acceptance and, upon acceptance, Xplore shall confirm the purchase order and the Estimated Shipping Date with Distributor. Notwithstanding such acceptance, Xplore reserves the right where necessary to amend the Orders including without limitation part numbers, special pricing and Estimated Shipping Date, and may at its sole discretion require an amended Order from Distributor incorporating such changes. For the purposes of this Exhibit B, \"Estimated Shipping Date\" shall mean the estimated shipping date of an accepted purchase order.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific requirements for 'bill-to address, ship-to address, unit price for each Xplore Product, the requested ship date, the preferred means of delivery, and tax-exempt certifications', the modified text contradicts the implicit need for this information to fulfill the order. This omission also removes the clause stating Xplore has the right to 'amend the Orders including without limitation part numbers, special pricing and Estimated Shipping Date' which allows them to change the order details after acceptance. Without those details, Xplore's obligations become unclear. This can create disputes about what constitutes a valid purchase order.",

Distributor has the right to cancel, reschedule or modify all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such cancellation or modification request is made within [*****] business days of PO acceptance or rescheduling request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non- cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.\n\nCertain purchase orders, determined at Xplore's sole discretion, and generally of large volume and/or extended lead times, may be subject to alternative rescheduling, cancellation, and modification rights. Should such purchase orders be subject to alternative rights, Xplore shall inform Distributor of alternative rights prior to order acceptance. Distributor will then have [*****] business days to accept, or reject, the alternative terms of Xplore for that certain purchase order. If Distributor rejects such alternative terms, the purchase order will not be accepted by Xplore.",

                "explanation": "By removing the distributor's rights to cancel or modify purchase orders within a specific timeframe (while also omitting the timeframe itself which is confidential), the changed text introduces a significant restriction. This creates an internal contradiction because the Distribution Agreement likely contains general clauses about order modifications or cancellations, and this change now heavily restricts distributor's rights specifically for Xplore products. The distributor now lacks any flexibility in managing accepted purchase orders of Xplore products.",

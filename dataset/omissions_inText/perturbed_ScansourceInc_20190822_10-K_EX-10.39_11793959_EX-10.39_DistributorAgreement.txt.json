                "original_text": "12.1 Distributor shall have the option to return to Cisco, for credit, up [*****] of the dollar value of Products from the Wholesale Price List (or, if no Wholesale Price Lists exists for Distributor's Territory, then the applicable price list) shipped to Distributor, net of credits, less returns to Cisco, in the preceding [*****] period (the \"Balancing Cap\") of the preceding Cisco fiscal quarter. The above-referenced cap shall be determined based on all Product purchases made under this Agreement. The responsibility to manage the Balancing Cap shall rest solely upon Distributor. Distributor shall be entitled to return Product once per quarter, provided such returns do not exceed the Balancing Cap. \"Dead on Arrival\" and Obsolete Products returned pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement shall be excluded from calculation of the Balancing Cap. Cisco shall credit Distributor's account in the amount of the price paid by Distributor therefore, less any price protection credits issued to Distributor related to the Product returned (the \"Return Credit\").",

The responsibility to manage product returns shall rest solely upon Distributor. \"Dead on Arrival\" and Obsolete Products returned pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement shall be excluded from the return process. Cisco shall credit Distributor's account for returned products.",
                "explanation": "By removing the defined limit of returnable products within a specific timeframe and linking return exclusions to Section 13 but also removing the description on calculating the return credit, this creates an inconsistency regarding how returns are handled. While returns are allowed and Section 13 is referenced, the specific process (balancing cap, Wholesale Price List usage, price protection credits) is undefined. The removal of 'Return Credit' and its calculation results in uncertainty about the actual credit value applied.",

Distributor shall follow Cisco's then-current RMA process; and\n\n12.2.5 Distributor reports must be provided to Cisco In accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",

Distributor reports must be provided to Cisco In accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Removing references to Cisco's RMA Policy and process in Section 12.2, creates a contradiction. By stating 'Distributor shall obtain an RMA number prior to returning any Product to Cisco' without specifying the method of obtaining it, while the original text mentions 'Cisco's then-current RMA process', there is uncertainty in the policy and process and the enforceability is weakened.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to \"Audit\" provision and Cisco's audit rights creates an internal contradiction. Distributor still have record keeping obligation but the contract lacks the language that gives rights for Cisco to inspect the records.",

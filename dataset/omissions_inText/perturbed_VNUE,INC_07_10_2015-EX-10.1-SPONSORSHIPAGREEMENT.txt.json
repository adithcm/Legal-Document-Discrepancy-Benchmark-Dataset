If the Sponsor decides not to be the category sponsor of the 2016 Event or fails to timely respond to the Notice, then ANTHEMIC may approach other parties to be the category sponsor.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the initial sentence stating 'The Sponsor will have 15 days from receipt of the Notice to accept the terms to be the category sponsor of the 2014 Event' creates an inconsistency because the paragraph then implies a prior 'Notice' with unspecified terms for acceptance but removes the actual clause defining the notification, and its duration for response. Furthermore, stating '2014 Event' is a typo creating a contradiction when the original intent was for the 2016 event.",

ANTHEMIC may use the Sponsor's name, logo, and other identifying characteristics on merchandise related to the Event, and the Sponsor is not entitled to any compensation from the sale of such merchandise. The right to use the Sponsor's name, logo and other identifying characteristics in connection with merchandise for the 2015 Event survives termination of this Agreement. After termination of this Agreement, ANTHEMIC may not design new merchandise that includes the Sponsor's name, logo, or other identifying characteristics for the 2015 Event but may produce additional previously designed and approved merchandise.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'for the 2015 Event' creates ambiguity and contradiction. While the modified text allows ANTHEMIC to use the logo, the reference to a specific event year is omitted. It leads to uncertainty regarding whether the license extends indefinitely to merchandise for future events or only applies retroactively, affecting ANTHEMIC's ability to monetize the sponsorship through merchandise beyond the initial event.",

                "original_text": "Without limiting or qualifying the Sponsor's liabilities, obligations, or indemnities, before the Event, the Sponsor will obtain, at its sole cost and expense, a comprehensive general liability insurance policy from a company acceptable to ANTHEMIC and authorized to do business in the state of Illinois with limits of no less than $1,000,000.00 per occurrence and $2,000,000.00 as an annual aggregate. The insurance mentioned in the preceding sentence will name ANTHEMIC as additional insured. The Sponsor will also maintain any statutorily required workers compensation insurance. The Sponsor will provide ANTHEMIC with properly executed certificates of insurance before the Sponsor provides any products or services at the Event, and the insurance will contain a provision that it cannot be reduced or cancelled unless and until the insurance company notifies ANTHEMIC. Any third party that performs services on the Event grounds on behalf of the Sponsor will be required to satisfy the same insurance requirements as provided in this section.",

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence stating 'The insurance mentioned in the preceding sentence will name ANTHEMIC as additional insured,' the clause becomes contradictory. The section still mandates the Sponsor to obtain comprehensive general liability insurance. However, without explicitly stating ANTHEMIC as an additional insured, their protection under that policy is ambiguous, weakening the indemnity clause. While the Sponsor is still obligated to have insurance, ANTHEMIC's direct benefit is removed.",

                "explanation": "By broadening the definition of 'Products' to simply 'apparel,' the agreement becomes vague. Section 2 specifies the license grant pertains to 'Company's Products', but with the modified definition, it's now unclear if it covers all apparel or only the originally intended casual apparel. Similar lack of clarity exists for the definition of \"Outerwear\". Similarly \"Exempt Status\" definition becomes extremely ambiguous and does not create a clear definition for enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the schedule of accomplishments and their associated remuneration, the clause becomes unenforceable. The contract references 'additional remuneration,' but lacks the specific triggers and amounts, leading to disputes. The specific additional remuneration values are critical for quantifiable enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'a reasonable number of days as mutually agreed upon and at places reasonably convenient to his schedule' to simply 'the services of Duval', the obligation becomes unbounded. Similarly, by reducing the reimbursement obligation from 'all reasonable travel, lodging and meal expenses' to just 'travel expenses,' the scope of reimbursement is unclear and creates ambiguity and opportunity for dispute. (b) is removed which creates an internal inconsistency because it is implicitly known that Duval's services can be leveraged for TV advertising, so what are the payment implications when this happens.",

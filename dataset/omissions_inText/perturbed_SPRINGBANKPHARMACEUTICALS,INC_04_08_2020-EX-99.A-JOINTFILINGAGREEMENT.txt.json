                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13G (including amendments thereto) with respect to the Common Stock of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and further agree that this agreement be included as an exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned agree to a joint filing agreement with respect to the Common Stock of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and agree that this agreement be included as an exhibit to such filing.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Rule 13d-1(k) and Schedule 13G, the contract loses its specific legal grounding. Later references to filing requirements are now ambiguous because the key regulation that mandates them is omitted. This can create enforcement challenges because the agreement's foundation in securities law is undermined.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'any and all amendments to such statement' significantly limits the scope of authorization. Later sections referencing the responsibilities related to filing amendments are now unclear. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, particularly if the filing requires specific amendments that are now implicitly unauthorized by this change.",

                "changed_text": "Each party agrees to this filing agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'this joint filing agreement may be signed in counterparts', the agreement now lacks clarity on whether counterpart signatures are acceptable. If other clauses assume signatures can be collected in counterparts for efficiency, this omission introduces conflict. A situation might arise where one party disputes the validity of the agreement because counterpart signatures were used, as that provision is not stated.",

FRANCHISEE  ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT  ABSENT A SEPARATE  AREA  DEVELOPER'S  AGREEMENT, PRETZEL  TIME  HAS THE  RIGHT  TO  PLACE  UNITS  AT ANY  LOCATION,  AT ITS  SOLE DISCRETION, AND WITHOUT REGARD TO THE IMPACT UPON THE FRANCHISEE'S BUSINESS.",

                "explanation": "This omission removes a critical sentence that clarifies the franchisee has limited territorial protection. While the initial clause limits where Pretzel Time can place new units to the extent *this agreement* provides territorial rights, the removed portion explicitly acknowledges that without a separate Area Developer's Agreement, Pretzel Time can place units without regard to the franchisee's business impact. By removing this explicit statement, the contract now implies stronger territorial protection than intended, creating a contradiction with the actual limited rights granted elsewhere.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the part in the original contract that talks about landlords' requirements, business potential or other conditions which Pretzel Time deems to be of importance to the successful operation of such franchisee's business. In a later section, there's a clause which talks about adhering to standards. Removing the part that franchisees adhere to those standards makes it seem like that clause is non-binding, because the standards are always subject to Pretzel Time's 'discretion'.",

The decision to grant an additional  franchise  location shall be in the sole  discretion of Pretzel Time and at no time does Pretzel Time promise or guarantee that additional franchises will be offered  or  approved.  Such  decisions  will be made on a  case-to-case basis,  based on  factors  including,  but not  limited to the  availability  of suitable locations,  quality of standards maintained in the Franchisee's current Units,   the  impact  of  additional   locations  upon  the  operations  of  the Franchisee's  current Units, the geographical  distance between the Franchisee's existing and proposed  location,  the business  plan of Pretzel  Time,  national contracts  with  major  corporations,  the  population  of  the  area  near  the prospective  site,  the quality of the site,  and other  economic  and  business factors.  Under no  circumstances  is  Franchisee  entitled to demand or require Pretzel Time to grant to Franchisee a Franchise or a similar variation thereof.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by removing the explicitly stated factors considered when granting additional franchises (e.g., availability of locations, quality of current units, geographic distance, etc.) and the explicit disclaimer that Franchisee is *never* entitled to demand an additional franchise. While maintaining Pretzel Time's 'sole discretion,' the omission makes the process *appear* less arbitrary and more open to negotiation, potentially contradicting later clauses that emphasize Pretzel Time's unilateral control. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, as Franchisee could argue that their application deserves more weight, given the apparent lack of defined criteria.",

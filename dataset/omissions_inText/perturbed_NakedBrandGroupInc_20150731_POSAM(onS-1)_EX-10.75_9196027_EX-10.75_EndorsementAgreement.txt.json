                "changed_text": "The Parties agree that the territory of such engagement shall be (the \"Territory\").",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"worldwide\", the contract still uses the defined term \"Territory\" but the geographical scope is now undefined and unclear. Later clauses rely on this definition, introducing uncertainty in enforcement of territorial rights and obligations.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"in the Territory\", Naked's license to use Athlete's image and likeness becomes geographically ambiguous, in direct contrast with the original intention as outlined in section 1. This creates contradictions with other sections that mention Territory or use thereof, potentially leading to legal disputes over usage rights across different regions.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"Wade will retain all ownership of the Intellectual Property Rights in connection with Wade Image including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Logo.\", section 14 now contradicts schedule A by stating it is jointly owned where schedule A says Wade trademarks and copyrights, thus making enforceability ambiguous.",

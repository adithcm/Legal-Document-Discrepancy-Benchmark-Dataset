                "explanation": "By removing the exclusions for 'base salary' and 'single product ad hoc awards,' the definition of 'Incentive Compensation' is broadened. This broadened definition contradicts Section 3.4(a), which specifies the minimum Incentive Compensation weighting tied to the Product. The contradiction creates uncertainty in enforcement because it is unclear whether base salary and ad hoc awards should be included in the calculation of the minimum Incentive Compensation weighting.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to use GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and replacing it with \"internal accounting methods\", the definition of Laboratory Service Revenue becomes ambiguous. This creates a direct contradiction with Section 4.3(a), which requires Exact to deliver a detailed Cost of Sales schedule. Without GAAP, there is no clear standard for how Cost of Sales is calculated, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of the Promotion Fee calculation. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement.",

The original text defines obligations for Pfizer to conduct 625,000 details and defines Incentive Compensation (IC) weightings. The replaced text makes the requirements subjective by stating that it should \"endeavor to provide Details in accordance with its sales strategy\". This changes the previously defined obligations to become at Pfizer's digression. ",

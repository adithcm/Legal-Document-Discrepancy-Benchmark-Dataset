                "explanation": "By removing the link to the GMA for definitions, any capitalized term undefined within this Amendment becomes ambiguous. Other clauses referencing these terms now lack clear definitions, especially concerning pricing or conditions.",

GOVERNING LAW - ARBITRATION 5.1 Governing law: Pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law, the Parties hereto agree that this Amendment in all respects, and any claim or cause of action based upon or arising out of this Amendment, or any dealing between the Parties relating to the subject matter of this Amendment or the transactions contemplated hereby or the Company/Repairer relationship being established, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A. as applied to contracts to be performed wholly within the State of New York (Exclusive of Section 7-101 of the New York General Obligations Law which is inapplicable to this Amendment).",

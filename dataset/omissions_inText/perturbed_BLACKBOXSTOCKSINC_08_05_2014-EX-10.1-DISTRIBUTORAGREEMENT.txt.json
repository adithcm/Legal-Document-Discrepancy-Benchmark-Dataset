Subsequent sections referencing these exhibits now lack clear anchors, leading to potential disputes and uncertainty in enforcement. The territory is now ambiguous. Products included are ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'except for Company's purchase money security interest defined in Section 1.03, above' and 'for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of delivery' creates uncertainty in the terms of the warranty. The contract guarantees no liens or encumbrances, while also referencing a security interest, creating an immediate contradiction. Also, removing the period means that the contract now guarantees a product free from defects into perpetuity. ",

Also, it is at the distributor's discretion to even provide them with the information to fight the cases. This creates a contradiction because it is impossible to fight cases without proper information and aid. ",

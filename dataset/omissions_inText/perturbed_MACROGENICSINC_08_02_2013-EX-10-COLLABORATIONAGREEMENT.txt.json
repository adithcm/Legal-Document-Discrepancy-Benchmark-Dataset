                "original_text": "1.18 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective under this Agreement, reasonable, good faith efforts to accomplish such objective as such Party would normally use to accomplish a similar objective of such Party under similar circumstances, it being understood and agreed that with respect to the Development or Commercialization of MGAH22 and Products, such efforts shall be similar to those efforts and resources commonly used by a Party for a similar biological or pharmaceutical product owned by it or to which it has rights, which product is at a similar stage in its development or product life and is of similar market potential taking into account efficacy, safety, approved labeling, the competitiveness of alternative products in the marketplace, the patent and other proprietary position of the product, and the likelihood of regulatory approval given the regulatory structure involved.",
                "changed_text": "1.18 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective under this Agreement, without defining the scope, criteria, or context by which such efforts are measured.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' provided detailed metrics for evaluating the level of effort required. By omitting the metrics, the term becomes vague and difficult to enforce. Other sections that reference this term, such as Sections 3.1, 3.3(a), 5.1, and 5.5(c), will now be subject to interpretation, creating uncertainty about what constitutes adequate effort.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'royalty rate determined in accordance with the royalty chart included in Exhibit H', the contract no longer specifies how royalties are calculated. This omission is contradictory because the obligation to pay royalties is still present, but the method to calculate the amount due is missing. This omission creates uncertainty in enforcement because there is no clear way to determine the amount of royalties Green Cross owes to MacroGenics. The removal of the percentages create financial unpredictability for MacroGenics.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specified a deadline of 'no event later than ***' for providing notice of patent or trademark infringement. By omitting the timeframe, the clause becomes less enforceable due to the lack of a specific deadline. Although the clause specifies 'promptly provide,' 'promptly' is open to subjective interpretation, creating uncertainty. If MacroGenics believes Green Cross didn't act fast enough when it provided notification.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'CO-BRANDED PAGES' specifies that they are developed pursuant to Section 2.2 and hosted on the Snap Web Site, displaying both Snap and Sponsor Brand Features. By removing the reference to Section 2.2 and the specific branding requirements, we create uncertainty about the governance and branding standards. Subsequent sections that rely on this definition will lack clarity on how the Co-Branded Pages are created and what elements they must include.",

During the Term, Snap will not grant any third party any right to sponsor any products or services in the Exclusive Category on or through the Snap Web Site.

                "explanation": "By omitting the sentence 'For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that the foregoing restriction applies only to persistent sponsorship placement as judged by Sponsor at its discretion, and not to run-of-site banner advertisements or other rotating promotional placements,' we introduce ambiguity regarding the scope of the exclusivity. Without this clarification, it's unclear whether the restriction applies to all forms of sponsorship or only to 'persistent' placements. This could lead to disputes over whether certain advertising falls under the exclusive category, creating an enforcement challenge.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'along with all accrued payment obligations of Sponsor (i.e. the up-front payment referenced in Section 3.1 [UP-FRONT PAYMENT] and set forth in Exhibit A hereof),' the clause creates uncertainty as to whether the Sponsor is still liable to pay for previously accrued payment obligations. While it states that Sections 5,6,7 and 8 will survive, this section omits reference to the survival of payment obligations set forth in Section 3.1 and Exhibit A, creating contradiction.",

Aduro shall be the sole and exclusive owner of, and Consultant hereby assigns to Aduro, any and all writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\"). Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro. To the extent, if any, that Consultant has rights in or to any Work Product or any data or inventions developed in connection with work under this Agreement (\"Aduro IP\"), Consultant hereby irrevocably assigns and transfers to Aduro, and to the extent that an executory assignment is not enforceable, Consultant hereby agrees to assign and transfer to Aduro, in writing, from time to time, upon request, any and all right, title, or interest that Consultant has or may obtain in any Work Product and/or Aduro IP without the necessity of further consideration. Aduro shall be entitled to obtain and hold in its own name all copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks with respect thereto. At Aduro's request and expense, Consultant shall assist Aduro in acquiring and maintaining its right in and title to, any Work Product. Such assistance may include, but will not be limited to, signing applications and other documents, cooperating in legal proceedings, and taking any other steps considered necessary or desirable by Aduro.",

Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro.

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit statement of assignment and replacing it with a reference to a nonexistent 'Appendix A,' the contract now implies that the rights to 'Work Product' are subject to terms that are not actually defined. The contract also states that the consultant irrevocably assigns the 'Work Product' or 'Aduro IP' to Aduro. However, without the definition found in 'Appendix A' it creates an ambiguity, because it means the terms of ownership may be interpreted differently.",

From the Effective Date and for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates. In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to entry of injunctive relief. Such injunctive remedy shall be nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any and all other remedies which may be available to it at law or in equity, including without limitation, the recovery of direct, indirect, incidental, consequential and/or punitive damages.",

In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to remedies as defined in Section 12.",
                "explanation": "The explicit duration of the 'Restricted Period' (12 months) has been removed, creating ambiguity about the length of the nonsolicitation restriction. Moreover, the specific remedies (injunctive relief and types of damages) have been replaced with a reference to 'Section 12,' which might not actually exist or comprehensively define the remedies, leading to a contradiction if other sections assume specific remedies exist. Further, Section 7 originally outlined that the remedies for breach are nonexclusive. Removing the nonexclusive part could suggest that remedies are limited and exclusive, even if this contradicts standard legal practices.",

Consultant acknowledges that it is illegal to buy or sell Aduro's stock or the stock of companies working with Aduro, on the basis of \"material non-public information.\" It is also illegal to pass such information on to others who use it to buy or sell Aduro stock.

Consultant acknowledges that it is illegal to use such information for personal gain. Consultant is expected to act ethically regarding company information.",
                "explanation": "The specific mention of it being illegal to buy/sell stock of Aduro or companies working with Aduro based on material non-public information has been removed. Also removed is the explicit statement about passing this information to others for stock trading. By removing these specifics, the modified text is less clear about what constitutes illegal activity, and also removes the crucial mention of the company's Insider Trading and Trading Window Policy, if other sections of the agreement state that the consultant will comply to all policies of the company then this creates a contradiction.",

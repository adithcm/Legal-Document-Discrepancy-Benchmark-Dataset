                "changed_text": "2. COMPENSATION TO LEADER. The compensation to LEADER shall be determined at a later date as agreed upon by both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies the compensation as 3,000,000 shares. The modified text removes this fixed compensation and introduces ambiguity by stating it will be determined later. This directly contradicts the initial agreement and creates uncertainty regarding the payment to LEADER, potentially leading to disputes.",

By removing the specifics of delivery methods (hand, courier, fax, mail) and timing, the modified clause creates ambiguity. It's now unclear when a notice is officially considered received, potentially leading to disputes over deadlines and obligations.",

It also provides a greater understanding of the customer and helps manage customer data and all interaction with the customer. Advantages and features of the CRM are as following:     ● Enhanced customer relationship management including retention tools and fraud prevention.         ● Recurring billing feature that allows for fully automated billing and tools to determine approval and decline rates and automated retries of declines.         ● Profit management tools including affiliate commission tracking, price point testing and indemnification of revenue loss causes.         ● Gateway integration and merchant account load balancing.         ● Improved affiliate management and affiliate fraud detection.         ● Better reporting and performance tracking.",

                "explanation": "The original Exhibit A describes the CRM system's functionalities in detail. The modified version truncates the list of functionalities, removing specific features like 'Recurring billing feature,' 'Profit management tools,' etc. Other sections of the contract might rely on the existence of these features as described in the original Exhibit A. Removing them creates a contradiction if, for instance, the 'Profit management tools' are central to the 'Profit management tools including affiliate commission tracking, price point testing and indemnification of revenue loss causes.'",

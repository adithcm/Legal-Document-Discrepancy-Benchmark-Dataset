Subject to the provisions of Section 8.2, if the Company determines to solicit additional equity financing subsequent to exercise of the Option but prior to Commencement of Production (hereinafter defined) at the El Aguila project, it shall provide written notice to that effect to HOC and HOC shall be entitled to exclusively provide such financing upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. For purposes of the preceding sentence, \"Commencement of Production\" shall be defined as the production and delivery to the point of sale (refiner) by the Company (either directly or through a subsidiary) of not less than 4,000 ounces of gold within a 45 day period. HOC shall have ten (10) Business Days from delivery of such notice in which to notify the Company that it desires to provide all of such financing (the \"Financing Election\"). If HOC delivers the Financing Election, the purchase price for each share shall be equal to eighty percent (80%) of the average closing price of the Shares during the thirty (30) calendar days preceding the date HOC delivers the Financing Election. Closing of the subscription, purchase and sale shall be at such place and time as the Parties agree but not more than ten (10) days from delivery of the Financing Election. If HOC delivers the Financing Election, one or more of the HOC Entities shall pay the purchase price for, and the Company shall issue, additional Shares, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. The Parties shall exchange representations and warranties, in form and in substance substantially similar to those provided in the Subscription Agreement and execute such documents as may be necessary to complete the subscription and sale of the Shares. In the event HOC fails to provide the Financing Election as set forth above, the Company shall be free to obtain such financing from one or more additional parties, free of any obligation to HOC.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Commencement of Production' is changed from a specific measurable standard (4,000 ounces of gold within 45 days) to a vague description 'start of mining operations'. The purchase price changes from being tied to a clear formula (80% of average closing price) to being 'determined by the board,' making enforcement uncertain and creating ambiguity. This uncertainty is further compounded by 'Closing of the subscription, purchase and sale shall be determined by the board,' thus making the process unclear and unenforceable.",

If, but only if HOC exercises the Option and completes the acquisition of the Additional Shares, HOC shall be entitled to nominate one (1) individual to the Board of Directors (the \"HOC Director\"). Upon receipt of such nomination and its satisfaction that the individual nominated by HOC meets the qualification requirements for directors under applicable laws, the Board of Directors further agrees to expand its membership to four (4) positions and appoint the individual nominated by HOC to the newly-created vacancy. The Board of Directors further agrees that if HOC maintains a Pro Rata Interest of at least 14.5%, it shall nominate such individual to the slate of directors at each subsequent annual meeting so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 are not invoked.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that HOC 'shall be entitled to nominate' and the Board 'agrees to expand its membership and appoint' the nominee if HOC exercises the Option. The modified text uses much weaker language: HOC 'may nominate,' the Board 'will consider the nomination'. The guarantee of a board seat is removed, creating uncertainty. By removing 'Upon receipt of such nomination and its satisfaction that the individual nominated by HOC meets the qualification requirements for directors under applicable laws, the Board of Directors further agrees to expand its membership to four (4) positions and appoint the individual nominated by HOC to the newly-created vacancy', creates an omission that creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states HOC 'shall have the right to designate' and the Company 'shall provide' room and board. The modified text weakens this to 'may designate' and 'may consider providing,' making the right discretionary. Additionally, the cost of 'Other consulting services' changes from 'no more than HOC's actual cost plus 1%' to 'market rate', which is significantly more ambiguous and increases the potential costs to the company and removing 'at any of its Existing Properties for the purpose of advising the Company with regard to ongoing exploration and development' creates an omission that creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

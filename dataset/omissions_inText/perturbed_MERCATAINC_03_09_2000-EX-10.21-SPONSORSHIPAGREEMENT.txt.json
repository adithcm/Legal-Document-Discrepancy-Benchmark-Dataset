Invoices are         payable thirty (30) days after receipt. A five percent (5%) late fee         will be added to all invoices which become past due and interest at a         rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum will be charged on all balances         not paid within thirty (30) days of the date they are due.",

                "explanation": "By removing the details about the late fee and interest rate, the contract becomes ambiguous about the penalties for late payments. Section 3 mentions 'Consideration' and 'Sponsorship Fee' that needs to be paid. Section 3.1 initially defines late fee and interest rates, but the removal of that condition leaves the sponsor in the dark if the invoices are due. The change introduces uncertainty regarding the financial penalties for not adhering to invoice schedules, which can lead to disputes. This omits a key enforcement term that creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The omission of the last sentence in Section 7 removes the clear right of the Sponsor to receive a pro rata refund if the agreement is terminated. The modified text lists the conditions under which the agreement may be terminated, and then the sentence guaranteeing pro rata refunds is missing.

Women.com shall make available to eDiets and eDiets shall purchase from Women.com advertising and promotional inventory in the amounts and at the rates specified in Exhibit B hereto and in accordance with the terms specified in Exhibit D hereto. If Women.com does not deliver at least 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for Advertsing Promotions as set forth on Exhibit B (11,250,000 per quarter; 45,000,000 per year); 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for the Diet Center Logo as set forth on Exhibit B (3,250,000 per quarter; 13,000,000 per year); and 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for Other Campaigns as set forth on Exhibit B (3,000,000 per quarter; 12,000,000 per year) each quarter following the Launch Date, within sixty (60) days of the end of the applicable quarter, Women.com shall deliver an amount equal to the under-delivery within the same campaign elements, including newsletters, promotions, exclusive sponsorships, targeted rotations, ROS, channel and sub-channel center logo placements, or mutually agreed upon comparable elements. If Women.com does not deliver the shortfall within sixty (60) days of the end of the applicable quarter, eDiets may terminate this Agreement in its entirety immediately or authorize Women.com to deliver the shortfall within an extended number of days to be mutually agreed upon by the parties (the \"Make Good Period\"). Should eDiets elect to terminate this Agreement, Women.com shall reimburse eDiets within thirty (30) days of the date of such termination for all pre-paid impressions or other promotions not delivered as of the date of termination. Women.com agrees that if eDiets elects to extend the Agreement the monthly fee due and payable during the Make Good Period will be recalculated and reduced to reflect the changes in the revised delivery schedule.",

                "explanation": "By removing the references to 'Exhibit B' and 'Exhibit D', which define the 'amounts' and 'rates' for advertising and the detailed campaign specifications, and by removing the specific metrics such as the '80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee' and the exact impression numbers, the modified text creates uncertainty and ambiguity in the enforcement of the advertising obligations. The criteria for 'satisfactory amount' is no longer quantifiable, making it difficult to determine if Women.com has met its obligations, which causes an internal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific types of advertising that are prohibited (banner ads, buttons, badges, etc.), it creates ambiguity as to what constitutes a violation of the exclusivity clause. If the intention was to prohibit *all* forms of advertising, the phrase \"or otherwise promote a Competitive Company\" would be sufficient. However, the original list implies a more specific restriction. Removing the list creates a contradiction and allows for potential loopholes as to what actions would constitute a breach of the exclusivity agreement, which causes an internal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'in the amount set forth on Exhibit C unless adjusted as set forth in Section 3.1', the contract no longer specifies the monthly fee eDiets must pay. This creates a clear contradiction because the obligation to pay a monthly fee is stated, but the exact amount is undefined. While Section 6.1 still discusses the Payment Schedule, and refers to increasing that amount after the Initial Term, the removal of the initial value that can only be found in Exhibit C makes these increase-related clauses unenforceable, which causes an internal contradiction.",

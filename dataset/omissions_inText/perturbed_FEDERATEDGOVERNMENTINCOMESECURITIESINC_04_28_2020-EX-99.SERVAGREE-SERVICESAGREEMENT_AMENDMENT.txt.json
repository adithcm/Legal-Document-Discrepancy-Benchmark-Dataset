                "explanation": "By removing the specific mention of 'coordination of client portfolios and related fixed income trade execution implementation and administration services', the amendment becomes vague about the specific changes to FASC's services. Section 1 proceeds to add this service. If there is a dispute, this could lead to argument that this service was not explicitly agreed upon.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'coordination of client portfolios and related fixed income trade execution implementation and administration' from the list of services provided by FASC, we create a contradiction. The 'WHEREAS' clause and other references might imply this service is included, but the explicitly listed services in Exhibit A omit it. This omission creates uncertainty regarding the scope of FASC's responsibilities and could be problematic if that coordination is needed.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'with respect to Accounts that are not investment companies registered under the 1940 Act' from the first sentence creates ambiguity. Now, one could interpret the first sentence as applying to all Accounts. This directly contradicts the second sentence, which states that the original agreement stays in effect for registered investment companies. This makes the applicability of the amendment unclear.",

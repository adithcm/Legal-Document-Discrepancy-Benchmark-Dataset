                "explanation": "By removing 'fully-paid up, royalty-free, worldwide non-exclusive', it creates an ambiguity because Section 4.3.2.3 references the Shortfall License as if its specific terms regarding payment and exclusivity are still defined. If not defined, enforcement is uncertain.",

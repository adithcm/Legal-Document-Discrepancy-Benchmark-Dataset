                "explanation": "The original text explicitly defines the Acceptable Use Policy and links it to a specific URL and future modifications detailed in Section 13.2. The modified text makes the definition vague, stating that IBM defines it and details are 'furnished upon request.' This creates an inconsistency if Section 13.2 is still referenced elsewhere in the contract concerning modifications to the 'Acceptable Use Policy' without a clearly defined initial policy. How are changes made to a policy that is not clearly defined? This change introduces ambiguity in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'if any, specified in Attachment A and applicable Service Option Attachments', the text implies that termination charges *always* apply when terminating for convenience. If Attachment A and the Service Option Attachments are silent on termination charges, or state 'no termination charges apply', this creates a direct contradiction. This creates a potential conflict because a 'termination charge' is referenced, but not defined. This ambiguity can lead to disputes over whether charges exist or not.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'specified herein, including the IBM perform security obligations identified in Section 8.0 of the Facilities Services Service Option Attachment' from 5.3(b) removes the reference to specific security obligations and links to Section 8.0, but this section still states IBM will implement 'security measures'. Similarly, removing 'numerous' and 'specified in Service Option Attachments' makes the offered security options and any means to configure said options for customer needs vague. If other sections reference Section 8.0 for security protocols or rely on service options attachments to enable or modify the provided security features, those references now contradict the current content in Section 5.3(b). This creates uncertainty regarding the contract's security requirements and enforcement.",

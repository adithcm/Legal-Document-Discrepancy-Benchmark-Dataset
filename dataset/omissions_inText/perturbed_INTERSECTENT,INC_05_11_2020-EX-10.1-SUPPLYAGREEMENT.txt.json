                "original_text": "1.2. \"Affiliate\" means any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with either Party hereto. For purpose of this definition, \"control\" shall mean ownership of over fifty percent (50%) of the equity capital, the outstanding voting securities or other ownership interest of an entity, or the right to receive over fifty percent (50%) of the profits or earnings of an entity. In the case of non-stock organizations, the term \"control\" shall mean the power to control the distribution of profits.",
                "changed_text": "1.2. \"Affiliate\" means any entity related to either Party hereto.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clearly specifies control as ownership of over 50% of equity or voting securities. The changed definition is vague and doesn't give any specific amount of 'control'. This creates uncertainty because the contract might later reference actions or obligations related to 'Affiliates' without a clear way to determine who qualifies.",

For each calendar year during the term of this Agreement, INTERSECT shall submit a twelve (12) month rolling forecast updated on a quarterly basis, broken down on a quarterly basis covering INTERSECT's anticipated requirements of API, each such forecast to be provided to HOVIONE at least ninety (90) days prior to the start of the relevant twelve (12) month period. The rolling forecast shall be for information purposes only and non- binding so long as the INTERSECT provides a blanket purchase order covering their demand for the next six (6) months. In the case that INTERSECT does not provide a blanket purchase order, the forecast will be considered binding. INTERSECT shall place all purchase orders with HOVIONE at least ninety (90) days in advance of required delivery to INTERSECT. Within five (5) days of receipt of a purchase order, HOVIONE shall notify INTERSECT in writing of its acceptance of the purchase order and confirm the delivery date. If the purchase order exceeds the Firm Forecasted amount, HOVIONE shall use commercially reasonable efforts to fill such order but shall not be in breach of this Agreement if HOVIONE does not supply the excess.",

                "explanation": "The original section defines the forecasting and purchase order mechanism, including when a forecast is considered binding (if no blanket purchase order is provided). The removal of the condition that forecast will be non- binding so long as the INTERSECT provides a blanket purchase order creates an inconsistency in the order process because it is not specified when HOVIONE should provide the API and what happens if they don't.",

Within thirty (30) calendar days of the arrival of each lot of API at the manufacturing facility designated by INTERSECT, INTERSECT shall inspect and test each lot of API at its own cost and expense. If, upon inspecting and testing the API, INTERSECT determines that a lot of API does not conform to the Product Specifications, then INTERSECT shall, within such thirty (30) day period, give HOVIONE written notice of such non-conformity (setting forth the details of such non-conformity):Unless HOVIONE objects, within 20 working days from the notice by INTERSECT, to the non-conformity INTERSECT will return the non-conforming API to HOVIONE. Any API rejected by INTERSECT may not be reshipped to INTERSECT except if the API is reprocessed according to the DMF. HOVIONE sole responsibility shall be to replace any non-conforming API within thirty (30) days of receiving the notice of non- conformity. Disputes between the Parties as to whether all or any part of a shipment rejected by INTERSECT materially conforms to the Product Specifications shall be resolved by a mutually acceptable third-party testing laboratory located in a neutral country. HOVIONE shall pay all the fees of the third-party laboratory, unless the third-party testing laboratory determines that the delivered API materially conforms to the Product Specifications, in which case INTERSECT shall pay all the fees of such third-party laboratory and also any additional costs that HOVIONE incurred in providing replacement material.",

                "explanation": "The original section establishes a clear process for handling API that does not conform to product specification, including how INTERSECT can return the API to HOVIONE if non-conformity is discovered. Removing this clause eliminates the responsibility of HOVIONE to replace any non-conforming API and create a contradiction to the statement that INTERSECT can return the product. Also, It is not clear who will pay for the third party laboratory test.",

                "original_text": "The energy saving service fee is paid in the form of electricity fee. The calculation basis of energy saving service fee is as follows: average operational time is 8,000 hours per annually; if the annual average operational time was less than 8,000 hours due to the reasons of Party B, the operational time is calculated as 8,000 hours per year; if the annual average operational time was less than 8,000 hours due to the reasons by Party A, the operational time is calculated based on the actual operational hours.",
                "changed_text": "The energy saving service fee is paid in the form of electricity fee. The calculation basis of energy saving service fee will be subject to further negotiations.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific calculation based on operational hours, the contract now vaguely states that the calculation basis will be subject to further negotiations, creating uncertainty and potential disputes regarding the amount of energy saving service fee to be paid. This contradicts the original intention of having a clearly defined calculation method.",

                "original_text": "The cooperation model is BO model. The expected total project cost is 176 million RMB. For the amount of electricity generated up to 800 million KWH after the project is put into operation, it shall be charged of the energy saving service fee at 0.40 RMB/KWH. After 800 million KWH, it shall be charged energy saving service fee with the rate of 0.20 RMB/KWH.",
                "changed_text": "The cooperation model is BO model. The expected total project cost is 176 million RMB. The energy saving service fee will be determined based on prevailing market rates.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies rates for energy saving service fees based on KWH milestones. The modified text removes these specific rates and replaces them with a vague reference to 'prevailing market rates.' This introduces ambiguity and contradicts any later sections that might rely on the original fee structure for financial calculations or dispute resolution.",

                "original_text": "From the starting day of the project, Party B must ensure that the coking system works properly and working hours of the CDQ system must be no less than 8,000 hours/year. Party A must ensure the waste heat power generation system of CDQ working hours no less than 7,200 hours/year.",
                "changed_text": "From the starting day of the project, both parties will strive to maintain optimal operational efficiency.",
                "explanation": "Removing the defined minimum working hours creates an internal contradiction. While the original clause held both parties accountable for specific operational targets, the new text introduces a vague aspirational statement which creates uncertainty regarding operational expectations and liabilities.",

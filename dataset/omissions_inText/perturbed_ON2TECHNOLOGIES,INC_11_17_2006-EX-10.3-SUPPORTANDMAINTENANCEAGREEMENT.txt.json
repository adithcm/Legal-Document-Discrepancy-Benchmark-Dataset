                "original_text": "1.13 \"Program Errors\" means any defect in the Flix Software that 1) results in the loss or corruption of data on a user's system, 2) causes the Flix Software to become unstable, 3) eliminates the user's ability to perform intended functions in the Flix Software, or 4) causes the operating system or any other programs to become unstable or cease to function. The defect must be caused by the Flix Software in the form provided by Wildform as a Deliverable.",
                "changed_text": "1.13 \"Program Errors\" means defects in the Flix Software.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clearly delineates what constitutes a \"Program Error\" with specific examples like data loss or system instability. The modified definition removes these specific criteria, making the term vague and open to interpretation. This creates an inconsistency because Section 3.2 and Exhibit A still reference 'Program Errors' but without a clear understanding of what they are, leading to potential disputes on what Wildform is actually obligated to fix.",

                "changed_text": "3.2 Program Errors. During the Term, Wildform may address software issues as deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original Section 3.2 creates a clear obligation for Wildform to resolve 'Program Errors' as defined and detailed in Exhibit A. The modified version replaces this obligation with a discretionary action ('may address'), introducing ambiguity. This contradicts Exhibit A, which outlines specific response and correction times for Program Errors. Now, it's unclear if Wildform is actually required to adhere to the timelines and resolutions specified in Exhibit A, since their action is no longer mandatory.",

                "changed_text": "The support obligations of Wildform are subject to resource availability.",
                "explanation": "In the original Exhibit A section 2, the technical support is clearly defined by time and email limits. The modified text removes the specific maximum hours and emails, and changes this to resource availability. Now, On2 can claim that Wildform still has the same obligations while Wildform can claim that it doesn't have the proper resources to complete it because the definition is now so vague. This change can create potential for future litigation.",

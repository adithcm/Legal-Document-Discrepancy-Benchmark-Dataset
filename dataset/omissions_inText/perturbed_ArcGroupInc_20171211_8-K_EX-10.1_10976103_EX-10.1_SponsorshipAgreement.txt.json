                "original_text": "3. Annual Fees; Playoff Payment.   (a) In consideration for the Benefits, during each Contract Year of the Term, Sponsor shall pay Club, in accordance with this Section 3(a) and Section 2(d) of the Terms and Conditions, the amount set forth next to the applicable Contract Year below (the \"Annual Fee\").   First Contract Year (2018/19):  $ 200,000  Second Contract Year (2019/20):  $ 204,000  Third Contract Year (2020/21):  $ 208,080  Fourth Contract Year (2021/22):  $ 212,240  Fifth Contract Year (2022/23):  $ 216,490    Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) equal installments, each due on or prior to the 1st of each month between June and November of the applicable Contract Year.",

Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in installments as agreed upon between both parties.",
                "explanation": "By removing the pre-defined Annual Fee amounts and the specific payment schedule, we create an omission that directly contradicts the intent of Section 3(a), which establishes a clear financial obligation. The new phrasing provides no certainty or method of payment and conflicts with the reference in section 5 to complying with the Terms and Conditions, where payment schedules are usually specified. This change introduces significant ambiguity regarding financial responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Exhibit B (Terms and Conditions), and changing it to 'common industry practices' we are removing a crucial definitional component of the contract. Section 5 refers to compliance with the Terms and Conditions which are now undefined in the contract, potentially invalidating the need to comply.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the requirement to comply with the 'Terms and Conditions' and replacing it with 'discretion of club', we are creating an inconsistancy. The contract refers to annual fees in Section 3(a) and playoffs payments in Section 3(c) being paid in accordance with Section 2(d) of the Terms and Conditions. The fees are now subject to Club's discretion, potentially leading to disagreements and disputes regarding the financial considerations of the agreement.",

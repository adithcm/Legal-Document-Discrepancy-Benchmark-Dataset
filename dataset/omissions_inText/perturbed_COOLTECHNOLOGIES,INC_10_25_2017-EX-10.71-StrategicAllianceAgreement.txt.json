                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be effective as of the date first set forth above and, shall expire on the later of (i) five (5) years from the date hereof, or (ii) with respect to any projects identified in any contract for which VET TECH is billing the client directly, upon the completion of COOL TECH's Services and receipt of payment by COOL TECH from VET TECH for said services. This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive one year periods unless either party gives written notice of termination to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of expiration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall be earlier terminated (x) by mutual agreement of the parties, or (y) at any time upon sixty (60) days advance written notice to the other party.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'or (ii) with respect to any projects identified in any contract for which VET TECH is billing the client directly, upon the completion of COOL TECH's Services and receipt of payment by COOL TECH from VET TECH for said services', the agreement now states a definitive end date of five years, potentially conflicting with ongoing projects billed directly by VET TECH. Later references to project completion and payment terms will now be ambiguous if those projects extend beyond the five-year term.",

Neither VET TECH nor COOL TECH shall be required hereunder to defend, indemnify or hold harmless the other and/or its partners, shareholders, directors, officers, directors, employees and agents, or any of them, from any liability resulting from the negligence or wrongful acts of the party seeking indemnification or of any third- party.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'resulting solely and directly from the indemnifying party's negligence or willful misconduct' from the first sentence of the article, VET TECH and COOL TECH must indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other, even if it does not result from negligence. However, the second sentence states that there is no requirement to indemnify from any liability resulting from the negligence or wrongful acts. This omission creates a contradiction concerning the circumstances in which indemnification is required, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

FEES\n\n3.1 The Company will pay the Consultant basic remuneration for its services in the sum of $10,000 per month (the \"Consulting Fee\") commencing on the 1st day of February, 2020, and payable on the last day of each month thereafter up to and including the 31st day of January, 2025, together with any such increments thereto as the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company may from time to time determine. In addition, the Company will pay to the Consultant all reasonable expenses of the Consultant as agreed to from time to time which are incurred by the Consultant in delivery of the Services, based on monthly invoices submitted to the Company, including copies of all paid receipts; plus harmonized sales taxes or goods and services taxes, as the case may be, in addition to the Consulting Fees, which taxes will be remitted by the Consultant to the Canada Revenue Agency.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific amount ($10,000 per month) and payment schedule, the contract now lacks a clearly defined payment amount, but still references 'Consulting Fees'. This introduces uncertainty as to how much the Consultant will be paid and when, creating potential disputes and making enforcement ambiguous. The contract still mentions 'increments thereto' which implies a base consulting fee, but that has been removed.",

                "explanation": "By changing the termination payment clause in section 5.1(b) from a fixed calculation (annual Consulting Fee) to 'a termination payment to be determined by the Board of Directors', this creates a contradiction. It removes a clear, enforceable standard and replaces it with a discretionary decision by the Board, creating uncertainty and possible future disagreements. Clause (c) offers a fixed amount, creating an inconsistency.",

At such time that ***** percent (*****%) of the Guarantee Forfeiture Payment is recouped by Licensee, Fox shall earn and Licensee shall pay to Fox Royalties at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee's gross receipts from Licensee's sale, license, distribution or other exploitation of the IN HER SHOES Wireless Product.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific definition of 'Guarantee Forfeiture Payment' and the exact percentages for recoupment and royalty rates, this creates ambiguity. Later sections might refer to recouping the 'Guarantee Forfeiture Payment' or specific royalty percentages, but without the definition, enforcement becomes uncertain. The specific financial details are removed, creating a contradiction with other clauses expecting these numbers to exist.",

                "original_text": "In consideration for all duties and obligations contained herein, on or before the Effective date above, Company shall issue to Consultant a warrant to purchase 4,400,000 shares of the Company's common stock, which is equal to 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company at the time of the grant. (a) The exercise price for the warrants shall be $0.075 per share, and shall not increase for any reason. (b) Upon achievement of certain milestones, the Warrants shall immediately vest upon any of the following events which may occur at any time (\"Milestones\"): 1) 10% upon the execution of this Agreement; and attached PR contract. 2) 20% upon the Company's receipt of a net equity investment of $1 million into the Company from any source (\"Included Investors\"), except those with a prior relationship with Company or its agents; 3) 20% upon the Company's receipt of an additional net equity investment of $1 million (an aggregate of $2 million) from Included Investors; 4) 20% upon the closing price for the Company's common stock closes above $80 (eighty cents) per share for 10 out of any 20 consecutive trading days; 5) 15% upon the announcement and consummation of a strategic relationship with at least two \"A-List Celebrity\" upon terms and conditions mutually agreed upon with the Company and Consultant. 6) 15% upon the launch and initial distribution of a Giggles N' Hugs branded product line, which may be clothing, furniture, frozen food, toys or similar merchandising (a \"Product Line).",

(a) The exercise price for the warrants will be determined by the board. (b) Upon achievement of certain milestones, the Warrants shall immediately vest as outlined in the vesting schedule.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies the exact number of warrants, the exercise price, and the vesting milestones. The modified text removes these specifics and instead refers to Exhibit A and general vesting schedules, creating uncertainty. The reference to Exhibit A implies details exist elsewhere, but if Exhibit A doesn't define them clearly or is inconsistent with other parts of the agreement, it creates a significant contradiction and enforcement challenges.",

(a) In addition, this Agreement will terminate upon the following: (1) Completion of work or period of work provided in this agreement. (2) Termination by Company or Consultant for any material breach, which is not cured within 30 days after written notice of any such material breach from the non-breaching party, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. (3) By the Company, at its option, if at least two Milestones (excluding Milestones 1) are not achieved within 12 months from the Effective Date.",

(2) Termination by Company or Consultant for any breach, which is not cured within 30 days after written notice from the non-breaching party.",
                "explanation": "The original termination clause includes a specific condition allowing the Company to terminate if certain milestones are not met within 12 months. Removing this condition creates a contradiction if Section 2 still mentions these milestones as criteria for warrant vesting. If those milestones are critical for the consultant's compensation, removing the company's right to terminate if they aren't achieved creates a disconnect and potential dispute.",

                "original_text": "Consultant will not, during the Term, and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, recruit or promote the solicitation or recruitment of any employee or consultant of the Company for the purpose of encouraging that employee or consultant to leave the Company's employ or sever an agreement for services; or (ii) solicit, participate in or promote the solicitation of any of the Company's clients, customers, or prospective customers with whom Consultant had a Material Contact (hereinafter defined) and/or regarding whom Consultant received Confidential Information, for the purpose of providing products or services (\"Competitive Products/Services\"). \"Material Contact\" means interaction between Consultant and the customer, client or prospective customer within one year prior to Consultant's separation of services from the Company that takes place to manage, service or further the business relationship. This limitation is not intended to limit the Company's right to prevent misappropriation of its Confidential Information beyond the non-solicitation period. Consultant and Company agree that if any court of competent jurisdiction shall for any reason conclude that any portion of this non-solicitation covenant shall be too restrictive, the court shall determine and apply lesser restrictions, it being the intent of the parties that some such restrictions shall be applicable for the protection of Company and its shareholders.",

                "explanation": "The omission of the clause regarding soliciting clients and defining 'Material Contact' creates a significant gap. If other sections of the agreement, particularly those regarding Confidential Information (Section 5) and Property of Company (Section 7), implicitly assume the existence of a non-solicitation clause covering clients, the deletion creates a contradiction. The consultant is still bound by confidentiality regarding client information, but can now freely solicit those clients, weakening the protection intended by the confidentiality provisions. The reference to 'this limitation' becomes ambiguous.",

                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.1      \"AB rated\" means, with respect to any Product (as defined in the          Dovonex(R) Agreement), a pharmaceutical product which is an AB-rated          equivalent to the Product, as defined in the 22nd edition of Approved          Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations issued by the          United States Department of Health and Human Services.",
                "changed_text": "1.1      \"AB rated\" means, with respect to any Product, a pharmaceutical product which is considered equivalent.",
                "explanation": "The modification removes the specific reference to the 'Dovonex(R) Agreement' and the detailed definition from the 'Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations' (the Orange Book). While the contract might elsewhere require compliance with FDA standards or reference AB-rated products, this omission introduces ambiguity. If other sections still assume the detailed FDA definition, a contradiction arises, because the term is now loosely defined.",

                "changed_text": "1.22     \"Trademark\" means any trademark selected for the Combination Product.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'the trademark Dovobet(R)' this creates ambiguity. While later sections might refer specifically to 'Dovobet(R)', its explicit inclusion in the definition of 'Trademark' is removed. This omission could lead to disputes if GALEN later claims rights over the Dovobet(R) trademark based on activities performed under the agreement, as the contract no longer clearly establishes LEO's initial ownership.",

Furthermore, LEO will perform any and all additional studies, required          specifically by the FDA and will bear all costs and expenses associated          therewith except for the obligation of GALEN described in Article 3.1.\n\n         A development plan is attached as Appendix I",

                "explanation": "The omission of 'any and all' before 'preclinical, clinical and other studies', removal of specificity regarding FDA-required studies and omitting the reference to Appendix I ('A development plan is attached as Appendix I') creates significant uncertainty. This omission directly contradicts potential assumptions or requirements in other sections that rely on a defined development plan or a clear allocation of responsibility for FDA-mandated studies. This ambiguity impacts enforceability if disputes arise regarding the scope of LEO's obligations.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'not separately commercialized by the MS Provider Group (as defined below)' significantly broadens the definition of MS Licensed Materials. Later sections (e.g., 2.1) grant rights based on this definition. This omission could lead to a contradiction if MS later commercializes some of the materials, as the original agreement excluded these from the license grant, whereas the altered version does not.",

Section 2 grants licenses to use, modify, copy, create derivative works of, and sublicense the Licensed Materials. Without the explicit disclaimer in Section 3.1, a reasonable interpretation is that the grantor must provide the materials to enable exercising these licensed rights, potentially contradicting the explicit intention of the original contract.",

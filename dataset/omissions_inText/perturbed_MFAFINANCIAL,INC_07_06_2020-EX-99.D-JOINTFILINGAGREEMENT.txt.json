                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing,' the agreement's legal basis becomes unclear. Later sections implicitly assume compliance with SEC rules by referencing Schedule 13D. Removing this clause creates a contradiction: the agreement purports to be a joint filing but omits the mandatory inclusion of the agreement as an exhibit, making it unenforceable under SEC rules. Other sections still refer to Schedule 13D, thus creating the uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be executed in a manner consistent with standard business practices.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specified that multiple counterparts are acceptable, each considered an original. Replacing it with 'standard business practices' creates ambiguity. If 'standard business practices' is not explicitly defined elsewhere, it is uncertain if counterpart signatures are considered valid, which is critical for enforceability. This creates a potential contradiction if some signatories use counterparts. Other sections that depend on the validity of the agreement based on the original terms now have an implied contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 'as of July 6, 2020' creates ambiguity about when the agreement becomes effective. If the rest of the document refers to actions taken under this agreement with dates relative to the original execution date (July 6, 2020), and that original date is removed, those references become contradictory since there's no established baseline date.",

(i) The Company agrees that, in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Board shall take such actions as are necessary to (i) reduce the size of the Board from ten (10) to seven (7) Directors, effective as of the 2020 Annual Meeting, and (ii) nominate each of the New Directors and Wayne Barr, Jr., Warren H. Gfeller and Philip A. Falcone (collectively, the \"2020 Director Slate\") for election to the Board at the 2020 Annual Meeting for a term expiring at the Company's 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \"2021 Annual Meeting\"). The Board, based on the information provided to it, has determined that each member of the 2020 Director Slate would (i) qualify as an \"independent director\" under the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and (ii) satisfy the guidelines and policies with respect to service on the Board applicable to all non- management directors (other than Mr. Falcone). The Company agrees that, provided that each member of the 2020 Director Slate is able and willing to serve on the Board, (i) the Board will unanimously recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote to elect each member of the 2020 Director Slate as a director of the Company at the 2020 Annual Meeting, (ii) the Company will use its reasonable best efforts (which will include the solicitation of proxies) to obtain the election of the 2020 Director Slate at the 2020 Annual Meeting and (iii) the Company will use its best efforts to resist, discourage and defend against any attempt, solicitation or action by any stockholder of the Company to remove any member of the 2020 Director Slate prior to the 2021 Annual Meeting.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific list of nominees (New Directors, Wayne Barr, Jr., Warren H. Gfeller and Philip A. Falcone) designated as the “2020 Director Slate”, subsequent references to efforts to support the election of the “2020 Director Slate” become vague. While the text still mentions the company will recommend that stockholders vote to elect 'each director nominee', the removal of the definition for the “2020 Director Slate” creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding what constitutes that slate and the extent of the Company's obligations to support it. This omission contradicts the intent of the original text, and could also create a point of contention if the company does not support the election of a person that the MG Capital Parties believed to be part of the 2020 Director Slate.",

                "explanation": "The omission of the clause '(i) limit the power of any director of the Company to act in accordance with his or her fiduciary duties or otherwise in accordance with applicable law' introduces a contradiction. Without this clause, the non-disparagement clause could be interpreted as restricting a director's ability to fulfill their fiduciary duties, particularly if those duties require them to disclose negative information about the Company or its representatives. This would directly conflict with their legal obligations as a director. Another part of the same section references section 5. This creates an internal contradiction.",

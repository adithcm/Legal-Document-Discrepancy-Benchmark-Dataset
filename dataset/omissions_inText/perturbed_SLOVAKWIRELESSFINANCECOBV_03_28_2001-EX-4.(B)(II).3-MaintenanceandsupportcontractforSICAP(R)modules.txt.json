                "explanation": "The removal of the defined response times for each priority level (emergency, high, medium, low) creates an ambiguity. Section 7.2 (Definitions) refers to 'Response time' as 'The time between the receipt of the notification by Sicap Ltd of an incident or problem and the initiation by the HotLine of a solution for the incident or problem,' but now the actual *time* is undefined. This contradicts the intention of having specific, measurable response times and makes enforcement uncertain.",

                "original_text": "For each Category of Services referenced in Exhibit A, Adviser shall pay FASC a Services Fee, payable monthly in arrears, determined according to the following formula:\n\nServices Fee = Cost of Services x Adviser's Assets under Management Total Assets Under Management x (1 + Applicable Margin)\n\nWhere:\n\n\"Cost of Services\" is FASC's total Operating Costs incurred in providing the applicable Category of Services during the month to all investment advisers for which FASC provides that Category of Services.\n\n\"Adviser's Assets under Management\" is the total average assets under management for the month for all Accounts or portions thereof for which the Adviser acts as investment adviser or subadvisor and which utilize the Category of Services.\n\n\"Total Assets under Management\" is the total average assets under management for the month for all Accounts or portions thereof for which all investment advisers (including the Adviser) to which FASC provides that Category of Services act as investment adviser or subadviser and which utilize the Category of Services.\n\n\"Applicable Margin\" is 0.10.\n\n\"Operating Costs\" means all operating expenses and non-operating expenses of FASC for the cost center(s) providing the applicable Category of Services.",

                "explanation": "The original Exhibit B outlines a specific formula for calculating service fees. By removing the formula and replacing it with 'mutually agreed-amount', the contract introduces ambiguity. While Exhibit A still references categories of Services, the method to determine fees is now unclear, leading to a contradiction between the expectation of a defined calculation method (implied by referencing categories) and the reality of a negotiable amount.",

                "explanation": "Section 5(b) outlines specific termination conditions for registered investment companies under the 1940 Act, providing extra protections and approval requirements. By removing Section 5(b), the contract creates a contradiction. While Section 5(a) describes general termination conditions, the specific, stricter conditions related to the 1940 Act registered companies are no longer present. This omission implies that the general conditions apply to all accounts, including registered investment companies, contradicting the stricter regulatory framework that should govern them.",

                "explanation": "Section 3 initially specifies adherence to the 1940 Act's Section 31(a) and Rule 31a-2 for recordkeeping. Removing these references creates a contradiction. FASC is still obligated to create and maintain necessary records, but the specific requirements dictated by the 1940 Act are eliminated. This suggests a deviation from regulatory compliance, which can lead to uncertainty, especially in areas where other sections of the contract might assume compliance with these regulations.",

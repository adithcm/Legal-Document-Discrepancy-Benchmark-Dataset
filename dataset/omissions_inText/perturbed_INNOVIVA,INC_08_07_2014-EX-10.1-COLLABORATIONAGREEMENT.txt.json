                "explanation": "By removing the reference to \"Pooled Compounds (including any Theravance New Compounds and Replacement Compounds, as applicable) identified in Section 4.1\", the modified text creates ambiguity regarding the specific compounds that qualify as Collaboration Products. Section 4.1 is the main section to identify the Pooled Compounds. It introduces uncertainty in enforcement because it's unclear whether all Long-Acting β2 Adrenoceptor Agonists fall under the definition, potentially leading to disputes about which products are subject to the agreement's terms.",

Diligent Efforts requires that: (i) each Party promptly assign responsibility for such obligations to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) each Party set and consistently seek to achieve specific and meaningful objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) each Party consistently make and implement decisions and allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"and as if there were no Competing Product owned by such Party, in accordance with the Development principles more specifically outlined in Section 4.2.4.\", the definition of Diligent Efforts becomes less stringent. It's now unclear if a Party must act without considering its own competing products, potentially allowing GSK to prioritize its own products over the Collaboration Products. The removed reference to Section 4.2.4, where development principles are outlined, further weakens the obligation. This creates an internal contradiction because the agreement may elsewhere assume a higher standard of effort.",

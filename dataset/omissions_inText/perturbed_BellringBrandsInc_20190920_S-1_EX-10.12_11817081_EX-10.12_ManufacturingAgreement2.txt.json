                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") of [***] (\"Units\") for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV will be determined annually by mutual agreement of both parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase products (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies the MAOV as [***] Units for the initial period and links future MAOV to Heritage's facility approval. The modified clause removes the specific unit quantity, introduces 'mutual agreement' for annual determination, and removes the facility approval contingency, creating uncertainty. It introduces a contradiction because Section 2 still refers to MAOV but the defined volume is now subject to agreement rather than a fixed number, making enforcement ambiguous if no agreement is reached.",

                "explanation": "By specifying that only terms, conditions, and covenants 'related to pricing' remain in full force, we omit the implication that all other sections except the altered Section 1 still apply. If, elsewhere in the original agreement, things such as delivery terms, quality control and etc. are referenced, that creates ambiguity as to whether those elements are still applicable or not.",

                "explanation": "By removing the references to 'Amendment No. 1,' 'Amendment Effective Date,' and the original 'Agreement,' the document's relationship to the original agreement and its effective date are obscured. If other sections still refer to the original 'Agreement' or 'Amendment Effective Date', this creates a contradiction and ambiguity regarding the document's legal standing and enforceability.",

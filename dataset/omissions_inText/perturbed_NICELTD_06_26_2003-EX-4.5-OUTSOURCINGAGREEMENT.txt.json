Throughout all the assembly phases of a Product                during the Production Lead Time and any time before the Due Date,                NICE may issue Contractor with a Change Order. The issuance of                such Change Order and the execution by Contractor of such Change                Order, shall be in accordance with the provisions hereunder. Upon                issuance of a Change Order, Contractor will immediately execute                it and the Product price shall change in accordance with APPENDIX                C.

The Product price                will be as after the implementation of the Change Order. For                Change Orders issued prior to commencement of the Production Lead                Time for any Product no charge will be incurred by NICE. Without                derogating from the aforementioned, Contractor will not charge                NICE for Change Orders during the first three (3) months of                production.",

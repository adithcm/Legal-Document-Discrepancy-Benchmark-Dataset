                "original_text": "1.12 \"Personal Injury Compensation\" refers to the compensation provided in the Interpretation of the Supreme People's Court on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in the Trial of Cases on Personal Injury Compensation.",
                "changed_text": "1.12 \"Personal Injury Compensation\" refers to compensation that may be required in certain circumstances as determined at Party A's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly references a legal definition for 'Personal Injury Compensation.' The modified text removes that reference, introducing ambiguity and contradiction. It suggests that the compensation is discretionary and determined by Party A, which contradicts established legal standards. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as the defined term no longer aligns with the implied legal requirements within the broader context of the agreement, specifically section 3.2.15.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates the use of a specific Financial Leasing Agreement template provided by Party A. By removing this clause, Party B is no longer obligated to use the template. However, Section 3.2.9 requires Party B to provide Party A with an original copy of the Financial Leasing Agreement \"signed by and between Party B and the Driver User, together with its annexes of Vehicle Handover List and Financial Leasing Confirmation Letter, etc.\" and Section 3.2.10 states that Party B must fulfill its obligations to the Driver User by means of strictly following the template. Removing the requirement to use the template creates an internal contradiction making enforcement ambiguous because the later sections still refer to the Financial Leasing Agreement and its required annexes as if it's a template to be followed.",

In case that Party A deducts any amount from the deposit, it shall issue a corresponding receipt to Party B.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Party A can deduct liquidated damages, overdue fines, and compensations from the deposit if Party B breaches the agreement or platform rules. The modified text removes this clause, while later sections (4.4, 4.5, 4.6) still refer to the process and consequences of deducting from the deposit for breaches. This omission creates an in-text contradiction, as the basis for deductions is no longer explicitly stated, but the process of deduction is still outlined, leading to uncertainty about under what conditions a deduction is permissible. The enforceability of deposit-related clauses becomes questionable.",

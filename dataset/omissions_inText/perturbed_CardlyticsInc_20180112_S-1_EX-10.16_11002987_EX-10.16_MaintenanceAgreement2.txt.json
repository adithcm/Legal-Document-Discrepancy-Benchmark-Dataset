Fees for Customizations:\n\n[SPECIFY TIME AND MATERIALS RATES ([Indicate any \"not to exceed\" limit on T&M Customization costs) OR FIXED PRICE]\n\nIf the proposed price Is Increased by Supplier upon delivery to Bank of America of detailed specifications or at any other time hereafter, Bank of America may terminate this Schedule and shall receive a refund of all amounts previously paid hereunder.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'Bank of America may terminate this Schedule and shall receive a refund of all amounts previously paid hereunder', a contradiction arises. The agreement still discusses potential price increases, implying a financial arrangement, but the condition of receiving a refund is omitted. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as Bank of America's rights upon price increase are now ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence 'The detailed specifications so delivered shall be incorporated herein when approved by Bank of America', we create a contradiction. The agreement mentions the delivery of detailed specifications, suggesting they are crucial. Omitting the clause about incorporation upon approval introduces ambiguity as to their legal standing within the agreement. This impacts enforcement because without formally incorporating specifications, their enforceability is undermined.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'Schedule A', and not providing the specific name of the new schedule, it makes it difficult to understand where the environment for this customization is described, thus creating a contradiction, since the environment details are not well defined.",

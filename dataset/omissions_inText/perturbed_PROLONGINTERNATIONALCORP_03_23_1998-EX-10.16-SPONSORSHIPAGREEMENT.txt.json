The drivers for the 33 Winston Cup events to be held -------- during the 1998 season in which Prolong is an associate sponsor shall be Sterling Marlin (40), Joe Nemechek (42) and Wally Dallenbach Jr. (46), unless due to injury or for some unforeseeable reason, either is unable to drive, in which event Sabco shall choose a substitute driver to drive their respective Sabco/Prolong-sponsored entry. For the duration of this agreement, Sabco reserves the right to substitute or replace any of the aforementioned drivers listed without prior notice to Prolong or prior approval from Prolong.",

                "explanation": "By removing the named drivers (Sterling Marlin, Joe Nemechek, and Wally Dallenbach Jr.) and replacing them with a vague 'drivers determined by Sabco', this creates a contradiction. Later sections, such as section 3 which references driver appearances and section 6 which discusses media and public relations for the Sabco No. 40, 42, and 46 cars, now lack a clear link to specific drivers. This undermines the value of the agreement to Prolong, as the drivers involved are undefined, causing uncertainty in enforcement of promotional commitments.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specified amount ( $[ * ]) and payment schedule and replacing it with a reference to 'Schedule A', this creates a contradiction if 'Schedule A' does not exist or is incomplete in the contract. Without explicit compensation details in the main body of the contract, the obligation to pay is ambiguous, and later references to the agreed services become difficult to enforce as the amount is not determined. This renders the agreement commercially uncertain.",

Sabco will provide transportation of show car and will provide an attendant to stay with the car during its display period. For any show car appearance requested by Prolong over and above the five (5) free appearances, Sabco will make available unto Prolong a show car at a discounted rate of [ * ] Dollars ($ [ * ]) per day. All travel days to and from the site of a show car appearance, as well as the actual day upon which show car is on display will be charged as a \"show date\".

                "explanation": "The removal of the specific number of free show car appearances (five), as well as the removal of the discounted rate for additional appearances, creates uncertainty. While the modified text still mentions show car appearances, the lack of specifics undermines the value and enforceability of this aspect of the sponsorship. The absence of a defined quantity of free appearances or a set rate for extra days creates ambiguity in what is being offered, especially given Section 5 initially quantified this provision. Furthermore, if Schedule A contains the discounted rate, it should be in the current text.",

Dr. Murray will receive an annual royalty on net sales (defined as gross sales minus returns) for any products (the \"Dr. Murray Products\") developed by Dr. Murray for EHN for as long as the Dr. Murray Products are being sold. The Dr. Murray Products will be listed on Schedule A attached hereto as they are developed and added to product portfolio. During each year of this agreement, Dr. Murray will be paid no later than the 30st day of January based on the cumulative Net Sales of the Dr. Murray Products for the preceding 12 months based upon the following scale:\n\nNet Sales per 12 Months Royalty\n$2,000,001 to $3,500,000 $150,000\n$3,500,001 to $5,000,000 $250,000\n$5,000,001 to $10,000,000 $350,000\n$10,000,001 to $25,000,000 $500,000\n$25,000,001 to $50,000,000 $1,000,000\n$50,000,001 to $75,000,000 $1,500,000\n$75,000,001 to $100,000,000 $2,000,000\nGreater than $100,000,000 $2,500,000",

                "explanation": "By removing the royalty scale, the contract still mandates royalty payments but lacks a method for calculating the amount. This creates an internal contradiction because Dr. Murray is entitled to royalties, but there's no enforceable mechanism to determine how much he should receive. This omission makes the royalty clause vague and unenforceable, while the agreement still states that Dr. Murray should get the payment, but does not state how much the value should be.",

(b) Except as otherwise stated herein as pertaining only to a Services Term, this Agreement shall remain in effect for ten years, unless terminated in accordance with Sections 6.1 (a) or 6.2(b). For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intent of the parties that subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the royalty payments set out above shall continue in perpetuity for as long as the Dr. Murray Products are being sold.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intent of the parties that subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the royalty payments set out above shall continue in perpetuity for as long as the Dr. Murray Products are being sold', we are creating an implicit contradiction. The contract defines a term of 10 years, but elsewhere discusses royalty payments (Article 5) which were *intended* to continue in perpetuity. Without this clarifying clause, it's unclear if royalty payments cease after the 10-year term, despite the ongoing sale of products.",

                "explanation": "By omitting '25,000' and 'at their then fair market value', the agreement still states EHS will provide Dr. Murray with options to purchase shares, but the quantity of shares and price per share are omitted. This omission means the 'Options' clause can be challenged as not defining all key terms. While options are still granted, there is no method on how the options work, creating a potential legal dispute.",

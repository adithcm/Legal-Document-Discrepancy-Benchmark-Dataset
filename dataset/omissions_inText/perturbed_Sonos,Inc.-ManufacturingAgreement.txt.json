                "original_text": "1.49. \"Sonos Sourced Component(s)\" means all Third Party Components required for the manufacture of Products that the pricing and supply contract, including all terms and conditions, are negotiated and controlled by Sonos. IAC shall procure Sonos Sourced Components at the pricing, terms and conditions as directed by Sonos, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Parties. Sonos Sourced Components are listed in the attached Statement of Works, and may be updated from time to time in writing by Sonos to IAC.",

IAC shall procure Sonos Sourced Components as directed by Sonos, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Parties. Sonos Sourced Components are listed in the attached Statement of Works, and may be updated from time to time in writing by Sonos to IAC.",
                "explanation": "By removing that the pricing and supply contracts for Sonos Sourced Components are managed by Sonos creates an ambiguity. The definition now implies Sonos directs *what* to procure, but not necessarily at *what price or terms*. This could lead to disputes over pricing and supply contracts in Section 7 related to component pricing.",

IAC agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain Sonos Tools in good, satisfactory working condition and to keep Sonos Tools fully covered under IAC's property insurance at all times and without expense to Sonos. IAC will be responsible for physical loss of or damage to the Sonos Tools while in the possession or control of IAC. IAC is solely responsible for installing, testing, and maintaining Sonos Tools in its control in good working condition and in compliance with applicable manufacturing specifications, for purchasing and maintaining spare parts to repair such Sonos Tools with a minimum of downtime, and for any risk of loss in connection with the Sonos Tools. Normal maintenance of Sonos Tools will be at Sonos' expense. In the event that a Sonos Tool is damaged beyond what is considered normal wear and tear, it shall be the responsibility of IAC or its designated suppliers to notify Sonos within one (1) working day. It shall be the [*] responsibility of [*] to bear the full repair or replacement cost of a damaged Sonos Tool, [*]. All Sonos Tool repairs shall be made to the satisfaction of applicable manufacturing specifications.",

                "explanation": "By omitting 'and to keep Sonos Tools fully covered under IAC's property insurance at all times and without expense to Sonos. IAC will be responsible for physical loss of or damage to the Sonos Tools while in the possession or control of IAC.' it creates a contradiction. Because IAC is still 'responsible for physical loss of or damage,' but does not have insurance, and IAC's liability is limited in Section 14, it is unclear who bears the actual risk/cost of damage or loss to the Tools.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'all the Component(s) procured by IAC, and any finished and work-in-process Products provided such Components and Products liabilities were incurred in compliance with this Agreement', it introduces a contradiction with Section 7.9 on Component Procurement, Supply Management, Component Buffer Inventory, and Excess Components. Section 7.9 outlines responsibilities of IAC and Sonos regarding Component procurement. If Sonos terminates for convenience, it becomes ambiguous who is responsible for Excess Components, as the clause limiting liability for these components has been removed. This creates uncertainty and could lead to disputes.",

                "original_text": "As consideration for the benefits it receives under this Agreement, Torvec shall provide the following to Vendor: See Exhibit A The schedule set forth in Exhibit A will constitute invoicing for the events. Notwithstanding the above, Torvec may, in its sole discretion, cancel its participation in any of the above-referenced events by notifying Vendor of such cancellation not later than two weeks prior to the due date(s) for payment hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "As consideration for the benefits it receives under this Agreement, Torvec shall provide consideration as verbally agreed upon. Notwithstanding the above, Torvec may, in its sole discretion, cancel its participation in any of the above-referenced events by notifying Vendor of such cancellation.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'Exhibit A' and replacing it with 'verbally agreed upon', the contract becomes vague. Later sections referring to payment schedules and event participation now lack a clear basis, leading to uncertainty. The two-week notification period is also removed, creating a contradiction with any assumed notification period based on prior discussions.",

                "original_text": "Vendor shall maintain insurance for not less than the following limits and coverage with duly licensed insurance companies having an A.M. Best rating of A-, X or better. In addition to covering all of the normal operations of Vendor, this insurance shall cover all of the activities and events described under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Vendor shall maintain insurance coverage. In addition to covering all of the normal operations of Vendor, this insurance shall cover all of the activities and events described under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the insurance coverage details (specific limits, A.M. Best rating requirement) creates an ambiguity. The contract still mandates insurance for the activities, but the level of coverage is undefined. This contradicts any implied expectation of substantial coverage given the nature of racing events mentioned elsewhere.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may change its address for notice.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'by giving written notice to the other party,' the contract lacks clarity on how address changes should be communicated. This omission creates an ambiguity and potential contradiction: while the contract allows address changes, there is no longer a defined procedure. This introduces uncertainty about how notices are to be properly delivered, affecting the enforcement of other clauses relying on effective communication.",

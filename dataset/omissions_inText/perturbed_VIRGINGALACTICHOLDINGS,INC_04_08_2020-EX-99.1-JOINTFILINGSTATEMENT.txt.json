                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G shall be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned without the necessity of filing additional joint acquisition statements. The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, except to the extent that he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned. The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, except to the extent that he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G shall be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned without the necessity of filing additional joint acquisition statements,' the modified text creates uncertainty regarding the obligation to file subsequent amendments jointly. The original text confirms a shared responsibility, while the modified text leaves it ambiguous, introducing a contradiction. One section refers to a joint filing responsibility, while the modified text no longer explicitly ensures it for all future amendments, creating a possible escape clause.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'SCULPTOR MASTER FUND LTD By: /s/ Thomas Sipp Thomas Sipp Chief Financial Officer' from the signatories, and without amending the first paragraph, it introduces an inconsistency. The document states it is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned, but then does not include all original entities in the signatory block. This introduces doubt to the completeness of the Joint Filing and raises questions about the legal standing of the entity not present in the list of signatories. This could lead to enforcement issues if one of the original participating entities is missing from the final, signed document.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Schedule A and A-1 from the beginning of Section 2(a), the contract now lacks a clear specification of which products Heritage is obligated to produce. However, section 3(a) still references \"the relevant Schedule C or Schedule C-l to be used in connection with the manufacturer of the Products.\" This creates a contradiction because the primary schedules defining the Products are removed but the manufacturing process is still related to schedule C and C-1.",

However, section 2(o)(i) states \"All Products manufactured, packaged and delivered by Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement shall conform to the specifications supplied to Heritage by Premier as listed on Schedule A and/or Schedule A-1, which Schedules may from time to time be modified by Premier in writing (the \"Specifications\").\" As such, the removal of the reference in 3(a) is a contradiction, because 2(o)(i) requires adherance to schedules A and A-1.",

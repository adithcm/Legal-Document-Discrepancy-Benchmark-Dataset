                "original_text": "Sponsor will pay Excite a share of all gross margins Sponsor realizes on transactions, advertising, sponsorship, promotions and any other revenue generated during each year of the term of the Agreement on the Sponsor Site as a result of users referred from the Excite Site (\"Total Revenue\"), subject to the following conditions:\n\n               i)       \"Gross margin\" is defined as [****].",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor will pay Excite a share of all gross margins Sponsor realizes on transactions, advertising, sponsorship, promotions and any other revenue generated during each year of the term of the Agreement on the Sponsor Site as a result of users referred from the Excite Site (\"Total Revenue\"), subject to the following conditions:\n\n               i)       \"Gross margin\" will be determined at the sole discretion of the Excite accounting department.",
                "explanation": "By removing the original definition of 'Gross margin' and replacing it with a clause stating it will be determined at Excite's discretion, there is an introduction of an imbalance in the definition of gross margins. The original contract outlines methods of arriving at gross margins. Therefore there is uncertainty in enforcement, as Sponsor has no means to be sure the Total Revenue is truly measured.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'which will in no event be less than the measures it uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own information of similar importance,' the contract still requires protection of confidential information, but removes the standard to which that protection must adhere. This weakens Sponsor's ability to argue Excite has not been diligent in confidentiality.",

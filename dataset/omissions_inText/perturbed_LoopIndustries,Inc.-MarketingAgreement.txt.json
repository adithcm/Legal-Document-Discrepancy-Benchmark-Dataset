                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Products' is specific (recycled or upcycled PET resins). The modified definition is broad and undefined, leading to uncertainty about what materials are actually covered under the agreement. This lack of clarity could cause disputes about the scope of the agreement, particularly if Loop Industries begins to include other material types without the explicit consent of the Joint Venture Company.",

Loop shall give Joint Venture Company prompt written notice, in the form of Exhibit A attached to this Agreement, [***] and (b) pursuant to which Loop offers to assign all of its rights and obligations under such Loop Sales Contract to Joint Venture Company (each such notice, a \"Proposed Contract Notice\"). Along with each Proposed Contract Notice, Loop shall deliver to Joint Venture Company a complete copy of the executed Loop Sales Contract (the \"Proposed Contract\"). The Proposed Contract Notice shall contain information necessary to establish whether the Proposed Contract meets the criteria set forth in the Contract Eligibility Framework. Each such Proposed Contract that (i) meets the criteria set forth in the Contract Eligibility Framework and (ii) contains no other terms or conditions other than those set forth in the Contract Eligibility Framework or any form of Loop Sales Contract mutually agreed in writing to be acceptable by the Parties, shall be an \"Eligible Contract.\" Each such Proposed Contract that does not qualify as an Eligible Contract shall be a \"Considered Contract.\"",
                "changed_text": "2.2 Proposed Contracts and Proposed Contract Notice. Loop shall give Joint Venture Company written notice of potential sales contracts (each such notice, a \"Proposed Contract Notice\"). Along with each Proposed Contract Notice, Loop shall deliver a summary of the executed Loop Sales Contract (the \"Proposed Contract\"). The Proposed Contract Notice shall contain information necessary to establish whether the Proposed Contract aligns with Loop's strategic goals. Each such Proposed Contract that (i) aligns with Loop's strategic goals shall be an \"Eligible Contract.\" Each such Proposed Contract that does not qualify as an Eligible Contract shall be a \"Considered Contract.\"",
                "explanation": "By removing 'Contract Eligibility Framework' the criteria for Eligible Contracts becomes vague ('aligns with Loop's strategic goals'). This creates an inconsistency because Section 2.3 refers to the Review Period. This change introduces ambiguity in contract acceptance, disadvantaging Joint Venture Company.",

If a Party commits a material breach of this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement if the breaching party does not cure the breach within thirty (30) days after the non- breaching party gives the breaching party written notice of the specific breach.",

                "explanation": "Removing the terms 'material breach' and the 'cure' period, introduces ambiguity regarding what constitutes a breach significant enough to warrant termination and removes the opportunity to remedy any breach, making the agreement more punitive and less balanced. It makes the term 'breach' undefined and is still used in the section.",

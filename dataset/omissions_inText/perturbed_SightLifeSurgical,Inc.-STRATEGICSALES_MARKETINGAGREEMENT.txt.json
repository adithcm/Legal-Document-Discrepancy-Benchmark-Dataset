                "original_text": "The sales representation services (\"Services\") are set forth in the Statement of Work (\"SOW\") that is attached hereto as Appendix A and made a part hereof, as it may be amended from time to time by the parties hereto.",
                "changed_text": "The sales representation services (\"Services\") are subject to discussion and mutual agreement between both parties.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to the Statement of Work (SOW) in Appendix A, the modified text introduces ambiguity regarding the specific sales representation services to be provided. Section 3, which discusses sales commissions relies on the SOW to set forth the services rendered and to be paid for. This contradicts the explicit terms in Section 3.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the reference to the SOW as the definitive source for determining sales commissions. This removal introduces uncertainty, because Section 4 discusses Sales Commission payments with reference to the Product (as defined in SOW), and this is a contradiction because no SOW now defines the Product or the Services.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'As further outlined in the SOW' creates a contradiction. Without the SOW, there is no clear definition of how 'the Product' is defined. It becomes impossible to ascertain the quality standards for a product with no definition. This makes compliance with Section 11 which discusses liabilities related to the product undefined.",

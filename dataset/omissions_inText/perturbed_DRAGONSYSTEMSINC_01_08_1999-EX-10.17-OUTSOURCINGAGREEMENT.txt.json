                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'if they do not comply with the specification set out by Dragon \\s\\ JB', the agreement no longer clearly defines the conditions under which Dragon Systems can reject services. This creates ambiguity and contradiction because the rest of the agreement relies on the existence of specifications, but this section makes rejection criteria vague.",

MMI will invoice Dragon Systems based on actual shipments that have been performed.

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'in accordance with the rates specified in the Annex \"Prices.\"', the pricing mechanism becomes undefined. While the section discusses payments, the crucial link to the actual price list is removed. This creates a contradiction because the agreement implies compensation but doesn't specify *how* compensation is determined, making enforcement impossible without that Annex.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'in accordance with the specifications set by Dragon Systems', the definition of the warranty is weakened and contradicts other sections. While the agreement mentions specifications elsewhere (like in Section 4 originally), the warranty is no longer explicitly tied to those specifications. This creates a contradiction because MMI's obligation is now vaguely defined, making it unclear what 'due diligence and care' actually entail, and what specifications they should be fulfilling.",

                "explanation": "By stating that LMG Tools excludes 'enhancements, translations, modifications, updates, releases, or other changes to LMG Tools,' this modification creates a contradiction with the standard definition of software which typically includes updates and modifications as part of the 'software.'

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict. The original text clearly states LMG's responsibility for 'maintenance, repair, replacement and upgrade.' The modified text makes the operational responsibility discretionary, creating ambiguity about LMG's actual obligations. This could lead to disputes over service levels and support.",

                "original_text": "In the event that either party materially defaults in the performance of its duties or obligations set forth in this Agreement, and such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice is given to the defaulting party specifying the default, then the party not in default may, by giving written notice thereof to the defaulting party, terminate the Agreement as of a date specified in such notice of termination.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that either party is perceived to not be performing to the other's satisfaction, that party has thirty (30) days to make amends. If performance does not reach the other's satisfaction, then the party perceiving a lack of performance may terminate the Agreement as of a date specified in such notice of termination.",
                "explanation": "This change is problematic because the term \"materially defaults\" has been replaced with \"perceived to not be performing to the other's satisfaction\". The former is an objective criteria that has a standard legal meaning, where the latter is a subjective standard with no legal meaning. The change from \"specifying the default\" to \"performance does not reach the other's satisfaction\" is vague and would not hold up in court. This could allow either party to terminate for even minor issues, making the contract unstable.",

                "original_text": "1.1. AFFILIATE shall mean, when used with reference to a party, any individual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means the direct or indirect ownership of at least 50% of the outstanding voting securities of a party, or the right to control the policy decisions of such party.",
                "changed_text": "1.1. AFFILIATE shall mean, when used with reference to a party, any individual or entity directly or indirectly related to such party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means influence over the decisions of such party.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Affiliate' and 'control' has been made deliberately vague. The original definition specified a clear 50% ownership threshold for 'control,' aligning with standard corporate law definitions. The modified definition removes this specific threshold and replaces it with 'influence,' creating ambiguity. This could lead to disputes over which entities are considered affiliates, impacting obligations and liabilities under the contract.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'USER' has been broadened to include 'automated systems.' While technically accurate in some contexts, this introduces a legal contradiction because many agreements concerning website usage differentiate between human users and bots. This change complicates data tracking, revenue sharing based on user activity, and security protocols outlined elsewhere in the agreement which were likely designed with only human users in mind.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'VERTICALNET SITE' has been made deliberately vague. The original definition specified ownership and operation by VerticalNet and confined it to the United States. The modified definition removes these specific criteria and replaces it with 'some arrangement over,' creating ambiguity. This could lead to disputes over which sites are considered VERTICALNET SITES, impacting obligations and liabilities under the contract.",

(hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement. This Amendment shall apply to said PCQ and ABW and all of their subsidiaries and related companies.",

(hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement. This Amendment shall only apply to said PCQ and ABW and not their subsidiaries or related companies.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"Term\" to \"Duration\" and limiting applicability to only PCQ and ABW introduces contradiction. 'Term' typically refers to the contract's length and conditions of renewal/termination, which has a defined legal meaning. Referring to the section as 'Duration' without outlining precise conditions and excluding subsidiaries creates ambiguity and potential unenforceability, particularly since subsidiaries may be intended beneficiaries, therefore contradicting the accepted legal and business definition.",

                "explanation": "Replacing the clear legal entity name 'PC Quote, Inc.' with 'PC Quote, a company' introduces ambiguity. 'Inc.' denotes incorporation, offering legal protections and defined liabilities. Using 'a company' is vague and could lead to disputes about the legal status and responsibilities of PC Quote under the agreement. It contradicts standards of contract law, especially around identifying legal entities.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "For the purpose of the Agreement each Party shall be, and shall be deemed to be, an independent contractor and not an agent, partner, joint venturer or employee of the other Party. Neither Party shall have authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action which shall be binding on the other Party (except as may be explicitly provided for herein or authorized in writing), and each Party agrees not to purport to do so.",
                "changed_text": "For the purpose of the Agreement each Party shall be, and shall be deemed to be, an independent contractor; however, Sekisui is authorized to act as Qualigen’s agent for distribution purposes. Neither Party shall have authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action which shall be binding on the other Party (except as may be explicitly provided for herein or authorized in writing), and each Party agrees not to purport to do so.",
                "explanation": "The modification states that 'Sekisui is authorized to act as Qualigen’s agent for distribution purposes' but still designates both as independent contractors. This creates a legal contradiction because an 'independent contractor' operates with autonomy, while an 'agent' acts on behalf of a principal (Qualigen). This introduces uncertainty regarding liability and control, which are critical in defining the relationship.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.1. Adverse Event shall mean an incident in which the Product was alleged to have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury of a patient or operator and would require submitting a Medical Devices Report to the FDA (as hereinafter defined) as per 21 CFR 803, or a similar report to a Competent Authority (as hereinafter defined) as per Vigilance Guidance MEDDEV 2.12-1.",
                "changed_text": "1.1. Adverse Event shall mean an incident in which the Product was alleged to have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury of a patient or operator and would require submitting a Customer Complaint to Qualigen.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clearly states requirements for submitting a Medical Device Report to the FDA as per 21 CFR 803 when the product is the source of the event. The changed text reduces the severity and impact of the definition of Adverse Event to simply reporting a customer complaint. This creates a situation where a potentially serious event, that would require an FDA mandated report, is now only labeled as a customer complaint, removing the mention of FDA regulatory requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR 803 - Medical Device Reporting requirements are not satisfied if the company redefines what an adverse event is to simply being a customer complaint.",

Serious Incident shall mean an incident involving the Products, which is reportable to a Competent Authority and as defined in Section 5 of Annex III of the IVD Directive, and the European Commission Medical Devices Vigilance Guidelines 2.12-1 or such other Guidelines as may be issued from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "1.24. Serious Incident shall mean an incident involving the Products, which is reportable at the discretion of Qualigen’s Quality Committee.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of a 'Serious Incident' is clearly tied to defined reporting requirements by Competent Authorities in Europe and refers to specific sections of the IVD Directive. Modifying the definition to depend solely on the 'discretion of Qualigen’s Quality Committee' creates a contradiction. European regulations mandate specific, non-discretionary reporting criteria for serious incidents, but this change allows the company committee to decide what to report, undermining regulatory compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "IVD Directive (specifically Section 5 of Annex III) - Reporting obligations are mandatory, not discretionary, under EU law.",

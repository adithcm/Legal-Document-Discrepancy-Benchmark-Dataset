                "explanation": "The original definition includes both registered and unregistered copyrights, whereas the modified definition limits it to 'exclusive copyrights, registered with the US Copyright Office'. This creates a contradiction because under US Copyright Law, unregistered copyrights are still protected. By limiting the definition, the contract contradicts the broader legal definition of copyright, potentially invalidating clauses that rely on this broader definition.",

                "explanation": "The original definition explicitly includes 'trade secrets, and other confidential and proprietary information'. The modification completely reverses this by defining 'Know-How' as 'publicly available information.' This contradicts the generally understood and legally protected definition of Know-How as confidential information, which is a critical aspect of trade secret law.",

                "explanation": "The original definition aligns with standard trademark law, including trademarks currently in use or with pending applications. The modified definition includes 'expired trademarks, abandoned service marks, trade names not in use, and other dissimilar designations of ambiguous origin'. This creates a contradiction because trademark law protects marks that are actively in use and distinguishes them by origin. The change invalidates the purpose of trademark protection.",

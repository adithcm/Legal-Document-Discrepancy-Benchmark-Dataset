                "original_text": "A. Licensee owns and operates the following radio station (the \"Station\") pursuant to licenses issued by the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\"): WQHT-FM, New York, NY (Facility ID No. 19615). The Station has the capability to transmit an in-band, on-channel (\"IBOC\") digital broadcast signal.",
                "changed_text": "A. Licensee may operate the following broadcasting source (the \"Station\") with permissions granted by the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\"): WQHT-FM, New York, NY (Facility ID No. 19615). The Station may experiment with various forms of signal transmission, including in-band, on-channel (\"IBOC\") digital broadcasts.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states ownership and operation 'pursuant to licenses'. The modified text uses 'may operate' and 'permissions granted,' weakening the commitment to operate under FCC licenses and introducing uncertainty. The original statement about transmission capability is replaced with permission to 'experiment,' further deviating from the regulated nature of broadcast signals.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement Licensee will have full authority, power and control over the operation of the Station, including the HD2 Channel, and over all persons working at the Station's facilities during the Term.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, both Licensee and Programmer will collaborate equally in the operation of the Station, including the HD2 Channel, and share authority over all persons working at the Station's facilities during the Term. Licensee and Programmer will attempt to share the responsibility for the Station's compliance with the general spirit of the rules and policies of the FCC.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives the Licensee full authority and responsibility for FCC compliance. The modified text introduces shared authority and responsibility between the Licensee and Programmer.

The revised text introduces collaboration and decision-making based on 'mutual agreement and business considerations,' which dilutes the Licensee's responsibility. This creates ambiguity and a potential conflict with FCC regulations regarding political broadcasting and equal opportunity rules.",

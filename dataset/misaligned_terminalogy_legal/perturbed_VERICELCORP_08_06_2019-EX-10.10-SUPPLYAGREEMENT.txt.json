                "original_text": "1.13 \"Conforming Product\" means, with respect to the applicable Product, that, as of the date of delivery to Vericel or its designated Affiliate or contractor in accordance with Section 2.9(c) hereof, such Product (a) meets, and was Manufactured in accordance with, the applicable Specifications, Regulatory Standards (including cGMP where applicable) and the requirements set forth in the Quality Agreement, (b) is free from defects in materials and workmanship, (c) is not adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the FD&C Act (or similar requirements of the countries for which the Product will be distributed), and (d) is not an article which may not, under the provisions of the FD&C Act, be introduced into interstate commerce.",
                "changed_text": "1.13 \"Conforming Product\" means, with respect to the applicable Product, that, as of the date of delivery to Vericel or its designated Affiliate or contractor in accordance with Section 2.9(c) hereof, such Product (a) generally aligns with, and was Produced with consideration for, the applicable Specifications, Guidelines, and the requirements detailed in internal quality protocols, (b) exhibits an acceptable level of material integrity, (c) adheres to company standards for branding and composition, and (d) is deemed suitable for market introduction based on internal evaluations.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Conforming Product' tied directly to established legal and regulatory standards like the FD&C Act and cGMP. The modified version replaces these with vague terms like 'generally aligns,' 'acceptable level of material integrity,' and 'company standards,' diverging from legally recognized definitions and introducing ambiguity that could lead to disputes about product conformity and compliance.",

                "original_text": "1.44 \"Regulatory Standards\" means all applicable Laws within the Territory applicable to the Manufacturing and shipment of the Product or any aspect thereof and the obligations of MediWound hereunder, including, without limitation, (a) the FD&C Act (or similar requirements of the countries for which the Product will be distributed), (b) cGMPs, and (c) the rules and regulations promulgated under or by a Regulatory Authority or any successor agency or other comparable agency thereto as each may be amended from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "1.44 \"Regulatory Standards\" means the guidelines and recommendations that MediWound deems appropriate for the Manufacturing and shipment of the Product, including (a) MediWoundâ€™s internal quality control documentation, (b) best practices in the industry, and (c) suggestions from consultants hired by MediWound to improve the manufacturing process.",
                "explanation": "This change completely removes the legally binding aspect of 'Regulatory Standards' by redefining it as MediWound's internal guidelines, best practices, and consultant suggestions. This contradicts the original definition which explicitly included applicable laws like the FD&C Act and cGMPs. The new definition allows MediWound to potentially disregard actual legal requirements, replacing them with discretionary standards.",

                "explanation": "This change alters the definition of 'Minimum Shelf Life' from being based on 'FDA approved shelf-life' to 'shelf-life determined by MediWound.' This contradicts regulatory expectations for pharmaceutical product dating, as the FDA approval process ensures a standardized, scientifically validated shelf life, which is being replaced by MediWound's potentially arbitrary determination. This could lead to products being marketed beyond their safe and effective period, in violation of applicable laws.",

                "original_text": "1.11 \"Manufacturing Subcontractors\" means (a) [***] and/or its Affiliate that is the wafer foundry for the Products (\"[***]\"), (b) [***] and/or its Affiliate that is responsible for the assembly, packaging and testing of the Products, and (c) and other third party contractors DIALOG or ENERGOUS use, or may from time to time use, for the manufacturing, assembly, testing, or packaging of the Licensed Products or Licensed Product components.",
                "changed_text": "1.11 \"Manufacturing Subcontractors\" means (a) [***] and/or its Affiliate that is the wafer foundry for the Products (“[***]”), (b) [***] and/or its Affiliate that is responsible for the assembly, packaging and testing of the Products, and (c) and other third party contractors DIALOG or ENERGOUS use, or may from time to time use, for the manufacturing, assembly, testing, or packaging of the Licensed Products or Licensed Product components. **For the purpose of this agreement, 'subcontractor' shall be interpreted to mean any entity regardless of its legal relationship with DIALOG or ENERGOUS, including those operating independently and not under the direct control of DIALOG or ENERGOUS.**",
                "explanation": "The modified definition broadens the term 'subcontractor' beyond its common legal understanding, which typically implies a degree of control or agency. By including entities operating independently without direct control, the contract introduces ambiguity. This conflicts with standard legal interpretations where a subcontractor is usually considered to be working under the direction and control of the main contractor. This could affect liability and responsibility attributions.",

                "original_text": "1.16 \"Net Sales\" means the invoiced amounts for the Sale of Products less: (a) amounts credited for return of any such Products; (b) amounts separately stated with respect to shipment of such Products for insurance, handling, duty, freight, and taxes; and (c) any discounts, credits or rebates in the relevant royalty or service fee period.",
                "changed_text": "1.16 \"Net Sales\" means the invoiced amounts for the Sale of Products less: (a) amounts credited for return of any such Products; (b) amounts separately stated with respect to shipment of such Products for insurance, handling, duty, freight, and taxes; and (c) any discounts, credits or rebates in the relevant royalty or service fee period. **For the purpose of royalty calculation, 'Net Sales' shall also exclude any amounts written off as bad debt.**",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction because while standard accounting practices may allow for writing off bad debt, it does not automatically exclude such amounts from the 'Net Sales' figure upon which royalties are typically calculated. This deviation creates a legal uncertainty as it allows for a subjective reduction in the royalty base based on DIALOG's accounting practices, potentially conflicting with the definition of revenue under GAAP. It could contradict revenue recognition principles which might consider the sale complete even if payment is later deemed uncollectible.",

Except for obligations to pay amounts due under this Agreement, neither party will be liable for any failure or delay in its performance under this Agreement due to causes which are beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, acts of civil or military authority, fires, epidemics, floods, earthquakes, riots, wars, sabotage, labor shortages or disputes, and governmental actions; provided, however, that the affected party: (a) gives the other party written notice of such cause promptly, and in any event within fifteen (15) days of discovery thereof; and (b) uses its reasonable efforts to correct such failure or delay in its performance as soon as possible. The affected party's time for performance or cure under this Section 20.3 will be extended for a period equal to the duration of the cause.",

The affected party's time for performance or cure under this Section 20.3 will be extended for a period equal to the duration of the cause.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'reasonable efforts' to 'commercially unreasonable efforts' creates a contradiction. Force majeure clauses typically require the affected party to mitigate the impact of the event using reasonable efforts. By requiring 'commercially unreasonable efforts,' the clause sets an impossibly high standard that could be interpreted as voiding the protection intended by the force majeure provision. This contradicts the purpose of a force majeure clause, which is to excuse performance under circumstances beyond a party's control when they have made reasonable attempts to mitigate the impact.",

                "explanation": "By changing the definition of \"Equipment Rental Business\" to be independent of the Distribution Agreement, the contract introduces ambiguity and conflicts with the original intent of aligning the definition with the Distribution Agreement.

HSI shall defend, indemnify and hold HERC harmless against any and all claims, suits, actions or other proceedings whatsoever brought against HERC based on third-party claims of trademark infringement in connection with HERC'S use of the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks, the HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks, the HERC (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks and the Other Intellectual Property to the extent such claims, suits, actions or other proceedings are based upon use of the HERTZ element comprising a HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademark, HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademark, HERC (HERTZ) US ERB Trademark or Other Intellectual Property during the Interim Period only and from claims of third parties against HERC or any of its affiliates stemming from HERTZ's use of the HERTZ trademarks.",

This indemnification applies only to claims HSI deems valid.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the mandatory indemnification obligation of HSI to a discretionary one. By introducing \"may, at its sole discretion\", the contract contradicts the original intent of providing clear indemnification. Also, by limiting to claims that HSI deems valid opens to legal ambiguity that might make the original statement unenforceable.",

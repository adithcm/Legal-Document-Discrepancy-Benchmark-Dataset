                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "6. \"Territory\" means: United Kingdom.",
                "changed_text": "6. \"Territory\" means: Locations deemed suitable at the Company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The term \"Territory\" is changed from a specific geographic location (United Kingdom) to a discretionary definition controlled by the Company. This creates uncertainty and contradicts the initial intention of limiting the agreement's scope geographically. This alteration introduces ambiguity, potentially leading to disputes over where the talent's endorsement rights apply.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Ambiguity and vagueness in contract terms.",
                "location": "Section 1, Definition 6"

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In accordance with the Primary Agreement, the Talent agrees that during the Term, he will make public appearances at the request of the Company, to include appearing at Company events and/or participating in photo shoots as requested by Company, not to exceed more than four such appearances or photo shoots per calendar year. Any public appearance and/or photo shoot must be approved by the Talent prior to his agreement to attend, which shall not be unreasonably withheld providing the Talent does not have any prior professional or other commitments and reasonable and adequate notice is given and received by CSA on behalf of Talent.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with the Primary Agreement, the Talent agrees that during the Term, he will make public appearances at the request of the Company, to include appearing at Company events and/or participating in photo shoots as requested by Company. The talent will make appearances at the company’s discretion and in the event that the Talent does not provide attendance for a public appearance, there is a fee that will incur.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation modifies the public appearance clause to remove the cap on appearances and introduces a financial penalty for non-attendance. It contradicts the original agreement, where the Talent had approval rights and appearances were limited. This could be deemed an unreasonable burden on the Talent, conflicting with standard endorsement contract practices that protect the talent's time and image.",

                "changed_text": "a. A bonus will be issued at the company’s discretion, after necessary deductions.",
                "explanation": "The compensation clause is altered to remove the explicit percentage of revenue and VAT deductions, replacing it with discretionary bonus payment. This change contradicts the original clarity regarding royalty calculations, thus enabling the company to unilaterally determine the talent's payment. The introduction of the word “bonus” is a means of payment that is not legally recognized, as opposed to royalties. This violates common business practice.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Franchisee shall maintain good customer relations in accordance with prudent and reasonable business practices.",
                "changed_text": "Franchisee shall strive to maintain adequate customer relations in accordance with business practices.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes 'good customer relations' to 'adequate customer relations' and removes the standard of 'prudent and reasonable business practices.' This introduces ambiguity. What constitutes 'adequate' is subjective and open to interpretation, and removing 'prudent and reasonable' weakens the standard of care required, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principle of 'good faith and fair dealing', which is weakened by the altered language.",

                "changed_text": "Franchisee shall attempt to market, promote, and publicise the Smaaash Centres throughout the Territory.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'best efforts' with 'attempt'. 'Best efforts' is a legally recognized standard requiring diligent and commercially reasonable actions. 'Attempt' is significantly weaker, implying only a try without a guarantee of serious commitment. This contradiction makes the obligation vague, impacting enforceability.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law relating to the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in franchise agreements, as the altered language weakens the franchisee's commitment to marketing the franchise.",
                "location": "5.1(a)"

                "original_text": "Communications will be duly given if delivered personally, if mailed (by registered mail, return receipt requested) or if delivered by nationally-recognized courier or mail service which requires the addressee to acknowledge, in writing, the receipt thereof, to the party concerned at the following addresses (or at any other address as a party may specify by notice in writing to the other)",
                "changed_text": "Communications will be considered delivered if sent by any means. If the addresses change, the sending party is encouraged to notify the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies precise and legally sound methods for delivering notices. The modified clause introduces vagueness by allowing 'any means' of communication. Removing the requirement for 'registered mail, return receipt requested' or a courier service with acknowledgment of receipt makes it difficult to prove notice was given, undermining the clause's legal certainty.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law regarding the sufficiency of notice, especially concerning legal or financial obligations, where proof of delivery is often required. This may also conflict with state laws governing notice requirements in commercial transactions.",

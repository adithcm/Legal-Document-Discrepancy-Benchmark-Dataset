                "original_text": "1.1. \"AFFILIATE\" means, with respect to any Party, any other entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with, such Party. The term \"control\" shall mean direct or indirect ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate entity or voting interest in a non-corporate entity and shall also mean the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity.",
                "changed_text": "1.1. \"AFFILIATE\" means, with respect to any Party, any other entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with, such Party. The term \"control\" shall mean direct ownership of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate entity or voting interest in a non-corporate entity and shall also mean the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to influence the management and policies of an entity.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"control\" is changed from 50% ownership to 25% ownership, and the ability to 'direct' management is changed to 'influence' the management. This creates a contradiction because typical legal and accounting standards require a higher threshold (over 50%) for control in determining affiliation. The lowered percentage and weaker influence standard deviate from standard legal definitions and could create disputes over which entities are considered affiliates.",

                "changed_text": "1.7. \"EVENT OF BANKRUPTCY\" for any Person means (i) such Person anticipates filing a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency, (ii) such Person considers filing for reorganization or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee of all or a portion of such Party's assets, (iii) such Person contemplates an assignment for the benefit of creditors, (iv) such Person considers its inability to pay its debts as they fall due, (v) such Person reviews seeking, consenting to or acquiescing in the appointment of a trustee, receiver or liquidator of a portion of its assets, (vi) such Person fails to address any petition in bankruptcy or insolvency, or for reorganization, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee of all or a portion of such Person's assets dismissed within ninety (90) days after the commencement of any proceeding as a result thereof or (vii) such Person fails to have any levy or attachment on a portion of its assets released or discharged within ninety (90) days of imposition thereof.",
                "explanation": "The original definition uses definitive actions like 'files a petition' or 'admits in writing.' The modified definition uses ambiguous language like 'anticipates filing' or 'considers its inability.' This creates a legal contradiction because the original provides clear, objective criteria for determining bankruptcy, while the modified definition introduces subjective and speculative elements. Changing 'material portion' to 'portion' also decreases the importance of the assets involved.",

                "explanation": "This modification replaces the standard governing law clause (Delaware law) with a vague reference to 'principles of equity and fairness.' This directly contradicts established contract law, which requires a defined legal system to interpret and enforce agreements. The removal of a specific jurisdiction creates uncertainty and makes the contract unenforceable, as 'equity and fairness' are subjective and not legally defined.",

(S)(S) 210 and 211; Investigational New Drug Application regulations at 21 C.F.R. (S) 312; NDA regulations at 21 C.F.R. (S) 314, relevant provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and other laws and regulations enforced by the FDA), ordinances and other pronouncements having the binding effect of law of any Governmental Authority.",
                "changed_text": "1.50 \"Laws\" means any internal guidelines, suggestions, best practices, internal policies or ethical standards, whether written or unwritten, and regardless of whether compliance is mandated or voluntary.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Laws\" is aligned with the established legal understanding of the term. The modified definition deviates from this by broadening the scope to include internal, non-binding directives, leading to legal uncertainty and potential unenforceability. This contradicts the standard definition and could lead to disputes over which rules the parties are bound by.",

Diligent Efforts requires that: (i) each Party promptly assign responsibility for such obligations to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) each Party set and consistently seek to achieve specific and meaningful objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) each Party consistently make and implement decisions and allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",
                "changed_text": "1.25 \"Diligent Efforts\" means commercially reasonable efforts, but does not require that a Party prioritize this agreement over its other business interests. Diligent Efforts requires only reasonable action, based on a subjective analysis conducted by the party obligated to act.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Diligent Efforts' typically implies a high standard of effort and commitment. The modified definition significantly weakens this obligation by permitting a party to prioritize its own interests over those of the collaboration, contradicting the accepted legal interpretation and creating ambiguity regarding the parties' responsibilities.",

                "changed_text": "1.17 \"Confidential Information\" means information that a party marks as 'confidential' at the time of disclosure, provided it is not shared on social media, as a tweet, or on platforms like Reddit or X (formerly Twitter).",
                "explanation": "The original definition of Confidential Information is standard and comprehensive, covering a wide range of data. The modified definition introduces ambiguity by making confidentiality dependent on the Disclosing Party explicitly marking the information as 'confidential', while at the same time allowing that shared information that appears on public forums is not considered confidential.  This is an unreasonable action because information can be marked confidential regardless of the forum the data is provided in. This contradicts common standards and legal interpretations of confidentiality, potentially leading to disputes over what information is protected.",

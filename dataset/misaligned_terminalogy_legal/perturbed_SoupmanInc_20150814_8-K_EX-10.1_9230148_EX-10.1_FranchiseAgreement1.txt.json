                "original_text": "You shall pay the following continuing fees to us each month during the term of this Agreement:\n\n4.2.1 You shall pay to us a royalty fee based on revenue generated by Unit Franchisees (the \"Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee\") equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of aggregate royalty fees paid to you by Unit Franchisees in the Master Territory pursuant to their Unit Franchise Agreements. The Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us in the manner provided in Section 4.3 of this Agreement by the fifteenth(15 th ) day of each calendar month based on royalty fees generated and received during the previous calendar month.",
                "changed_text": "You shall pay the following continuing fees to us each month during the term of this Agreement:\n\n4.2.1 You shall pay to us a royalty fee based on revenue generated by Unit Franchisees (the \"Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee\") which will be determined at our discretion, based on a good faith assessment of market conditions. The Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us in the manner provided in Section 4.3 of this Agreement by the fifteenth(15 th ) day of each calendar month based on royalty fees generated and received during the previous calendar month.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a fixed percentage for the royalty fee, offering legal certainty. The modified text replaces this fixed percentage with a discretionary determination based on \"market conditions\". This introduces ambiguity and contradicts the concept of a fixed royalty, making enforcement challenging as 'market conditions' is vague.",

Any additional training shall be at your expense. The group of trainees must include management level employees and the principal owner of at least 25% interest in the location, if it's a franchisee or the franchisee is a corporate entity.",

Any additional training shall be at your expense, or our discretion. The group of trainees can be anyone, regardless of their role.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"comprehensive initial training program\" to just \"training program\" and removing the specific trainee requirements, the changed text adds uncertainty. 'As we see fit' contradicts the idea of a defined initial training program. This is because the first suggests there is a standard or comprehensive training, while the second makes it arbitrary.",

In the event of any conflict of law, the laws of New York shall prevail, without regard to the application of such state's conflict of law rules. If, however, any provision of this Agreement would not be enforceable under the laws of New York, and if the Franchised Business is located outside of New York and such provision would be enforceable under the laws of the state in which the Franchised Business is located, then such provision shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of that other state.

In the event of any conflict of law, the decision of which law will be used rests solely with us. If, however, any provision of this Agreement would not be enforceable under the laws of New York, and if the Franchised Business is located outside of New York and such provision would be enforceable under the laws of the state in which the Franchised Business is located, then such provision may be interpreted and construed under the laws of that other state, at our discretion.

                "explanation": "Originally, the agreement specifies New York law and provides a clear fallback. The modified version lets the franchisor choose applicable law at the time of a dispute, contradicting the principle of contractual certainty. The original clause provides a clear legal framework, while the modified version gives the franchisor discretionary power over the applicable legal rules.",

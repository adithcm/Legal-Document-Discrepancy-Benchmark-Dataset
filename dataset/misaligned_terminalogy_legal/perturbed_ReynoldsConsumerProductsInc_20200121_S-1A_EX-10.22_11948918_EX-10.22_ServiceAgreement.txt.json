                "original_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any person, any other person who directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such person. The term \"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise, and the terms \"controlled\" and \"controlling\" have meanings correlative thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this Agreement and all exhibits thereto, the term Affiliate shall not apply to the relationship between RGHI or RGHL or either of their respective Affiliates on the one hand and RCP and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on the other hand.",
                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any person, any other person who directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such person. The term \"control\" might mean the ability to influence, but not necessarily direct, the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise, and the terms \"controlled\" and \"controlling\" have meanings correlative thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this Agreement and all exhibits thereto, the term Affiliate shall not apply to the relationship between RGHI or RGHL or either of their respective Affiliates on the one hand and RCP and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on the other hand.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"control\" adheres to the standard legal interpretation requiring the *power to direct* management and policies. By changing \"means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction...\" to \"might mean the ability to influence, but not necessarily direct...\", the modified definition introduces ambiguity and contradicts established legal precedent. This could lead to disputes over whether a party is truly an affiliate and the extent of their liabilities or rights.",

                "original_text": "Provider shall perform the Services (i) at a level of quality substantially similar in all material respects to that at which such Services were performed or enjoyed during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof and (ii) in accordance with applicable Law (collectively, (i) and (ii), the \"Service Standard\"). Subject to Section 3.1(c), internal controls of Provider and its Affiliates with respect to the Service Standard shall remain materially the same in effect throughout the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Provider shall perform the Services (i) at a level of quality that the provider deems appropriate and (ii) in general accordance with the provider's understanding of applicable Law (collectively, (i) and (ii), the \"Service Standard\"). Subject to Section 3.1(c), internal controls of Provider and its Affiliates with respect to the Service Standard shall remain materially the same in effect throughout the term of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original \"Service Standard\" definition requires a *substantially similar* level of quality to the past and strict compliance with the law. The modification changes this to a quality \"that the provider deems appropriate\" and general \"understanding of applicable law,\" introducing subjectivity and potential non-compliance. This creates a contradiction by giving the Provider discretion to define quality, diverging from objective standards and the requirement to adhere to laws fully.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring objective standards of performance and adherence to laws.",

                "original_text": "In the event that a Party is wholly or partially prevented from, or delayed in, providing one or more Services, or one or more Services are interrupted or suspended, by reason of events beyond their reasonable control, which by their nature were not foreseen, or, if it was foreseen, was not reasonably avoidable, including acts of God, act of Governmental Authority, act of the public enemy or due to fire, explosion, accident, floods, embargoes, epidemics, war, acts of terrorism, nuclear disaster, civil unrest or riots, civil commotion, insurrection, severe or adverse weather conditions, lack of or shortage of adequate electrical power, malfunctions of equipment or software (each, a \"Force Majeure Event\"), such Party shall promptly give notice of any such Force Majeure Event to Company and shall indicate in such notice the effect of such event on their ability to perform hereunder and the anticipated duration of such event.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that a Party is wholly or partially prevented from, or delayed in, providing one or more Services, or one or more Services are interrupted or suspended, by reason of events which the provider claims are beyond their control, including but not limited to unexpected increases in the cost of materials or labor, or general economic downturns (each, a \"Force Majeure Event\"), such Party shall promptly give notice of any such Force Majeure Event to Company and shall indicate in such notice the effect of such event on their ability to perform hereunder and the anticipated duration of such event.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly broadens the definition of \"Force Majeure Event\" to include foreseeable and controllable events like \"unexpected increases in the cost of materials or labor, or general economic downturns.\" Standard legal interpretations of force majeure require unforeseeable and unavoidable events. Including common business risks contradicts this, potentially excusing non-performance based on factors within a party's control, leading to uncertainty and disputes.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"exclusive\" to \"non-exclusive\" contradicts the initial intent of granting Naked Brand Group exclusive rights to Wade's image for the specified products, undermining trademark protection and the value of the endorsement deal. This modification creates uncertainty regarding the extent of Naked's brand protection and the exclusivity Wade is providing.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"will pay\" to \"may pay\" makes the payment of royalties discretionary. This contradicts the fundamental understanding of a royalty agreement, where payment is typically an obligation, not an option. It introduces uncertainty and could be interpreted as a breach of contract, especially under New York law, which governs this agreement (Section 25).",

                "explanation": "By changing the decision from \"final and binding\" to \"advisory and non-binding,\" the clause now fundamentally undermines the purpose of arbitration, which is to provide a conclusive resolution to disputes. This contradicts the essence of an arbitration agreement, as it renders the outcome non-enforceable. Parties usually agree to binding arbitration to avoid litigation.",

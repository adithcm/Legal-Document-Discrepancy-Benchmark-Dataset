                "explanation": "The original definition defers to a reasonableness standard. The modified definition forces Sanofi to 'exert best efforts to maximize profits,' changing a typical commercial standard into something more akin to an 'utmost' standard.

                "explanation": "This edit directly contradicts the standard definition of FTE which caps the contribution of one person to one FTE. Changing 'will not' to 'can' and adding 'if they exceed the maximum number of hours' creates a conflict that is internally inconsistent with the first half of the statement, and also misaligned with the commonly understood definition of a Full Time Equivalent.",

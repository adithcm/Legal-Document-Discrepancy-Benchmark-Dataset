                "original_text": "1.6      \"New Version\" in this Agreement shall mean a new release of Licensed Technology that provides significant performance enhancements, including new releases of software product optimized for different members of the same DSP processor family which is based on the same core architecture and instruction set.",
                "changed_text": "1.6      \"New Version\" in this Agreement shall mean a new release of Licensed Technology that may or may not provide performance enhancements or compatibility, including optional releases of software product that may be optimized for different or identical members of any processor family regardless of core architecture or instruction set.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"New Version\" specified 'significant performance enhancements' and optimization for 'the same DSP processor family' based on the 'same core architecture and instruction set.' The modified text changes this to 'may or may not provide performance enhancements or compatibility' and removes the requirement for optimization within the same processor family and architecture. This introduces ambiguity because it allows for 'New Versions' that do not necessarily improve performance and can apply to completely different systems, conflicting with common expectations of software versioning and potentially leading to disputes about maintenance and support obligations.",

                "changed_text": "1.7      \"Defect\" shall mean any perceived imperfection in the Licensed Technology as subjectively determined by LICENSEE. \"Material\" is defined as LICENSEE’s sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Defect\" relies on a failure to meet the 'Specification' and defines 'Material' with objective priority levels (A, B, C) in Article 6.3. The modified text broadens 'Defect' to 'any perceived imperfection' and replaces the objective priority with 'LICENSEE’s sole discretion'. This creates a legal contradiction by making the determination of a 'Defect' entirely subjective, which contradicts the specificity of the Specification and makes it difficult to enforce maintenance obligations, as any perceived issue, regardless of its impact on functionality or specifications, can be claimed as a 'Defect'.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a specific schedule for error correction based on defined priorities (A, B, C). The modified text replaces the objective schedule with vague terms like 'commercially reasonable efforts' and conditions the correction on 'resource availability of D2'. Further, the response and closure times are changed to 'As available,' 'When Possible,' and 'Whenever Convenient.' This contradicts the original intent of having a defined error correction process and introduces significant ambiguity regarding D2’s obligations, making it difficult to enforce service levels and potentially violating basic contract law principles related to definiteness and enforceability.",

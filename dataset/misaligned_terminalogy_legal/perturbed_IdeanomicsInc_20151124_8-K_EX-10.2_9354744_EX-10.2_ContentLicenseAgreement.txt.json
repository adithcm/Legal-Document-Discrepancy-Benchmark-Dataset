            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(c) \"Affiliate(s)\" shall mean an entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with a party. \"Control,\" for purposes of this definition, means direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 50% of the voting interests of the subject entity.",
                "changed_text": "(c) \"Affiliate(s)\" shall mean an entity loosely associated with a party. \"Control,\" for purposes of this definition, suggests influence rather than direct ownership.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Affiliate\" adheres to a standard legal interpretation requiring a specific level of ownership (more than 50% of voting interests) to establish control. The modified definition introduces ambiguity by using terms like \"loosely associated\" and \"influence,\" which contradict the clear and established legal meaning of 'control' as defined in corporate law. This creates uncertainty regarding which entities qualify as affiliates, potentially affecting obligations and liabilities under the contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "Corporate law principles regarding control and affiliation, specifically regarding ownership thresholds for defining control.",
                "location": "Section 1(c)"

                "original_text": "Licensee shall have the right to assign or sublicense any or all of its rights granted under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to third parties exhibiting the Titles in the ordinary course of Licensee's business with prior written notice to Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee may transfer or sublicense parts or all of its rights as long as it informs Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The phrase \"prior written notice\" was replaced with \"informs\", creating legal uncertainty. Prior written notice has a clear legal definition, whereas \"informs\" is vague and open to interpretation. This contradicts the intent of the contract and could lead to disputes over assignment and sublicensing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles, where explicit clauses like 'prior written notice' are expected for clarity, especially in assignment and sublicensing agreements.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Any dispute, controversy and/or difference which may arise out of or in connection with or in relation to this Agreement, shall be solely and finally settled by binding arbitration pursuant to then-current rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. Such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York.",
                "changed_text": "Any dispute, controversy and/or difference which may arise out of or in connection with or in relation to this Agreement will be settled by informal discussion, not necessarily binding, if both sides agree. If that fails, we might think about arbitration in some place.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates 'binding arbitration' under ICC rules in New York, a clear and enforceable provision. The modified clause replaces this with 'informal discussion', undermining the enforceability and intent of the dispute resolution process. The lack of a binding commitment to arbitration contradicts standard contract enforcement practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles emphasizing the importance of clear and enforceable dispute resolution mechanisms, and the enforceability of arbitration agreements under laws like the Federal Arbitration Act.",

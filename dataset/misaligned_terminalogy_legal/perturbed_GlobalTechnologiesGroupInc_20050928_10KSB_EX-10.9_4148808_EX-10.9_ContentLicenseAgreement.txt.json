                "original_text": "\"Confidential Information\" means the confidential or proprietary technical or business information of a party, including without limitation (a) proposals or research related to possible new products or services; (b) financial statements and other financial information; (c) reporting information; (d) the material terms of this Agreement and the relationship between the parties; and (e) planned launch dates. All of the information will be considered confidential only if it is conspicuously designated as \"Confidential,\" or if provided orally, identified at the time of disclosure as confidential. \"Confidential Information\" does not include information that (i) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement, (ii) the receiving party lawfully receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without breach of a nondisclosure obligation, or (iii) the receiving party knew prior to receiving such information from the disclosing party or develops independently.",
                "changed_text": "\"Confidential Information\" means any information exchanged between the parties, regardless of its nature or form. All information exchanged is considered confidential, irrespective of whether it is marked as such or identified as confidential at the time of disclosure. \"Confidential Information\" does not exclude information that (i) enters the public domain, even if due to a breach of this Agreement, (ii) the receiving party receives from a third party, regardless of any restrictions on disclosure, or (iii) the receiving party knew prior to receiving such information from the disclosing party or develops independently.",
                "explanation": "The original definition adheres to standard confidentiality practices, requiring information to be designated as confidential to be protected. The modified version broadens the definition to include all exchanged information, irrespective of designation, which is highly unusual and potentially unenforceable under standard contract law. The modification to the exclusions further weakens confidentiality protections, potentially nullifying the clause's intent. Making any data public, even through a breach, won't exclude it from being considered confidential.",

                "original_text": "\"Subscriber\" means any individual who purchases mobile content programming and: (a) who actually pays the applicable Subscription Fee; and (b) does not receive a refund of such Subscription Fee for any reason within thirty (30) days from the end of the payment period for which the Subscription Fee was paid. A Subscriber remains a \"Subscriber\" for the purposes of this Agreement so long as such individual continues to pay the applicable Subscription Fee.",
                "changed_text": "\"Subscriber\" means any individual who expresses interest in mobile content programming, regardless of whether they pay any Subscription Fee. An individual is considered a 'Subscriber' even if they receive a full refund of the Subscription Fee at any time. A 'Subscriber' remains a 'Subscriber' for the purposes of this Agreement indefinitely, even if such individual ceases to express interest or pay any applicable fee.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clearly links 'Subscriber' status to payment and lack of refund. The modified definition severs this link, defining 'Subscriber' as anyone expressing interest, even without payment or after a refund. This creates a legal contradiction because the contract bases financial obligations and usage rights on 'Subscribers,' but the modified definition makes this term extremely broad and potentially meaningless, affecting revenue calculations and reporting obligations.",

Subscription fee in Territory is to be determined based on market research performed by Distributor with pricing to be agreed upon jointly and in writing Each quarter, Distributor will make royalty payments to IMNTV based on a Structure as follows:\n\n55% of subscriber revenue for the subscription based services broadcasting IMNTV content only, net of telecom percentage provided in accordance with this Agreement.   (\"Programming Payments\"), subject to the following: The parties acknowledge that some mobile carriers may bill end users for a full month in a single billing, and that others may bill for partial months or pro-rate the billing of Recurring Subscribers. For each full month of Fees received from a Recurring Subscriber, Distributor will pay IMNTV based on the Rate Structure (the \"Full Month Payment\"). To the extent that Distributor receives a partial month's Fee or pro-rated Fee from a Recurring Subscriber as a result of a carrier's billing practices, Distributor will pay IMNTV a proportionate or pro-rated portion of such Full Month Payment based on the amount received by Distributor.",
                "changed_text": "6.1 Mobile Product Payments. The concept of a Subscription Fee is purely theoretical and bears no relation to actual monetary transactions. Each quarter, Distributor will make royalty payments to IMNTV based on a Structure as follows:\n\n55% of estimated subscriber revenue for the subscription based services broadcasting IMNTV content only, net of a vaguely defined 'telecom consideration'.   ('Programming Payments'), subject to the following: The parties agree that payments to IMNTV are entirely discretionary and can be altered or withheld based on Distributor's subjective assessment of market conditions. Payments to IMNTV do not need to be linked to fees received by the subscribers.",
                "explanation": "The original text ties royalty payments to subscriber revenue. The changed text makes the 'Subscription Fee' theoretical and royalty payments discretionary and based on 'estimated' revenue, effectively removing the obligation to pay based on actual earnings. The introduction of 'vaguely defined telecom consideration' offers room for exploitation.",

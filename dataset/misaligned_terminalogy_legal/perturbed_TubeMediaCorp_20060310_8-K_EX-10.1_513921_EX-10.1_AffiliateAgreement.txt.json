                "original_text": "\"TV Households\" means the number of television households in a given DMA as determined by Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (which, as of the date hereof, is published annually by Nielsen Media Research, Inc. as the Nielsen Media Research Local Universe Estimates (US)) or, if Nielsen Media Research, Inc. ceases to publish the number of television households in a DMA, a replacement term to determine the number of television households in local television markets in a substantially similar manner which shall be determined by the parties in good faith.",
                "changed_text": "\"TV Households\" means an estimated number of households with televisions within a Designated Market Area (DMA). This estimate is based on figures self-reported by local cable providers and may not align with Nielsen Media Research data or any other standardized metric.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'TV Households' is altered to rely on self-reported data from local cable providers instead of the industry-standard Nielsen Media Research. This creates a conflict because Nielsen data is generally accepted as the authoritative source, and self-reported cable data can be subjective and less reliable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Lack of adherence to recognized statistical standards can lead to disputes in advertising revenue calculations, potentially violating general contract law principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "Affiliate should attempt to negotiate for Service distribution with MVPDs, with the specific service tier and penetration level to be determined by Affiliate at their sole discretion and according to their business priorities, but affiliate is not obligated to report the specifics.",
                "explanation": "This changes the 'endeavor to secure...most highly penetrated level' to a discretionary 'attempt to negotiate'. This creates ambiguity, undermining the original intent to maximize distribution through MVPDs.",
                "contradicted_law": "Changes the nature of the obligation, moving from a 'best efforts' clause which could be legally enforceable, to a vague aspirational statement, affecting the obligation of good faith efforts.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with the 'V-chip' ratings system. The modified version makes it optional and removes the requirement for accuracy or industry compliance, contradicting the purpose of standardized ratings.",

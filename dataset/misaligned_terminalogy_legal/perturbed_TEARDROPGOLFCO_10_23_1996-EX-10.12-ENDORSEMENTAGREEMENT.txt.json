The modified definition introduces ambiguity and allows TPC to unilaterally decide what constitutes a \"Major Tournament,\" potentially reducing bonus payments to Ogle. This contradicts the intended meaning and creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

In consideration of the rights and benefits granted to TPC hereunder, TPC agrees to pay Consolidated Artists on behalf of Ogle a discretionary payment, termed here as the \"Retainer Fee\" in each Contract Year during the Contract Period.

The changed language makes the payment contingent on TPC's discretion, potentially rendering the clause unenforceable due to lack of consideration. This is a misaligned terminology because a true retainer fee is non-discretionary.",

In addition to the Retainer Fee, Tournament Bonuses and Money List Bonuses set forth in Paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 above, TPC agrees to pay Consolidated Artists on behalf of Ogle royalty compensation of ten percent (10%) of the net sales of all Endorsed Products distributed or sold during the Contract Period in or to the Countries of Australia and New Zealand (\"Royalty Compensation\"). \"Net sales\" shall mean the gross invoice price billed to customers, less customary trade/quantity discounts, rebates and returns actually credited, but with no deductions of any kind. No costs incurred by TPC in the manufacture, advertisement, promotion or exploitation of any Endorsed Product shall be deducted as a cost in calculating the net sales. TPC agrees to guarantee to Consolidated Artists on behalf of Ogle a minimum Royalty Compensation of Twenty Thousand U.S. Dollars ($20,000) payable in four (4) equal installments of Five Thousand U.S. Dollars ($5,000) and due simultaneously with the Retainer Fee on or before the first (1st) day of February, May, August and November in each Contract Year.",

In addition to the Retainer Fee, Tournament Bonuses and Money List Bonuses set forth in Paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 above, TPC agrees to consider providing a potential royalty payment, called the \"Royalty Consideration\", for products sold. The calculation of this Royalty Consideration, if offered, will be at TPC's sole discretion, based on internal sales metrics. TPC might offer something, but does not guarantee a minimum Royalty Consideration.",
                "explanation": "The initial segment distinctly outlines a fixed percentage for royalty payment. By modifying it, the mandatory compensation becomes a mere 'consideration', rendering it optional and subject to TPC's discretion. This alteration contradicts standard royalty agreements and is likely unenforceable due to its vague nature. A key element here is that royalty has a clear definition as being a set percentage. The changes introduce high degrees of legal ambiguity.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to a Party, any corporation, association, or other entity which, directly or indirectly, controls the Party or is controlled by the Party or is under common control with such Party, where \"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the affairs or management of a corporation, association, or other entity through the ownership of fifty percent Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019) or more of the voting securities or otherwise, including having the power to elect a majority of the board of directors or other governing body of such corporation, association, or other entity.",
                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to a Party, any corporation, association, or other entity which, directly or indirectly, controls the Party or is controlled by the Party or is under common control with such Party, where \"control\" means the ability to influence decisions of the Party.",
                "explanation": "The statutory definition of \"affiliate\" often includes specific ownership or control thresholds. By changing the definition of control to 'the ability to influence decisions,' the contract introduces ambiguity and could be interpreted more broadly than intended under corporate law, leading to disputes over which entities qualify as affiliates. This is particularly relevant for determining liability or responsibility within the contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by jurisdiction; generally state corporate laws defining control and affiliate relationships based on ownership.",

                "changed_text": "\"Business Day\" means any day that the Parties mutually agree to consider a Business Day for transactions under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Business Day\" relies on objective criteria (banking institutions being open). The modified definition makes it subjective and dependent on mutual agreement, which contradicts typical legal and commercial understanding. This creates uncertainty about deadlines and obligations, as the definition can change arbitrarily, potentially violating standard interpretations used in contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and objective definitions, and potentially specific state laws related to banking holidays and business days.",

                "original_text": "\"Applicable Laws\" means all supranational, national, state and local laws, rules and regulations and guidelines governing the activities of a Party described in this Agreement within the Territory that are applicable to the manufacture, use, storage, import, export and handling of the Miltenyi Products, including any applicable rules, regulations, guidelines, and other requirements of any Regulatory Authority that may be in effect in the Territory from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "\"Applicable Laws\" means those laws, rules, regulations, and guidelines that a Party deems relevant to its performance under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition ties 'Applicable Laws' to objective legal requirements. The modified definition allows each party to subjectively determine which laws apply, creating a conflict with the principle that laws are binding regardless of a party's opinion. This undermines the enforceability of the contract by allowing parties to selectively comply with legal obligations, contravening principles of regulatory compliance and good faith.",

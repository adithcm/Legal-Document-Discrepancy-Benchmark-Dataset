                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" With respect to any Party to this Agreement may mean any company, corporation, firm, individual or other entity which Controls, is Controlled by or is under common Control with such Party to this Agreement. The determination of affiliate status is subject to the controlling party's discretion and may be altered based on business needs.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Affiliate\" provides a clear and objective standard based on control. The modified definition introduces subjectivity and discretion, potentially conflicting with established legal interpretations of affiliate relationships, particularly in corporate and securities law.",

Force Majeure events are limited to governmental regulations preventing performance, financial difficulties of the party citing force majeure, or other circumstances that the party deems sufficient.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of force majeure includes a comprehensive list of events beyond a party's control.

This Agreement and the relationship between the Parties shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with New York law without regard to provisions related to conflicts of laws, and, except as provided in Section 21.2 above, the Parties agree to submit any dispute to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts sitting in New York.",

The modified clause introduces ambiguity and allows for the governing law to change depending on what the parties 'deem appropriate' at the time of the dispute, contradicting the principle of contractual certainty and potentially rendering the clause unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "Sabco is acting as an independent contractor. Each party is responsible for all taxes relating to its operation, including payroll taxes for its employees, and nothing in this Agreement is intended to create a relationship, express or implied, of employer-employee between Sabco and Prolong.",
                "changed_text": "Sabco is acting as an independent contractor. Each party is responsible for all taxes relating to its operation, excluding payroll taxes, and this Agreement is interpreted to foster a collaborative work environment between Sabco and Prolong.",
                "explanation": "By stating that the parties will 'foster a collaborative work environment', the nature of the relationship is changed from 'independent contractor' to a potential employer-employee relationship, which contradicts the intended nature of relationship.",

                "changed_text": "Sabco shall provide insurance. The amount of spectator liability insurance depends on event attendance and risk assessment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the liability insurance requirements. The original contract explicitly specifies a minimum coverage of $1 million, but this modification makes the coverage amount discretionary and dependent on unspecified factors. This contradicts standard insurance contract principles which usually require a clearly defined amount.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding definiteness of terms; potential violation of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Sabco will try not to represent or accept as a primary, secondary, or associate sponsor any other company potentially competitive with Prolong products.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'will not' and 'reasonably deemed' provide a clear prohibition and standard for competitive conflicts. Changing this to 'try not to' and 'potentially competitive' significantly weakens the exclusivity clause. By using the terms 'try not to' and 'potentially competitive', this section has been made more vague. This introduces uncertainty and contradicts the original intent of the exclusivity agreement, making it unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Adaptimmune recognizes the value of disseminating research results but mandates that MD Anderson requires Adaptimmune's prior consent to publish or otherwise publicly disclose the results and Data of any Study, subject in each case to this Article 12.",
                "explanation": "The original clause grants MD Anderson the right to publish study results, while the modification requires Adaptimmune's consent. This introduces a conflict because academic institutions typically maintain autonomy over research publication. The modified version could impede academic freedom and open dissemination of scientific findings, contradicting typical research standards.",

Exchanges of Confidential Information directly between the Affiliates and Joint Research Partners are also covered by this Agreement. \"Affiliates\" means any individual, company, partnership or other entity which directly or indirectly, at present or in the future, controls, is controlled by or is under common control of a Party, and \"control\" will mean direct or indirect beneficial ownership of at least fifty per cent (50%) of the voting share capital in such company or other business entity, or to hold the effective power to appoint or dismiss members of the management.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement defines 'control' as 50% ownership, which is a standard threshold. By changing the ownership percentage to 20%, the definition of 'Affiliates' becomes significantly broader. This alteration introduces uncertainty because it deviates from the widely accepted understanding of corporate control, potentially causing disputes over which entities are bound by the confidentiality clauses. This impacts enforcement by making it unclear which entities are covered by the agreement's obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Adaptimmune shall assume responsibility for only those medical expenses pre-approved by Adaptimmune incurred by a Study subject for treatment if the Study subject experiences an illness, adverse event or injury that is a result of the Study Drug or any procedure required by the Protocol that the subject would not have undergone were it not for such Study subject's participation in the Study.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires Adaptimmune to cover 'reasonable' medical expenses. The modified clause adds a requirement for 'pre-approval,' which contradicts standard clinical trial protocols where emergency care might be needed. This change allows Adaptimmune to deny coverage for necessary treatments if pre-approval wasn't obtained, potentially violating ethical standards for subject safety and introducing legal ambiguity regarding the definition of 'reasonable'.",

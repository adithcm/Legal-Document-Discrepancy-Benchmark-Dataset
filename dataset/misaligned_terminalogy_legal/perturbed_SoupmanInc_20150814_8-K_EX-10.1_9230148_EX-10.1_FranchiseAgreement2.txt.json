                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Guarantors shall unconditionally guarantee full performance and discharge by Master Franchisee of all the obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement at the times and in the manner therein provided.",
                "changed_text": "Guarantors shall ensure best efforts for the performance and discharge by Master Franchisee of all the obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement at the times and in the manner therein provided.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"unconditionally guarantee full performance\" with \"ensure best efforts for the performance\" significantly weakens the guarantor's obligation. An unconditional guarantee is a legally binding commitment for the full performance, whereas 'best efforts' introduces ambiguity and a lower standard of care, contradicting the original intent and enforceability of the guarantee.",

                "changed_text": "Guarantors shall facilitate payment to Franchisor of monies that Master Franchisee is reasonably able to pay under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"Guarantors shall pay\" to \"Guarantors shall facilitate payment\" and introducing the condition of \"reasonably able to pay\" fundamentally alters the guarantor's financial responsibility. The original clause creates a direct obligation to pay all monies, while the modified clause introduces discretion and a lower threshold, thus potentially violating the strict liability implied in a guarantee agreement.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Franchisor shall not be obligated to proceed against Master Franchisee or exhaust any security from Master Franchisee or pursue or exhaust any remedy, including any legal or equitable relief against Master Franchisee, before proceeding to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee, and the enforcement of such obligations may take place before, after, or contemporaneously with, enforcement of any debt or obligation of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Franchisor should make a reasonable attempt to proceed against Master Franchisee or exhaust security from Master Franchisee before enforcing the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee, and the enforcement of such obligations will take place only after enforcement of any debt or obligation of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Introducing a “reasonable attempt” clause to proceed against the Master Franchisee first and stipulating that the Guarantor obligations can only be enforced after attempts to collect from the Master Franchisee contradicts the original clause. The original clause states there is no obligation to pursue the Master Franchisee first and the enforcement can happen at any time. The modified clause gives the Guarantor leverage, potentially delaying or preventing enforcement of the guarantee, which would contradict standard guarantee agreement principles.",

                "original_text": "1.1.42 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means with respect to the performance of activities under this Agreement by a Party (as pertains to its role in conducting the Clinical Trials): reasonable, diligent, good-faith efforts to accomplish such objective which are consistent with industry standards for companies of comparable size as that of such Party. \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" requires, with respect to a particular task or activity in making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, exporting, developing (including seeking regulatory approvals or applicable pricing or reimbursement approvals) or otherwise commercializing the Product, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such task or activity to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis; (ii) set and consistently seek to achieve specific and meaningful objectives for carrying out such task or activity; and (iii) make and implement decisions and allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives in accordance with established timelines; provided, however, that, to the extent that the performance of a Party's obligations hereunder is adversely affected by the other Party's breach in performing its obligations hereunder, the impact on the first Party of such performance failure by the other Party will be taken into account in determining whether the first Party has used its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to perform any such affected obligations.",
                "changed_text": "1.1.42 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means with respect to the performance of activities under this Agreement by a Party (as pertains to its role in conducting the Clinical Trials): perfunctory attempts to accomplish such objective. \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" requires, with respect to a particular task or activity in making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, exporting, developing (including seeking regulatory approvals or applicable pricing or reimbursement approvals) or otherwise commercializing the Product, that a Party: (i) assign responsibility for such task or activity to employee(s); (ii) set broad objectives for carrying out such task or activity; and (iii) make decisions and allocate minimal resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives; provided, however, that, to the extent that the performance of a Party's obligations hereunder is adversely affected by the other Party's breach in performing its obligations hereunder, the impact on the first Party of such performance failure by the other Party will not be taken into account in determining whether the first Party has used its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to perform any such affected obligations.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" is weakened, and the language is changed to contradict legal precedents. The modified definition now suggests a lower standard of effort than is generally understood or required under common law. Specifically, removing the qualifiers 'reasonable', 'diligent' and 'good-faith' and replacing them with 'perfunctory' directly opposes the established meaning. Further, the original requirement for employees to be 'held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis' has been removed entirely. Limiting the objectives to be 'broad' and 'allocate minimal resources' makes the overall obligation unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The phrase **'tangible personal property and physical assets'** contradicts the established definition of 'Intellectual Property', which is defined as 'intangible assets'. Since intellectual property is governed by specific laws that do not apply to tangible property, the conflict will create ambiguity and make the agreement unenforceable.",

For clarity, a planned medical or surgical procedure is not, in itself, a SUSAR.",
                "changed_text": "1.1.179 \"SUSAR\" may mean a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction, only if there is clear causality as determined by PhaseBio, that is life- threatening (i.e., causes an immediate risk of death) or that results in any of the following outcomes: death; in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability or incapacity (i.e., substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); or a congenital anomaly or birth defect. For clarity, a planned medical or surgical procedure may be considered as a SUSAR at PhaseBio's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of SUSAR significantly alters the legally required reporting standards for adverse events in clinical trials. By adding the 'clear causality as determined by PhaseBio' criterion, it contradicts established regulatory definitions, which require reporting regardless of causality to ensure patient safety. As the original definition did not give such authority to PhaseBio, this makes the term and the agreement conflicting.",

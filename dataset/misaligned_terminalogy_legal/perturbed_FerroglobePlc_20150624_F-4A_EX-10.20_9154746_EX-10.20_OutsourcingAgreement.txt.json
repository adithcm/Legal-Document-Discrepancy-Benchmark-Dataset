The internal network of the factories (hereinafter \"LAN\") is excluded from this Agreement and the Customer is responsible for it.",

The internal network of the factories (hereinafter \"Premises Network\") is excluded from this Agreement and the Customer is responsible for it.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'LAN' (Local Area Network), a term with an established technical definition, with 'Premises Network' introduces ambiguity. The scope and responsibilities related to network management become unclear, as 'Premises Network' is not a standard term and lacks a precise legal or technical meaning.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'is responsible' to 'may be responsible', the contract creates uncertainty around application support and maintenance obligations. This contradicts the principle of clear contractual obligations and introduces a contingency that is not defined.",

It introduces discretion where a regular, defined process existed, undermining data security assurances. This also contradicts established IT best practices concerning data backup frequency.",

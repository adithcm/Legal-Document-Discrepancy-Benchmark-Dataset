                "original_text": "E. \"Gross sales\" as used in this Section 3.01 shall mean the amount of gross revenues received by You from all sources, including without limitation sales of Products, services or other merchandise of every kind or nature from, at or in connection with the operation of the AIRSOPURE Center granted herein, excluding state, federal or local sales taxes collected from customers and paid to the appropriate taxing authority.",
                "changed_text": "E. \"Gross sales\" as used in this Section 3.01 shall mean the amount of gross revenues received by You from all sources, including without limitation sales of Products, services or other merchandise of every kind or nature from, at or in connection with the operation of the AIRSOPURE Center granted herein, including state, federal or local sales taxes collected from customers but not necessarily paid to the appropriate taxing authority.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Gross sales' clearly excludes sales taxes collected from customers and paid to the appropriate taxing authority. This modification includes those taxes in 'Gross Sales', directly conflicting with standard accounting practices and potentially violating tax laws if royalties are calculated on amounts including unremitted taxes.",

                "original_text": "18.03. The relationship between the Parties is that of independent contractors. No partnership, joint venture, employment or relationship of principal and agent is intended, and You may not commit or bind AIRSOPURE to any obligation whatsoever.",
                "changed_text": "18.03. The relationship between the Parties is that of independent contractors, however, AIRSOPURE retains the right to direct the daily activities and business operations of the Franchisee. While no partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is intended, AIRSOPURE may, at its discretion, act as the agent of the Franchisee for certain business purposes, as AIRSOPURE deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement clearly states the relationship is that of independent contractors. The modified version gives AIRSOPURE excessive control over the franchisee's daily operations and suggests a possible agency relationship. This contradicts the definition of 'independent contractor' under common law and IRS guidelines, creating ambiguity and potential misclassification issues.",

                "original_text": "16.03. You covenant and agree that You (or any shareholder if Your Franchise is a corporation) shall not, for a period of two years following termination of this Agreement for any reason, either directly or indirectly own, maintain, engage in, be employed by, advise, consult, assist, invest in or have any interest whatsoever in any business or entity which competes with or offers products or services which are the same or similar to those of AIRSOPURE or the Franchise within a radius of 25 miles of Your Exclusive Territory. In the event a court of competent jurisdiction should hold this covenant to be unreasonable or overly broad, the Parties agree to reduce the scope of such covenant to the maximum restriction permitted by law, and You agree to be bound by such less restrictive terms of this covenant.",
                "changed_text": "16.03. You covenant and agree that You (or any shareholder if Your Franchise is a corporation) shall not, following termination of this Agreement for any reason, either directly or indirectly own, maintain, engage in, be employed by, advise, consult, assist, invest in or have any interest whatsoever in any business or entity, regardless of the type of business, within the United States. In the event a court of competent jurisdiction should hold this covenant to be unreasonable or overly broad, the Parties agree that the covenant remains valid to the fullest extent permissible by law.",
                "explanation": "The original clause contains a reasonable non-compete agreement, limited to similar businesses and a specific geographic area. The modified version expands the restriction to any business anywhere in the United States, making it unreasonable and likely unenforceable. The clause stating that even if deemed overly broad, the covenant remains valid to the fullest extent permissible exacerbates the issue and is legally questionable.",

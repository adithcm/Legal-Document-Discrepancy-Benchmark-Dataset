                "original_text": "Owners Capacity: means the Transportation Capacity of the Pipeline necessary in a period of time for the Transportation Crude Oil owned by its owners, its parent companies or subsidiaries.",
                "changed_text": "Owners Capacity: means the Transportation Capacity of the Pipeline sometimes necessary for the Transportation Crude Oil managed by its owners, its parent companies or subsidiaries.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines 'Owner's Capacity' as a necessary Transportation Capacity. Modifying 'necessary' to 'sometimes necessary' introduces ambiguity about whether this capacity is guaranteed or subject to other factors, potentially conflicting with regulations ensuring pipeline access.",
                "contradicted_law": "Unclear—violates principles of contracts, which need clear definitions.",

                "original_text": "Preferred Right: means the power that the National Government has through the National Agency of Hydrocarbons (ANH) or whoever replaces it, on the Design Capacity of the Pipeline for the Transportation of royalty Crude. This preference is limited to Crude Oil coming from royalties corresponding to production served through the Pipeline. The preferred right shall be up to 20% of the design Capacity.",
                "changed_text": "Preferred Right: means the suggestion that the National Government has through the National Agency of Hydrocarbons (ANH) or whoever replaces it, on the Design Capacity of the Pipeline for the Transportation of royalty Crude. This preference is not limited to Crude Oil coming from royalties corresponding to production served through the Pipeline. The preferred right could be more than 20% of the design Capacity.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the 'Preferred Right' as a limited power with a cap of 20% of the design capacity. By changing 'means the power that' to 'means the suggestion that,' 'is limited to' to 'is not limited to,' and 'shall be up to 20%' to 'could be more than 20%,' the modification removes the certainty of the government's rights and introduces the possibility of exceeding capacity limits, which can create legal uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "By including 'management decisions' in the definition of 'Justified Event', it allows the Transporter to potentially evade liability for operational failures or strategic choices that negatively impact the Sender, contradicting the normal understanding of justified events, which usually are considered as external events.",

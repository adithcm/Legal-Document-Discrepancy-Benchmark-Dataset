A force majeure event that occurs respecting one or more Downstream Pipelines for which there are no reasonable alternatives for a Claiming Party to utilize in order to meet its duties and obligations under this Agreement, regardless of whether such Downstream Pipeline declared such force majeure event, shall constitute Force Majeure for purposes of this Agreement, subject to the requirement of the first sentence of this definition. The failure of a Claiming Party to settle or prevent a strike or other labor dispute with employees shall not be considered to be a matter within such Claiming Party's control.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'reasonable control' to 'sole discretion', the definition of Force Majeure is weakened. Under typical legal interpretations, 'reasonable control' implies a standard of due diligence and commercial reasonableness, which is a higher bar than 'sole discretion'. This introduces ambiguity because a party could argue that an event was within their 'sole discretion' to prevent, even if preventing it would be commercially unreasonable or impractical, thereby voiding force majeure claims. This could cause uncertainty over Force Majeure claims.",

Transporter reserves the right to reject any and all shipments of: (i) Crude Petroleum delivered by Shipper to Transporter whose gravity, viscosity, and/or other characteristics are such that it is not readily susceptible to transportation through the Transporter's existing facilities and it will damage the quality of other shipments or cause disadvantage to other shippers and/or the Transporter; (ii) Crude Petroleum containing water, sediment and other impurities totaling in excess of one per cent as determined by centrifugal test, or by such other tests as may be agreed upon by the Shipper and Transporter; or (iii) Crude Petroleum where Shipper has failed to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations made by any governmental authorities regarding shipment of Crude Petroleum.",

Transporter reserves the right to reject any and all shipments of: (i) Crude Petroleum delivered by Shipper to Transporter whose gravity, viscosity, and/or other characteristics are undesirable; (ii) Crude Petroleum containing water, sediment and other impurities totaling in excess of five per cent as determined by Transporter; or (iii) Crude Petroleum where Shipper has failed to comply with Transporter's internal policies.",
                "explanation": "This alteration involves replacing specific, objectively measurable criteria with vague and subjective language. Changing 'not readily susceptible to transportation through the Transporter's existing facilities' to 'undesirable' gives the Transporter broad, unchecked discretion. Increasing the water, sediment, and impurities threshold from 1% to 5% and removing the need for agreement on test methods, along with replacing compliance with 'applicable laws, rules, and regulations' with 'Transporter's internal policies,' creates significant opportunities for arbitrary rejection of shipments, contradicting standard quality control practices and potentially violating regulations regarding fair access and transportation.",

                "explanation": "Removing the exception for indemnification obligations and eliminating the types of damages that cannot be claimed significantly alters the risk allocation in the contract. The original clause allowed for indemnification for third-party claims and specified certain types of damages that could not be claimed. By omitting these provisions, the revised clause attempts to create an absolute bar against any liability, which may be unenforceable under state laws that do not allow parties to completely waive liability for their own negligence, especially concerning third-party claims. This introduces enforceability issues and contradicts standard legal practice regarding negligence and indemnification.",

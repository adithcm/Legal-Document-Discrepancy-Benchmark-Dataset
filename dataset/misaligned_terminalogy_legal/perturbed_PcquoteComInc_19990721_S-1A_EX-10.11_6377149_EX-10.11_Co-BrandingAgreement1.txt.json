                "explanation": "The original definition of \"SOFTWARE\" is specific and tied to displaying market data. The modified definition broadens it to \"digital content\" and introduces uncertainty by stating it \"may or may not\" display market data and can be \"arbitrarily altered.\" This contradicts the implied reliance on accurate and reliable data, potentially violating SEC regulations or FINRA rules requiring accurate financial data.",

The modified definition removes any such guarantees and grants PCQ complete discretion over the content, even to the point of possibly excluding stock quotes. This undermines the entire purpose of the agreement and raises concerns about compliance with regulations requiring accurate and complete market data. By including 'PCQ has no obligation to include or exclude any data,' it makes the obligation of PCQ open to interpretation.",

                "explanation": "The original text specified the limit as the amount paid in the last 12 months. This creates a fixed, calculable amount. The modified text replaces this with \"reasonable money damages.\" This introduces ambiguity and shifts the liability determination to a court or arbitrator, making it difficult to predict the extent of liability. In Illinois, limitations on liability must be clear and unequivocal. Replacing it with reasonable money damages could lead to litigation about the definition of \"reasonable.\" This change also impacts the enforceability of the liability clause under Illinois law, which generally permits such limitations if they are conspicuous and unambiguous.",

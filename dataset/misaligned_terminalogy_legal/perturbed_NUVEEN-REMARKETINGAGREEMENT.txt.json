                "original_text": "\"Remarketing Memorandum\" means the Prospectus or any other written communication describing the Fund and/or the terms of the VRRM-MFP Shares, which has been approved by the Fund in writing for use in connection with remarketing prior to its use, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.",
                "changed_text": "\"Remarketing Memorandum\" means any communication, whether written or verbal, describing the Fund and/or the terms of the VRRM-MFP Shares, which may or may not be explicitly approved by the Fund for use in connection with remarketing.",
                "explanation": "The original definition requires written approval by the Fund for the Remarketing Memorandum. The modified version contradicts this by including verbal communications and removing the strict requirement for approval, creating uncertainty about what constitutes an approved remarketing material.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Act of 1933 - requirements for disclosure in securities offerings.",

                "changed_text": "The Remarketing Agent may, at any time and without prior notice, alter the settlement procedures as deemed necessary, irrespective of potential impacts on Holders, Beneficial Owners, the Calculation and Paying Agent, or the Fund.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for prior notice and the constraint that modifications should not adversely affect other parties. This contradicts standard financial regulations that require transparency and consideration of stakeholders' interests, potentially causing disputes over settlement.",

                "changed_text": "The Fund and the Investment Adviser will, at their convenience, consider reimbursing each Indemnified Person for legal or other expenses incurred. Reimbursement is entirely discretionary and may not cover expenses if the Remarketing Agent uses unapproved information.",
                "explanation": "The original clause creates an obligation to reimburse expenses, whereas the modified version makes it discretionary and removes the reasonably incurred standard. This introduces ambiguity and potential disputes, contradicting the purpose of the indemnification clause in protecting the Remarketing Agent.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with guidance, the undersigned hereby acknowledge an arrangement for collaborative submission of filings concerning the Schedule 13D statement, including subsequent revisions, related to the securities of the specified issuer, and its inclusion as an addendum to said filings.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states compliance with Rule 13d-1(k) of the Securities Exchange Act, requiring a formal joint filing agreement. The modified text replaces 'Rule 13d-1(k)' with a vague reference to 'guidance', and 'agreement' with 'arrangement', and 'Exhibit' with 'addendum'. This introduces ambiguity about whether the parties are actually legally bound by the formal requirements of Rule 13d-1(k), potentially undermining the enforceability of the joint filing requirement.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This arrangement may be implemented through multiple copies; however, acknowledgement of these copies does not equate to them forming one unified arrangement.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes the legal principle that multiple counterparts of the agreement are considered original and form a single agreement, which is standard legal practice. The modified text undermines this by stating that acknowledging the copies does not equate to forming a unified arrangement. This contradicts established contract law principles, which could jeopardize the validity and enforceability of the agreement if only counterpart copies exist. It implies that a complete, signed original is required, which is not necessarily true under the law if counterparts are explicitly allowed.",

                "changed_text": "Acknowledging this arrangement, the below parties offer affirmations as of February 20, 2020.",
                "explanation": "The original text, 'execute this Agreement,' is a formal declaration of intent to be legally bound. Changing it to 'offer affirmations' reduces the legal force of the signing, making it less certain that the parties intended to enter into a legally binding agreement. The term 'execute' has a clear legal meaning, while 'offer affirmations' is vague and non-committal.",

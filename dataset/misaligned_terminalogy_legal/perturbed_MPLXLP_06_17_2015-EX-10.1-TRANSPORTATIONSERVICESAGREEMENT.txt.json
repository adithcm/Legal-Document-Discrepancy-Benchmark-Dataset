                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"Product\" means the commodities commonly associated as specialty petroleum products, specifically condensate, natural gasoline, and diluent. Product may also include liquefied petroleum gas commodities such as butane. Product, as designed in this Agreement, does not refer to finished gasoline and diesel products.",
                "changed_text": "\"Product\" means any substance that can be transported via pipeline, including but not limited to crude oil, refined petroleum products, and other marketable liquids. Product explicitly includes finished gasoline and diesel products.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Product' specifically excluded finished gasoline and diesel products. The modified definition now explicitly includes them, contradicting the original intent and potentially conflicting with regulatory definitions concerning what can be transported in specific types of pipelines. This introduces uncertainty about the scope of the agreement and could lead to disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal pipeline safety regulations (49 CFR Part 195) and state-specific regulations on pipeline transportation of hazardous liquids.",

                "original_text": "Subject to the provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement, if the volume of each Product shipped by Shipper on the Pipeline during the Quarter is less than the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment for that Product then, in addition to paying any amounts incurred by Shipper pursuant to Section 3.4 with respect to Shipper Deliveries for such Quarter, Shipper shall also pay MPL a deficiency payment (the \"Quarterly Deficiency Payment\"); equal to the product of:\n\n(a) the difference between the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment for that Product for such Quarter and the volume of Shipper Deliveries of that Product on the Pipeline for such Quarter (the \"Deficiency Volume\"); and\n\n(b) the applicable Tariff Rate for that Product for such Quarter.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement, if the volume of any substance shipped by Shipper on the Pipeline during the Quarter is less than the general Quarterly Volume Commitment, Shipper will not be subject to a deficiency payment. The decision to enforce a deficiency payment is at the discretion of MPL.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates a 'Quarterly Deficiency Payment' if volume commitments aren't met. The modified text removes this obligation and makes deficiency payments discretionary. This directly contradicts the original agreement and creates uncertainty about the enforcement of volume commitments, potentially affecting the financial viability of the pipeline project.",

                "original_text": "If, during any Quarter of the Contract Year, Shipper deliveries on the Pipeline exceed the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment requirements, Shipper shall be permitted to apply Prepaid Transportation Credits against any amount due from Shipper and payable to MPL with respect to the transportation of volumes on the Pipeline for such Quarter. Any Prepaid Transportation Credits that are not used by Shipper during the four (4) Quarters immediately following the Quarter for which said Prepaid Transportation Credits were posted to Shipper's account (the \"Credit Period\") will expire.",
                "changed_text": "If, during any Quarter of the Contract Year, Shipper deliveries on the Pipeline exceed the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment requirements, Shipper may, at MPLâ€™s sole discretion, be permitted to apply Prepaid Transportation Credits against any amount due from Shipper and payable to MPL. All Prepaid Transportation Credits are subject to immediate forfeiture, regardless of usage, at the discretion of MPL.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a 'Credit Period' for using 'Prepaid Transportation Credits.' The modified text introduces discretionary application of credits and the possibility of immediate forfeiture. This undermines the value of the credits and creates uncertainty about whether Shipper will receive the benefit of these prepayments, contradicting the intent of the original agreement and potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles of good faith and fair dealing, potentially state-specific laws regarding prepayment for services.",

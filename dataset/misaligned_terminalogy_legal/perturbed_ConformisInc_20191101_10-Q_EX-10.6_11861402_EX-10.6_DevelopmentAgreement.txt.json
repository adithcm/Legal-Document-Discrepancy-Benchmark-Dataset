                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"Invention\" means any idea, invention, discovery, know-how, data, work of authorship, information, improvement, technology, process, concept or material, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or protectable as a trade secret, and whether or not reduced to practice or memorialized in writing.",
                "changed_text": "\"Invention\" means any idea, discovery, data, work of authorship, information, technology, process, concept or material, that is patentable, copyrightable or protectable as a trade secret, and reduced to practice or memorialized in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original definition includes items 'whether or not patentable, copyrightable or protectable as a trade secret, and whether or not reduced to practice or memorialized in writing'. The modified definition limits 'invention' to only those ideas that meet those requirements, conflicting with standard IP definitions that consider a broader range of creations as inventions, which creates uncertainty and restricts the scope of IP protection, potentially leading to disputes over ownership and usage rights.",

                "changed_text": "\"Applicable Laws\" means all applicable federal and state laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'local and foreign laws, orders, writs, injunctions and decrees of any kind,' the modified definition creates ambiguity about the contract's adherence to local regulations and international legal standards, which are critical in global business contexts. This contradiction introduces a risk of non-compliance and legal challenges in jurisdictions outside the US and individual states.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees, to execute, acknowledge and deliver documents and instruments to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement, with reasonable additional consideration.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires parties to fulfill necessary actions 'without any additional consideration'. The modified clause introduces 'reasonable additional consideration,' which can create disputes. It conflicts with standard contract law principles that require all contract modifications to be supported by new consideration. This shift complicates the enforcement of the agreement.",

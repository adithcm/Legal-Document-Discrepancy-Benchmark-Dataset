                "original_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company hereby appoints the Agent, and the Agent hereby accepts appointment, as an authorized distributor agent within the Territory, (Territory as outlined in section 1.2), for the promotion, sale and collection of payment for, the Products to Customers. The Company has appointed a limited number of Agents; however, the Company retains the right to itself, and/or appoint others to, promote, sell, and collect payment for, and distribute, the Products to Customers in the Territory.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company hereby appoints the Agent, and the Agent hereby accepts appointment, as an authorized distributor agent within the Territory, (Territory as outlined in section 1.2), for the promotion, sale and collection of payment for, the Products to Customers. The Company retains the right to itself, and/or appoint others to, promote, sell, and collect payment for, and distribute, the Products to Customers in the Territory.",
                "explanation": "The term 'limited number of agents' was removed, contradicting the initial exclusivity implied in appointing an 'authorized distributor agent'. This creates ambiguity about the agent's exclusive rights and violates contract law regarding clear and unambiguous terms, making enforcement uncertain. Also by removing the limitation, it means they can also appoint as many new agents as they want, thus diluting the first agent's market share.",

Any deviation from current pricing as indicated by the Company is a violation of this contract. All prices are F.O.B. the Customer's facility and are exclusive of any federal, state or local sales, use, privilege, excise or similar taxes or duties levied upon any party.",

Any significant deviation from current pricing as indicated by the Company is a violation of this contract. All prices are delivered at the customers door and inclusive of any federal, state or local sales, use, privilege, excise or similar taxes or duties levied upon any party.",
                "explanation": "Modifying pricing terms creates a contradiction regarding price determination. It introduces ambiguity by not having a price list. The changes to what consists a violation also makes it vague and unenforceable.",

Each product liability insurance policy of the Company will name the Agent (as its interest may appear) as an additional insured under the policy and provide for at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Agent of any cancellation, modification, or amendment of this policy.

Each product liability insurance policy of the Company will name the Agent as an additional insured under the policy. Each party will furnish to the other if they feel like it a Certificate of Insurance or other documentation that suits them evidencing compliance with this Paragraph 3.3.",
                "explanation": "Removing the notice clause and the 'reasonably satisfactory' clause weakens the insurance obligations. The 'as its interest may appear' was removed so it may cause issues as the company is no longer insuring it based on their best interest. The term 'if they feel like it' completely contradicts any contractual agreement. This creates significant uncertainty about whether insurance requirements are actually enforceable, potentially violating standards of commercial reasonableness and contractual obligations to provide adequate protection.",

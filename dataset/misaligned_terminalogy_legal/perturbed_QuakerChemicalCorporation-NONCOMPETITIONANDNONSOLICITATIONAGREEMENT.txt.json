                "original_text": "Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the \"Non- Compete Period\"), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, not more than five (5%) percent collectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged; (ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in such Seller's business as conducted on the Effective Date and reasonable extensions thereof, which may include routine, day-to-day transactions with any entity, and (iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller acquires control after the Effective Date provided that the acquired business did not receive more than $25,000,000 of its aggregate net sales (as measured during the 12 full calendar months prior to such acquisition) from product lines included within the definition of Company Business.",
                "changed_text": "Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the \"Non- Compete Period\"), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or oversee any business which possibly interacts with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who at any time worked with any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, up to twenty (20%) percent collectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person; (ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller from engaging in any kind of transactions, and (iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller acquires control after the Effective Date regardless of the revenue obtained from product lines included within the definition of Company Business.",
                "explanation": "The terms \"competes with\" and \"engaged in\" regarding the Combined Business were replaced with much broader, less defined terms like \"possibly interacts with\" and \"at any time worked with.\" Additionally, the passive investor ownership percentage was increased to 20% and the revenue exception for acquired businesses was removed, creating substantial loopholes. The term \"reasonable extensions thereof\" and \"routine, day-to-day transactions\" were also made more ambiguous.",

                "original_text": "Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the \"Non-Solicit Period\"), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former 3 employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.",
                "changed_text": "Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the \"Non-Solicit Period\"), each Seller shall not, directly: (i) aggressively induce any key employee of the Combined Business to consider other opportunities, or (ii) formally solicit the current highest-ranking employees of the Combined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall also not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) immediately after their employment was terminated or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business through any means.",
                "explanation": "The non-solicitation clause has been significantly weakened by altering the definitions of prohibited actions. The terms \"induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade\" have been narrowed to \"aggressively induce\" and \"formally solicit\". The phrase \"any employee\" has been restricted to \"key employee\" and \"current highest-ranking employees\". Additionally, the waiting period for soliciting former employees has been removed and all restrictions on how employees are solicited has been changed.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pennsylvania law regarding non-solicitation agreements requires them to be reasonably tailored to protect legitimate business interests. This change makes the non-solicitation agreement so weak that it may fail to adequately protect Buyer's legitimate interests in maintaining its workforce.",

                "original_text": "Each Seller agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, the damage to Buyer will be inestimable and that therefore any remedy at Law or in monetary damages shall be inadequate. Accordingly, the parties agree that Buyer shall, in addition to monetary damages incurred by reason of any such breach or potential breach, without the necessity of posting any bond or similar instrument (and Sellers hereby irrevocably waive any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument) be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) against the Sellers for breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Seller acknowledges that in the event of a potential breach of this Agreement, it is likely that Buyer will experience damages, and the parties agree that Buyer may, subject to further negotiation and the posting of a bond, be entitled to possibly seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) against the Sellers for actual, proven breaches of this Agreement. It is understood that there is no guarantee of injunctive relief and Buyer may elect to seek damages in that case.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provided a strong entitlement to injunctive relief for Buyer. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by adding conditions like 'subject to further negotiation and the posting of a bond,' and 'possibly seek injunctive relief'. The term 'inestimable' was removed.",
                "contradicted_law": "By weakening the certainty of injunctive relief, the contract diminishes the Buyer's protection against breaches, potentially undermining the intended enforcement mechanisms under contract law. Some states might see this as an unreasonable limitation on remedies.",

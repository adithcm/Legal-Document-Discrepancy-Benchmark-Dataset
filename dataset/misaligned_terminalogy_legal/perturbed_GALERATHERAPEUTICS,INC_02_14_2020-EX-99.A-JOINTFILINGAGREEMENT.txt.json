                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \"Exchange Act\") the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of Clarus IV-A, L.P., Clarus IV-B, L.P., Clarus IV-C, L.P., Clarus IV-D, L.P., Clarus IV GP, L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.L.C., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings I/II GP L.L.C., The Blackstone Group Inc., Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. and Stephen A. Schwarzman, on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \"Exchange Act\") the undersigned hereby agree to a voluntary association for filing of Clarus IV-A, L.P., Clarus IV-B, L.P., Clarus IV-C, L.P., Clarus IV-D, L.P., Clarus IV GP, L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.L.C., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings I/II GP L.L.C., The Blackstone Group Inc., Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. and Stephen A. Schwarzman, on behalf of each of them of any submission deemed appropriate by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and further agree to the inclusion of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto, at their convenience.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'joint filing' with 'voluntary association for filing' and 'filing required' with 'submission deemed appropriate' introduces ambiguity and contradicts the mandatory nature of filings under the Securities Exchange Act. The phrase 'at their convenience' weakens the obligation to file, conflicting with SEC regulations.",

                "changed_text": "Each of them aims to contribute to the filings of such filings and any updates, and for the integrity of the data related to such person shared; but none of them is accountable for the integrity of the data concerning the other persons involved in the submission, unless such person is certain that such data is incorrect.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'responsible' with 'aims to contribute' and 'accountable' weakens the liability for accurate filings, and replacing 'completeness and accuracy' and 'inaccurate' with 'integrity of data' and 'incorrect' introduces vagueness about the standard of care required, conflicting with the strict requirements of the Exchange Act.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain active until deemed inactive by mutual understanding among the participants, communicated informally. Termination applies broadly.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'full force and effect' with 'active until deemed inactive' replaces the formal revocation process with an ambiguous 'mutual understanding communicated informally', and replacing 'revoked by any party' with 'mutual understanding among the participants' removes the right of individual parties to revoke. By removing the clause 'only with respect to such revoking party' by replacing it with 'Termination applies broadly', this undermines the enforceability of individual obligations and creates inconsistency with securities regulations requiring specific and documented revocation procedures.",

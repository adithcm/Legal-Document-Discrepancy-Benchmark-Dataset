Integrity will act only on its own behalf as principal should it choose to enter into selling agreements with selected dealers or others.",

Integrity will act only on its own behalf as principal should it choose to enter into selling agreements with selected dealers or others.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the standard definition of 'independent contractor,' who generally lacks the authority to represent the principal. By granting Integrity the potential authority to represent the Fund unless explicitly denied, the contract blurs the line between an independent contractor and an agent, creating potential legal ambiguity regarding liability and responsibility. This undermines the independence typically associated with an independent contractor status.",

For purposes of this Agreement, \"distribution expenses\" of Integrity shall mean all expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, including, but not limited to, office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services; (b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising; (c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund; (d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund; (e) costs involved in obtaining whatever information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.8 Integrity will bear a portion of the expenses in connection with the performance of its services and the incurring of distribution expenses under this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, \"distribution expenses\" of Integrity shall mean some expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, potentially including the following: (a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, possibly including office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services; (b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, but only those approved by the fund, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising; (c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund, pending fund approval; (d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund, contingent on fund consent; (e) costs involved in obtaining only the information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and",
                "explanation": "By changing 'all expenses' to 'a portion of the expenses' and adding conditional language like 'potentially including' and 'possibly including' with fund approval, the definition of 'distribution expenses' becomes ambiguous. The original clear allocation of expenses solely to Integrity is now blurred, potentially shifting some undefined portion of the cost back to the Fund. This contradicts standard interpretations where distribution agreements clearly define expense responsibilities, creating uncertainty in enforcement. The changes create ambiguity over which distribution expenses are actually Integrity's responsibility, thus shifting some burden to the fund to determine whether to cover all the expenses.",

The approval does not require final sign-off.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires 'specific approval' by a majority of qualified trustees for annual renewal. The modification changes 'specifically approved' to 'tentatively approved' and changes 'a vote of a majority' to 'a recommendation by a minority', effectively lowering the standard for renewal. Further, the sentence `The approval does not require final sign-off` gives the suggestion of automatic approval if not explicitly disapproved. This contradicts the explicit requirements for approval under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which necessitate affirmative approval by a qualified majority. By diluting the approval requirement, the enforceability of the renewal clause becomes uncertain, potentially leading to automatic renewals without proper oversight. It conflicts with the spirit and letter of the 1940 Act's provisions for protecting fund shareholders by ensuring proper governance.",

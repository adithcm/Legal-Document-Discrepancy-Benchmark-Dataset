                "original_text": "14.1 Definitions. When used in this Agreement, the following terms have the - following meanings:\n\n\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any given Person, any other Person at the time directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with that Person, or (2) any director, officer or employee of that Person. For purposes of this Agreement, \"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "14.1 Definitions. When used in this Agreement, the following terms have the - following meanings:\n\n\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any given Person, any other Person the parties decide. For purposes of this Agreement, \"control\" means the suggestion, indirectly, of the power to offer or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through public opinion, by request or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' is based on legal standards of control, typically involving ownership. The modified definition changes 'control' to a vaguer and less legally defined concept of 'suggestion' through public opinion. This contradicts standard corporate law definitions.",

Nothing in this Agreement creates, or will be deemed to create, a partnership or the relationship of principal and agent or employer and employee between the parties. Each party agrees to perform under this Agreement as an independent contractor if necessary,",
                "explanation": "By adding the phrase 'if necessary', the contract now introduces uncertainty about the actual status of the parties. This can contradict the legal requirements defining an 'independent contractor' relationship, particularly regarding behavioral control and financial risk.",

Any Cartridges that Medica manufactures under this Agreement must conform to the specifications in Exhibit D (the \"Specifications\") and (2) be manufactured, labeled, packaged, stored, and tested (while in the possession of, stored by, or under the control of Medica) in accordance with cGMP. Medica shall provide adequate packaging for protection during normal shipping and handling environments.",

Any Cartridges that Medica manufactures under this Agreement must vaguely conform to specifications vaguely described in Exhibit D (the \"Specifications\") and (2) be manufactured, labeled, packaged, stored, and tested (while in the possession of, stored by, or under the control of Medica) with manufacturing standards, guidelines and regulations but not limited to ISO 13485, US 21CFR 820 FDA (\"QSR\"), EU MDD 93/43 and Canadian MDR. Medica shall provide any kind of packaging.",
                "explanation": "By changing the original definition to 'vaguely conform' and 'any kind of packaging' introduces subjective interpretation, contradicting the clear intent of 'conform to the specifications in Exhibit D'. Furthermore, changing the cGMP standards to what is not limited to a list of ISO/FDA regulations introduces legal uncertainty regarding the manufacturing quality.",

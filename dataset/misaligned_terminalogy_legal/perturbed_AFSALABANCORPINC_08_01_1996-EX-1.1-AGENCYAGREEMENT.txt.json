                "explanation": "Federal regulations dictate the conversion process and oversight for federally-chartered savings and loan associations, implying a 'state-chartered' conversion introduces conflicting jurisdiction and uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'substantially amended so as to materially and adversely change' to 'slightly amended so as to indirectly change' introduces ambiguity regarding the threshold for termination. Also the 'completion' was changed to 'commencement', creating uncertainty about when Capital Resources' role ceases.",

                "explanation": "Replacing specific affirmations with vague, qualified statements (e.g., 'duly authorized' becomes 'authorized to conduct some business,' 'all material licenses' becomes 'some licenses') weakens the representations and warranties. This makes enforcement more difficult due to increased ambiguity and uncertainty regarding compliance.",

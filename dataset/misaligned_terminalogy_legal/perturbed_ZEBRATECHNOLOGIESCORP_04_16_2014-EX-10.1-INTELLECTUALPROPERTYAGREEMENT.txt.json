(including translation into other computer language and any other form in which an existing work may be recast, transformed or adapted which would constitute a derivative work under the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §101), and (ii) with respect to Know-How, it shall also mean any material derived from such Know-How.",
                "changed_text": "(t) \"Derivative Works\" (i) with respect to copyrightable works shall have the meaning set forth in the company's internal guidelines, which may or may not align with the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §101, et seq. (including translation into other computer language and any other form in which an existing work may be recast, transformed or adapted which would constitute a derivative work under the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §101), and (ii) with respect to Know-How, it shall also mean any material derived from such Know-How.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Derivative Works\" for copyrightable works directly references the U.S. Copyright Act. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating that the meaning could also be defined by the company's internal guidelines, which creates a legal contradiction. The phrase 'may or may not align with the U.S. Copyright Act' directly contradicts the reliance on established legal definitions.",

Object Code includes firmware, compiled or interpreted programmable logic, libraries, objects, bytecode, machine code, and middleware.",

The definition may include or exclude certain types of code at Seller's discretion, regardless of whether the code is directly executable or derived from Source Code. This definition supersedes any generally accepted definition of Object Code.",
                "explanation": "This change provides a conflicting definition of \"Object Code\" where the seller has the right to unilaterally modify the definition as needed. This deviation from established legal and industry norms creates uncertainty about what qualifies as 'Object Code', creating enforceability issues.",

                "explanation": "By restricting the definition of \"Trademarks\" to 'only those with federal registration', the modified text creates a direct contradiction.

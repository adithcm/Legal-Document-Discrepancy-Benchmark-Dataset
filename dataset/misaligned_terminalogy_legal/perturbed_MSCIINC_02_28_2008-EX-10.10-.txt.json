                "original_text": "(c) \"MS Licensed Materials\" means collectively, to the extent owned by a member of the MS Provider Group, any hardware settings and configurations, generic software libraries and routines, and generic document templates not separately commercialized by the MS Provider Group (as defined below) and used by MSCI prior to the Trigger Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the MS Licensed Materials does not include (i) any patent, trademark or service mark of the MS Provider Group, or (ii) any infrastructure hardware or software (e.g., monitoring software and systems, customized operating systems (and components such as AFS, DNS, AD, etc.), and middleware). For the avoidance of doubt, the document templates do not include any references to members of the MS Provider Group or its personnel.",
                "changed_text": "(c) \"MS Licensed Materials\" means collectively, any materials licensed to MSCI, regardless of ownership. For the avoidance of doubt, the MS Licensed Materials does not exclude any patent, trademark or service mark of the MS Provider Group, or any infrastructure hardware or software. For the avoidance of doubt, the document templates include references to members of the MS Provider Group or its personnel.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"MS Licensed Materials\" specifies ownership by the MS Provider Group and excludes certain items. The modified definition broadens the scope to include any materials licensed to MSCI, regardless of ownership, and removes the exclusions for patents, trademarks, infrastructure hardware/software, and references to MS Provider Group personnel. This creates a contradiction because the original definition is limited and the changed definition is broad, potentially leading to disputes over what is considered \"Licensed Materials\" and violating intellectual property laws.",

                "explanation": "The original grant is perpetual, irrevocable, and royalty-free, implying long-term, unrestricted usage rights. The modified grant introduces terms that directly contradict these characteristics: \"terminable at will,\" \"revocable with notice,\" \"geographically restricted,\" and \"royalty-bearing.\" This creates uncertainty and potential legal challenges because the terms of the license are no longer clearly defined, undermining the initial grant.",

The modified contract explicitly states that the license grants include implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. This creates a direct legal contradiction, as the presence or absence of warranties significantly affects liability and risk allocation under contract and commercial law.",

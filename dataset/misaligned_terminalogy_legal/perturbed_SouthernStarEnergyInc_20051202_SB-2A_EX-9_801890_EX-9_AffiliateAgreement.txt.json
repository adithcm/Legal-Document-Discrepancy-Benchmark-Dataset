                "original_text": "Instead of fixed compensation, the Affiliate receives result- dependent Advertising Cost Compensation (also known in the element 5 Control Panel as \"Commission\") in exchange for publishing the advertisements. The Advertising Cost Compensation depends on the actual sales generated by end users referred via the electronic advertisement (the Affiliate's link).",
                "changed_text": "Instead of fixed compensation, the Affiliate receives result- dependent Advertising Cost Reimbursement (also known in the element 5 Control Panel as \"Commission\") in exchange for publishing the advertisements. The Advertising Cost Reimbursement depends on management discretion, not necessarily on actual sales generated by end users referred via the electronic advertisement (the Affiliate's link).",
                "explanation": "The term 'Advertising Cost Compensation' is replaced with 'Advertising Cost Reimbursement,' and the definition is altered to imply that the amount is based on 'management discretion' rather than 'actual sales.' This contradicts the fundamental principle of affiliate marketing, where compensation is directly tied to sales performance. This change introduces ambiguity and potential for disputes regarding payment.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles of 'consideration' and 'mutual agreement,' where performance-based compensation is a key element of the agreement.",

All actions carried out with the user ID and password will be attributed to the Affiliate.",
                "changed_text": "If the Affiliate loses its password or if there is a possibility that an unauthorized party has learned the user ID and password, the Affiliate shall report this to element 5 at their earliest convenience, and element 5 may block access at its discretion. Actions carried out with the user ID and password may, at element 5's sole discretion, be attributed to the Affiliate.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the obligation of the affiliate to report security breaches 'immediately', replacing it with 'earliest convenience'. Additionally, it replaces 'will be attributed' with 'may...be attributed, at element 5's sole discretion'. This creates uncertainty about accountability for unauthorized actions and contradicts principles of security and responsibility for user accounts.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall indicate' to 'may optionally indicate' and portraying the affiliate as a 'representative' instead of an 'independent partner,' the modification obscures the affiliate's true relationship with the software publisher. This is a subtle change that can lead to misrepresentation and potentially violate consumer protection laws requiring clear disclosure of business relationships.",

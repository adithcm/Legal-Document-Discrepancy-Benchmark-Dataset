                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Company agrees that Distributor shall not be liable or subject to reevaluation for failure to meet expectations due to any occurrence beyond Distributor's reasonable control, including, but not limited to, Acts of God, fires, floods, wars, sabotage, accidents in shipping, labor disturbances, weather conditions, governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by Company, failure of Company to honor warranties or otherwise materially support the Products.",
                "changed_text": "Company agrees that Distributor shall not be liable or subject to reevaluation for failure to meet expectations due to minor inconveniences. The reasons the distributor is not liable are at the company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The term 'occurrence beyond Distributor's reasonable control' is replaced with 'minor inconveniences,' creating a legal uncertainty. 'Force majeure' events have a clear legal definition, whereas 'minor inconveniences' is vague and open to interpretation. This contradicts the intent of the contract and could lead to disputes over liability under contract law.",

Company further warrants that the Products sold hereunder shall be free from defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period of twenty-four (24) months after delivery to Distributor's end-user.",
                "changed_text": "Company suggests that the Products will be designed, manufactured, constructed, assembled and packaged in a presentable manner and that such Products shall be functional and somewhat fit for their alleged purposes. Company hopes that the Products sold hereunder shall be free from noticeable defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period of two (2) months after delivery to Distributor's end-user.",
                "explanation": "The term 'warrants' is replaced with 'hopes,' the period of warranty went from 'twenty-four months' to 'two months', 'workmanlike manner' is replaced with 'presentable manner' and 'fully functional' is replaced with 'functional'. This change will create a uncertainty because the terms 'warrants' and 'workmanlike manner' have legal protection, while 'presentamble manner' is too ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "The term 'becomes adjudicated insolvent' is replaced with 'thinks about insolvency', 'discontinues its business' is replaced with 'takes a vacation', 'bankruptcy proceedings instituted against it' is replaced with 'thinks about bankruptcy proceedings' and 'makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors' is replaced with 'considers an assignment for the benefit of creditors'. This change will create a uncertainty because the original terms have legal protection, while the new terms are too ambiguous.",

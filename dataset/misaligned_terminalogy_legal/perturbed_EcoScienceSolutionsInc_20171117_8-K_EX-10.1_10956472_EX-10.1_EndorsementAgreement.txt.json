                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a thirty-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\").",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a notice of termination at their discretion (\"Term\").",
                "explanation": "The original contract states that a thirty-day notice of written termination is required. The modified contract removes the thirty-day notice period, allowing either party to terminate at their discretion, which introduces ambiguity regarding the enforceability of the term. State contract law typically requires a definite term or a reasonable method for termination, contradicting this discretionary termination clause.",

                "changed_text": "ESSI engages Talent and Talent hereby accepts the engagement to act as a Public Figure for ESSI, and to provide his endorsement of all ESSI products and services, domestically and worldwide.",
                "explanation": "Changing the term \"Spokesperson\" to \"Public Figure\" introduces legal uncertainty. While a spokesperson has a defined role within the company with specific legal responsibilities, a \"public figure\" has broader implications, particularly regarding defamation and privacy laws. The contract does not clarify the extent of liability or the scope of representation, creating a potential conflict with defamation law.",

                "changed_text": "ESSI will provide Talent with what they deem to be an equitable number of shares, issued within ten business days of execution of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This contradicts securities regulations requiring specific and agreed-upon terms for stock compensation. By replacing the fixed number of shares with a vague 'equitable number,' the agreement fails to meet the standard for a legally binding stock grant, potentially violating securities laws requiring clear terms of compensation.",

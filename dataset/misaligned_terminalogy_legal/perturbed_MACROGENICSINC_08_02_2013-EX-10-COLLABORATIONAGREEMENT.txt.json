Applicable Laws and Regulations implies a binding legal requirement, whereas Applicable Suggestions and Guidelines implies a non-binding, discretionary adherence. This contradicts the legal requirement for compliance with laws and regulations, potentially leading to non-compliance with mandatory requirements.",

It being understood and agreed that with respect to the Development or Commercialization of MGAH22 and Products, such efforts shall be dissimilar to those efforts and resources commonly used by a Party for a similar biological or pharmaceutical product owned by it or to which it has rights, which product is at a similar stage in its development or product life and is of similar market potential taking into account efficacy, safety, approved labeling, the competitiveness of alternative products in the marketplace, the patent and other proprietary position of the product, and the likelihood of regulatory approval given the regulatory structure involved.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' is replaced with 'Token Efforts.' Commercially Reasonable Efforts implies a serious, good-faith commitment to achieving an objective, while Token Efforts suggests a superficial attempt without a genuine intent to succeed.

A Joint Steering Committee implies a defined structure for decision-making and oversight, while an Optional Discussion Group implies a non-binding, informal structure.

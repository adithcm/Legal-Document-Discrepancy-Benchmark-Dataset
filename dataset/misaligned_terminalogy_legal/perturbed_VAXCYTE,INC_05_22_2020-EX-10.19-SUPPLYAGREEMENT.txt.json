                "changed_text": "1.2 \"Applicable Law\" means some suggestions, guidelines, and other similar suggestions of any Government Agency that may apply to the design, manufacture, or supply of any Product or any related activities as mentioned in this Supply Agreement, including (i) any random federal, state, and local guidelines, rules, and procedures; (ii) the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; (iii) other suggestions or regulations from the FDA and Regulatory Agencies, specifically excluding cGMPs; and (iv) any other non-U.S. equivalent recommendations for any previously listed, which includes rules from the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requests for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (as amended from time to time).",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Applicable Law\" has been changed to exclude mandatory compliance elements and to frame legal requirements as suggestions. This misrepresents the binding nature of laws and regulations, undermining the enforceability of compliance-related clauses.",

                "original_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" means non-public information about the disclosing party's business or activities that is proprietary and confidential, which shall include, without limitation, all business, financial, technical and other information of a party marked or designated \"confidential\" or by its nature or the circumstances surrounding its disclosure should reasonably be regarded as confidential. Confidential Information includes not only written or other tangible information, but also information transferred orally, visually, electronically or by any other means.",
                "changed_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" means information the disclosing party explicitly labels as confidential. It only includes written documents marked as 'Confidential' with no exceptions. Verbal communication, visually, or electronically transferred data shall not be considered confidential regardless of its implicit nature.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition significantly narrows what constitutes 'Confidential Information,' conflicting with common law and statutory interpretations that include information confidential by its nature or circumstances. This change creates uncertainty, as standard business practices consider certain information confidential even without explicit labeling.",

                "original_text": "Any and all disputes, controversies and claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or concerning the respective rights or obligations of the parties hereto shall be settled and determined by arbitration in the defending parties home forum before one (1) arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association.",
                "changed_text": "Any disputes arising from this agreement must be addressed through binding arbitration. The location for arbitration will be chosen at the sole discretion of the dominant party based on market capitalization at the time of the dispute. The selection of arbitrators is at the sole discretion of the dominant party.",
                "explanation": "This change makes the arbitration clause unconscionable and likely unenforceable. Standard arbitration clauses require neutrality in the selection of the location and arbitrator. Giving the 'dominant party' complete control contradicts fundamental principles of fairness and impartiality in arbitration, potentially violating state and federal arbitration laws.",

                "original_text": "Neither party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the other party's written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, except that: (a) a party's rights and obligation hereunder may be transferred to a successor of all or substantially all of the business and assets of the party regardless of how the transaction or series of related transactions is structured, provided, that the successor party agrees to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (b) Sponsor may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any entity (i) which operates the Sponsor Website and (ii) which agrees to bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party, and such consent may be arbitrarily and unilaterally denied. Moreover, assignment can only occur if it is approved by a simple majority vote of a newly formed advisory board consisting of a non-voting member of each party to the agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides that consent for assignment will not be unreasonably withheld. The modified clause allows consent to be 'arbitrarily and unilaterally denied,' directly contradicting the original intent. This introduces uncertainty and potential unenforceability, as courts often interpret 'unreasonably withheld' consent based on established commercial standards.",

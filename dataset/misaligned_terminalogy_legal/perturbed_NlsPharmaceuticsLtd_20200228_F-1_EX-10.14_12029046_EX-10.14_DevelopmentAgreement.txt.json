                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Developed Intellectual Property shall mean any and all changes, additional Know-how, improvements and inventions relating to the Intellectual Property (such as, without limitation, method of use patents) made after the Effective Date of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Developed Intellectual Property shall mean any and all creations, extra knowledge, enhancements and discoveries connected to the Intellectual Property (like, but not limited to, ways to use patents) created after the moment this Agreement becomes active.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'changes', 'additional Know-how', 'improvements', and 'inventions' have clear legal definitions and are replaced with terms that lack specific legal meaning. For example, 'creations' is broader than 'inventions' under patent law. Also, 'Effective Date' is replaced with 'the moment this Agreement becomes active,' which is less precise.",

                "changed_text": "Know-how shall mean all information, data, secrets, and knowledge related to the Licensed Product, useful for research, development, production, or sale. This includes, but is not limited to, whatever NLS thinks it includes.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Know-how' is detailed and references specific types of information (laboratory data, trade secrets, etc.). The modified definition is vague and subjective ('whatever NLS thinks it includes'). This undermines the contract's enforceability because 'Know-how' is a key element of the license granted to Eurofarma.",

                "original_text": "Net Sales means the total of the gross invoice prices of Licensed Products sold or leased by the Licensee, an Affiliate, a Distributor, or any combination thereof, less the sum of the following actual and customary deductions where applicable and separately listed: cash, trade, or quantity discounts; sales, use, tariff, import/export duties or other excise taxes imposed on particular sales (in particular value-added tax); transportation charges; or credits to customers because of rejections or returns.",
                "changed_text": "Net Sales means the amount of money Eurofarma receives, minus whatever Eurofarma feels like deducting, so long as it seems reasonable.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides a specific and itemized list of permissible deductions from gross invoice prices to arrive at 'Net Sales.' The modified definition makes deductions entirely discretionary and subjective. This change allows Eurofarma to arbitrarily reduce Net Sales, impacting royalty payments to NLS. The term 'reasonable' is vague and subject to interpretation, creating ambiguity. The 'Net Sales' is important because of royalty regulations.",

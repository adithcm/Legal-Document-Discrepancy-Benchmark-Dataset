                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "e. \"Net Revenue\" shall mean gross receipts collected by Company or Reseller from the distribution of Company Products, [less third party commissions, equipment sales, delivery costs, taxes, refunds, and credits.",
                "changed_text": "e. \"Net Revenue\" shall mean gross receipts collected by Company or Reseller from the distribution of Company Products, [less direct costs at Company discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Net Revenue' lists specific deductions, providing a clear calculation method. The modified definition replaces these objective deductions with 'direct costs at Company discretion,' making the calculation subjective and potentially contradictory to standard accounting practices and legal interpretations of revenue sharing. This introduces uncertainty and could lead to disputes, as the Company can arbitrarily define 'direct costs'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and contract law principles requiring clear and unambiguous terms.",

                "changed_text": "Referral Fees will be paid within a reasonable timeframe of the collection of receivables from the Registered Referral.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 30-day payment term, creating a clear obligation. The modified text replaces this with 'a reasonable timeframe,' making the payment term vague and unenforceable. 'Reasonable timeframe' is subject to interpretation, potentially conflicting with contract law principles requiring definiteness of terms. This weakens the reseller's right to timely compensation.",

                "changed_text": "Company may indemnify Reseller and its officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents, successors and assigns from claims arising from Company Products, only if the Company determines there was no negligence on Reseller's Part.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear and broad indemnification obligation for the Company, covering claims related to product infringement, misappropriation, or injury. The modified text changes this to a discretionary indemnification, dependent on the Company's assessment of the Reseller's negligence. This significantly weakens the Reseller's protection and contradicts the intent of a standard indemnification clause. The word shall was changed to may, and the condition was added that there could be no determination of Reseller negligence.",

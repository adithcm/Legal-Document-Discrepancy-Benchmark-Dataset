The Company hereby appoints and grants Distributor the exclusive right to sell the products of the Company, including the Snotarator™ Nasal Aspirator,  (\"Products\") listed in the current \"Price List\" (Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto). The distribution right shall be limited to all countries and all of their territories and possessions within the continent known as South America (\"Territory\")  (Exhibit \"B\" attached hereto).  Distributor agrees that the Products, including the name Snotarator ™ Nasal Aspirator (the \"Brand\") are the sole property of the Company and Distributor has no interest whatsoever in such Brand and Products, and Distributor shall use the Brand and Products only for so long as the rights granted hereby remains in full force and effect.",

The Company hereby appoints and grants Distributor the exclusive right to sell the products of the Company, including the Snotarator™ Nasal Aspirator,  (\"Products\") listed in the current \"Price List\" (Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto). The distribution right shall be limited to a selection of countries and a few territories and possessions within the continent known as South America (\"Territory\")  (Exhibit \"B\" attached hereto).  Distributor agrees that the Products, including the name Snotarator ™ Nasal Aspirator (the \"Brand\") are the shared property of the Company and Distributor and Distributor has significant interest in such Brand and Products, and Distributor shall use the Brand and Products perpetually and without any restriction.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the distribution right as exclusive to all countries and territories in South America and clarifies that the brand and products are the sole property of the company. The modified text contradicts this by limiting the distribution to 'a selection of countries and a few territories' and stating that the brand and products are 'shared property' with the distributor. This creates ambiguity regarding the scope of the distribution rights and ownership, potentially leading to disputes over intellectual property and territorial boundaries.",

Company warrants that Distributor shall acquire Products purchased hereunder free and clear of all liens and encumbrances except for Company's purchase money security interest defined in Section 1.03, above. Company further warrants all Products to be free from defects in material or workmanship under normal use and service for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of delivery. Any defects must be replaced by the Company within sixty (60) days within this scope of the warranty and all charges for labor and material, will be borne by Company. If it is determined that either no fault exists in Company, or the damage was caused by negligence of Distributor, its agents, employees or customers, Distributor agrees to pay all charges associated with each such replacement. THIS CONSTITUTES THE SOLE WARRANTY MADE BY COMPANY EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. THERE ARE NO OTHER WARRANTIES EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED WHICH EXTEND BEYOND THE FACE HEREOF, HEREIN, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT SHALL COMPANY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AND DISTRIBUTOR'S REMEDIES SHALL BE LIMITED TO REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF NONCONFORMING UNITS OR PARTS.",

Company warrants that Distributor shall acquire Products purchased hereunder free and clear of all liens and encumbrances except for Company's purchase money security interest defined in Section 1.03, above. Company further provides a 'guarantee' of all Products to be substantially free from some defects in material or workmanship under unique use and service for an undetermined period from an unspecified date of something elses delivery. Defects might be replaced, potentially or not, by any of our partners within a time deemed appropriate, and all charges, which might or might not encompass labor and material, possibly will be borne by someone. If it is assumed that some fault could exist vaguely in Company, Distributor might agree to pay some unspecified charges. THERE MIGHT BE OTHER WARRANTIES SUGGESTED. IN SOME EVENT SHALL COMPANY MAYBE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AND DISTRIBUTOR'S REMEDIES MIGHT BE LIMITED TO REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF NONCONFORMING UNITS OR PARTS.",
                "explanation": "The original warranty provides a clear timeframe (90 days) and outlines specific responsibilities of the company for defects. The modified version introduces vague and discretionary language ('guarantee', 'some defects', 'unique use', 'undetermined period', 'might be', 'possibly will be', 'someone') that undermines the warranty's enforceability. By replacing specific terms with ambiguous ones, the modified warranty contradicts the implied warranties and creates uncertainty about the company's obligations under Texas law.",

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to make the Distributor the agent for the Company for any purpose, and neither party hereto shall have any right whatsoever to incur any liabilities or obligations on behalf or binding upon the other party. The Distributor specifically agrees that it shall have no power or authority to represent the Company in any manner; that it will solicit orders for Products as an independent contractor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and that it will not at any time represent the Company in any manner; that it will solicit orders for Products as an independent contractor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and that it will not at any time represent orally or in writing to any person or corporation or other business entity that it has any right, power or authority not expressly granted by this Agreement.",

This Agreement shall be construed to make the Distributor an agent for the Company for certain purposes, and each party hereto shall have the right to incur some liabilities or obligations on behalf of or binding upon the other party, in limited instances. The Distributor agrees that it shall have the power and authority to represent the Company in some situations; that it will solicit orders for Products not as an independent contractor but as a partial agent of the Company in accordance with some of the terms of this Agreement; and that it may sometimes represent orally or in writing to any person or corporation or other business entity that it has some right, power or authority even if not expressly granted by this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the Distributor as an independent entity with no agency relationship to the Company. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that the Distributor is an 'agent for certain purposes' and has the right to incur 'some liabilities' on behalf of the Company. This contradicts the principle of independent contractor status and potentially exposes the Company to vicarious liability for the Distributor's actions. The phrase 'some of the terms' further exacerbates uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "The relationship of the Parties is that of independent contractors. Nothing herein is intended or will be construed to establish any agency, partnerships or joint ventures. Neither Party is authorized or empowered to act as an agent for the other Party for any purpose, nor shall either Party be bound by the acts or conduct of the other Party.",
                "changed_text": "The relationship of the Parties is that of independent contractors. However, this shall be construed to establish an agency relationship only for activities that contribute to profits. Neither Party is authorized or empowered to act as an agent for the other Party for any other purpose, nor shall either Party be bound by the acts or conduct of the other Party, unless those acts lead to financial gains.",
                "explanation": "By stating that an agency relationship exists for activities that contribute to profits, it directly contradicts the 'independent contractor' definition, which implies no such agency relationship exists. This creates uncertainty as to whether standard partnership laws apply, potentially exposing one party to liabilities of the other.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States Agency Law, specifically concerning the distinction between independent contractors and agents.",
                "location": "Article 11"

                "changed_text": "The Parties agree that the researchers involved in the RESEARCH PROJECTS are encouraged to present methods and/or results of the RESEARCH PROJECTS at symposia and professional meetings and to publish the same in journals or the like; provided however, the disclosing Party may furnish copies of any proposed publication, presentation or disclosure (collectively \"Disclosure\") to the other Party at least thirty (30) days in advance of the specific submission, presentation or other disclosure.",
                "explanation": "This change alters the obligation to provide copies of proposed publications from a 'must' to a 'may', effectively negating the original intent. Now, there is no legal recourse if one party fails to provide advanced copies of disclosure, disrupting the process of intellectual property protection.",

                "original_text": "All disputes, differences or questions arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or its SCHEDULES, or related to the alleged breach, termination, validity, interpretation or violation thereof, shall be submitted to the MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE for resolution, which shall convene, whether in person or otherwise, to resolve such dispute in a timely manner. Either Party may initiate a resolution procedure by providing written notice (\"Dispute Notice\") to the other Party, and any such Dispute Notice must set forth the subject matter of the dispute, difference or question. If after sixty (60) days the dispute remains unresolved, the Chief Scientific Officer of CERES and the Director of IGER shall seek to resolve the dispute through negotiation. The Parties agree that at least eight (8) cumulative hours of negotiations will be undertaken. If the dispute still remains unresolved ninety (90) days after the Dispute Notice, either Party may initiate proceedings pursuant to Article 15.2.",

Either Party may, at their leisure, initiate a resolution procedure by providing notice. If the dispute remains unresolved, the Chief Scientific Officer of CERES and the Director of IGER may seek to resolve the dispute through negotiation. If the dispute still remains unresolved, either Party may initiate proceedings pursuant to Article 15.2.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall' with 'may' regarding submitting disputes to the management committee, reduces the process to being optional. Replacing 'shall convene' with 'may convene' implies the MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE has discretion as to whether they convene to solve disputes. Removing obligation to include subject matter on Dispute Notice and removing the minimum negotiation duration, all in all renders the dispute resolution process arbitrary and unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"non-exclusive license\" to \"exclusive license\" creates a conflict. The contract later refers to Licensor's agreements with other parties. If Licensor enters or has entered into agreements with third parties, this implies a non-exclusive arrangement. In Canada, exclusivity in distribution rights has specific legal implications under competition law and contract law, which are now contradicted.",

For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Retail Revenues\" means the retail revenues actually received by Rogers for each authorized exhibition of a Licensed Program on the ROD Service, less GST and applicable sales tax.

For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Retail Revenues\" means the retail revenues deemed appropriate by Rogers for each exhibition of a Licensed Program on the ROD Service, without deductions.

                "explanation": "Altering the definition of 'Retail Revenues' to mean 'revenues deemed appropriate by Rogers' and removing deductions gives Rogers the ability to arbitrarily determine the revenue amount. The addition of terminal and access fees to the revenue definition also conflicts with standard accounting practices and creates uncertainty in calculating royalties, which affects enforceability under Canadian contract law.",

                "explanation": "Canada's laws regarding contract notices and electronic signatures require specific compliance measures (e.g., the Electronic Commerce Act) to ensure validity and enforceability. This change creates a conflict. It removes the requirement for hard copies of faxed notices and allows Rogers to change its contact information without proper notice. The change introduces ambiguity, especially if there is no guarantee of receipt.",

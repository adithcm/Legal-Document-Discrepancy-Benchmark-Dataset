In the event that       any product is marketed in a carton, container, packing or wrapping       material bearing KI's name, such notice shall also appear upon the said       carton, container, packing or wrapping material. Each and every tag,       label, imprint, or other device containing any such notice and all       advertising, promotional or display material bearing KI's name shall be       submitted by Diplomat to KI, Inc. for its written approval prior to use by       Diplomat. Approval by KI, Inc. shall not constitute waiver of KI, Inc.'s       rights or Diplomat's duties under any provision of this Agreement.",

In the event that any product is marketed in a carton, container, packing or wrapping material bearing KI's name, such notice may appear upon the said carton, container, packing or wrapping material, if Diplomat chooses. Submission by Diplomat to KI, Inc. for its written approval prior to use by Diplomat is optional. Approval by KI, Inc. shall constitute a waiver of KI, Inc.'s rights or Diplomat's duties under any provision of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates specific copyright and trademark notices, aligning with federal intellectual property law. The modified text makes these notices discretionary, directly contradicting U.S. copyright and trademark laws that require specific forms of notice to protect intellectual property rights. This creates a legal contradiction.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. ยง 401) and Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 1111)",

                "original_text": "Diplomat agrees that the products covered by this Agreement shall be of such style, appearance and quality as to be adequate and suited to their exploitation to the best advantage, protection and enhancement of KI's name and the good will pertaining to such name. Diplomat further agrees that (a) such products will be manufactured, sold and distributed in accordance with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, (b) that the policy of sale, distribution, and/or exploitation by Diplomat shall be to the best advantage of KI, Inc. and KI, and (c) that the latter policy shall in no manner reflect adversely upon the good name of KI and KI, Inc.",
                "changed_text": "Diplomat agrees that the products covered by this Agreement shall be of a style, appearance, and quality that Diplomat deems fit for their commercial purpose. Diplomat agrees that (a) it will endeavor to manufacture, sell and distribute the products in general accordance with applicable laws, (b) that the policy of sale, distribution, and/or exploitation by Diplomat should generally not disadvantage KI, Inc. and KI, and (c) that the latter policy should ideally not reflect adversely upon the good name of KI and KI, Inc.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a high standard for product quality and legal compliance. The modified text introduces ambiguity and lowers the bar, replacing 'shall be' with weaker language like 'deems fit,' 'endeavor,' 'generally not,' and 'ideally not.' This weakens the contractual obligations and contradicts the implicit requirement for strict compliance with applicable laws and the protection of KI's brand reputation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; potential violation of consumer protection laws if quality standards are significantly lowered.",

                "original_text": "KI, Inc. hereby indemnifies Diplomat and undertakes to hold it harmless against only those claims or suits (i) arising solely out of the authorized use of KI's name by Diplomat in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) brought by those persons or entities to whom KI, Inc. has licensed the use of KI's name and likeness. Prompt notice shall be given by Diplomat to KI, Inc. of any such claim or suit. In addition, KI, Inc. shall have the option to undertake and conduct the defense of any suit so brought and no settlement of any such claim or suit shall be made without the prior written consent of KI, Inc.",
                "changed_text": "KI, Inc. may, at its convenience, choose to indemnify Diplomat from claims or suits (i) vaguely related to the use of KI's name by Diplomat and (ii) initiated by individuals KI, Inc. has previously allowed to use KI's name. Notification to KI, Inc. of claims is optional. KI, Inc. has the option, but not the obligation, to conduct the defense of any such suit, and Diplomat may settle any claim without KI, Inc.'s consent.",
                "explanation": "The original indemnification clause offers Diplomat specific protection. The modified version makes the indemnification discretionary ('may choose to indemnify'), broadens the claim scope ('vaguely related'), removes the prompt notice requirement, and allows Diplomat to settle claims independently. This significantly weakens Diplomat's protection and contradicts the expected function of an indemnification clause, which is to provide clear and reliable protection against specific liabilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding indemnification; potential issues related to insurance coverage if the indemnification clause is deemed unenforceable due to its vague and discretionary nature.",

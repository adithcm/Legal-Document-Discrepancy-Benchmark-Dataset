                "original_text": "1.32 \"Fully Burdened Costs\" with respect to a Lead Compound shall mean all costs to produce, package and distribute the product to Astellas or its carrier at the Ex Works location (in compliance with Section 12.6) and any royalties or other consideration (not reimbursed by Astellas) paid to third parties related to the acquisition or sale of product, with costs to produce and package the product to include the direct material, labor and indirect costs that are incurred by FG or its Affiliate(s) associated with the manufacture, filling, packaging, labeling, preparation of product for shipment and/or other preparation of such Lead Compound, as applicable, including, but not limited to taxes, fees, and customs incurred, as applicable. Costs will be determined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) and will include but not be limited to the costs of facilities, labor, purchasing, depreciation of equipment, materials, payments to third parties for any necessary contract work related to the manufacture or testing of the product, the validation studies, quality assurance, quality control and other testing, storage, shipping (if requested by Astellas), costs related to distribution and a reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. Costs related to distribution include the labor, materials and overhead necessary to prepare and package the final product for shipment to the Ex Works location.",
                "changed_text": "1.32 \"Fully Burdened Costs\" with respect to a Lead Compound shall mean only the direct costs associated with the materials used to produce, package and distribute the product to Astellas or its carrier at the Ex Works location (in compliance with Section 12.6) and exclude any royalties or other consideration paid to third parties related to the acquisition or sale of product. These costs will be determined at the sole discretion of FibroGen's accounting department.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Fully Burdened Costs\" was significantly narrowed to include only direct material costs and removed the application of U.S. GAAP. Furthermore, it gives sole discretion for determining costs to FibroGen, contradicting standard accounting practices and creating ambiguity in what constitutes a legitimate cost. This creates a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Insurance requirements are made vague and discretionary. It no longer requires the insurance to be underwritten by a \"reputable insurance company\". Moreover, it removes the requirement for specific types of coverage and eliminates the obligation to provide proof of insurance. This contradicts standard practices and prudent risk management principles in business, creating legal uncertainty regarding liability protection and violating general principles of insurable interest.",

                "original_text": "1.9 \"ELEPHANT TALK Customer\" shall mean any company or legal entity partnering with ELEPHANT TALK, which wishes to offer mobile services in a MVNO/ESP/SP model using the T-Mobile Network and the by T-Mobile provided Hosting Services under the terms and conditions as mentioned in this Agreement. ELEPHANT TALK Customers might include the mobile end-users of ELEPHANT TALK Customers, subject to the interpretation of the specific provision.",
                "changed_text": "1.9 \"ELEPHANT TALK Customer\" shall mean any individual consumer who purchases mobile services directly from ELEPHANT TALK. ELEPHANT TALK Customers shall under no circumstances include business entities or other organizations.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"ELEPHANT TALK Customer\" includes any company or legal entity, aligning with the common understanding of a business-to-business (B2B) relationship in a hosting agreement. The modified definition restricts this to individual consumers, contradicting the B2B nature of the agreement. This shift could cause legal issues regarding the intended scope and beneficiaries of the services provided, particularly regarding liability and service obligations, potentially violating telecommunications regulations related to B2B service agreements.",

                "explanation": "The original definition clearly defines 'Hosting Services' as a core offering with defined terms. The modified definition makes the provision of services optional and subject to T-Mobile's discretion, directly contradicting the original intent and potentially undermining the entire agreement. This shift might render the agreement unenforceable due to lack of a defined obligation.",

                "explanation": "The original clause outlines specific limitations on liability with defined maximum amounts, typical in commercial agreements. The modified clause completely eliminates any liability for either party, contradicting the principle of responsibility for damages caused by one's actions or those of their agents. This is unlikely to be enforceable and goes against standard practices of Dutch contract law.",

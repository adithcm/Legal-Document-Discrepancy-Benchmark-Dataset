                "changed_text": "A \"Portal\" is defined as a link to Tickets.com website. The appearance and functionality of such a link are left to the discretion of MP3.com.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Portal' provides a specific technical definition related to size and format. The modified definition removes all objective criteria and makes it a generic link with unspecified characteristics. This vagueness introduces ambiguity because the original agreement guarantees a specific visual element (the Portal). The new definition does not require a graphic, making the agreement's obligation unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "An \"Impression\" is defined as any user interaction with MP3.com's website.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clearly links 'Impression' to the display of the Tickets Portal. The modified definition broadens the term to include 'any user interaction,' which could encompass numerous activities unrelated to the Tickets Portal. This discrepancy undermines the basis for Sponsor Fees, as Tickets is now paying for potentially irrelevant user activity. This contradiction makes measuring the 'Impressions' tied to the Tickets.com portal impossible",

                "changed_text": "Any late payments under this Agreement will be assessed a discretionary penalty.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a fixed late payment fee of 1.5% per month, capped by legal limits. The revised text changes this to a 'discretionary penalty,' removing the certainty of the late fee amount. This contradicts the enforceability of a specific late payment penalty under standard contract law since 'discretionary penalty' allows for arbitrary and potentially unreasonable fees not agreed upon in advance.",

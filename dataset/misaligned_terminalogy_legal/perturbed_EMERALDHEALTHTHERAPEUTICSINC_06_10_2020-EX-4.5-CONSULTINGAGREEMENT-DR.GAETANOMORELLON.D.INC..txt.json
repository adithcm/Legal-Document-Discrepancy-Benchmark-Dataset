                "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractor' to 'worker' creates ambiguity. While the contract intends to establish an independent contractor relationship, using the term 'worker,' which can be interpreted under employment law as an employee, contradicts this intention and introduces uncertainty. This contradiction can affect tax obligations, liability, and other legal aspects of the relationship.",

Emerald shall not be obliged to deduct or retain from the Fees due to the Contractor, nor shall it be obliged to remit same to the required governmental authority, any amounts that may be required by law or regulation to be deducted, retained and remitted including, without limitation, Federal and Provincial or State Income Tax, Workers' Compensation and Pension Plan deductions and remittances. All such remittances and other payments are entirely the responsibility of the Contractor and the Contractor hereby indemnifies and saves Emerald and its Board members and officers harmless from any liability of any kind whatsoever that they may incur as a result of the Contractor's failure to make such remittances or payments.",
                "changed_text": "3.3 Deductions and Remittances. Emerald may choose whether or not to deduct or retain from the Fees due to the Contractor, any amounts that may be required by law or regulation to be deducted, retained and remitted including, without limitation, Federal and Provincial or State Income Tax, Workers' Compensation and Pension Plan deductions and remittances. All such remittances and other payments are the responsibility of the Contractor unless otherwise agreed upon and Emerald is not liable for contractor's remittances of payments.",
                "explanation": "This alteration makes the deduction and remittance of taxes and other statutory payments discretionary, contradicting Canadian tax laws and regulations. The original clause clearly states that Emerald is not obliged to deduct, retain, or remit these amounts. The modified clause gives Emerald the option, creating confusion about who is responsible for remitting these deductions. This conflicts with the statutory obligations under the Income Tax Act and Employment Insurance Act, where employers may be required to deduct and remit certain amounts, even for independent contractors in some cases.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Cause' for termination has been broadened to include 'simple negligence' instead of 'gross negligence or gross incompetence', 'any breach' instead of 'material breach', a shorter disability period (30 days instead of 180 days), and 'suspected of a criminal offence' instead of 'convicted'. This creates a contradiction as it allows the company to terminate the contract more easily and for less serious reasons than initially defined. This conflicts with common law principles that require a significant breach to justify contract termination, increasing the risk of wrongful termination claims. It also reduces the standard of proof required for termination.",

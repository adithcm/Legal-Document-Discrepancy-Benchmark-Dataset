                "original_text": "\"Cash Surrender Value of the Policies\" will mean the Cash Value of the Policies; plus any dividends and/or earnings added hereto; and less any Policy Loan Balance.",
                "changed_text": "\"Cash Surrender Value of the Policies\" will mean an amount arbitrarily determined by the Employer, but not less than the Cash Value of the Policies; plus any dividends and/or earnings added hereto; and less any Policy Loan Balance.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a conflict because it allows the Employer to arbitrarily determine the cash surrender value, potentially contradicting standard insurance accounting practices and creating uncertainty in the actual value accessible to the employee. While setting a minimum limit, the maximum is left unconstrained.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring good faith and fair dealing; potential violation of ERISA if the plan is not administered according to its written terms.",

                "changed_text": "Upon the death of the Employee while this Agreement is in force, the Employee's beneficiary as named in the Beneficiary Designation Form on page 6 (or as it may be amended according to the terms set forth on page 6) for this Agreement will be entitled to receive from the Policy proceeds an amount as determined by the Employer at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear formula for calculating the death benefit. This revision replaces that formula with a discretionary determination by the Employer, which contradicts the principle of a definite benefit amount and creates uncertainty. It directly conflicts with the concept of a defined benefit outlined in the original agreement.",

                "original_text": "For purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Employer will be the \"Named Fiduciary\" and Plan Administrator of the split-dollar life insurance plan for which this Agreement is hereby designated the written plan instrument. The Employer's board of directors may authorize a person or group of persons to fulfill the responsibilities of the Employer as Plan Administrator. The Named Fiduciary or the Plan Administrator may employ others to render advice with regard to its responsibilities under this Plan. The Named Fiduciary may also allocate fiduciary responsibilities to others and may exercise any other powers necessary for the discharge of its duties to the extent not in conflict with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.",

The Employer's board of directors may or may not authorize a person or group of persons to fulfill the responsibilities of the Employer as Plan Administrator. The Named Fiduciary or the Plan Administrator may seek advice at its discretion. The Named Fiduciary may allocate fiduciary responsibilities as it sees fit, and may exercise any other powers necessary for its convenience.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several contradictions to established ERISA principles. First, it makes the Employer's role as Named Fiduciary optional, which contradicts the requirement for a named fiduciary. Second, it makes the delegation of responsibilities discretionary and the pursuit of advice discretionary. Finally, it replaces the standard of acting in accordance with ERISA with acting according to its own convenience. This creates significant uncertainty and conflicts with the core duties of a fiduciary under ERISA.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"beneficial owners\" with \"ostensible owners\" creates a legal contradiction. Beneficial ownership has a specific meaning under SEC rules (Rule 13d-3), while \"ostensible ownership\" is a vague term not defined in securities law. This could lead to uncertainty about the Marathon Parties' actual rights and responsibilities concerning the shares.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Support Period\" to \"Guidance Period\" alters the understood legal commitment.

                "explanation": "Modifying the interpretation and construction clause undermines the contract's enforceability and clarity. Asserting that parties may not have had legal counsel, drafts may not be collaborative, and standard interpretation rules may apply introduces significant ambiguity, potentially contradicting established contract law principles and making the contract susceptible to varied interpretations.",

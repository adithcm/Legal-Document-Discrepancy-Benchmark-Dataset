                "changed_text": "(iii) \"Intellectual Property Right\" shall mean authorship right and patent right only.",
                "explanation": "This modification narrows the definition of \"Intellectual Property Right\" by excluding proprietary trademark right, business secret ownership right and other intellectual property rights. This is a legal contradiction because under PRC law, intellectual property rights encompass a broader range of protections. This could cause disputes about the scope of intellectual property protection afforded under the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "PRC Law regarding Intellectual Property Rights (Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China, Trademark Law of the People's Republic of China, Patent Law of the People's Republic of China)",

                "changed_text": "(viii) \"PRC Law\" shall mean only the fundamental laws passed by the National People's Congress, excluding any administrative regulations or local rules.",
                "explanation": "By limiting \"PRC Law\" to only fundamental laws and excluding administrative regulations and local rules, this modification directly contradicts the comprehensive definition of law under the Chinese legal system. This introduces uncertainty about which laws govern the agreement and could render key provisions unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "11.1 The execution of this Agreement shall be governed by common business practices, and dispute resolution shall be subject to the sole discretion of Party A.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the governing law provision (PRC Law) and replaces it with vague 'common business practices' and grants Party A unilateral control over dispute resolution. This contradicts Article 11.1 and 11.2 where it was previously stated the execution, validity, interpretation, enforcement and dispute resolution of this Agreement shall be governed by the PRC Law. By giving Party A discretion in dispute resolution, this undermines the legal framework established within the initial contract.",

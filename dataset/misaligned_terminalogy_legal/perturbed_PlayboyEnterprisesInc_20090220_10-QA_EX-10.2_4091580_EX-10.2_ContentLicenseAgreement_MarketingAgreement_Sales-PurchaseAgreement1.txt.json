                "original_text": "Unless otherwise agreed by the parties and provided that this Agreement is executed not later than  January 15, 2008, EFS agrees that no later than March 1, 2008, both Websites shall launch and be fully operational, with the  exception of the gift wrapping which EFS shall make available as set forth in the time and action calendar (attached hereto as  Exhibit 12 and hereby incorporated by reference) and local billing (pursuant to Section 3.1, below), and EFS shall be ready to  perform all aspects of administration of the Website business, including, but not limited to, all Fulfillment Services.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise agreed by the parties and provided that this Agreement is executed not later than  January 15, 2008, EFS agrees that no later than March 1, 2008, both Websites shall launch and be mostly operational, with only some of the gift wrapping features available as EFS sees fit, and local billing will be implemented at EFS' discretion, and EFS shall endeavor to perform the main aspects of administration of the Website business, including, but not limited to, some of the Fulfillment Services.",
                "explanation": "The original text specified a clear deadline and scope for website launch and operational readiness. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using vague terms like 'mostly operational,' 'some of the gift wrapping features', 'at EFS's discretion', and 'endeavor to perform'. This undermines the enforceability of the clause, as the exact obligations of EFS become unclear.",

EFS agrees that it will use the merchandising presence on the EFS Portals to also market the Websites in  order to drive additional customer acquisition.",
                "changed_text": "EFS may sell Merchandise on EFS shopping portals (“EFS Portals”) under some of the standards applicable to the Websites but only if those integrations with third-party vendors are somewhat acceptable, giving Client general discretion. If EFS uses the promotional materials of these EFS portals, then they might think about vaguely promoting these websites for further growth.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces uncertainty and undermines the original intent, it replaces \"all respects\" with \"some of the standards\" and turns \"approval not to be unreasonably withheld\" into \"giving Client general discretion\" which deviates from contract principles. By changing \"EFS agrees that it will use\" with \"they might think about vaguely promoting these websites for further growth\", the obligation of EFS to market the websites becomes unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "EFS will commit to an annual Catalog budget equal to or greater than *****, which represents  ***** of the actual amount spent by Client on the Catalogs for 2007. In addition, EFS shall use commercially reasonable efforts  to achieve a target in 2008 of not less than ***** of 2007 Catalog circulated pages. It is EFS' intent to maximize both Website  and Catalog sales, and the parties agree that they will collaborate during the Term to define the budget and sales matrix to  maximize sales in both channels to bring the greatest overall sales growth. EFS shall have the right to decrease the Catalog budget  below the ***** minimum only if EFS can demonstrate that online marketing activities yield a higher return-on-investment and  provided all such reduced dollars are then reinvested in online marketing spend over and above the minimum online marketing  commitment described in Section 4.2, below.",
                "changed_text": "EFS will try to adhere to an annual Catalog budget roughly equivalent to the prior amounts that Client had, which is not really a guarantee. In addition, EFS will make a good-faith attempt to reach certain possible targets of prior pages circulated but doesn't promise success. To ensure, the EFS will focus on optimizing and selling, and the parties may collaborate to discuss sales and marketing, but no one should be held responsible for sales volume. EFS may decrease the Catalog budget below anything previously stated if they can show that different marketing has a different ROI and might then invest money in that new marketing approach.",
                "explanation": "The original language established a minimum budget commitment. The modified text transforms this into a vague intention with phrases like 'try to adhere', 'roughly equivalent to', and 'make a good-faith attempt'. The explicit obligation to reinvest reduced catalog dollars into online marketing is weakened by stating that EFS 'might then invest money', making the financial commitment unenforceable.",

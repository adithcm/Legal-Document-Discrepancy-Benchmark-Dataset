                "original_text": "(iii) immediately prior to offering the Securities to persons in the United States, we had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe that each such person was an Accredited Investor, based upon a pre-existing relationship, and, on the date hereof, we continue to believe that each such offeree purchasing Securities from the Corporation is an Accredited Investor;",
                "changed_text": "(iii) immediately prior to offering the Securities to persons in the United States, we had reasonable grounds to assume and did assume that each such person was an Accredited Investor, regardless of a pre-existing relationship, and, on the date hereof, we believe that each such offeree may potentially qualify as an investor;",
                "explanation": "The term \"Accredited Investor\" has a specific legal definition under Regulation D of the U.S. Securities Act. Changing 'believe' to 'assume', removing the pre-existing relationship requirement, and weakening the certainty of accreditation to 'may potentially qualify' contradicts the due diligence required to verify investor status. This creates uncertainty and potential non-compliance with securities laws, since there is no certainity of accredited investor qualification.",

                "explanation": "Replacing the explicit prohibition of 'Directed Selling Efforts, General Solicitation or General Advertising' with the allowance of 'informal communications' and suggesting a 'manner resembling a public offering' directly contradicts the restrictions on private placements under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. This creates ambiguity about whether the offering complied with private placement rules, which strictly limit how securities can be marketed.",

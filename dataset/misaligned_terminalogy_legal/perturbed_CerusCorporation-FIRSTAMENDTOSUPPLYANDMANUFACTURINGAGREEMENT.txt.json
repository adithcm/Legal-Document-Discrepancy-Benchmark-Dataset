                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due [*] days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work, payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due at Cerus's earliest convenience following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment terms from a fixed timeframe to 'Cerus's earliest convenience' introduces ambiguity. Standard contract law requires specific payment terms, and this vague phrasing could render the payment clause unenforceable due to uncertainty, as 'earliest convenience' is subjective and undefined, contradicting the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "If Porex begins to perform services under a work order that has not been formally agreed in writing, then Porex shall bear the costs of any expenses incurred prior to formal written agreement of the Statement of Work.",
                "changed_text": "If Porex begins to perform services under a work order before formal written agreement of the Statement of Work, Porex and Cerus shall share equally the costs of any expenses incurred.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Porex bears all costs for work done before a formal agreement. The modification introduces a cost-sharing arrangement, creating uncertainty. This change could be viewed as a waiver of rights, but without clear legal language regarding waiver, it creates ambiguity in responsibility for costs incurred, deviating from standard practices of written contracts which assign responsibility. This potentially weakens the enforceability of the cost allocation terms of the contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - Offer and Acceptance; Detrimental Reliance",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each work order shall set forth the terms and conditions (including specifications (if applicable), delivery and performance schedules, and fees) pursuant to which Porex will perform the Services.",
                "changed_text": "Each work order should generally describe the terms and conditions (including specifications if convenient), estimated delivery and suggested performance schedules, and approximate fees for Porex to perform the Services.",
                "explanation": "By replacing mandatory language ('shall') with permissive language ('should generally describe', 'if convenient', 'estimated', 'suggested', 'approximate'), the contract becomes significantly weaker. Core terms like specifications, schedules, and fees, which are usually considered essential for a binding agreement, are now optional and vague. This creates uncertainty about the actual obligations of Porex and the basis upon which Cerus is contracting, making the entire agreement potentially unenforceable for lack of definiteness in material terms.",

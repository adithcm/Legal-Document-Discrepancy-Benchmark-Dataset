                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") of [***] (\"Units\") for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall aim to purchase a Suggested Annual Order Volume (“SAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Minimum Annual Order Volume' (MAOV) implies a contractual obligation with specific remedies for failure to meet the quota. Replacing it with 'Suggested Annual Order Volume' (SAOV) weakens this obligation, making it unclear if Premier is legally bound to purchase the specified amount. This introduces ambiguity regarding the enforceability of the volume commitment, potentially contradicting contract law principles that require clear and definite terms.",

                "changed_text": "The Desired Annual Order Volume [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier at their convenience.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'MAOV' to 'Desired Annual Order Volume' further weakens the legally binding nature of the order volume. Furthermore, stating approval of the facility can be done at Premier's 'convenience' contradicts standard contract practices that require approvals to be done within a reasonable timeframe. This introduces subjectivity and potentially allows Premier to delay or avoid approval, undermining the intended obligation.",

                "changed_text": "For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier is expected to consider purchasing [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Consideration Period\").",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will be required to purchase' to 'is expected to consider purchasing' drastically reduces the obligation, making it optional rather than mandatory. Changing 'Contract Period' to 'Consideration Period' further suggests that the purchase is discretionary and not a legally binding commitment. This creates a legal contradiction by undermining the fundamental principle of a contract requiring mutual obligations.",

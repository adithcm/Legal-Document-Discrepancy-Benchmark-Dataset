                "original_text": "The phrase \"Purchase Schedule\" will mean a written supplement to this Agreement signed by an officer of each Party which references this Agreement and which identities, among other terms and conditions, the specific types and quantities of products that will be purchased and sold by the Parties on terms and conditions in the schedule, the specifications for the identified products, the duration of the commitment period during which the Parties will be obligated to purchase and sell the identified products on the terms and conditions in the schedule, the prices of the identified products, any mechanisms for adjusting the prices of the identified products over the commitment period, and the facilities at which the identified products will be manufactured, stored and delivered by Seller.",
                "changed_text": "The phrase \"Purchase Schedule\" may mean a written supplement to this Agreement signed by an employee of each Party which references this Agreement and which identifies, among other terms and conditions, the general categories of products that may be purchased and sold by the Parties on terms and conditions as discussed, the non-binding specifications for the broadly identified products, the possible duration of a prospective commitment period during which the Parties might consider purchasing and selling unidentified products on vaguely defined terms and conditions, the potential prices of the unidentified products, suggested mechanisms for considering adjustments to the prices of the unidentified products over an unspecified commitment period, and some potential facilities at which products could possibly be manufactured, stored and delivered by Seller.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Purchase Schedule' creates a clear, binding obligation with specific requirements such as officer signatures and specific quantities. The modified definition uses permissive language ('may'), lowers the required signatory authority to any 'employee,' and makes essential terms vague and non-binding. This contradicts the purpose of a 'schedule' as a legally enforceable commitment, creating uncertainty about whether the Parties are actually obligated to purchase or sell anything.",

                "changed_text": "A Party might consider notifying the other Party of any possible change in circumstance during the Term in which the Party might not fully be in compliance with the aforementioned general aspirations, hopeful assurances, and non-binding guidelines.",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes a clear and mandatory obligation to promptly notify the other party of any non-compliance with representations, warranties, and covenants. The modified clause transforms this into a discretionary action ('might consider'), weakens the commitment to 'full' compliance, and degrades the nature of the original promises to 'aspirations' and 'guidelines'. This directly contradicts the intent of the original clause, which was to ensure transparency and accountability.",

                "original_text": "The phrase \"Confidential Information\" means information meeting all of the following criteria: 1) The information is a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information owned by a Party or its direct and indirect subsidiaries under Applicable Law (this Party is referred to at times in this Section as the \"Disclosing Party\"); and 2) The other Party (referred to at times in this Section as the \"Receiving Party\") requests such information from the Disclosing Party for the Authorized Purpose during the Term (i.e., neither Party wants unsolicited Confidential Information from the other Party); and 3) The Disclosing Party discloses such requested information to the Receiving Party during the Term either labelled as \"Confidential\" or words of similar intent, or describes the disclosed information in reasonable detail in a written notice to the Receiving Party delivered, either at the time of disclosure or within five (5) days of disclosure. If a Disclosing Party neglects to label or deliver timely written notice to the Receiving Party identifying the disclosed information as confidential in nature, the disclosed information will only be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement if the Disclosing Party is able to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the Receiving Party knew that the disclosed information was a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information of the Disclosing Party at the time of disclosure.",
                "changed_text": "The phrase \"Information Potentially Considered Confidential at a Later Date\" could mean information that may or may not meet some of the following possible criteria: 1) The information could be loosely considered, maybe, a trade secret or some other kind of information that is not currently widely distributed, arguably proprietary, and potentially owned by a Party, or perhaps an associate of that Party, subject to future interpretation of what constitutes 'Applicable Law' (this Party is vaguely referred to in this Section as the \"Possible Disclosing Party\"); and 2) Another Party (henceforth nebulously known as the \"Eventual Receiving Party\") sort of intimates that it might possibly want some information, maybe, from the Possible Disclosing Party for a purpose that could, in hindsight, be construed as Authorized at some distant point during the indeterminate duration of the agreement; and 3) The Possible Disclosing Party, in its sole and unfettered discretion, releases information to the Eventual Receiving Party, perhaps labelling it something vague like \"For Internal Use\" or failing to provide any indication whatsoever of its alleged confidentiality and failing to provide any written notification. If the Possible Disclosing Party completely neglects to suggest, either verbally or in writing, that the disclosed information might be confidential, the disclosed information will under no circumstances be treated as Information Potentially Considered Confidential at a Later Date, even if the Possible Disclosing Party has undeniable proof the Eventual Receiving Party knew precisely what they were receiving.",
                "explanation": "This change directly undermines the definition of 'Confidential Information.' The original clause creates a specific set of requirements for information to be considered confidential. The modification introduces uncertainty by using terms like 'could', 'loosely considered', 'maybe', and 'arguably'. The requirement for labeling or written notice is eliminated, creating ambiguity and directly contradicting the legal requirements for trade secret protection. This creates a clear legal contradiction, making it difficult to enforce confidentiality obligations.",

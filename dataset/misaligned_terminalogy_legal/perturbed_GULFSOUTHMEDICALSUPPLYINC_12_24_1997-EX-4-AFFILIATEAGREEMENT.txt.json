                "original_text": "The undersigned understands and agrees that as to ---------------- GSMS he is an \"affiliate\" under Rule 145(c) as defined in Rule 405 of the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"1933 Act\"), and the undersigned anticipates that he will be such an \"affiliate\" at the time of the Merger.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned understands and agrees that as to ---------------- GSMS he is considered a 'contractual party' under Rule 145(c) as loosely interpreted, and the undersigned anticipates that he will be considered a 'contractual party' at the time of the Merger.",
                "explanation": "The term 'affiliate' has a specific meaning under SEC rules, particularly Rule 145(c) and Rule 405. Replacing it with 'contractual party' introduces ambiguity and contradicts the legally defined term. This undermines the clarity regarding the insider status and potential liabilities associated with being an affiliate.",

                "changed_text": "PSS agrees to file reports as deemed necessary by its internal counsel after the effective date of the Merger, but only if the undersigned requires them to transfer shares of PSS Common Stock issued to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the obligation to comply with Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the specific requirements of Rule 145(d). By making the filing discretionary and dependent on the undersigned's request, it contradicts the mandatory reporting requirements designed to ensure transparency and protect investors.",

                "changed_text": "If PSS's counsel subjectively believes that the sale or transfer is generally acceptable, PSS may, at its sole discretion, consider providing some form of documentation, if it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the objective standard of compliance with Rule 145(d) with a subjective assessment by PSS's counsel. It also makes the provision of necessary opinions discretionary. This directly contradicts the intent of Rule 145(d), which is to provide a clear pathway for certain transactions, and creates uncertainty and potential for arbitrary denial of transfers.",

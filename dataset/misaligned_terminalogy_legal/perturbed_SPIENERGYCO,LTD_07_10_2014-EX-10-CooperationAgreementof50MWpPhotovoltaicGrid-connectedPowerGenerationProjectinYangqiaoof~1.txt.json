                "original_text": "Party B promises that land nature will not be changed for building large-scale PV grid-connected power generation project in the plot; comprehensive development will be carried out according to relevant national stipulations, such commercial crops will be interplanted as agriculture and forestry as well as medicinal materials; local employees will enjoy the priority to be employed; local building materials will be adopted and relevant expenses will be paid on schedule.",
                "changed_text": "Party B promises that land use designation will not be significantly altered for building a PV project; some development will be carried out; local workforce may be considered; and expenses will be subject to negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'land nature will not be changed,' and describes 'comprehensive development' according to 'national stipulations' with a specific priority for 'local employees'. Changing these terms introduces ambiguity and contradicts established legal interpretations related to land use regulations and labor laws, where 'land nature' and 'national stipulations' have specific meanings. The change makes adherence discretionary rather than obligatory.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates land use regulations and employment laws; specific regulations depend on the jurisdiction but generally relate to zoning, environmental protection, and fair labor practices.",

                "changed_text": "Party A welcomes and supports Party B to invest and develop new energy projects in Fenyi County, and Party B intends to explore the possibility of building a photovoltaic project; both parties aim for cooperative interaction on areas of mutual interest, documenting their understanding below",
                "explanation": "Replacing '50MWp photovoltaic grid-connected power generation project' with 'photovoltaic project' and substituting 'reach the following cooperation agreement' with 'documenting their understanding below' changes the nature of the agreement. The original text implies a legally binding commitment to a specific project, whereas the modified text suggests only a preliminary understanding without a firm obligation. This introduces legal uncertainty regarding the enforceability of the agreement.",

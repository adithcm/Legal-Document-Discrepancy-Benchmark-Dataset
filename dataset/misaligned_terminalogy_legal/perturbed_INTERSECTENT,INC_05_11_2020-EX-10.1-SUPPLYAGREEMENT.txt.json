                "original_text": "1.6. \"Current Good Manufacturing Practices\" or \"cGMP\" shall mean current Good Manufacturing Practice as set forth by the US FDA as well as current good manufacturing practices applicable to the API, or the making thereof at HOVIONE's manufacturing facility, set forth by the relevant Regulatory Agency.",
                "changed_text": "1.6. \"Current Good Manufacturing Practices\" or \"cGMP\" shall mean suggestions for manufacturing standards. The determination of whether or not a practice constitutes cGMP lies solely at the discretion of HOVIONE.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of \"Current Good Manufacturing Practices\" or \"cGMP\" contradicts the standard legal and regulatory definition provided by the US FDA. cGMPs are not merely suggestions; they are legally mandated standards. Giving HOVIONE sole discretion to determine cGMP compliance introduces ambiguity and potential non-compliance with US regulations.",

                "original_text": "5.6. Inspection of API. Within thirty (30) calendar days of the arrival of each lot of API at the manufacturing facility designated by INTERSECT, INTERSECT shall inspect and test each lot of API at its own cost and expense. If, upon inspecting and testing the API, INTERSECT determines that a lot of API does not conform to the Product Specifications, then INTERSECT shall, within such thirty (30) day period, give HOVIONE written notice of such non-conformity (setting forth the details of such non-conformity):Unless HOVIONE objects, within 20 working days from the notice by INTERSECT, to the non-conformity INTERSECT will return the non-conforming API to HOVIONE. Any API rejected by INTERSECT may not be reshipped to INTERSECT except if the API is reprocessed according to the DMF. HOVIONE sole responsibility shall be to replace any non-conforming API within thirty (30) days of receiving the notice of non- conformity.",
                "changed_text": "5.6. Inspection of API. Within thirty (30) calendar days of the arrival of each lot of API at the manufacturing facility designated by INTERSECT, INTERSECT may, but is not required to, inspect and test each lot of API. If INTERSECT performs an inspection and determines that a lot of API does not conform to their internal standards, they may notify HOVIONE. HOVIONE will consider the notification and may, at their discretion, offer a discount on future purchases.",
                "explanation": "This modification changes the mandatory inspection of API to a discretionary one and removes the defined 'Product Specifications' as a compliance metric. Instead, it uses 'internal standards' which are undefined, weakening INTERSECT's ability to reject non-conforming API based on agreed-upon specifications. Furthermore, the 'sole responsibility' of HOVIONE to replace non-conforming API is reduced to the possibility of a discount, creating uncertainty in the recourse INTERSECT has.",

HOVIONE shall indemnify, defend and hold INTERSECT and its officers, directors, affiliates, agents and employees harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, costs, expenses, losses, liabilities and/or damages (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) of every kind and nature caused by, arising out of or resulting from HOVIONE's negligence relating to, or breach of, this Agreement and any claim for personal or bodily injury arising from the manufacture and/or distribution of API by HOVIONE. This indemnification obligation does not apply to any claim for personal or bodily injury arising from the use or administration of the API except to the extent such injury is attributable to a Defect in the API arising out of HOVIONE's gross negligence, willful misconduct, or failure to manufacture and deliver the API in accordance with the Product Specifications and all Applicable Law.",
                "changed_text": "8.2. HOVIONE may consider offering assistance to INTERSECT in the event of claims, demands, costs, expenses, losses, liabilities and/or damages arising from HOVIONE's actions. However, HOVIONE’s maximum assistance will never exceed 10% of their gross annual revenue, and any offer of assistance is entirely at HOVIONE’s discretion.",
                "explanation": "This modification fundamentally alters the indemnification obligations of HOVIONE. Instead of a clear obligation to indemnify INTERSECT, it is replaced with a discretionary 'consideration of assistance' with a capped amount. This directly contradicts the standard definition of indemnification, which requires the indemnifying party to protect the other party from losses or liabilities. The alteration creates uncertainty as to whether INTERSECT will be protected from damages caused by HOVIONE's negligence, violating standard business and legal practices.",

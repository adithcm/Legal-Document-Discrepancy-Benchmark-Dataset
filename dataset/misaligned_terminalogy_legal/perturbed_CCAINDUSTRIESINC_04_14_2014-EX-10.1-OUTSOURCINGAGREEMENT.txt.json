                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below.\n\n(a) \"Accounts Receivable\" shall mean all accounts receivable, notes receivable and other indebtedness due and owed by any Customer and arising or held in connection with the sale of any of the Products.",
                "changed_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below.\n\n(a) \"Accounts Receivable\" shall mean some amounts a Customer owes, as determined by the Contractor's discretion, though these amounts may not align with typical accounting definitions.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Accounts Receivable' according to standard accounting practices. The modified text allows the Contractor to arbitrarily determine what constitutes 'Accounts Receivable', contradicting generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and creating uncertainty about the financial obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Contractor shall endeavor, when feasible, to deposit the foregoing amounts within a reasonable timeframe after receipt, subject to Contractor's resource availability.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear timeframe for depositing amounts (five business days). The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'best efforts' with 'endeavor, when feasible' and replacing 'five (5) business days' with 'a reasonable timeframe', making enforcement unclear and contradicting the intent of the original clause which aims for prompt remittance. The term reasonable timeframe lacks concrete details, which would potentially nullify the provision.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All insurance coverages are to be placed with insurers which have a Best's rating of no less than \"A.\" Such insurance requirements shall be maintained during the Term and shall continue for a minimum of three years following termination of this Agreement. Failure to comply with the insurance requirements shall place Company in material breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "All insurance coverages are to be placed with insurers as the Company deems necessary. The necessity of maintaining these requirements is at the Contractor's discression and shall be determined on a case by case basis. Failure to comply with the insurance requirements may or may not be a material breach of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a specific 'A' Best's rating for insurers and defines non-compliance as a 'material breach'. The modified text gives the Company the discretion to select insurers and removes the guarantee that the failure to comply with insurance requirements will create a 'material breach'. This introduces ambiguity and misaligns with standard insurance compliance expectations. By not following the A Best's Rating, it goes against the insurance policy expectations and potentially the state compliance regulations regarding those matters.",

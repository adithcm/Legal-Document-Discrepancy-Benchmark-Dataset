                "original_text": "1.3 \"Affiliate\" means, with respect to a Party, any corporation or other entity that is directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under the common control with such Party. For the purpose of this definition, \"control\" means the direct or indirect ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or other voting rights of the subject entity to elect directors (or, in the case of an entity that is not a corporation, for the election of the corresponding managing authority), or if not meeting the preceding, any entity owned or controlled by or owning or controlling at the maximum control or ownership right permitted in the country where such entity exists.",
                "changed_text": "1.3 \"Affiliate\" means, with respect to a Party, any corporation or other entity that is directly or indirectly associated with such Party. For the purpose of this definition, \"control\" means influence over the business decisions of the subject entity, regardless of ownership percentage. Even without meeting this condition, an affiliate may be any entity associated or influenced by the maximum influence or association right permitted in the country where such entity exists.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' specifies a clear ownership threshold (50% ownership) to define control. The modified version introduces ambiguity by defining 'control' as 'influence over the business decisions' without a clear metric. It also adds 'association' as an alternative condition, making the term 'Affiliate' vague and unenforceable under standard corporate law.",

                "changed_text": "1.21 \"Products\" means materials processed by either party and labeled as sustainable.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clearly defines 'Products' as 'recycled or upcycled PET resins'. The modified version introduces the term 'materials processed by either party and labeled as sustainable'. This is problematic because the term \"sustainable\" lacks a clear, legally defined meaning. This alteration opens the door for disputes over the definition of \"sustainable,\" creating contractual uncertainty and deviating from established industry standards for recycled materials.",

The term \"Confidential Information\" means any information disclosed by one Party to the other (i) prior to the date of this Agreement but with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, or (ii) pursuant to this Agreement, in each case which is in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form and is marked \"Confidential,\" \"Proprietary\" or in some other manner to indicate its confidential nature. Confidential Information may also include oral information disclosed by one Party to the other pursuant to this Agreement, pro-vided that such information is designated as confidential at the time of disclosure and reduced to a written summary by the disclosing Party, within thirty (30) days after its oral disclosure, which is marked in a manner to indicate its confidential nature and delivered to the receiving party.",
                "changed_text": "4.1 Confidential Information. The term \"Confidential Information\" means any information disclosed by one Party to the other. Confidential Information also includes information that a party deems it to be secret. There is no requirement that the information be in writing, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form or marked as 'Confidential' or 'Proprietary'.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' requires that information be marked as 'Confidential' or 'Proprietary' and, in the case of oral information, be reduced to writing within 30 days. The modified version removes these requirements, making any information disclosed between the parties potentially confidential, regardless of its nature or marking. This contradicts standard legal practices that require reasonable efforts to protect confidential information and could render the clause unenforceable due to its breadth and lack of specificity.",

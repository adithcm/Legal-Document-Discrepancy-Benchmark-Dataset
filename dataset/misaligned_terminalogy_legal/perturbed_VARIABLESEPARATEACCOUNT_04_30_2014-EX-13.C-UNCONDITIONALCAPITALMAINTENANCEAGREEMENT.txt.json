                "explanation": "This change allows AIG to define key financial terms, such as \"Total Adjusted Capital\" and \"Company Action Level RBC,\" in a manner inconsistent with statutory definitions prescribed by Texas insurance laws and NAIC RBC instructions. By stating that AIG has sole discretion, the contract creates a legal contradiction that could lead to uncertainty and disputes regarding the actual capital requirements and reporting obligations of the Company.",

The type and amount of such funds or assets, and the determination of whether the Company's Capital is adequate, shall be at the sole discretion of AIG.",
                "explanation": "The original text tied AIG's obligation to contribute capital to specific calculations and regulatory definitions. By changing \"Total Adjusted Capital\" to simply \"Capital, as determined by AIG\" and removing the reference to \"Company Action Level RBC\" and \"Specified Minimum Percentage,\" the modified text creates a contradiction. It gives AIG broad discretion to determine when and how much capital to contribute, deviating from the statutory capital requirements that insurance companies must adhere to under Texas law. This contradicts the intent of regulatory oversight and the legal requirements for maintaining adequate capital reserves.",

Best, on the one hand, or to the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, which causes the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, (b) the Company completes a material transaction that is treated materially differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand, and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any other material development or circumstance affecting the Company which AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum Percentage then in effect.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates an annual review of the \"Specified Minimum Percentage,\" considering external factors such as agency criteria and regulatory changes. The modification, replacing it with \"Adequacy Percentage\" and granting AIG sole discretion in revising it, directly contradicts the intent of ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. This change introduces a legal contradiction, as insurance companies are legally required to adhere to specific capital adequacy standards that cannot be arbitrarily altered by one party to a contract. This is in direct opposition to the Texas Insurance code. ",

                "original_text": "Horst Entertainment agrees to pay Galactcomm $0.01 (one cent) per access up to 400,000 accesses thereafter payment shall be $0.005 (one-half cent) per access. Horst Entertainment shall send this amount to Galacticomm by no later than Wednesday for accesses used from the previuos week (Monday thru Sunday).",
                "changed_text": "Horst Entertainment agrees to pay Galactcomm $0.01 (one cent) per access up to 400,000 accesses thereafter payment shall be $0.005 (one-half cent) per access. Payment terms are subject to change at Galacticomm's discretion. Horst Entertainment shall send this amount to Galacticomm by no later than Wednesday for accesses used from the previuos week (Monday thru Sunday).",
                "explanation": "By adding 'Payment terms are subject to change at Galacticomm's discretion,' the contract contradicts the initial agreement on payment amounts. This introduces uncertainty and potential disputes, as the legally defined payment terms can now be unilaterally altered, conflicting with contract law principles requiring mutual agreement.",

After-hours support is available on a best-effort basis. This person(s) must be available by beeper or telephone during business hours. Horst Entertainment shall provide this same 24 hour service at the broadcast location.",
                "explanation": "The change from '24 hours per day, 7 days per week' to 'during normal business hours' creates a contradiction. The original clause implies a legally enforceable commitment to 24/7 support, while the modified clause limits this obligation and introduces ambiguity, making enforcement uncertain. This contradicts the initial commitment to consistent service.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'fully agree to all terms' to 'agree to the majority of the terms' introduces ambiguity regarding the enforceable aspects of the agreement. Specifying 'venue selected by Galacticomm' contradicts standard legal principles of fair venue selection, potentially biasing dispute resolution. The location of mediation and its effects are left open to change at Galacticomm's discretion.",

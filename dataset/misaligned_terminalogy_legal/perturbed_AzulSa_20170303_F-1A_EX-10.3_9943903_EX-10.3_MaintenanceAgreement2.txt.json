                "original_text": "Unless otherwise defined, capitalised terms, singular or plural, used in this Amendment, shall have the same meaning ascribed thereto in the GMA.",
                "changed_text": "Unless specifically redefined within this Amendment, capitalized terms, whether singular or plural, will adopt a common industry understanding, irrespective of definitions previously provided in the GMA.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by suggesting that common industry understanding supersedes explicitly defined terms in the GMA. This contradicts contract law principles that prioritize defined terms within the contract itself. Now it is uncertain whether the definitions in GMA or industry definition would be applied.",

                "original_text": "In case of any inconsistency between the terms of the GMA and this Amendment regarding the subject-matter, the latter shall prevail. To the extent not inconsistent with this Amendment, all terms and conditions of the GMA shall remain valid and binding.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of any conflict between the GMA and this Amendment concerning the subject matter, the interpretation most favorable to the Repairer shall control. In all other respects, unless directly superseded herein, the GMA remains in effect, although interpretations may vary based on Repairer's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a legal contradiction by prioritizing the Repairer's interpretation in case of conflict and introduces uncertainty about which interpretation of the GMA would be binding. Favoring one party's interpretation over another contradicts general principles that require fair and objective interpretation of contracts.",

                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law, the Parties hereto agree that this Amendment in all respects, and any claim or cause of action based upon or arising out of this Amendment, or any dealing between the Parties relating to the subject matter of this Amendment or the transactions contemplated hereby or the Company/Repairer relationship being established, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A. as applied to contracts to be performed wholly within the State of New York (Exclusive of Section 7-101 of the New York General Obligations Law which is inapplicable to this Amendment).",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law, the Parties acknowledge that while this Amendment shall be generally interpreted under the laws of the State of New York, the application and enforcement of specific clauses may, at the Repairer's sole discretion, be subject to principles of international commercial law, or the laws of France where ATR is established.",
                "explanation": "By allowing for the potential application of international commercial law or French law at the Repairer's discretion, this modification directly contradicts the initial agreement that New York law governs all aspects of the contract. It introduces uncertainty about the governing law, which is a key element of contract enforceability, and creates a legal contradiction.",

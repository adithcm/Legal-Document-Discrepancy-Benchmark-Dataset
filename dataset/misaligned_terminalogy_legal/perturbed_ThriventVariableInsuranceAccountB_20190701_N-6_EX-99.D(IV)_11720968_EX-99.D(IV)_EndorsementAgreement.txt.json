Rights and privileges of membership are set forth in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Society. These rights and privileges are inherently linked to the ownership of this contract.",
                "explanation": "By stating that membership rights are 'inherently linked' to the contract's ownership, it contradicts the earlier statement that they are 'separate.' This introduces ambiguity regarding the member's rights, potentially conflicting with established fraternal benefit society regulations that carefully delineate membership benefits from contractual benefits.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'if any' to 'as we see fit' gives the company discretionary power over dividend allocation, contradicting the implied fairness in 'divisible surplus' distribution. This creates uncertainty, especially since the contract states dividends are not expected, yet provides for the possibility. It could conflict with regulations requiring equitable treatment of policyholders in mutual or fraternal benefit societies.",

                "explanation": "Contradicts itself by first stating that membership rights can't be transferred or assigned, then saying that membership rights are automatically transferred with contract ownership, creating uncertainty about what will happen to the membership status of the society.

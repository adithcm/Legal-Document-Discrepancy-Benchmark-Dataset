                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "As used herein, the term \"Golf Instruction Related Product\" shall mean any interactive entertainment software product related to golf instruction which is produced and released during the \"Term\" (hereinafter defined in Section 5.1) and which may be published in multiple versions (e.g., versions for play on handheld mobile devices (including cell phones), for sale in any and all territories.",
                "changed_text": "As used herein, the term \"Golf Instruction Related Product\" shall mean any tangible item vaguely associated with golf. This includes, but is not limited to, interactive entertainment software, golf clubs, apparel, and accessories. The definition may be altered at TDA's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of \"Golf Instruction Related Product\" is now excessively broad and subjective, conflicting with typical interpretations of product definitions in commercial contracts. The clause 'may be altered at TDA's discretion' introduces further uncertainty and allows TDA to unilaterally expand the scope of the agreement, potentially infringing on Smith's other endorsement deals. This change makes the term legally ambiguous and unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term (the \"Exclusivity Period\"), Smith hereby agrees that he will have limited association with golf products or services as TDA deems appropriate. The specifics of this association will be decided on a per-case basis, with TDA maintaining complete discretion on approval.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear definition of exclusivity, while the modified version introduces uncertainty by replacing specific restrictions with vague concepts. The phrases 'limited association' and 'as TDA deems appropriate' lack legal precision and grants TDA broad, unchecked power, making this exclusivity clause legally questionable and potentially unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "TDA will endeavor to provide Smith with a token of appreciation, such as samples of product when available. The nature and timing of this provision is subject to TDA's sole discretion and financial capability.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear obligation to provide products of specific quantities. The modified text replaces this with a vague 'token of appreciation' and makes delivery contingent on TDA's 'sole discretion and financial capability.' This significantly weakens TDA's obligation and creates a contractual contradiction, making it unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "Abnormal Use\" means any usage, maintenance, storage, handling of the Aircraft, or its sub-assemblies, or its systems, or Items fitted on it including LRUs, Main Elements, Spare Main Elements, that does not comply with all applicable technical documentation and any other instructions issued by the manufacturers and which is not attributable to the Repairer or Subcontractors, including: (i) Any failure by the Company to correctly comply with any Repairer and/or OEM instructions or recommendations, technical directives, or any workmanship defect, lack of qualification, non- approved repair and/or maintenance method; or, (ii) Any negligence or failure to exercise reasonable effort(s) made to initiate corrective action(s), or lateness or total or partial failure in undertaking corrective action(s), for Aircraft or LRU(s) or Main Element(s) malfunctions which should have been reasonably identified by the Company; or, (iii) Any Aircraft, LRU(s) or Main Element(s) suffering damage or premature removal arising out of or in connection with any defective storage, inappropriate Packaging or transport by the Company or its forwarder agent, or gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Company(or its subcontractors or agents); or (iv) Any events or circumstances, including: FOD, abnormal wear, hard contact, material drop or shock, engine fire or submersion, lightning strike, hard landing, hail (including on storage position), partial or total destruction or loss of Aircraft, LRU(s) or, Main Element(s);",
                "changed_text": "\"Abnormal Use\" means any usage, maintenance, storage, handling of the Aircraft, or its sub-assemblies, or its systems, or Items fitted on it including LRUs, Main Elements, Spare Main Elements, that does not comply with general good practices and common airline standards, including: (i) Any failure by the Company to comply with any Repairer and/or OEM suggestions or general notes; or, (ii) Any lack of diligence or effort(s) made to initiate corrective action(s) after a reasonable delay, for Aircraft or LRU(s) or Main Element(s) malfunctions; or, (iii) Any Aircraft, LRU(s) or Main Element(s) suffering damage or premature removal arising out of or in connection with any storage, Packaging or transport by the Company or its forwarder agent; or (iv) Any events or circumstances, including: FOD, unusual wear, hard contact, material drop or shock, engine fire or submersion, lightning strike, hard landing, hail (including on storage position), partial or total destruction or loss of Aircraft, LRU(s) or, Main Element(s);",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Abnormal Use\" references 'technical documentation and any other instructions issued by the manufacturers,' providing a clear, objective standard. The modification replaces this with 'general good practices and common airline standards' and weakens specific requirements, replacing them with subjective interpretations like 'suggestions' and 'general notes'. It also removes the need to address 'workmanship defects' and 'non-approved repair and/or maintenance method', which has established legal definitions. These changes make it difficult to enforce the 'Abnormal Use' clause because the contractual language now contradicts standard definitions of maintenance and repair, undermining the contract's clarity.",

                "original_text": "The Company shall carry out all such remedial actions within a mutually agreed time period , otherwise the Company shall be deemed in Default. It is acknowledged and agreed that any audit or operational visit by the Repairer will be conducted by the Repairer for its own purposes in connection with this Agreement and the Repairer shall have no responsibility, liability or obligations with respect to the safety compliance with any AD, operation or, except as otherwise provided herein, maintenance of any Aircraft, all of which shall be the sole responsibility, liability and obligation of the Company.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall endeavor to carry out remedial actions as quickly as possible , and it is acknowledged that the Repairer has no liability if any safety issues arise. It is acknowledged and agreed that any audit or operational visit by the Repairer will be conducted by the Repairer for its own purposes and the Repairer shall only offer recommendations with respect to safety compliance with any AD, operation or maintenance of any Aircraft, all of which shall be subject to the Company's own discretion.",
                "explanation": "This section originally established a landlord obligation for carrying out remedial actions based on audits. The modified text changes the Company's obligation to 'endeavor to carry out remedial actions as quickly as possible', removing a defined timeline. Further, stating the Repairer has 'no liability if any safety issues arise' and framing AD compliance as 'subject to the Company's own discretion' undermines aviation safety regulations. This misaligns terminology and contradicts legal safety responsibilities, especially regarding AD compliance, because 'recommendations' are not legally binding under aviation law.",

                "explanation": "The initial text mandates compliance with 'all applicable technical documentation,' 'any AD' and managing updates according to technical notices, creating clear, enforceable obligations. The revised text introduces uncertainty by stating that the aircraft must be operated in a 'generally accepted manner using practices deemed suitable by the Company,' AD compliance becomes 'consider' and modify 'if deemed necessary,' and technical notices are updated 'if convenient'. These changes convert mandatory requirements into optional considerations, conflicting with aviation regulations that mandate specific maintenance and AD compliance procedures, undermining enforceability.",

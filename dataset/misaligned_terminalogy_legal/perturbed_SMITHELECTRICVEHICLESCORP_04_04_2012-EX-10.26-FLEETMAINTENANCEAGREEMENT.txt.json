                "original_text": "4.6 labour and parts to make repairs to Vehicles and Chargers due to normal wear and tear;",
                "changed_text": "4.6 labour and parts to make repairs to Vehicles and Chargers, regardless of cause;",
                "explanation": "The original text limits repairs to 'normal wear and tear,' whereas the modified text broadens it to 'regardless of cause.' This introduces a legal contradiction because normal wear and tear has a generally understood meaning in contract law, while 'regardless of cause' is ambiguous and could include damage from misuse or accidents, which are typically excluded.",

Legal status\nSEV is an independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a partnership or any employment  relationship between the parties nor shall anything in this Agreement be deemed to constitute one party the agent of the other for any  purpose.",
                "changed_text": "23. Legal status\nSEV is considered both an independent contractor and an agent of DCL. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a partnership or any employment relationship between the parties for the purposes of this agreement only.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states SEV is an independent contractor. The modified clause creates a direct contradiction by stating SEV is both an independent contractor and an agent. This is legally problematic because independent contractors and agents have different legal responsibilities and liabilities. An agent acts on behalf of the principal, whereas an independent contractor acts on their own behalf. The added caveat regarding 'this agreement only' does not resolve the inherent contradiction.",

                "changed_text": "8.2 Spare Vehicles, at DCL's discretion, may or may not be held at each Site, with the number of Spare Vehicles having no impact on Fleet Size calculations.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a required ratio of spare vehicles and their inclusion in fleet size calculations. The modified text makes both the holding of spare vehicles and their inclusion in fleet size calculations discretionary and non-impactful, directly contradicting the original requirement. This creates uncertainty about the obligations regarding spare vehicle availability, which could lead to disputes over the adequacy of maintenance support.",

                "changed_text": "(c)      \"Products\" shall mean various items consisting of men's                   pants, shirts, sweaters, windshirts and raingear. The specific items will be determined at the Company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Products' clearly defined the items covered by the agreement. The modified definition introduces ambiguity by stating \"various items\" and adding that the specific items will be determined at the Company's discretion. This contradicts the initial specificity, potentially leading to disputes over what constitutes 'Products' under the contract, especially if 'various items' encompasses goods not typically considered 'casual apparel'.",

                "changed_text": "(d)      \"Duval Identification\" means the allowance to potentially use, subject to the                   provisions hereof, Duval's name, fame, nickname, initials,                   autograph, voice, video or film portrayals, facsimile                   signature, photograph, likeness and image or facsimile image,                   and any other means of endorsement by Duval used in connection                   with the advertisement and promotion of Company's Products.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clearly grants a 'right to use' the Duval Identification. The modified version weakens this by stating 'allowance to potentially use.' This shifts the obligation and introduces uncertainty as to whether the Company actually has a guaranteed right to utilize Duval's Identification as initially intended, affecting the contract's enforceability concerning endorsement rights.",

                "changed_text": "Past due payments hereunder may bear interest at a rate to be determined by the Company, not exceeding the maximum interest rate permissible under law.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specified a clear interest rate for past due payments (1.5% per month or the legal maximum, whichever is less). The modified version introduces uncertainty by allowing the Company to determine the interest rate, as long as it doesn't exceed the legal maximum. This creates ambiguity and could be interpreted as violating usury laws or principles of good faith if the Company applies the maximum rate arbitrarily, even when a lower rate would be reasonable.",

                "original_text": "1.2 It is the goal of the Seller Trusts to have all of the Shares sold, on a pro-rata basis, in three or more tranches (each a \"Tranche\") commencing not earlier than six (6) months after the Effective Date with the resale of all of the shares of Stock completed as soon as practicable after the Effective Date.",
                "changed_text": "1.2 It is the goal of the Seller Trusts to have all of the Shares sold, without specific proration requirements, in stages (each a \"Tranche\") commencing at their discretion after the Effective Date with the resale of all of the shares of Stock completed at a pace determined by market conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a pro-rata basis and a minimum six-month delay. The modified text removes the pro-rata requirement, makes the timing discretionary, and ties the pace to market conditions. This contradicts the intent for orderly, predictable marketing, potentially violating securities regulations regarding fair and transparent market practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934; potential violation of regulations related to fair market practices and disclosure requirements.",

                "original_text": "1.4 The Seller Trusts and GWG intend to retain one or more nationally recognized bulge bracket investment banks (the \"Bank\") for the orderly marketing and resale of Shares pursuant to a separate engagement letter (the \"Engagement Letter\") to advise them in connection with the sale of the Tranches (together, the \"Offerings\").",
                "changed_text": "1.4 The Seller Trusts and GWG may, at their sole option, retain any financial entity (the \"Bank\") for assistance with the sale of Shares with no obligation for orderly marketing or resale, detailed in a separate agreement (the \"Engagement Letter\") which outlines their limited role.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates retaining a nationally recognized bank for 'orderly marketing.' The modified text makes retaining a bank optional, removes the orderly marketing mandate, and broadens the type of entity that can be retained. This undermines the purpose of an orderly marketing agreement, potentially conflicting with fiduciary duties to shareholders.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential breach of fiduciary duty; Conflicts with generally accepted standards for securities offerings.",

                "original_text": "1.8 Prior to the offering of each Tranche, GWG shall provide the placement agents or underwriters in such Offering a list of the top 100 institutional holders of the Common Stock. In connection with any Offering, the Seller Trusts shall instruct the placement agents or underwriters to use their reasonable best efforts to (i) effect as wide a distribution of the Shares as is reasonably practicable without adversely affecting the pricing thereof and (ii) not sell any Shares to any person or Group (as such terms is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\")) who, upon completion of the Offering, would have Beneficial Ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of shares of Common Stock representing in the aggregate 5.0% or more the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (or in the case of a person of the type described in Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act, 10% or more of the Total Voting Power).",
                "changed_text": "1.8 Prior to each Tranche, GWG may provide a list of major shareholders. The Seller Trusts may suggest, but are not required to ensure, that placement agents aim for some distribution of Shares without overly affecting prices and should attempt to limit sales to entities already owning over 10% of the stock.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates providing a list of top institutional holders and requires best efforts to ensure a wide distribution and prevent concentration of ownership above 5%. The modified version makes providing the list optional, weakens the distribution requirement to a suggestion, and raises the ownership threshold to 10% with no requirement to 'not sell', directly conflicting with regulations preventing market manipulation and insider control.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 13(d)(3); Rules 13d-3 and 13d-1(b)(1)(i) regarding beneficial ownership and reporting requirements; regulations against market manipulation.",

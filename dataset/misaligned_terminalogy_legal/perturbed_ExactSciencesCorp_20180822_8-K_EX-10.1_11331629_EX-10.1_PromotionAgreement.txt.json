For clarity, non- face-to-face contact shall mean e-detailing, video detailing or other presentation of Promotional Material by a Sales Representative to an Eligible Prescriber via audio, video, internet, using webex or other similar live conference applications, and in all instances that allows for real time, detailed and substantive communication between the Sales Representative and the Eligible Prescriber regarding the Product and would be considered a Detail by Pfizer for its own products under its own guidelines, but shall exclude any such communications, such as telephone calls, during which such detailed and visual",

Such information need not be balanced or verified, and is only required to meet minimal requirements outlined by internal guidelines. This may include, but is not limited to, activities performed by any Representative, presentations made at conventions, or delivery of savings cards. The measurement of such interactions will be determined solely by the recording Party’s discretion.

                "explanation": "The modified definition broadens the scope of 'Detail' to include any interaction, regardless of the healthcare professional's prescribing authority or the nature of the information shared. By removing the requirements for balanced and verified information and including activities previously excluded, and introducing automated and prerecorded messages, the definition conflicts with established regulations and guidelines regarding pharmaceutical marketing, which mandates details include only eligible prescribers and require balanced, truthful and non-misleading information.",

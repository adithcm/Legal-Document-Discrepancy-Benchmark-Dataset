Background Information includes Background Samples but does not include Program Information. Background Information further includes any business or financial information of the indicated Party relating to the subject matter of this Agreement that is disclosed to the other Party under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, financial data, costs, margins, overhead, returns on capital employed, marketing strategies, and licensing strategies and terms.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit condition that Background Information must be pre-existing or independent of the project and stating that it *includes* Program Information directly contradicts the original definition and general IP law where background and project-specific information are treated distinctly. This creates uncertainty around ownership and usage rights.",

                "original_text": "Promptly after the Effective Date, the Parties will establish a committee that will oversee technical support and provide overall supervision and administrative guidance for the Program (\"Steering Committee\" or \"SC\"), further detailed as follows - (a) Composition. Each Party will appoint in writing one or more of its employees as SC members. Each Party will have the right to change its SC members at any time by giving written notice of such change to the other Party. (b) Meetings. Meetings of the SC will be in person or by phone at a location and time agreed to in advance by the SC members. (c) Other Attendees. In addition to the attendance of SC members, with prior written notice to the other Party's SC members, each Party may also bring to any SC meeting such technical and other advisors as it may deem appropriate, provided that such advisors are employees of a Party or its Affiliates and are under written confidentiality and use restrictions at least as strict as those imposed herein. Otherwise, a Party's additional invitees may attend a SC meeting only with the other Party's advance written approval. (d) Responsibilities. The responsibilities of the SC will include, but are not limited to: i. Project Endorsement and Monitoring. The SC will review and approve each Project Description and amendment thereto prior to execution by the Parties. (However, no Project Description or amendment thereto will be effective unless and until it is executed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties.) The SC will periodically monitor the ongoing status of all Projects, and make adjustments to priorities within and between the Projects. ii. Dispute Resolution. Assist the Parties in resolving any disputes. (e) Votes. Each Party only gets one vote on the SC regardless of the number of SC members it appoints. Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, all decisions by the SC will be by unanimous agreement. In the absence of unanimity, ExxonMobil's SC representatives will have final decision making authority with respect to only the following decisions required by the SC: whether and where to seek patent protection and whether to maintain patent assets, subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6.04 (Solicitation of Program Patents Discretionary). (f) Minutes. All decisions by the SC will be documented in agreed upon minutes distributed to SC members after the meeting. (g) No Amendment Rights. The SC may recommend but has no authority to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement. (h) Costs. ExxonMobil will bear its own costs associated with participating in the SC. FCE's costs and expenses associated with its participation in the SC are included in each Project's budget as Direct Costs.",

Each Party will appoint one or more individuals as SC members. Each Party will have the right to change its SC members at any time by giving verbal notice of such change to the other Party. (b) Meetings. Meetings of the SC will be informal, location and time decided spontaneously. (c) Other Attendees. Each Party may bring any attendees to any SC meeting without notifying the other Party. (d) Responsibilities. The responsibilities of the SC will be limited to: i. Casual Project Monitoring. The SC will casually look over each Project. (However, no Project Description or amendment thereto will be effective unless and until it is initiated by representatives of one Party.) The SC will informally monitor the ongoing status of projects, and make suggestions. ii. Vaguely resolve any disputes. (e) Votes. Each Party gets as many votes as they have SC members. All decisions by the SC will be advisory. (f) Minutes. No minutes will be taken. (g) Amendment Rights. The SC may informally propose amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. (h) Costs. Each Party will bear its own costs.",
                "explanation": "By weakening the responsibilities of the steering committee to 'casual' and 'informal', changing the notification requirements, removing ExxonMobil's final decision-making authority, and allowing for amendments of the agreement terms by the SC, the original intent of the program governance is contradicted. This shift introduces uncertainty about the actual decision-making process and can lead to disputes over how the projects are managed and whether the agreement's terms are being adhered to.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates full compliance with all applicable laws. The modified clause suggests that laws will only be *aimed* to comply with and provides a loophole by prioritizing the project's primary objective above legal compliance. This contradicts the fundamental principle that contracts must adhere to existing laws and introduces the possibility of illegal activities being justified under the contract.",

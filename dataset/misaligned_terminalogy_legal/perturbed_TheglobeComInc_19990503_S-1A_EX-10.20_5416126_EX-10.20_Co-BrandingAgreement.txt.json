                "original_text": "(i) \"Net Revenues\" means all monetary consideration theglobe actually receives for CPM- or CPC-based advertisements and promotions (other than those for its commerce partners) delivered in connection with the Co-Branded Pages, less a sales and administration fee of 15%.",
                "changed_text": "(i) \"Net Revenues\" means all monetary consideration theglobe subjectively deems appropriate to account as revenue for CPM- or CPC-based advertisements and promotions (other than those for its commerce partners) delivered in connection with the Co-Branded Pages, less a variable fee determined at theglobe's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Net Revenues' provides a clear, calculable formula. The modified definition introduces subjectivity and ambiguity by replacing 'actually receives' with 'subjectively deems appropriate' and a fixed percentage fee with a 'variable fee determined at theglobe's discretion.' This contradicts standard accounting practices, which requires revenue to be determined following GAAP principles.",

Boxlot shall be responsible for providing all customer support regarding the Service or the Co-Branded Pages, and theglobe may redirect to Boxlot any associated customer support inquiries. Boxlot shall have sole control over the user agreement that governs the Service, and Boxlot shall have the sole responsibility for dealing with breaches of such user agreement. However, if theglobe has an issue with the user agreement or Boxlot's enforcement of it, the parties shall discuss such issues in good faith. Furthermore, Boxlot's privacy policy shall make any disclosures, or obtain any User consent, reasonably requested by theglobe that the parties believe are necessary to make the disclosures about Users back to theglobe required by this Agreement. All Users shall be treated at least as favorable in all respects (including without limitation with respect to pricing, quality of service, and customer support responsiveness) as Boxlot treats users of the Boxlot Site.",
                "changed_text": "2.8 User Relations. Boxlot shall be primarily responsible for providing general customer support regarding the Service or the Co-Branded Pages; however, theglobe retains the final say in customer support matters. Boxlot shall create a user agreement that governs the Service; however, theglobe can unilaterally amend or terminate this agreement. Boxlot's privacy policy will be non-binding, and User data will be collected and handled as solely determined by theglobe.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly alters the control and responsibilities regarding user relations and data privacy. By stating that 'theglobe retains the final say' and 'theglobe can unilaterally amend,' it contradicts the initial assignment of 'sole control' to Boxlot. It also makes the user agreement and privacy policy non-binding, which contradicts the requirement for a proper user agreement and a privacy policy under consumer protection laws.",

The parties are nominally independent contractors; however, Boxlot shall adhere to theglobe's directives regarding service operation and customer interactions. The parties intend to create a relationship where theglobe has significant operational control over Boxlot. theglobe may provide warranties and representations on behalf of Boxlot.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the core definition of 'independent contractors.' By stating that Boxlot must adhere to theglobe's directives and that theglobe has 'significant operational control,' the relationship effectively shifts towards an employer-employee or principal-agent relationship. Furthermore, by enabling theglobe to make warranties on Boxlot's behalf, the agreement imposes agency-like liability, conflicting with the independent contractor classification.",

                "explanation": "The term \"FF&E\" (Furniture, Fixtures, & Equipment) is a well-defined legal and accounting term. Replacing it with \"Fixtures and Fittings\" introduces ambiguity. 'Fixtures and Fittings' is not consistently defined, and can lead to disputes over what is included, conflicting with standard business practice. This may cause confusion on the items included in the sale.",

All Expenses incurred during each week of the GOB Sale (i.e. Sunday through Saturday) shall be paid by Agent to or on behalf of Merchant, or paid by Merchant and thereafter reimbursed by Agent as provided for herein; provided, however, in the event that the actual amount of an Expense is unavailable on the date of the reconciliation (such as payroll), Merchant and Agent shall agree to an estimate of such amounts, which amounts will be reconciled once the actual amount of such Expense becomes available. Agent and/or Merchant may review or audit the Expenses at any time.",

All Expenses incurred during each week of the GOB Sale (i.e. Sunday through Saturday) may be paid by Agent at their sole discretion. All Expenses incurred during the week may or may not be subject to reconciliation and may or may not be audited.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be paid' to 'may be paid,' the obligation to pay expenses becomes discretionary. Removing the explicit instruction for reconciliation and auditing expenses creates ambiguity about financial responsibilities, directly conflicting with generally accepted accounting and business practices that emphasize proper accounting. The payment of the vendors and others may become uncertain.",

Merchant acknowledges, and the Approval Order (as and when applicable) shall provide, that the Additional Agent Merchandise shall be consigned to Merchant as a true consignment under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of Delaware (the \"UCC\"). Agent is hereby, and shall be through the Approval Order, granted a first priority security interest in (i) the Additional Agent Merchandise and (ii) the Additional Agent Merchandise Proceeds, which security interest shall be deemed perfected pursuant to the Approval Order without the requirement of filing UCC financing statements or providing notifications to any prior secured parties (provided that Agent is hereby authorized to deliver any notices and file any financing statements and amendments thereof under the applicable UCC identifying Agent's interest in the Additional Agent Merchandise and any proceeds from the sale thereof as consigned goods thereunder and Merchant as the consignee therefor, and Agent's security interest in such Additional Agent Merchandise and Additional Agent Merchandise proceeds.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'true consignment under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code' creates legal uncertainty. Additionally, removing language about the Approval Order and perfection of security interest contradicts standard practices for secured transactions, potentially undermining the agentâ€™s claim to the merchandise. By not mentioning 'first priority', a dispute can arise where the merchant can claim priority.",

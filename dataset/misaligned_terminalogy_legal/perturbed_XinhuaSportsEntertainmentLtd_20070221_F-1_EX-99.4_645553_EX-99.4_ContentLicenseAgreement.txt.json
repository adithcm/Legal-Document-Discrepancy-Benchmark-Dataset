                "explanation": "By adding that the 'subject matters as CEIS defines it', this creates ambiguity and allows CEIS to unilaterally alter the scope of 'Content' beyond what is detailed in Schedule 1. This undermines the purpose of Schedule 1, which is to provide a clear and agreed-upon description of the Content. This shift contradicts the contractual intent to define 'Content' with specificity, making the contract's scope uncertain and potentially unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "By changing the rights to vest to CEIS, XFN has no rights to what they created. This goes against common legal understandings of intellectual property ownership of derivative works, creating a contradiction.

                "explanation": "The change stipulates that the Chinese language version of the agreement prevails over the English version. If there were a conflict between the English and Chinese versions of the contract, the Chinese language version will be followed and the contract is now governed by the laws of Beijing, creating ambiguity and uncertainty in legal interpretation and application. The change of jurisdiction from Hong Kong to Beijing introduces a further layer of contradiction and potential unenforceability, as the contract was initially drafted under the legal framework of Hong Kong.",

                "changed_text": "21.1 In connection with the sale or distribution of Cisco Products or Services, or otherwise in carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, Distributor represents and warrants the following:\n\n(a) Distributor will endeavor to comply with most country, federal, state and local laws, ordinances, codes, regulations, rules, policies and procedures, but strict compliance with all anti-corruption laws, Including, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (Applicable Laws) is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with all applicable laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The modified text weakens this obligation by stating that compliance with anti-corruption laws is not guaranteed, contradicting the strict compliance required by the FCPA.",

                "original_text": "(c) Distributor will not use money or other consideration paid by Cisco (and Distributor will not use its own money on Cisco's behalf) for any unlawful purposes, including any purposes violating Applicable Laws, such as direct or indirect payments, for the purpose of assisting Cisco in obtaining or retaining business, to any of the following:\n\n(i) Government officials (including any person holding an executive, legislative, judicial or administrative office, whether elected or appointed, or of any public international organization, such as the United Nations or World Bank, or any person acting in any official capacity for or on behalf of such government, public enterprise or state-owned business); (ii) Political parties or party officials; (iii) Candidates for political office; or (iii) Any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given or promised, directly or indirectly to any of the above identified persons or organizations.",
                "changed_text": "(c) Distributor may, at its discretion, use money or other consideration paid by Cisco (and Distributor may use its own money on Cisco's behalf) for purposes that align with local business customs, including facilitating business relationships with Government officials, Political parties or party officials, Candidates for political office, even if such uses might technically violate Applicable Laws, provided such payments are nominal and customary.",
                "explanation": "This alteration introduces a significant legal contradiction by suggesting that the Distributor can make payments that might technically violate applicable anti-corruption laws as long as they are considered nominal and customary. This directly contradicts the explicit prohibition of such payments under the FCPA, creating uncertainty about the enforceability of the anti-corruption provisions.",

                "explanation": "The original clause grants Cisco the right to immediate termination upon any breach of anti-corruption warranties. The modified clause weakens this right by allowing Cisco to choose whether or not to terminate the agreement and to waive breaches at their convenience. This contradicts the intent of strict enforcement of anti-corruption measures by making the termination clause discretionary, undermining the seriousness of the compliance obligations.",

                "original_text": "1.2 Goodwill. Licensee expressly recognizes and acknowledges that its use of the Licensed Mark shall inure solely to the benefit of Licensor, and shall not confer on Licensee any ownership rights to the Licensed Mark. Licensee agrees and covenants that it shall not challenge, contest, or take any actions inconsistent with Licensor's exclusive rights of ownership of the Licensed Mark.",
                "changed_text": "1.2 Goodwill. Licensee expressly recognizes and acknowledges that its use of the Licensed Mark shall inure solely to the benefit of Licensor, but upon termination of this agreement, Licensee shall retain indefinite rights to utilize the data and information gathered during the agreement's term. Licensee agrees and covenants that it shall not challenge, contest, or take any actions inconsistent with Licensor's exclusive rights of ownership of the Licensed Mark *during the term of this agreement*.",
                "explanation": "By granting the Licensee indefinite rights to data and information gathered during the agreement's term upon termination, it contradicts the premise that the use of the Licensed Mark inures *solely* to the benefit of the Licensor and undermines the exclusive rights of ownership. Trademark law requires consistent control by the owner to prevent genericide.",

                "original_text": "1.5 Quality Control, Licensor Approvals. Licensor, as owner of the Licensed Mark, shall have the right at all times to control and approve the nature and quality of the Licensed Products (and the Licensed Mark thereon), and to inspect Licensee's business operations upon reasonable prior notice for the purpose of ensuring that a high level of quality of the Licensed Products is being maintained by Licensee.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 Quality Control, Licensor Approvals. Licensor, as owner of the Licensed Mark, shall have the right, *at its discretion*, to suggest changes to the nature and quality of the Licensed Products (and the Licensed Mark thereon), however, Licensor shall not inspect Licensee's business operations at any time.",
                "explanation": "This weakens Licensor's control over the quality of Licensed Products by making quality control suggestions discretionary, and eliminating the option to inspect Licensee's business operations. This contradicts standard trademark licensing practices, which necessitate that the Licensor must maintain sufficient control over the quality of goods and services sold under the licensed mark.",

If legally able and without breaching any confidentiality provisions of a contract with a third party, in the event that Licensee becomes aware that any third party is infringing the Licensed Mark, Licensee shall promptly notify Licensor and provide pertinent details. Licensor shall have the right in its sole discretion to bring a legal action for infringement against the third party, together with the right to enforce and collect any judgment thereon. If Licensor elects to exercise such right, Licensee shall, at Licensor's request, provide reasonable assistance to Licensor, at the sole expense of Licensor.",

If legally able and without breaching any confidentiality provisions of a contract with a third party, in the event that Licensee becomes aware that any third party is infringing the Licensed Mark, Licensee *may* notify Licensor and *may* provide pertinent details. Licensor shall *only* have the right to bring a legal action for infringement against the third party *if* Licensee provides consent, together with the right to enforce and collect any judgment thereon. Licensee may request Licensor to cover reasonable expenses incurred, and Licensor is not required to provide that.",
                "explanation": "This change severely limits the Licensor's ability to enforce its intellectual property rights by making notification of infringement optional for the Licensee, requiring Licensee's permission to bring suit and requiring licensee's expenses. This weakens the standard legal principle that the trademark owner is responsible for protecting their mark from infringement, or risk abandonment of the trademark.",

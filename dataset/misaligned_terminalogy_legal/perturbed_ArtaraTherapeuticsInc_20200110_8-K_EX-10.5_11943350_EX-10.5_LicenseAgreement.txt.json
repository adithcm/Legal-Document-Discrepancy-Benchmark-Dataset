                "original_text": "1.9 \"Net Sales\" means, with respect to the Product, the gross invoiced sales price payable to ArTara and/or its Affiliates and their respective licensees and sublicensees for sales anywhere in the world of the Product to a third party, less: (a) discounts (including cash, quantity and patient program discounts), retroactive price reductions, charge-back payments and rebates granted to managed health care organizations or to federal, state and local governments, their agencies, and purchasers and reimbursers or to trade customers; (b) credits or allowances actually, not to exceed the original invoice amount, granted upon claims, damaged goods, rejections or returns of the Product, including the Product returned in connection with recalls or withdrawals; (c) freight out, postage, shipping and insurance charges for delivery of the Product if charged separately and include in the gross receipts; and (d) taxes or duties, excluding income taxes and value-added taxes, levied on, absorbed or otherwise imposed on the sale of the Product, including governmental charges otherwise imposed upon the billed amount, as adjusted for rebates and refunds, provided that such are included in gross receipts and are paid to and/or its Affiliates and their respective licensees and sublicensees.",
                "changed_text": "1.9 \"Net Sales\" means, with respect to the Product, the gross invoiced sales price payable to ArTara and/or its Affiliates and their respective licensees and sublicensees for sales anywhere in the world of the Product to a third party, less: (a) discounts (including only standard commercial discounts); (b) credits or allowances, but limited to only documented defective goods; (c) freight out, postage, shipping and insurance charges for delivery of the Product, only if explicitly stated on the invoice; and (d) taxes or duties, excluding income taxes and value-added taxes, at ArTara's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Net Sales\" has been modified to restrict the allowable deductions. Specifically, limiting discounts only to standard commercial discounts contradicts standard accounting practices that include a range of discounts (e.g., patient program discounts, government rebates). Similarly, limiting credits to documented defective goods excludes returns due to recalls, impacting how revenue is calculated. Also, 'at ArTara's discretion' causes uncertainties on the 'taxes and duties' part.",

Access to all original Program Data shall be provided to ArTara and the CRO at University's facilities in accordance with the Project Plan for the purposes of review and copying as and only to the extent needed to support ArTara's efforts to accomplish the Project. As between ArTara and the University, ownership of all Program Data is hereby retained by the University.",

Access to all original Program Data shall be provided to ArTara and the CRO at University's facilities in accordance with the Project Plan for the purposes of review and copying as and only to the extent needed to support ArTara's efforts to accomplish the Project. ArTara will have temporary control of Program Data, with the understanding that permanent ownership will be determined later.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'ownership' to 'temporary control' and deferring permanent ownership creates ambiguity. Program Data ownership under this agreement is with the University. This change makes the enforcement uncertain.",

To the extent permitted by law, ArTara agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the University of Iowa Research Foundation, the University, the State of Iowa, the University's Board of Regents, their respective affiliates, trustees, officers, directors, faculty, staff, students, successors, assigns, independent contractors, agents and employees including but not limited to Principal Investigator (\"University Indemnitees\"), harmless from and against any and all liability, loss, expense, reasonable adjudicated attorneys' fees, or claims for injury or damages arising out of the use of the Program Data by ArTara and its Affiliates and subcontractors including but not limited to the CRO involved in the Project, but only in proportion to and to the extent such liability, loss, expense, attorneys' fees, or claims for injury or damages are caused by or result from the negligent or acts or omissions of ArTara, its officers, agents, employees, subcontractors, the CRO or Affiliates.",

ArTara may, at its discretion, defend, indemnify and hold the University of Iowa Research Foundation harmless from liability if ArTara believes such indemnification is warranted. The extent of such discretionary indemnification shall be determined solely by ArTara.",
                "explanation": "This alteration replaces the clear obligation to indemnify with a discretionary decision by ArTara. The original clause specifies coverage for liabilities arising from ArTara's use of Program Data due to negligence. Changing this to 'at its discretion' contradicts basic contract law principles that mandates the fulfillment of contractual obligations.",

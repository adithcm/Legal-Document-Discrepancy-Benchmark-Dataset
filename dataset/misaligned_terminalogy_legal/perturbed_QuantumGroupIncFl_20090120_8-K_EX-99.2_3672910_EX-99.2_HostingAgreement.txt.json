                "changed_text": "\"Direct Access Storage\" or \"DAS\" means data storage devices that are generally associated with servers.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides a clear, technical specification. The modified definition replaces \"directly attached\" with \"generally associated with\", creating ambiguity. Under typical IT standards, direct-attached storage has an extremely precise definition involving a direct physical link that is now weakened, making the term open to interpretation and potentially leading to disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Technical standard definitions in IT; though not codified as law, contradict accepted industry practices and could affect contract performance.",

IBM does not make any representation or warranty with respect to Customer's responsibilities set forth in Section 11.6.

                "explanation": "By replacing 'error-free operation' with 'rectify all insufficiencies', the obligation to correct all defects is removed, creating contradiction. 'Defects' have clearer implications regarding service quality, whereas 'insufficiencies' is vaguer and gives IBM more leeway in what it chooses to address.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'is a minimum of' to 'aims for' significantly weakens the SLA guarantee. The original language creates a clear contractual obligation, while the changed language introduces a goal rather than a guaranteed minimum. This introduces ambiguity in enforcement.",

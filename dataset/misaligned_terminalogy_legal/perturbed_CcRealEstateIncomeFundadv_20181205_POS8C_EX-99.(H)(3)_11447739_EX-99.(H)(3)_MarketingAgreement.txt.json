                "original_text": "WHEREAS, the Distributor wishes to retain S2K, through registered representatives of S2K (\"Authorized S2K Representatives\"), to introduce the Funds to registered representatives of broker-dealers and registered investment advisers located at the financial institutions (each, an \"Intermediary\" and collectively, \"Intermediaries\") that may have customers interested in investing in a Fund.",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, the Distributor wishes to retain S2K, through registered representatives of S2K (\"Authorized S2K Representatives\"), to introduce the Funds to anyone expressing interest, whether or not they are registered representatives, at any location, regardless of financial institutional affiliation (each, an \"Intermediary\" and collectively, \"Intermediaries\") that may have customers interested in investing in a Fund.",
                "explanation": "The original text restricts S2K's marketing efforts to registered representatives at financial institutions, aligning with regulatory requirements for securities marketing. The modified text broadens the definition of 'Intermediary' to include anyone interested and removes location/institutional restrictions. This creates ambiguity and potential violation of securities laws, which mandate specific qualifications and oversight for those marketing investment products.",

                "changed_text": "S2K will market the Funds to Intermediaries that: (a) are considered 'sales agents' based on their own subjective criteria, regardless of registration status with the SEC, FINRA, or any other applicable jurisdiction, and registration will be optional;",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the requirement for intermediaries to be registered broker-dealers. By using the vague term 'sales agents' and making registration optional, the modified text creates a legal contradiction that could lead to non-compliance with securities regulations. Registered broker-dealers are subject to specific regulatory oversight and compliance requirements that 'sales agents' are not.",

S2K's responsibility will be on its own assessment only, with no mandatory certification requirement from the Distributor.",
                "explanation": "This alteration removes the requirement for S2K to adhere to applicable rules and regulations when performing distribution-related activities and eliminates the certification requirement. This directly opposes regulatory requirements that ensure distribution activities comply with securities laws and are properly documented. The contradiction introduces uncertainty about compliance and could lead to regulatory violations.",

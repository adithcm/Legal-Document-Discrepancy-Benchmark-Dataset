                "explanation": "The original contract states that the pagers are offered with 'no activation fee', while the modified text introduces a 'mandatory activation surcharge'. This is contradictory because a fee and a surcharge are the same thing and cannot both be zero and mandatory.",

The purchased airtime shall be refundable to the consumer under extreme circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that purchased airtime is 'non-refundable'. The modified text then states that the airtime 'shall be refundable to the consumer under extreme circumstances'. This creates a contradiction as to whether or not the airtime is refundable and under what conditions.",

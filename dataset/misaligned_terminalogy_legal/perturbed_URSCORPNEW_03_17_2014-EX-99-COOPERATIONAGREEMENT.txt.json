                "original_text": "In accordance with the Company's By­Laws and Delaware law, the Company agrees that, effective as of the next meeting (the \"March Board Meeting\") of the Board of Directors of the Company (the \"Board\"), which shall be held not later than March 27, 2014, and prior to taking any other formal action at such meeting, the Board will:\n\n(1) increase the size of the Board to fourteen (14) members; and\n\n(2) appoint Diane C. Creel, William H. Schumann, III, David N. Siegel and V. Paul Unruh (together, the \"JANA Nominees\") (other than in the case of the refusal or inability of any such person to serve, in which case, the Board shall appoint his/her substitute chosen in accordance with Section 3(c)) as Company directors to fill the vacancies created thereby and to have the same rights of participation in all other matters undertaken at the March Board Meeting as the other Company directors; provided, however, that as a condition to the appointment of each JANA Nominee, such JANA Nominee shall have completed and executed the Company's 2014 Questionnaire for Potential Director Nominees and the Director Nominee Representation and Agreement, provided that such documents have not been amended in any material respect from the versions provided to JANA prior to the date of this Agreement, and have agreed to comply with all policies, codes of conduct, confidentiality obligations and codes of ethics applicable to all of the Company's directors, including the Company's Code of Business Conduct, to provide the information regarding themselves that is required to be disclosed for candidates for directors and directors in a proxy statement under the federal securities laws of the United States of America and/or applicable New York Stock Exchange rules and regulations, and to provide such other customary information as reasonably requested by the Company; and provided, further that any JANA Nominee may participate in the March Board Meeting telephonically if unable to attend in person.",

Creel, William H. Schumann, III, David N. Siegel and V. Paul Unruh (together, the \"JANA Nominees\") (other than in the case of the refusal or inability of any such person to serve, in which case, the Board shall consider his/her substitute chosen in accordance with Section 3(c)) as possible Company advisors to fill the vacancies created thereby and to have similar rights of participation in some other matters undertaken at any special Board Meeting as the other Company directors; provided, however, that as a condition to the consideration of each JANA Nominee, such JANA Nominee shall have completed and executed the Company's 2014 Questionnaire for Potential Director Nominees and the Director Nominee Representation and Agreement, provided that such documents have been amended in some material respect from the versions provided to JANA prior to the date of this Agreement, and have only tentatively agreed to comply with some policies, codes of conduct, confidentiality obligations and codes of ethics applicable to some of the Company's directors, potentially including the Company's Code of Business Conduct, to possibly provide the information regarding themselves that is required to be disclosed for candidates for directors and directors in a proxy statement under any possible securities laws of Delaware and/or applicable stock exchange rules and regulations, and to provide no other customary information as reasonably requested by the Company; and provided, further that any JANA Nominee may only participate in the March Board Meeting telephonically and unable to attend in person.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will' to 'may', 'increase' to 'maintain or increase as it sees fit,' and other adjustments to the wording, the obligation to follow Delaware Law is lessened. The original contract clearly establishes the process for Board nomination that adheres to Delaware law. The modified version uses softer terminology, creating ambiguity and potential misalignment with established procedures for director appointments and compliance requirements for disclosures.",

                "changed_text": "(d) During the Cooperation Period, JANA might consider that all shares of the Company's capital stock (\"Shares\") debatably owned, seemingly directly or indirectly, by it, or by some of its Affiliates or Associates (potentially including all Shares arguably owned as of the loosely defined record dates for the 2014 Annual Meeting and as of the record dates for some special meeting of shareholders) over which it may exercise or have some voting authority, to maybe be present for quorum purposes and to maybe be voted, at those meetings or at some adjournments or postponements thereof, in favor of past, current, or future members of any Board (including those potentially considered 'JANA Nominees') and to not submit any proposal for discussion at, or bring any other trivial matter before, the 2014 Annual Meeting or initiate or participate in some vaguely defined \"withhold\" campaign with respect to board of director positions at the 2014 Annual Meeting and may later permit some of its Affiliates or Associates to do some of the aforementioned and publicly or privately encourage or support any other vaguely connected stockholder to take any such actions.",
                "explanation": "By inserting weakening language such as 'might consider,' 'debatably owned,' 'seemingly,' and 'arguably owned,' the original, clear commitment for JANA to vote shares in a specific way is obscured. The change introduces significant ambiguity, rendering the voting commitment uncertain and unenforceable, which contradicts the intent of this section.",

                "explanation": "By removing the link to the SEC's Rule 12b-2, the contract discards established regulatory definitions for 'Affiliate' and 'Associate.' This alteration introduces uncertainty because these terms are commonly understood through their legal definitions within securities law. Redefining them by subjective interpretation will create ambiguity in determining who is bound by the agreement's restrictions, potentially leading to misapplication of securities regulations.",

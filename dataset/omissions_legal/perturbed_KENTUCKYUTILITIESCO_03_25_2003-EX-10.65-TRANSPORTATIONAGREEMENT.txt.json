                "original_text": "Transporter shall bill and shipper shall pay all rates and charges in accordance with Articles V and VI, respectively, of the General Terms and Conditions of the FERC Gas Tariff.",
                "changed_text": "Transporter shall bill and shipper shall pay all rates and charges as determined by Transporter.",
                "explanation": "The original text ensures billing adheres to FERC Gas Tariff, protecting the shipper from arbitrary charges. Removing this and granting the transporter unilateral control over billing violates consumer protection principles embedded in FERC regulations, designed to ensure fair and transparent pricing in interstate gas transportation. This creates a legal risk in Kentucky, where consumer protection laws require adherence to regulated tariffs.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be subject to all applicable and lawful governmental statutes, orders, rules and regulations and is contingent upon the receipt and continuation of all necessary regulatory approvals or authorizations upon terms acceptable to Transporter. This Agreement shall be void and of no force and effect if any necessary regulatory approval is not so obtained or continued. All Parties hereto shall cooperate to obtain or continue all necessary approvals or authorizations, but no Party shall be liable to any other party for failure to obtain or continue such approvals or authorizations.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be subject to governmental statutes and regulations as determined solely by Transporter. All Parties hereto shall cooperate to obtain necessary authorizations, but no Party shall be liable to any other party for failure to obtain such approvals.",
                "explanation": "By removing the condition that governmental statutes, orders, rules, and regulations must be 'lawful' and the regulatory approvals or authorizations must be upon 'terms acceptable to Transporter' and that the agreement is voided 'if any necessary regulatory approval is not so obtained or continued' and adding that the regulations are to be determined solely by the Transporter introduces ambiguity and allows Transporter to potentially disregard regulations unfavorable to them. This may contradict Kentucky law requiring adherence to lawful regulations in business contracts, creating legal risk.",

                "original_text": "In addition to the warranties set forth in Article IX of the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Shipper warrants the following:\n\n(a) Shipper warrants that all upstream and downstream transportation arrangements are in place, or will be in place as of the requested effective date of service, and that it has advised the upstream and downstream transporters of the receipt and delivery points under this Agreement and any quantity limitations for each point as specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto. Shipper agrees to indemnify and hold Transporter harmless for refusal to transport gas hereunder in the event any upstream or downstream transporter fails to receive or deliver gas as contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n(b) Shipper agrees to indemnify and hold Transporter harmless from all suits, actions, debts, accounts, damages, costs, losses and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising from or out of breach of any warranty by Shipper herein.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines specific warranties made by the Shipper, limiting their indemnity obligations. The modified version removes these specific warranties and broadly requires the Shipper to indemnify the Transporter for all liabilities arising from performance under the agreement, even if not due to the Shipper's fault. This shifts significant risk to the Shipper and potentially contradicts Kentucky's principles of fair contracting and liability, creating a legal risk by potentially violating consumer protection tenets against unconscionable contract terms.",

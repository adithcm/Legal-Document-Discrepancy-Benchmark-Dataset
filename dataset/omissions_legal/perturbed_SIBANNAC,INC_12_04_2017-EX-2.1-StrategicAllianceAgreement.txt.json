                "original_text": "COMPANY shall indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of COMPANY or breach of COMPANY of any of its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "COMPANY shall indemnify Bravatek for any damages directly caused by a breach of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provided a broad indemnification for Bravatek, covering various costs and liabilities arising from COMPANY's actions, including attorney's fees. The modified version severely restricts this indemnification to 'damages directly caused by a breach,' removing coverage for negligence, intentional misconduct, third-party claims, and attorney's fees. This omission contradicts the general principle that parties are responsible for their negligence or intentional misconduct that causes harm to others. This creates significant legal risk for Bravatek, especially in states like Texas and Arizona where negligence laws could expose them to uncovered liabilities. Moreover, by removing attorney's fees, it violates the principle of 'make whole' remedies where the injured party is put back in the financial position had the breach not occurred.",

                "changed_text": "Bravatek's indemnification is limited to the extent of insurance coverage for any potential third-party claim.",
                "explanation": "The original clause ensured a broad indemnification from Bravatek to COMPANY, encompassing damages, costs, attorney's fees, and liabilities linked to negligence or breach. The modified version limits this to 'the extent of insurance coverage', drastically reducing Bravatek's financial responsibility. This omission violates the general legal principle that a party is responsible for its actions, even beyond insurance limits. It places a significant financial burden on COMPANY if Bravatek's negligence results in damages exceeding the insurance policy limits. This presents substantial legal risk within the jurisdictions of Texas and Arizona, potentially resulting in uncovered expenses for COMPANY due to Bravatek's misconduct. Also, if there is no insurance, then no indemnification will occur.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states that Texas law governs the interpretation of the agreement. The modified version removes this specific reference, instead stating that 'principles of contract law' will apply. This omission introduces ambiguity and potentially deprives parties of the protections offered by Texas-specific statutes and case law. While 'principles of contract law' provide a general framework, they may not cover specific issues addressed by Texas law, such as statutory consumer protections or specific rules regarding contract interpretation. The changed text exposes the agreement to varying interpretations, potentially undermining legal certainty.",

                "changed_text": "The Contractor may furnish statements, reports, and information to the Paying Agent as it deems necessary.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies a mandatory provision of information to the Paying Agent as dictated by the Paying Agent Agreement, which is a standard requirement to ensure proper financial oversight and compliance. By changing 'shall' to 'may,' the obligation becomes discretionary, which can lead to non-compliance with regulatory requirements for financial reporting and transparency, particularly in dealings with securities and payments. Making the provision of information optional removes a legally implied safeguard that ensures accountability.",

The Contractor agrees that it shall pay all sums, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs incurred by the Company, in defense of, by final judgment or decree, or in settlement of any suit or claim asserted or assessed against, or incurred by, any of the Company Indemnified Parties on account of such infringement or violation, provided that the Company Indemnified Parties involved shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Contractor and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom; provided, however, that the Company Indemnified Parties may, at their own cost, participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides a strong indemnification by the Contractor, including defense against suits and coverage of reasonable attorney's fees. The modified clause significantly weakens this protection by limiting indemnification to 'direct' claims. This eliminates the obligation to defend against suits, potentially leaving the Company to bear significant legal costs upfront. It also removes the protection for officers, directors, employees, and affiliates, narrowing the scope of the indemnification. This introduces a legal contradiction because intellectual property law holds companies accountable for infringements by their agents, and failing to protect these agents weakens the overall safeguard.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of any action to enforce or interpret this Agreement, attorneys' fees and costs may be awarded at the discretion of the court.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that the prevailing party in any enforcement action is entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. The modified clause changes this mandatory provision to a discretionary one, stating that such fees 'may' be awarded at the discretion of the court. This introduces a legal risk because it removes a guaranteed right to recover legal expenses, potentially discouraging parties from enforcing the agreement. Such a change could contradict state laws that favor awarding attorney's fees to a prevailing party in certain contract disputes, undermining the original intent to provide a clear and enforceable agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by state, but many states have laws or established legal principles favoring the awarding of attorney's fees to the prevailing party in contract disputes to ensure equitable enforcement.",

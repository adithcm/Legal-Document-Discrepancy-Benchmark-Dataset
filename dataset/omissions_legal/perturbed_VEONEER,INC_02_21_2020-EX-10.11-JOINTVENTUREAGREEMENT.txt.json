                "explanation": "By changing the governing law from Japan to Sweden, Article 3 introduces potential legal risks and contradictions. While both countries have established legal systems, their specific consumer protection laws, contract enforcement mechanisms, and dispute resolution processes differ. This alteration could potentially void or negatively impact consumer rights if the original agreement provided protections under Japanese law that are not available under Swedish law, or if the involved parties are located in different jurisdictions from Sweden.",

This may contradict laws which mandate the protection of company directors and officers from liabilities incurred during their tenure, and the removal of excluding indemnifying resigning directors could contradict laws regarding corporate governance and liability.",

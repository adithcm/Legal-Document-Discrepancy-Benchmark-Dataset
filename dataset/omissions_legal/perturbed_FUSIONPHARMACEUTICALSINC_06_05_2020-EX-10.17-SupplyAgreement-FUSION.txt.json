                "original_text": "CPDC hereby provides a limited product warranty, and accordingly does warrant for each Batch, that the Product shipped will (i) conform with the Specifications, (ii) be manufactured, tested, processed, packed and prepared for shipment in accordance with cGMPs, and (iii) be free from defects in material and workmanship for the period from the date of manufacture to the expiry date set out on each Unit of Product packed and prepared for shipment.",
                "changed_text": "CPDC provides a limited product warranty that the Product shipped will conform with the Specifications.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit warranty that the product will be manufactured and tested according to cGMPs (Current Good Manufacturing Practices) and free from defects. By omitting these guarantees, the contract weakens consumer protections that are mandated by regulatory authorities like Health Canada for pharmaceutical products manufactured in Canada. This introduces potential liability for FUSION if the products are not manufactured to the required standards.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in the performance of its activities as contemplated by this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'and to require its Affiliates and Sublicensees to comply' limits the responsibility for ensuring compliance to the primary parties themselves, which can be a violation of laws requiring oversight of affiliates and sublicensees, particularly concerning import/export regulations and intellectual property protection. This omission creates a loophole that potentially exposes the company to liability if its affiliates or sublicensees violate applicable laws. The deletion of 'including, but not limited to, import/export restrictions, laws, rules and regulations governing use and patent, copyright and trade secret protection' makes the clause less specific and reduces the legal commitment to these critical areas.",

This omission is a critical violation of Canadian law, as these records are essential for demonstrating adherence to legally mandated safety and manufacturing standards. By not requiring CPDC to maintain these records, FUSION is exposed to significant legal risk related to regulatory non-compliance.",

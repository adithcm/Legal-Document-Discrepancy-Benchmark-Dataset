                "explanation": "By removing sections of the original text, the warranties are significantly weakened. Specifically, deleting 'the Ehave Companion Solution will substantially conform to and operate in accordance with, and have the functions and features set out in, the Specifications, and any related documentation provided by Ehave, and any such documentation shall be complete and accurate in all material respects; and the Ehave Companion Solution will not contain any material undocumented feature;' removes the guarantee that the solution will meet its specifications. The omission of the terms 'industry standard', 'timely, professional and workmanlike manner' and 'adequate' reduces the level of care the company must display. The original text offered some consumer protection which is being legally contradicted with the edits.",
                "contradicted_law": "The edits create a legal risk of violating consumer protection laws in Ontario, as well as breach of contract due to non-performance. The edits weaken consumer rights, which introduces legal risk.",

This alteration could be seen to go against the implied warranty of merchantability, potentially violating consumer protection laws related to product performance and fitness for purpose.",

                "explanation": "By removing the term of maintaining the policies one year after the termination of the agreement, the time period of the coverage is unclear. By deleting 'comprehensive' and the 'minimum coverage of $1,000,000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate for product liability and completed operations, including death, and property damage, including loss of use;' and 'with an insured limit of at least $1,000,000 in the aggregate.' significantly weakens the insurance requirement. This creates a legal contradiction with provincial laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts for commercial contracts.",

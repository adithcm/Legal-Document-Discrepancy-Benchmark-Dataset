The retention of monies shall only be to the extent that the reasonable anticipated deductions exceed the anticipated accounts receivables. At the end of the Withholding Period, Contractor shall remit to the Company the retained monies less any deductions charged by Customers against Company's Products. After the Withholding Period, Company will remain liable to Contractor for any additional audits, deductions, rebates, credits, allowances or other adjustments taken by the Customers against the Company's Products.",

At the end of the Withholding Period, Contractor shall remit to the Company the retained monies less any deductions charged by Customers against Company's Products.",
                "explanation": "Removing the limitations on the amount of money retained and deleting the liability clarification after the withholding period unfairly disadvantages the Company. Many jurisdictions limit the ability of service providers to retain funds indefinitely without clear justification. By removing 'reasonable anticipated deductions exceed the anticipated accounts receivables' and 'After the Withholding Period, Company will remain liable to Contractor for any additional audits, deductions, rebates, credits, allowances or other adjustments taken by the Customers against the Company's Products.', the agreement violates the implicit covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most US contract laws. This allows the contractor to retain excessive amounts without recourse.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause 'and in an amount satisfactory to Contractor' allows for the insurance coverage to be arbitrarily determined. Also, the removal of 'All insurance coverages are to be placed with insurers which have a Best's rating of no less than \"A.\" and 'Such insurance requirements shall be maintained during the Term and shall continue for a minimum of three years following termination of this Agreement.' lowers the standard.

Specifying the location and rules of arbitration, limits of arbitrator power and providing jurisdictional consent, and methods of service are key in arbitration clauses. Removing these increases the risk of an unfair or unenforceable arbitration process. This would contradict standard legal practice for enforceable arbitration agreements.",

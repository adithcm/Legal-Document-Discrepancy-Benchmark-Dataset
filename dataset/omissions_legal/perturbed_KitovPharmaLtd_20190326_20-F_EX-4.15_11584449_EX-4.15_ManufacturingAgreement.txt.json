In the event that a defect is not apparent upon visual inspection during the shelf life of the Product (\"Hidden Defect\"), Kitov shall use commercially reasonably best efforts to provide Dexcel with written notification within thirty (30) Working Days of discovering the same, to be accompanied by samples of any such allegedly defective Product, if such samples are available In the event of any failure by Kitov to provide Dexcel with written notification of any such shortfall, Apparent Defect or Hidden Defect within the respective aforementioned periods, it shall be deemed as Kitov having accepted the relevant consignment.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for samples of defective products and extending the notification period, the burden on the manufacturer is reduced, while the consumer (Kitov) loses some of its rights to claim defects. This could violate the Israeli Sale Law, 5728-1968, which requires a prompt notification of defects.",

At the time of entering this Agreement, each Party shall be fully insured and shall duly maintain such insurance during the term of this Agreement and thereafter for so long as it customarily maintains insurance for itself for similar products and activities. Each Party shall provide the other Party with proof of such insurance upon request. Each Party shall cause such insurance policies to provide that the other Party shall be given at least thirty (30) days' notice of any cancellation, termination or change in such insurance.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific coverage details and minimum coverage amounts weakens the insurance requirements. This could fail to meet the standards of reasonable care expected under Israeli tort law, potentially leaving Kitov under-insured for product liability claims arising from Dexcel's manufacturing defects. This may make the contract non-compliant.",

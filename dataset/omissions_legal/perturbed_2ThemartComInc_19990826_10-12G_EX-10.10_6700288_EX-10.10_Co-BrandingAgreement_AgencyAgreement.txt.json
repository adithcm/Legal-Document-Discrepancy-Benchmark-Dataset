Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
                "changed_text": "6.7 SERVICE STANDARDS. i-Escrow will comply with most laws and regulations. Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement appear to conflict with any law, its rules or regulations, the terms of this agreement shall prevail. i-Escrow will give 2TheMart notice of such conflict; however, i-Escrow's interpretation will be accepted.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for i-Escrow to strictly adhere to California Escrow Law and subordinates it to the agreement's terms. This violates California Financial Code Section 17000 et seq., as it weakens the protections afforded to consumers by escrow regulations.",

In addition to other remedies that may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2 [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT], 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.",

                "explanation": "By removing the word 'materially,' any minor breach, even administrative ones, can lead to termination. This undermines the legal principle that breaches must be significant to warrant contract termination, contradicting common law principles governing contract breaches and good faith dealing. It creates a clause that could be deemed unconscionable.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the phrase \"EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH OF SECTION 11\" from the limitation of liability clause means that even if one party breaches the confidentiality agreement (Section 11), they are still shielded from liability for special, incidental, or consequential damages.

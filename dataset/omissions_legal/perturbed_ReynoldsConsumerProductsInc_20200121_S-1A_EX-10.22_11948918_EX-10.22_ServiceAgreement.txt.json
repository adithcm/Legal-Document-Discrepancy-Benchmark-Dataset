                "original_text": "Section 9.5 Insurance. Each Party shall obtain and maintain, for the Term (i) commercial general liability insurance with a single combined liability limit of at least $5,000,000 per occurrence, (ii) workers compensation/employer's liability insurance with a liability limit of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence or, if greater, the statutory minimum, and (iii) \"all risk\" property insurance on a replacement cost basis adequate to cover all assets and business interruption Losses that a Party may suffer in connection with or arising out of this Agreement, subject to policy limits, and in the case of the policies described in clause (i) above, naming the other Party as an additional insured thereunder. Upon request, each Party shall provide the other Party a certificate of insurance as proof of insurance coverage.",

Each Party shall obtain and maintain, for the Term (i) commercial general liability insurance, (ii) workers compensation/employer's liability insurance and (iii) property insurance, subject to policy limits. Upon request, each Party may provide the other Party a certificate of insurance as proof of insurance coverage.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific liability limits for commercial general liability and workers' compensation insurance, the contract no longer mandates legally required minimum coverage. Also, the 'all risk' clause on property insurance is removed. The phrase 'may provide' weakens the obligation to provide proof of insurance, potentially violating Illinois state laws that require specific insurance coverage levels for businesses.",

If any Party discovers (a) any material breach of the Security Regulations or of the systems used to provide the Services or (b) any breach or threatened breach of the Security Regulations that involves or may reasonably be expected to involve unauthorized access, disclosure or use of the other Party's or its Affiliates' Confidential Information (each of (a) and (b), a \"Security Incident\"), such Party shall, at the cost of the Party responsible for the Security Incident, (i) promptly (both orally, if practicable, and in any event in writing) notify the other Party of the Security Incident and (ii) reasonably cooperate with the other Party (1) to take commercially reasonable measures necessary to control and contain the security of such Confidential Information, (2) to remedy any such Security Incident, including using commercially reasonable efforts to identify and address any root causes for such Security Incident, (3) to furnish full details of the Security Incident to the other Party and keep such other Party advised of all material measures taken and other developments with respect to such Security Incident, (4) in any litigation or formal action with third parties or in connection with any regulatory, investigatory or other action of any Governmental Authority and (5) in notifying the other Party's or its Affiliates' customers and Personnel and other persons of the Security Incident to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires prompt notification (orally and in writing if possible) of security incidents, including breaches of security regulations, unauthorized access, disclosure, or use of confidential information. It also mandates reasonable cooperation to contain the security of confidential information, identify root causes, provide full details, participate in litigation, and notify affected parties. The modified version removes the requirements for prompt notification, actions to control and contain the breach, efforts to find the root cause, full disclosure of details, and notification of affected parties. This omission significantly reduces the obligations of the party experiencing the security incident. This weakens compliance with data breach notification laws that require immediate action to mitigate damage and notify affected individuals and authorities in case of a data breach involving personal data.",

                "explanation": "By limiting acceptable forms of notice to email only, the contract eliminates options like personal delivery, fax, and registered/certified mail with return receipt. Additionally, removing the physical addresses creates ambiguity, making it challenging to serve legal notices that require a physical location. This can hinder the ability to properly notify a party of breaches or legal actions, potentially violating due process requirements and applicable rules of civil procedure, especially in Illinois where specific methods for serving legal notices are mandated by law.",

                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement, including its attachment and order acknowledgments under the Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between Distributor and NETGEAR with respect to the purchase, resale and distribution of the Products and is governed by the laws of the State of California except that body of law dealing with conflicts of law.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement, including its attachment and order acknowledgments under the Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between Distributor and NETGEAR with respect to the purchase, resale and distribution of the Products.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'is governed by the laws of the State of California except that body of law dealing with conflicts of law,' the contract becomes ambiguous about the governing law. This could lead to a situation where California consumer protection laws, which might favor the distributor, are not explicitly applied. This introduces legal risk as it omits a clear statement ensuring the application of California law, potentially weakening the distributor's legal position under California's consumer protection statutes.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without prior written permission from the other party, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any attempt by either party to assign any right, or delegate any duty or obligation which arises under the Agreement without such permission will be voidable.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be assigned by either party with written permission from the other party. Any attempt by either party to assign any right, or delegate any duty or obligation which arises under the Agreement without such permission will be voidable.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,' the contract allows either party to arbitrarily deny assignment requests. This introduces a legal risk because California law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts. Unreasonable withholding of assignment permission could be construed as a breach of this covenant, potentially violating California contract law and harming the other party's business interests. The omission creates ambiguity and weakens the protection against arbitrary actions.",

                "original_text": "Neither party is liable for its failure or delay to perform its obligations under the Agreement due to strikes, wars, revolutions, acts of terrorism, fires, floods, explosions, earthquakes, shortages in labor, components or materials, government regulations, or other causes beyond its control.",
                "changed_text": "Neither party is liable for its failure or delay to perform its obligations under the Agreement due to causes beyond its control.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific examples of 'strikes, wars, revolutions, acts of terrorism, fires, floods, explosions, earthquakes, shortages in labor, components or materials, government regulations,' the force majeure clause becomes significantly less defined. While 'causes beyond its control' is still present, the omission of the enumerated events creates ambiguity. Under California law, ambiguous contract terms are often construed against the drafter (in this case, potentially NETGEAR). The distributor could argue that certain events, previously explicitly covered, are now not clearly excused, increasing NETGEAR's liability risk and potentially violating California's principles of contract interpretation.",

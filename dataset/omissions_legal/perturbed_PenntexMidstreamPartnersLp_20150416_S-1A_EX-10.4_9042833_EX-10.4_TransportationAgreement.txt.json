                "explanation": "This removes the consumer's right to dispute incorrect billing after delivery of the invoice. It eliminates the 24-month window for questioning invoices, potentially violating consumer protection laws that ensure fair billing practices and dispute resolution rights. This contradicts general contract law principles which ensure that the consumer is able to challenge unfair contract terms.",

                "original_text": "Consultant expressly agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, either directly or indirectly on his own behalf, or in the service or on behalf of others, solicit, divert or hire away, or attempt to solicit, divert or hire away any person employed by the Company for a period of five (5) years for any reason, and without limitation for the purpose of harming the Company or of obtaining and disseminating its trade secrets, or other proprietary and confidential information. Consultant also expressly agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, either directly or indirectly on his own behalf, or in the service or on behalf of others, solicit, divert, or attempt to solicit or divert any customer, client, supplier or vendor of the Company for a period of five (5) years for any reason, and without limitation for the purpose of harming the Company or of obtaining and disseminating its trade secrets, or other proprietary and confidential information",
                "changed_text": "Consultant expressly agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, either directly or indirectly on his own behalf, or in the service or on behalf of others, solicit, divert or hire away, or attempt to solicit, divert or hire away any person employed by the Company for any reason.

                "explanation": "The removal of the phrase 'for a period of five (5) years' eliminates a key time limit, making the non-solicitation clause unreasonably broad. In California, non-solicitation agreements must be narrowly tailored and have reasonable time limits, otherwise they can be considered unenforceable restraints on trade under Business and Professions Code Section 16600. The removal of the clause specifying 'without limitation for the purpose of harming the Company or of obtaining and disseminating its trade secrets, or other proprietary and confidential information' broadens the restriction beyond legitimate business interests, making the non-solicitation clause overly restrictive.",

                "changed_text": "In any court action at law or equity that is brought by one of the Parties to this Agreement to enforce or interpret the provisions of this Agreement, each party will bear its own legal fees.",
                "explanation": "By stipulating that each party will bear its own legal fees, the contract eliminates the prevailing party's right to recover attorney's fees. In California, while parties can contractually agree to waive attorney's fees, this can disproportionately harm the consultant (TruckThat LLC), especially if they are a smaller entity. This alteration might be challenged under unconscionability arguments if it significantly disadvantages one party. Eliminating this section creates risk because California law often implies a right to attorney's fees in certain types of disputes, and this clause attempts to explicitly waive that right without proper consideration of fairness.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall continue indefinitely.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specified term of six months, the contract creates ambiguity and potential unenforceability. California law requires contracts to have reasonably definite terms. Removing a defined term introduces uncertainty and makes it challenging to determine the parties' obligations over time. This ambiguity could violate the requirement for definiteness in contract formation, rendering the entire agreement vulnerable to legal challenge.",

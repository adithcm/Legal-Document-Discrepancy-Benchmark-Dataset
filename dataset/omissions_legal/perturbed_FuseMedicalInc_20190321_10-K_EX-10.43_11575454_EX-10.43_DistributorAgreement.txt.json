                "explanation": "By removing 'except for any warranty or guarantee which cannot be excluded under law' from section 2.4(c), the distributor is now prohibited from providing any warranty, even those legally mandated. This violates consumer protection laws, such as implied warranty laws, that exist in most US states, including Texas where CPM Medical Consultants, LLC is located. This introduces a legal risk as it restricts consumer rights.",

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence 'The Supplier shall add the distributor to their current insurance certificate,' the contract no longer explicitly requires the Supplier to include the distributor on its insurance policy. This weakens the distributor's protection in case of product liability claims and contradicts the general principle of product liability law, which requires manufacturers to bear responsibility for defects. Moreover, without being added to the Supplier's insurance, the Distributor will be completely liable to any claims arising from damages in the event that a Supplier is unable to defend them due to bankruptcy or other extenuating circumstances.",

The Supplier may provide a copy of the insurance policy to the Distributor on request.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall' to 'may' in two places and removing the minimum insurance amount of 'AU$10 million', the obligation on the supplier to maintain product liability insurance is weakened. The minimum amount insures the liability of the client, and its removal causes a consumer protection law violation. This omission undermines the distributor's financial protection and is in contradiction with expectations under product liability laws for adequate coverage.",

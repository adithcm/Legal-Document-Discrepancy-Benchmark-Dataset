                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from New Jersey to Delaware could adversely affect consumer rights. New Jersey has consumer protection laws. Delaware's laws might be less consumer-friendly in certain aspects, such as product liability or warranty enforcement. This change introduces legal risk by potentially limiting the consumer's ability to seek remedies under New Jersey law, where Integra's principal place of business is located.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 'NOTWITHSTANDING' clause expands the limitation of liability to *all* breaches, including those related to confidentiality and intellectual property. This creates a legal contradiction if New Jersey law mandates certain remedies for breaches of confidentiality or IP rights (which it does).

Integra may offset all costs and expenses covered under (i) above against the Fees as provided in Section 2.2 (c) as its sole and exclusive remedy for the recovery of such costs and expenses.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the final sentence 'Integra may offset all costs and expenses covered under (i) above against the Fees as provided in Section 2.2 (c) as its sole and exclusive remedy for the recovery of such costs and expenses.' eliminates the clarification that the offset of fees is the *sole and exclusive* remedy for patent infringement indemnification. By removing the 'sole and exclusive' language, the contract becomes ambiguous and potentially opens Integra up to additional liabilities beyond the fee offset, contradicting the initial intent. While seemingly minor, this omission could expose Integra to higher legal risks depending on how a court interprets the indemnification clause in the absence of this explicit limitation. This would lead to additional damages awarded, creating a contradiction with the original language and intent of the agreement.",

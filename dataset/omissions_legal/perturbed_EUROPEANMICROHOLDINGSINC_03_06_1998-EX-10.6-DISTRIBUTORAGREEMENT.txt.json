                "original_text": "WGT will permit Distributor and end-users purchasing\nthrough resellers to return any defective Product in accordance with the\nlimited warranty contained in the applicable end-user license agreement or\nlimited hardware warranty, as applicable, provided that the Distributor and\nend-user have compiled with the applicable warranty terms and conditions.",
                "changed_text": "WGT may, at its discretion, permit Distributor and end-users purchasing through resellers to return any defective Product. The terms and conditions for any such return will be determined solely by WGT.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the legally required consumer right to return defective products under warranty, making it subject to WGT's discretion. The original clause refers to a 'limited warranty' implying some warranty exists, but this is weakened. This violates consumer protection laws within the European Union which require distributors to accept returns of defective goods under warranty.",
                "contradicted_law": "EU Consumer Rights Directive (Directive 2011/83/EU) Article 16 - specifically relating to warranty rights for defective products.",

Payment\nof such finance charges will not excuse or cure Distributor's breach or\ndefault for late payment. If WGT retains a collection agency, attorney or\nother person or entity to collect overdue payments, all collection costs,\nincluding but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees, will be payable by\nDistributor.",
                "changed_text": "Any amount not paid when due will be subject to finance charges. If WGT retains a collection agency, attorney or other person or entity to collect overdue payments, collection costs may be payable by Distributor.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the specific interest rate (or the legally capped rate) and weakens the obligation to pay collection costs. The original clause sets a cap on interest rates (1.5% or maximum legal). Removing this violates usury laws. Removing 'including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees' weakens the obligation of the distributor and is very ambiguos, which might be contradicted with the European Laws.",

                "original_text": "WGT will defend and indemnify Distributor against any\njudicial proceeding based upon infringement of any U.S. patent or US.\ncopyright by the Product to the extent that such proceeding arises from or\nin connection with a component of the Product manufactured or developed by\nWGT and not any third party, provided that Distributor notifies WGT of such\nproceeding promptly after Distributor receives notice thereof, WGT has\ncontrol over the defense and settlement of the proceeding, Distributor\nprovides such assistance in the defense and settlement of the proceeding as\nWGT may reasonably request, and Distributor complies with any settlement or\ncourt order made in connection with such proceeding (e.g., as to the future\nuse of any infringing Product). WGT's obligations under this paragraph will\nnot apply to any infringement to the extent arising out of any use or\ncombination of the Product with any other products, goods, services or\nother items furnished by Distributor or anyone other than WGT or to any\nmodification or change of the Product not made by WGT.",
                "changed_text": "WGT may, at its discretion, defend and indemnify Distributor against any judicial proceeding based upon infringement of any U.S. patent or US. copyright by the Product. WGT's obligations under this paragraph will not apply to any infringement.",
                "explanation": "This change transforms a mandatory indemnification into a discretionary one and greatly restricts that indemnification. The original clause offers indemnification under specific conditions. Removing the mandatory nature and limiting the scope to exclude 'any infringement' effectively nullifies the protection, potentially violating EU laws regarding product liability and distributor protection where WGT is responsible for the product design.",

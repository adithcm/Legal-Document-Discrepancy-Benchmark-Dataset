                "original_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, Contractor shall maintain workers compensation insurance in the amount required by statute, comprehensive general liability insurance with coverage of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000) and professional errors and omissions insurance for bodily injury, property damage or other losses with coverage of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000), in connection with the provision of Services by Contractor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. At Company's request, Contractor shall provide Company with certificates or other acceptable evidence of insurance or self-insurance evidencing the above coverage and shall provide Company with prompt written notice of any material change.",

At Company's request, Contractor shall provide Company with certificates or other acceptable evidence of insurance evidencing the coverage.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirements for (1) workers compensation insurance in the amount required by statute (2) specific coverage amounts for general liability and professional errors and omissions insurance, and (3) prompt written notice of any material change. Arizona Statute 23-902 mandates workers' compensation insurance. The removal of these specifics makes the contract non-compliant and increases the company's risk by potentially leaving them underinsured. Furthermore, the removal of 'prompt written notice of any material change' eliminates a crucial aspect of verifying that adequate insurance coverage is maintained, making it harder to ensure compliance with Arizona law throughout the agreement's term.",

                "explanation": "By removing the exclusion 'EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACTOR'S OBLIGATIONS PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH 9 HEREOF', the limitation of liability now encompasses the contractor's indemnification obligations. In Arizona, as in many jurisdictions, certain indemnification clauses, especially those related to gross negligence or willful misconduct, may not be enforceable if they completely absolve a party of responsibility. This omission creates a legal risk by suggesting that even if the contractor acts with gross negligence, their liability is capped at the fees paid, potentially violating public policy and Arizona law regarding the enforceability of exculpatory clauses in contracts.

                "explanation": "The phrase 'COMPANY AND CONTRACTOR HEREBY WAIVE ANY CLAIM TO AWARD OF ATTORNEYS FEES IN SUCH A SUIT' has been removed. Arizona Revised Statute 12-341.01 allows for the award of reasonable attorney fees to the successful party in any contested action arising out of a contract, meaning the parties can be awarded attorney fees under certain circumstances. By removing the explicit waiver, the contract now fails to clarify the parties' intention regarding attorney fees, potentially leading to disputes and contradicting the expected application of Arizona law. This omission makes the agreement less protective of either party.",

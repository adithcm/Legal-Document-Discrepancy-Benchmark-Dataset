Any disputes arising under or in connection with the validity, interpretation and performance of this Agreement that cannot be resolved amicably by the parties shall be settled in arbitration before a single arbitrator. If arbitration fails to render a mutually agreement resolution the Courts of the State of Florida will be deemed to have jurisdiction. In addition to all other remedies provided in this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to all costs and expenses reasonably incurred as a result of said breach, including arbitration and court costs, and reasonable attorney's fees.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'legal fees' from the indemnification clause significantly weakens the protection offered to the 'Innocent party.' This omission introduces a legal risk as it deviates from standard indemnification practices, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing by denying the Innocent Party full recovery of their losses, and contradicting general legal principles of indemnification in Florida. This limits the Innocent party to only being able to reclaim the other fees for the court process but not the legal advising part.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase '(v) is required to be disclosed by law, government regulation, or court order' from the exceptions to the confidentiality agreement introduces a legal contradiction. Under Florida law and general legal principles, parties cannot contract to keep information confidential if a valid court order or law requires its disclosure. By omitting this exception, the contract attempts to override legal mandates, placing TKCI in a potential position of violating legal requirements if forced to disclose information. This creates a conflict with legal precedence and statutes regarding mandatory disclosure.",

                "original_text": "CBC undertakes, at its sole cost and expense, to take out and maintain an \"All risk\" insurance against loss of and destruction or damage to the Facility (including fire, theft and vandalism, etc.), third party liability insurance, product liability insurance for the Bromelain SP and employers liability insurance. Without prejudice to the above, CBC shall maintain, or shall cause to be maintained with respect to itself and each of its Affiliates, such types and levels of insurance (including, without limitation, third party and product liability insurance), as are customary in the pharmaceutical or manufacturing industry to provide coverage for their activities contemplated hereby. Upon request of MediWound, CBC shall keep MediWound informed of the general parameters of its liability insurance program and any proposed substantive changes therein. Upon request, CBC shall furnish MediWound certification of insurance (and/or true copies of policies) showing the above coverage, signed by an authorized agent of the insurance company, certifying that liability assumed under this Agreement is fully insured without exception, and providing for at least thirty (30) days prior written notice.",
                "changed_text": "CBC may, at its discretion, obtain insurance against loss of and destruction or damage to the Facility, third party liability insurance, product liability insurance for the Bromelain SP and employers liability insurance. CBC shall inform MediWound of its insurance program if MediWound requests such information. CBC may furnish MediWound certification of insurance policies.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates specific insurance types and requires CBC to maintain such insurance. It also mandates providing proof of insurance. The modified version makes insurance optional (\"may\"), weakens the obligation to inform MediWound, and removes the requirement for providing proof of insurance and advanced notice. This contradicts the principle of ensuring financial responsibility and consumer protection.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of product liability and risk management, potentially violating requirements under New York law (specified in section 15.1) that require reasonable measures to ensure product safety and financial responsibility in case of damages caused by defective products. Insurance requirements are also often mandated by banking and financial regulations in New York.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement is made under and subject to the provision of the laws of the Republic of China, without giving effect to its conflict of law rules.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from New York to the Republic of China could impact consumer protections and remedies available to MediWound. New York law generally provides more robust consumer protections than the laws of the Republic of China in areas like product liability, intellectual property, and contract enforcement. The change could reduce MediWound's ability to effectively pursue claims related to defective products, breaches of contract, or intellectual property infringement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Changing the governing law effectively weakens the protections afforded by New York law to MediWound, potentially violating fundamental principles of contract law that ensure parties have adequate remedies for breach of contract and product liability.",

                "original_text": "Any disputes relating to this Agreement of whatever nature that cannot be resolved by negotiation between the parties shall be referred for final resolution to arbitration in New York City by 3 (three) Arbitrators under the Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties and their legal successors. The arbitrators may at their discretion, provide for discovery by the parties not to exceed 4 (four) months from the date of notice of arbitration and the arbitrators shall notify the parties of their decision in writing within 30 (thirty) days of the completion of the final hearing. The arbitrators may at their discretion award costs and expenses in respect of the arbitration.",
                "changed_text": "Any disputes relating to this Agreement of whatever nature that cannot be resolved by negotiation between the parties shall be subject to the discretion of Challenge Bioproducts Corporation Ltd.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates arbitration in New York City under the rules of the American Arbitration Association, ensuring a neutral and structured dispute resolution process. The modified version gives Challenge Bioproducts Corporation Ltd. (CBC) sole discretion over dispute resolution, effectively removing MediWound's right to an impartial arbitration process. This violates the principle of fairness and equity in contract law, as it allows one party to unilaterally decide how disputes will be resolved. Under New York law, such a clause would be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable, as it creates an unfair advantage for CBC and deprives MediWound of a meaningful remedy.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change directly contradicts principles of contract law and due process, potentially violating provisions under New York law related to fair dispute resolution and unconscionable contract terms.",

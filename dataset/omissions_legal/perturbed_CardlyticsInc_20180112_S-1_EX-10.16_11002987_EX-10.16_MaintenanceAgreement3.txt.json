This could be problematic if state laws require clear and conspicuous disclosure of the software's function or specific consumer rights related to its use, potentially creating a legal contradiction if such rights are not adequately addressed elsewhere in the contract.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'and the exchange of such good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,' the contract weakens the acknowledgement of consideration. While not always strictly enforced, the absence of this acknowledgement could potentially weaken the enforceability of the contract under certain state contract laws (e.g., in states where a clear record of consideration is required for valid contracts). This is a legal contradiction because a valid contract requires consideration, and removing the acknowledgement of it creates ambiguity. This is relevant in Georgia where Cardlytics is located.",

                "original_text": "The Parties have established and maintain standards, policies, and/or guidelines (\"Policies\") applicable to lawful and ethical conduct when conducting their business activities. Upon written request, a Party will provide to the other Party a copy of, or electronic access to, such Policies. The Parties agree to comply with such Policies when conducting activities under this Agreement. These Policies pertain to, but may not be limited to, gifts/entertainment/and other things of value and drugs and alcohol. These Policies are communicated to the Parties' employees, along with an expectation that the employees will comply with these Policies.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties agree to comply with their own internal business standards and policies when conducting activities under this Agreement. These Policies pertain to gifts, entertainment, and drugs and alcohol.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement to provide the other party with access to the business standards and policies and weakens the commitment to ethical conduct. This omission introduces a potential conflict with laws mandating transparency and ethical conduct in business relationships, especially concerning conflicts of interest and anti-corruption measures. Omitting the promise to provide access to the policies reduces the check and balance on business conduct and introduces a legal risk.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in the United States, and similar laws in other countries, which emphasize the importance of ethical conduct and transparency in business dealings.",

                "original_text": "All actions by each Party related to this Agreement will comply with applicable laws and regulations. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision will be interpreted or applied so as to require a Party or its Affiliates, to do, or to refrain from doing, anything which would constitute a violation of, or be penalized by, any applicable laws and regulations or result in a loss of economic benefit under such laws or regulations.",
                "changed_text": "All actions by each Party related to this Agreement will generally comply with applicable laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"will comply\" to \"will generally comply\", the contract introduces ambiguity regarding legal compliance. The omission of the 'notwithstanding' clause further weakens the commitment to full legal compliance. This may violate regulations that require strict adherence to the law, as it creates room for interpretation and potential non-compliance. Omitting the clear compliance standard creates legal risk.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varying national, state, and local laws across jurisdictions mandating strict compliance with laws and regulations. For example, environmental regulations or safety standards.",

Such books, records and accounts will be maintained for a period of at least three (3) years following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, provided there are no pending disputes between the Parties. In the case of a dispute, the books, records, and accounts will be maintained for one (1) year following resolution of such dispute.",
                "changed_text": "FCE will keep books, records, and accounts containing information related to amounts payable to FCE under this Agreement. Such books, records and accounts will be maintained following the termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This removes the requirements for compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), removing the requirement to include all information necessary to determine amounts payable, and the explicit retention periods for financial records. This omission creates risks related to accounting transparency and compliance with financial regulations, such as those enforced by the SEC, and introduces ambiguity. The lack of GAAP compliance and specified retention periods increases the potential for financial misrepresentation or the inability to resolve financial discrepancies due to loss of records.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and related accounting standards which require accurate and transparent financial record-keeping and reporting.",

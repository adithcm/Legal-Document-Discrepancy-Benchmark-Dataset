Operator shall cause Owner (and such additional parties as Owner designates in writing) to be named additional insured(s), must be written as primary policy not contributing to or in excess of any policies carried by the Owner, and each contain a waiver of subrogation endorsement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Owner, in favor of the Owner.",

                "explanation": "The removal of specific insurance limits and the advance notice requirement introduces a legal risk. Delaware law typically mandates specific minimum insurance coverage amounts for businesses, and a lack of proper coverage can lead to legal and financial liabilities. The cancellation notice requirement is also removed, exposing the owner to potential risks with lack of coverage.",

Delaware law stipulates that the Owner should be able to utilize the training materials effectively if they have invested in them.

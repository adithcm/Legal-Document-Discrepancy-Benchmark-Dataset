                "original_text": "In the event that any party to this Agreement has any claim, right or cause of action against any other party to this Agreement, which the parties shall be unable to settle by agreement between themselves, such claim, right or cause of action, to the extent that the relief sought by such party is for monetary damages or awards, shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), through the adjudication by a single arbitrator, in New York, New York, with the decision of such arbitrator to be final and binding upon all parties.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that any party to this Agreement has any claim, right or cause of action against any other party to this Agreement, which the parties shall be unable to settle by agreement between themselves, such claim, right or cause of action, to the extent that the relief sought by such party is for monetary damages or awards, shall be determined by arbitration at Tadeo's discretion. If arbitration is chosen, it will be in accordance with internal rules and adjudicated by an arbitrator selected by Tadeo in New York, New York, with the decision of such arbitrator to be final and binding upon all parties.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement to use the American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules and allows Tadeo to choose an arbitrator. This could lead to a biased arbitration process, contradicting the principles of fair and impartial dispute resolution often required by consumer protection laws, especially concerning mandatory arbitration clauses. By giving Tadeo sole discretion, it removes the consumer's right to a neutral arbitration process.",

                "changed_text": "Diplomat shall be responsible for all fees, costs, and expenses of any arbitration, including Tadeo's legal fees. ",
                "explanation": "Shifting all arbitration costs to Diplomat deters them from pursuing legitimate claims, violating fair practice laws. This contradicts regulations against contract terms that discourage consumers from exercising their rights.",

                "changed_text": "Each party shall make reasonable efforts to comply with laws and regulations applicable to its activities under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply in all respects' to 'shall make reasonable efforts to comply' weakens the obligation to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations. This creates a loophole where a party can avoid full compliance by arguing that they made 'reasonable efforts,' even if those efforts were insufficient. This contradicts the legal requirement to fully comply with all relevant laws and regulations, potentially harming the consumer.",

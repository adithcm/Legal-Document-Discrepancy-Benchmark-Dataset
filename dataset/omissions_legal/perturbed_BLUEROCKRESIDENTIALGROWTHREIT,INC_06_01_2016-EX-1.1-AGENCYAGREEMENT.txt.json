The Transaction Entities and each of their respective Subsidiaries are insured by insurers with appropriately rated claims paying abilities against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are prudent and customary for the businesses in which they are engaged; all policies of insurance and fidelity or surety bonds insuring the Transaction Entities, their respective Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, assets, employees, officers and directors are in full force and effect; neither of the Transaction Entities nor any of their respective Subsidiaries has been refused any insurance coverage sought or applied for; neither of the Transaction Entities nor any of their respective Subsidiaries has any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a similar cost as currently paid, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; and the Company has obtained or will obtain directors' and officers' insurance in such amounts as is customary for companies engaged in the type of business conducted by the Company.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the requirements of insurance with 'appropriately rated claims paying abilities,' 'such amounts as are prudent and customary,' and any guarantees of renewal or similar coverage. This weakens the obligation to maintain adequate insurance, creating a legal risk under Maryland law, where companies have a duty to exercise reasonable care and diligence in managing their assets, including insurance coverage.",

Except as described in the Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and except as would not reasonably be expected to result, singly or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect, neither of the Transaction Entities nor any of their respective Subsidiaries (and, to the knowledge of the Transaction Entities, no tenant or subtenant of any Property or portion thereof owned or leased by the Transaction Entities or their respective Subsidiaries) is in violation of any Environmental Law, including relating to the release of Hazardous Materials, and there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Transaction Entities, threatened administrative, regulatory or judicial actions, suits, demands, claims, liens, notices of noncompliance, investigations or proceedings relating to any such violation or alleged violation. There are no past or present events, conditions, circumstances, activities, practices, actions, omissions or plans that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any costs or liabilities to the Transaction Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries under, or to interfere with or prevent compliance by the Transaction Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries with, Environmental Laws, except as such would not have a Material Adverse Effect and would not have a material adverse effect on a Property or a prospective acquisition property described in the Prospectus, or any of their respective operations, financial results or value. There are no costs or liabilities associated with Environmental Laws (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up, closure of properties or compliance with Environmental Laws or any permit, license or approval, any related constraints on operating activities and any potential liabilities to third parties) that would, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.",

There are no significant costs or liabilities associated with Environmental Laws.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the environmental compliance clause. Replacing the detailed assurance of compliance with a vague 'aim to comply' introduces ambiguity and reduces accountability. Removing the language regarding specific actions, suits, claims, and potential liabilities creates a loophole. This omission contradicts the legal obligations under federal and state environmental laws in Maryland and Delaware, where the companies are incorporated.",

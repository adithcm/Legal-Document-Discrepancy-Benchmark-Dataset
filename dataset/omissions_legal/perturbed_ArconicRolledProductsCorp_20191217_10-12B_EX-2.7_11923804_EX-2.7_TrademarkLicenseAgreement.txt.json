                "original_text": "Licensee shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Licensor and its officers, directors, employees, agents, corporate subsidiaries, parents, and affiliates (\"Licensor Indemnitees\") from and against any and all demands, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments, deficiencies, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees and expenses), incurred in conjunction with or arising out of or relating to any third-party claim concerning the Licensed Products and any acts or omissions of Licensee with respect to the Licensed Mark, including without limitation Licensee's performance of its obligations under this Agreement. The Licensor Indemnitees agree to cooperate with Licensee, at Licensee's expense, to provide copies of any documents or materials reasonably requested by Licensee in support of its defense of the Licensor Indemnitees.",

The Licensor Indemnitees agree to cooperate with Licensee to provide copies of documents requested by Licensee in support of its defense of the Licensor Indemnitees.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'defend' significantly weakens Licensor's protection. The removal of 'hold harmless' also reduces the protection. The phrase 'any and all demands, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments, deficiencies' is replaced with a shorter text to weaken protection and limit the scope of indemnification. The exclusion of 'reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees and expenses' shifts a substantial financial burden onto Licensor in the event of a claim, potentially deterring them from pursuing legitimate legal recourse. The removal of 'at Licensee's expense' removes the responsibility from Licensee, creating financial burden on Licensor.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware law requires indemnification clauses to be clear and unambiguous and can be unenforceable if they are overly broad or vague. By removing specificity regarding the scope of expenses covered and weakening the obligation to defend, the clause becomes less clear and could be challenged in court, especially if it imposes undue hardship on the indemnifying party. Although there's no specific statute mandating indemnification, the changes impact common law principles regarding fair and reasonable contractual terms.",

                "changed_text": "Licensor represents and warrants to Licensee that Licensor's performance of its obligations under this Agreement is not in conflict with any other contract to which Licensor is a party.",
                "explanation": "This significantly reduces the scope of the warranty. By removing 'instrument, rule of law or order of any court or governmental agency to which Licensor is a party or by which Licensor is bound,' the Licensor is no longer warranting that their performance doesn't violate any laws, court orders, or other legal obligations. This omission creates a legal risk for the Licensee, as they could be held liable if the Licensor's performance of the agreement violates a law or court order.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract. By significantly reducing the scope of the warranty, especially concerning compliance with laws and regulations, the Licensor potentially violates this implied covenant. If the Licensor's actions under the agreement violate a law, the Licensee could argue that the Licensor breached this covenant by failing to disclose potential conflicts or ensure compliance.",

                "changed_text": "EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHT OF TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT.",
                "explanation": "The omission of 'TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW' suggests that the waiver applies regardless of legal restrictions, which may not be enforceable and could mislead a party. Removing 'PROCEEDING, CLAIM, OR COUNTERCLAIM...OR ANY MATTER ARISING HEREUNDER' narrows the scope of the waiver. Some states have specific requirements for jury waiver clauses to be conspicuous and knowingly made. Removing the phrase 'TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW' could make the waiver less enforceable if it violates those requirements. A party might argue they didn't understand the waiver applied to all potential legal actions related to the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware law generally upholds jury waivers if they are knowing and voluntary. However, if a party can demonstrate they did not fully understand the implications of the waiver (especially due to the removal of limiting language), a court might refuse to enforce it. Furthermore, narrowing the scope of the waiver could leave some types of legal actions subject to jury trial, creating uncertainty.",

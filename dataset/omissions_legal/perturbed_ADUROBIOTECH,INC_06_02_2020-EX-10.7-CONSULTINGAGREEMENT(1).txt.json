                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Consultant may have access to, or learn, \"material non-public information\" about Aduro or companies working with Aduro during the course of performing Services under this Agreement. Consultant acknowledges that it is illegal to buy or sell Aduro's stock or the stock of companies working with Aduro, on the basis of \"material non-public information.\" It is also illegal to pass such information on to others who use it to buy or sell Aduro stock. Consultant is subject to and will comply with Aduro's Insider Trading and Trading Window Policy.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant may have access to, or learn, \"material non-public information\" about Aduro or companies working with Aduro during the course of performing Services under this Agreement. Consultant acknowledges that it may be inappropriate to trade on material non-public information. Consultant will adhere to company guidelines related to insider trading.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states the illegality of insider trading and mandates compliance with Aduro's Insider Trading Policy. The modified text weakens this by stating it 'may be inappropriate' and only requires adhering to 'company guidelines'. The complete removal of the explicit acknowledgement of the illegality of insider trading and the specific mention of compliance with Aduro's Insider Trading and Trading Window Policy introduces legal risk. This conflicts with SEC regulations and California law regarding insider trading, which holds individuals accountable for trading on material non-public information, regardless of whether the company policy explicitly outlines the illegality.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with principles of contract law.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific reference to California law, the contract becomes vague about the governing jurisdiction. This omission creates uncertainty and potential legal risk. California law provides specific consumer protections and regulations that would apply if the agreement is explicitly governed by California law. Removing this clause allows Aduro to potentially argue for a more favorable jurisdiction in case of disputes, potentially depriving the consultant of legal protections afforded under California law.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Consumer Rights Laws",

                "original_text": "In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to entry of injunctive relief. Such injunctive remedy shall be nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any and all other remedies which may be available to it at law or in equity, including without limitation, the recovery of direct, indirect, incidental, consequential and/or punitive damages.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to remedies.",
                "explanation": "This change omits the specific mention of injunctive relief, direct, indirect, incidental, consequential and/or punitive damages, weakening the remedies available to Aduro in case of a breach of the non-solicitation clause. Removing 'injunctive relief' is the most significant change, as it allows the consultant to potentially continue the breach without immediate legal intervention. By omitting the different kinds of damages, the consultant's risks are lowered.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600, which governs the enforceability of non-solicitation agreements under California law.",

                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder. As used in this Section 4, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder. As used in this Section 4, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.",
                "explanation": "By removing the exception for 'willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence,' the contract attempts to shield the Sponsor from liability even in cases of egregious misconduct. This contradicts the basic fiduciary duties required of investment advisors under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which requires a higher standard of care.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Sponsor.",
                "explanation": "Removing the Board of Trustees' ability to terminate the agreement significantly reduces investor protection. The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that fund advisory agreements be terminable by the fund's board (representing shareholders) to ensure proper oversight. Omitting this right violates that principle and weakens the board's governance role.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the requirements for trustee approval of subcontractors and retaining liability for their actions, the agreement removes essential safeguards for the Trust. The Investment Company Act of 1940 emphasizes the board's role in overseeing fund operations and protecting shareholder interests. Removing the approval process for subcontractors increases the risk of unqualified or negligent service providers, potentially violating the board's oversight responsibility.",

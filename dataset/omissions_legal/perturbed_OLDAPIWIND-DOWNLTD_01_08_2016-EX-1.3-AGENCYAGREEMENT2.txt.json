                "original_text": "immediately prior to offering the Securities to persons in the United States, we had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe that each such person was an Accredited Investor, based upon a pre-existing relationship, and, on the date hereof, we continue to believe that each such offeree purchasing Securities from the Corporation is an Accredited Investor",
                "changed_text": "immediately prior to offering the Securities to persons in the United States, we believed that each such offeree purchasing Securities from the Corporation is an Investor",
                "explanation": "The removal of the 'Accredited Investor' qualification and the condition of having 'reasonable grounds to believe based upon a pre-existing relationship' weakens investor protections. U.S. securities laws, specifically Regulation D, require verification of accredited investor status to ensure investors have sufficient financial sophistication and resources. By omitting this requirement, the agency agreement fails to ensure compliance with Regulation D, potentially exposing the Corporation to liability for selling unregistered securities to unqualified investors. This is a violation of investor protection regulations.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'Directed Selling Efforts, General Solicitation', the agreement now allows for such actions, which contradicts the requirements for private placements under Section 4(a)(2) and Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933. These regulations prohibit general solicitation or advertising to ensure that the offering remains private and is only offered to qualified investors. Allowing directed selling efforts or general solicitation could lead to the offering being deemed a public offering, requiring registration with the SEC, which this agreement is trying to avoid.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'caused each such U.S. Subscriber to duly complete and execute' to 'may provide a Subscription Agreement' removes the mandatory requirement for U.S. subscribers to complete and execute a subscription agreement. Subscription agreements are critical documents that provide information about the investment, including risks and disclosures required by securities laws. By making the execution of the subscription agreement optional, the agreement fails to ensure that U.S. subscribers receive and acknowledge these crucial disclosures, potentially violating securities laws requiring informed consent and adequate risk disclosure.",

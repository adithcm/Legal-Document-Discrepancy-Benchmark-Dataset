                "original_text": "11.1 The execution, validity, interpretation, enforcement and dispute resolution of this Agreement shall be governed by the PRC Law.\n\n11.2 Any dispute, conflict or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the performance hereof shall be resolved by the Parties through amicable negotiation, which negotiation shall commence immediately upon notice by one Party to the other of the nature of such dispute, conflict or claim. In the event that such dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) Business Days following such notice, either Party may upon the expiration of the such 30-day notice period submit such dispute to arbitration by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the arbitration rules of such centre then in effect. The arbitration shall be conducted in Hong Kong in English and the arbitral award shall be binding upon both Parties. During the resolution (including the arbitration) of the dispute, the Parties shall continue to perform other portions of this Agreement unaffected by such dispute.",
                "changed_text": "11.1 The execution, validity, interpretation, enforcement and dispute resolution of this Agreement shall be governed by the PRC Law.\n\n11.2 Any dispute, conflict or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the performance hereof shall be resolved by the Parties through amicable negotiation. In the event that such dispute is not resolved, either Party may submit such dispute to a method of resolution of their choosing. During the resolution of the dispute, the Parties shall continue to perform other portions of this Agreement unaffected by such dispute.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies arbitration at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre as the mandatory dispute resolution mechanism if negotiation fails. The modified clause removes the mandatory arbitration clause and replaces it with a vague statement allowing either party to choose their method of dispute resolution. This omission removes the consumer's right to a pre-agreed upon method of dispute resolution, which may violate PRC laws requiring fair and transparent dispute resolution processes, potentially forcing smaller parties into expensive or unfair legal battles.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates the return or destruction of confidential information upon termination of the agreement. By removing the part relating to returning or destroying such confidential information, the modified clause fails to adequately protect Party A's business secrets after the agreement ends. This omission contradicts general principles of contract law and intellectual property protection under PRC Law which necessitate safeguarding trade secrets and confidential information even after termination of a business relationship, potentially leading to unauthorized use or disclosure of sensitive data.",

                "original_text": "8.1 Both Parties agree that any breach of any of the warranties, covenants, or provisions hereof by either Party shall constitute a breach of this  Agreement, except under circumstances described in Section 8.2 below. In the event of any breach of this Agreement by any Party  hereto, the breaching Party shall indemnify the other Party for all of such other Parties losses arising therefrom, which losses shall  include only direct losses, reasonable expenses and reasonable attorney fees.",

In the event of any breach of this Agreement by any Party  hereto, the breaching Party may, at their discretion, consider indemnifying the other Party for losses.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly stipulates that a breaching party *shall* indemnify the other party for losses (including direct losses, reasonable expenses, and attorney fees). The changed text alters this to state that the breaching party *may*, at their discretion, consider indemnifying the other party. This significantly weakens the protection for the non-breaching party, effectively removing their guaranteed right to compensation for damages caused by a breach of contract. This introduces a legal contradiction with fundamental principles of PRC Contract Law, which emphasizes the importance of fulfilling contractual obligations and providing remedies for breach of contract, thus negatively impacts Party A.",

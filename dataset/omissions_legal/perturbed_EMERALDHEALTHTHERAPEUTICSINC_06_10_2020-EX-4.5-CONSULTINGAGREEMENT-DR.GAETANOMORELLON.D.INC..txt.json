                "original_text": "Emerald shall not be obliged to deduct or retain from the Fees due to the Contractor, nor shall it be obliged to remit same to the required governmental authority, any amounts that may be required by law or regulation to be deducted, retained and remitted including, without limitation, Federal and Provincial or State Income Tax, Workers' Compensation and Pension Plan deductions and remittances. All such remittances and other payments are entirely the responsibility of the Contractor and the Contractor hereby indemnifies and saves Emerald and its Board members and officers harmless from any liability of any kind whatsoever that they may incur as a result of the Contractor's failure to make such remittances or payments.",

All such remittances and other payments are entirely the responsibility of the Contractor.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific mention of 'Federal and Provincial or State Income Tax, Workers' Compensation and Pension Plan deductions and remittances' and the indemnification clause, the contract attempts to shift the legal responsibility for these deductions entirely to the contractor, even though Emerald, as the payer, may still have legal obligations under Canadian law (given the Burnaby, BC address) to withhold and remit certain taxes and contributions. This creates a legal risk for both parties, as it may violate the Income Tax Act (Canada) and related provincial employment standards legislation. Specifically, by removing the indemnification and reference to workers compensation, the contractor is now responsible for that as an independent contractor.",

Each party to the Agreement represents to the other that it, he or she has sought independent legal advice or consciously chosen not to do so with full knowledge of the risks associated with not obtaining such independent legal advice.",
                "changed_text": "Each party to the Agreement acknowledges that they have the opportunity to seek legal advice with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit recommendation for each party to seek independent legal advice and the acknowledgement of the risks associated with not doing so, the contract weakens the protection for both parties, particularly the contractor. This could be problematic if one party later claims they did not understand the terms of the agreement and were not properly advised. While not a direct violation of a specific law, it weakens the enforceability of the contract and increases the risk of future legal disputes. This is contradictory to standard practice. In Canada there is always the oppurtunity to seek legal advice.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Canada, and the parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of courts in Canada.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specification of British Columbia law and BC courts, the governing law and jurisdiction become ambiguous. While still specifying Canadian law, the absence of a specific provincial law opens the door to disputes over which provincial laws apply (given the contractor's location in Vancouver, BC). The omission of 'appellate courts' further limits the recourse options. Contractual language needs to be precise. In this case, the original had precision, which is legally safer.",

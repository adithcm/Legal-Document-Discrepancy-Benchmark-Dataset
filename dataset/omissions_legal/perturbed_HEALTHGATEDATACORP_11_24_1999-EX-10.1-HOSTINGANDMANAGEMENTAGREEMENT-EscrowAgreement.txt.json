                "changed_text": "NCC's Liability\n\n      10.1  NCC's liability for any loss caused to the Owner or the Licensee is limited to the fees paid under this agreement.\n\n      10.2  NCC shall in no circumstances be liable to the Owner or the Licensee for indirect or consequential loss of any nature whatsoever whether for loss of profit, loss of business or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The original clause limits NCC's liability to Â£500,000 except for personal injury or death. The modified clause removes this specific liability limit and replaces it with a limit tied to fees paid, thereby greatly reducing potential recovery for negligence-related damages, especially for direct damages to the material. This contradicts the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (UCTA) in the UK, which restricts the extent to which liability for negligence can be limited or excluded, particularly concerning direct loss or damage caused by negligence in a business context. This change creates a significant legal risk for the licensee.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires the licensee to provide supporting documentation (6.2.1), a copy of the License Agreement (6.2.2) and a signed confidentiality undertaking (6.2.3) along with a statutory declaration to trigger the release of the material. The modified clause removes these requirements. Under UK law, specifically related to commercial contracts and escrow agreements, a reasonable level of proof and documentation is typically expected to prevent fraudulent or unsupported claims. Removing the requirements for supporting documentation, the license agreement copy, and the confidentiality agreement significantly lowers the burden of proof for the Licensee to trigger release, exposing the Owner to potential abuse and legal challenges. This creates a risk that the release could be triggered without sufficient evidence of a valid release event, which is a legal contradiction.",

                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "ITS Products are warranted free from defects of material or workmanship for 3 years after shipment from the manufacturer. Equipment purchased from ITS, which becomes defective within that time period will be repaired by ITS at its headquarters in San Antonio, Texas at no cost to COMWARE beyond cost of shipping the equipment to ITS. ITS will bear the cost of returning the item to COMWARE by UPS, REGULAR DELIVERY. priority shipping costs will be borne by COMWARE.",
                "changed_text": "ITS Products are warranted against defects of material or workmanship. Equipment purchased from ITS, which becomes defective will be repaired by ITS at its headquarters in San Antonio, Texas at a cost to be determined later. Shipping costs will be borne by COMWARE.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 3-year warranty and free repair (excluding shipping). The modified version removes the 3-year guarantee, introduces the potential for repair costs, and makes the customer responsible for all shipping fees. This introduces legal risk as it removes a specific, time-bound warranty and allows ITS to charge unspecified repair costs, potentially conflicting with implied warranty laws under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, which requires warranties to be clear and understandable.",

                "changed_text": "In the event that one of COMWARE'S customers has a problem, ITS will attempt to address the problem in a reasonable timeframe.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'without delay' clause, ITS can delay addressing product-related issues, potentially causing damage to COMWARE's reputation. Furthermore, removing the requirement to act 'in the best interest of customer service' weakens the commitment to resolving problems, violating potential implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under Texas contract law.",

                "changed_text": "ITS will attempt to deliver systems after a purchase order is received from COMWARE.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a delivery deadline of 30 days. The modification removes this deadline and replaces it with 'attempt to deliver', which is vague and unenforceable. This omission creates a legal risk as it violates the implied duty of reasonable diligence in contract performance under Texas law, as the lack of a specific delivery timeframe could be deemed commercially unreasonable.",

                "original_text": "Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Company possesses valuable know-how, proprietary, confidential and trade secret Information that has been procured or developed by the Company at great expense and that its unauthorized disclosure would result in substantial damages to the Company that may not be adequately compensated by monetary relief. Accordingly, Recipient hereby consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal and County Courts in Essex County, New Jersey and agrees that the Company may seek temporary restraining orders against it or other extraordinary relief necessary to protect the Information.",

Accordingly, Recipient hereby consents to the jurisdiction of the County Courts in Essex County, New Jersey.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the acknowledgement that unauthorized disclosure of confidential information would result in substantial damages that may not be adequately compensated by monetary relief. It also removes the agreement that the company may seek temporary restraining orders or other extraordinary relief. This omission weakens the company's ability to seek injunctive relief, potentially conflicting with trade secret laws that allow for such remedies. Injunctive relief is a standard remedy for trade secret misappropriation, and this clause attempts to limit that right.",

                "changed_text": "Recipient agrees to execute documentation necessary to assign the Company ownership of Intellectual Property.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'acknowledge and deliver any instruments, specifications or disclosures necessary to prosecute, protect, perfect or exploit', the contract significantly reduces the recipient's obligation to assist the company in defending and enforcing its intellectual property rights. The original obligation is broad, requiring the recipient to take any action necessary to protect the company's IP. The altered version limits this obligation to simply signing assignment documents. This may conflict with implied duties under assignment law to provide reasonable assistance in enforcing assigned rights.",

Recipient hereby grants to the Company power of attorney for the purpose of assigning all Recipient's rights in Intellectual Property to the Company for the purposes of filings, registrations and other formalities deemed necessary by the Company to prosecute, protect, perfect or exploit its ownership and interests in Intellectual Property.",
                "changed_text": "Recipient hereby assigns all Recipient's rights in any Intellectual Property to the Company.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the phrase \"agrees to assign\" weakens the contract's enforceability because it removes the forward-looking promise to assign future intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the removal of \"power of attorney\" limits the company's ability to act on the recipient's behalf to protect its intellectual property rights. This could conflict with laws requiring specific powers of attorney for certain legal actions related to intellectual property, especially regarding filings and registrations in various jurisdictions. The power of attorney provision ensures the company can act swiftly and efficiently to protect its IP, whereas the modified version requires the recipient's ongoing cooperation, which may not always be guaranteed.",

This could be seen as an attempt to evade liability for data breaches or service disruptions caused by MediaNet Group Technologies' negligence or security failures.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the 'implied warranties of MERCHANTABILITY', the contract removes a standard guarantee that the product is of acceptable quality and fit for its intended use. This directly contradicts consumer protection laws like the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which imply these warranties unless explicitly and conspicuously disclaimed. Removing this disclaimer creates a legal loophole where MediaNet Group Technologies might avoid liability for defective or substandard products.",

                "explanation": "By changing '30 days after termination of this Agreement' to 'immediately after termination of this Agreement', the contract now allows MediaNet Group Technologies to avoid paying the reseller for sales they generated if the contract is terminated, a common situation.

                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "13.8 Data Protection (Privacy) and Security.\n\n  13.8.1 Study Data Collection\n\nFMI shall collect and process Study Data in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and in compliance with Applicable Law with respect to the processing of Study Data, including but not limited to applicable international, US federal, state and local data protection and data security laws.",

                "explanation": "The omission of 'in compliance with Applicable Law with respect to the processing of Study Data, including but not limited to applicable international, US federal, state and local data protection and data security laws' removes the explicit requirement for FMI to adhere to data protection laws, such as HIPAA or GDPR if applicable. This introduces a legal risk, as it creates a loophole where FMI might not follow mandatory data protection standards.",

FMI shall assist and cooperate with Roche concerning any disclosures to affected parties and with any other remedial measures requested by Roche.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'government or regulatory agencies and with any other remedial measures...mandated by Applicable Law', the contract no longer requires FMI to report breaches to regulatory bodies as mandated by data protection laws, nor take required actions. This could potentially expose FMI to regulatory penalties for failure to comply with breach notification laws.",

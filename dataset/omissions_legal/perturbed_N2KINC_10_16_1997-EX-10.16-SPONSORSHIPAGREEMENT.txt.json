                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates that New York law governs the agreement. By changing this to Delaware law and removing the phrase 'and construed in accordance with,' and adding 'without regard to its conflict of laws principles,' the contract now potentially avoids specific consumer protection laws that New York mandates for online retail transactions, especially concerning data privacy and security. Delaware is often perceived as more business-friendly and less consumer-protective.",

Excite may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Sponsor, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect the records of Sponsor reasonably related to the calculation of such payments during Sponsor's normal business hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in connection with the inspection will be paid by Excite unless the payments made to Excite are determined to have been less than ninety percent (90%) of the payment owed to Excite, in which case Sponsor will be responsible for the payment of the reasonable fees for such inspection.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor will maintain records with respect to the calculation of all payments due under this Agreement. Excite may request records. All fees associated are the responsibility of Excite.",
                "explanation": "By omitting 'accurate' records, and the clause allowing Excite to hire an independent CPA to inspect records with costs borne by Sponsor if discrepancies are found, the contract weakens Excite's ability to verify payment accuracy. This introduces a legal risk as it could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, which are generally recognized under contract law, especially in financial transactions. Removing the requirement of 'accurate' records keeping is an omission that goes against normal business practices.",

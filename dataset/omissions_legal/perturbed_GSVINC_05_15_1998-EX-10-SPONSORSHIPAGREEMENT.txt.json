Once per year, the parties will review these records to\n            verify the accuracy and appropriate accounting of all payments made\n            pursuant to the Agreement. In addition, Excite may, upon no less\n            than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Client, cause an\n            independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect the records of\n            Client reasonably related to the calculation of such payments during\n            Client's normal business hours. The fees charged by such Certified\n            Public Accountant in connection with the inspection will be paid by\n            Excite unless the payments made to Excite are determined to have\n            been less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the payments actually\n            owed to Excite, in which case Client will be responsible for the\n            payment of the reasonable fees for such inspection.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a specific process for auditing the client's financial records, including yearly reviews and the option for Excite to hire an independent CPA. It also states the condition for who pays the fees for that CPA. By removing the detail and Excite having to give 30 days written notice, this removes accountability from Excite to the Client. This also removes the Client's right to verify that they are being charged accurately. This creates legal risk for Excite because there is no method of audit.",

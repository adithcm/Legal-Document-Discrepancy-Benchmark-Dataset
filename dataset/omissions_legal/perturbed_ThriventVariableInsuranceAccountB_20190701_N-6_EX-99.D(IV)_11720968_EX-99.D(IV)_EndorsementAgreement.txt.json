If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause that describes the consequences of not making the extra payment within 60 days eliminates a crucial consumer protection. Many states, including Wisconsin where Thrivent is located, have regulations regarding how insurance companies can handle unpaid debts related to solvency requirements. Specifically, charging interest compounded at 5% and retroactively applying it to reduce benefits without clear, legally compliant notification procedures could violate these regulations. The omission introduces legal risk by obscuring the full financial implications of non-payment.",

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence 'Benefits will not be reduced or eliminated by any future amendments to our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws,' the contract now implies that future amendments *could* reduce or eliminate benefits. This creates significant legal risk and contradicts the principle of 'reasonable expectations' in insurance contract law. Wisconsin law requires that insurance policies be interpreted in a way that fulfills the reasonable expectations of the insured. Allowing future, unspecified amendments to diminish benefits without policyholder consent violates this principle and introduces potential claims of bad faith.",

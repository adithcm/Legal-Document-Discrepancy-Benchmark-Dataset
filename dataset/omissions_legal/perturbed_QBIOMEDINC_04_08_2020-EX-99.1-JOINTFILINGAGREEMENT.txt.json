                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein and therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others. Timely filing of such amendments is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'Timely filing of such amendments is not guaranteed,' the agreement attempts to circumvent the legally mandated responsibility for timely filing of amendments required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This omission introduces legal risk because it creates ambiguity about the parties' obligations regarding timely compliance, potentially shielding them from liability for late filings, which is a violation of securities regulations.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the statement on Schedule 13G with respect to the equity securities of Q Biomed, Inc. is, and any amendment thereto signed by each of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the statement on Schedule 13G with respect to the equity securities of Q Biomed, Inc. is, and any amendment thereto signed by each of the undersigned may be filed.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be' to 'may be' removes the mandatory requirement to file amendments, contradicting Rule 13d-1(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which mandates the filing of amendments to Schedule 13G when certain ownership thresholds are met. This alteration weakens the legal obligation and potentially allows parties to avoid required filings, leading to non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "By stating a fixed one-year limitation period for all claims (except non-payment), regardless of the nature of the claim, the contract could violate Maryland law. Maryland law generally allows for a three-year statute of limitations for most civil claims. While parties can contractually shorten the statute of limitations, such clauses are often strictly construed, and a court might find that a one-year limitation is unconscionable, especially for claims involving latent defects or fraud discovered long after the event. Adding the additional phrase ensures the one-year limitation period does not apply to gross negligence or willful misconduct which ensures it will not violate state law.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' and adding 'at the discretion of the Court' significantly weakens the prevailing party's right to recover attorney's fees. While Maryland law generally allows parties to contract regarding attorney's fees, modifying 'shall' to 'may' could discourage parties, especially Axiometric, from pursuing legitimate claims, as it introduces uncertainty about recovering legal costs. This could be viewed as a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, especially if LKPL has significantly more resources to litigate. It could also be seen as unconscionable if it effectively prevents Axiometric from enforcing its rights due to the risk of incurring substantial unrecoverable legal fees.",

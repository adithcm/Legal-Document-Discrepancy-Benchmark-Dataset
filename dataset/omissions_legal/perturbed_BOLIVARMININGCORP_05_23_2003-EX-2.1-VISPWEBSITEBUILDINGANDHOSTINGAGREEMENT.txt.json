                "original_text": "24/7 \"800\" Number Customer Service / Tech Support $25.00 per month for private labeled service and Free for the first 90 days for generic service.  If the ISP does not have 250 users within the first 90 days we will charge $25.00 each month thereafter.",
                "changed_text": "Customer service and tech support will be provided during normal business hours, subject to availability and at rates to be determined by Provider.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the guarantee of 24/7 customer service and tech support, and introduces ambiguity about cost and availability. This creates a legal risk as it potentially violates consumer protection laws that require clear and reasonable access to support for services paid for. While the contract is between two businesses, the end-users are consumers, and failure to provide adequate support could lead to claims of unfair business practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates consumer protection laws related to fair and reasonable access to customer support in New York, and potentially Nevada where KCI is located. Specific laws include deceptive business practices acts.",

                "changed_text": "KCI's Customers will receive an initial VISP web site setup, maintenance of the site, and technical support. Storage space is subject to availability.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the guarantee of 5Mbs of storage space and replaces it with 'subject to availability'. This weakens the agreement, making it non-compliant with consumer protection laws that require the fulfillment of promised services, especially when those services are advertised as 'free' or included in the initial setup. Limiting storage without prior clear notice may cause financial implications for customers, potentially contravening consumer protection laws.",

                "original_text": "All questions regarding the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York.  Any controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement that has not been resolved through the informal mediation of the parties shall be resolved through arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect, as modified by the terms set forth below: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted in New York state; (b) the arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator selected by the parties; (c) the parties shall act in a commercially reasonable manner and speedily select and then conduct the arbitration within 45 days with the expenditure of minimal discovery efforts and expense which shall be determined, if necessary, by the arbitrator. The agreement to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable under prevailing New York law.  Any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be binding and enforceable by any party to the arbitration and judgment shall be rendered upon it in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in New York.",
                "changed_text": "All questions regarding the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York. Any controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration. The location of arbitration shall be determined by the Provider.",
                "explanation": "This clause originally mandates arbitration under AAA rules, which often include provisions for consumer protection and fairness. By removing the reference to AAA rules and giving the provider the sole right to determine the arbitration location, it weakens consumer rights. This creates a risk of violating consumer protection laws that require fair dispute resolution processes. The changed wording could be interpreted as an attempt to forum shop and impose unfavorable conditions on consumers. For example, Provider could impose Nevada, which would pose logistical and financial challenges for a customer in New York.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates consumer protection laws requiring fair dispute resolution processes. This may also violate laws regarding unconscionable contract terms in New York, as well as similar regulations in Nevada.",

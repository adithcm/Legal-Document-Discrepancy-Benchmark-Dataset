Each Party agrees to comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws arising from its obligations, if any, under the Agreement and to reasonably co-operate with the other Party in order to allow the other Party to comply with any laws as deemed necessary from time to time. Each Party shall treat all data, information relating to Services, including but not limit to the customer personal data, as confidential. Each party warrants that it shall take appropriate technical and organizational measures against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, the personal data of the other party.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the obligation to comply with 'all applicable' data protection laws and replaces it with a subjective standard of compliance 'as it deems necessary'. Also, it removes each party's warrant to take appropriate technical and organizational measures against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data. India has stringent data protection laws, including the IT Act, 2000 and upcoming Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, mandating specific security measures. Removing the commitment to 'all applicable' laws and security measures makes the contract non-compliant with these laws, as it allows parties to potentially disregard mandatory data protection requirements.",

INDEMNIFICATION\n8.1 PC Financial shall defend at its own expense and indemnify Mobimagic against any cost, loss or damage arising out of any claim, demand, suit or action (\"Action\") brought against Mobimagic by a third party to the extent that such Action is related to PC Financial's breach of this Agreement. Mobimagic will promptly inform PC Financial in writing of any such Action and will co-operate in the defence and/or settlement of the Action. PC Financial agrees that in negotiating any settlement, it shall act reasonably and shall obtain Mobimagic's prior, written consent which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n8.2 Mobimagic shall indemnify and hold harmless PC Financial and its officers, direct0l8 and Affiliates, (\"PCF Indemnified Parties\") against any cost, penalty, loss or damage arising out of or related to the Services, or Mobimagic's breach of this Agreement or applicable law.

                "explanation": "By removing the phrases 'at its own expense', 'Promptly inform PC Financial in writing' , 'PCF Indemnified Parties' and 'applicable law' and also omitting the clauses that protect against applicable laws, the contract shifts the financial burden of defence onto Mobimagic, eliminates the need for the financial service to be involved in the defense of PC Financial and also omits any penalties brought about due to the actions violating said laws. Under Indian Contract Act, 1872, Indemnification should cover all losses and breaches of all applicable laws. These deletions introduce legal risks, non-compliance and a shift in liabilities that would otherwise be indemnified.",

                "explanation": "This change significantly limits the liability of both parties by removing exclusions for indirect, exemplary, special, or incidental damages and removing the cap on total cumulative liability. Under Indian law, particularly the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, businesses can be held liable for various types of damages beyond direct consequential damages. Removing these exclusions and the liability cap could render the contract unenforceable in cases where the damages suffered by one party (especially PC Financial's customers) far exceed the fees paid under the agreement. This creates a legal risk and contradiction with consumer protection laws that aim to provide remedies for various types of harm.",

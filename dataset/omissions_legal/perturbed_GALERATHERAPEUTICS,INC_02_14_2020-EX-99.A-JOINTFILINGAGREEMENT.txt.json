                "changed_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto. ",
                "explanation": "By removing the clauses related to accuracy and completeness of information, especially the 'unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate' clause, the agreement weakens the obligation for each party to ensure the correctness of the filings. This could be a violation of securities laws like Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, which require accurate disclosure of information and prohibit misleading statements.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party,' the clause now lacks clarity and enforceability regarding the revocation process. This introduces ambiguity as to how revocation is to be communicated and its effective scope. Such lack of specificity might conflict with general contract law principles requiring clear communication of intent, and could potentially lead to disputes about whether proper notice was given for revocation. In Delaware, where Galera Therapeutics, Inc. is incorporated, courts emphasize clear contractual terms, and this omission could be seen as a weakening of investor protection.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \"Exchange Act\")' and 'of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto' weakens the explicit link and adherence to SEC regulations. This might not explicitly violate a specific section but obfuscates the legal grounding of the agreement. The explicit mention of Section 13 filings clarifies the legal basis, and its removal could be seen as an attempt to obscure their obligations under federal securities laws.",

                "original_text": "In the event of any recall with respect to Sponsor's products provided to the Concessionaire pursuant to this Agreement or the Concessions Agreement, Sponsor shall notify both Club and the Concessionaire immediately upon issuance of such recall, and Club may, at its sole discretion and without penalty, suspend the Benefits for a duration as reasonably determined by Club. Any costs or expenses incurred by Club or the Concessionaire with respect to any such recall shall be the sole responsibility of Sponsor.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of any recall with respect to Sponsor's products provided to the Concessionaire pursuant to this Agreement or the Concessions Agreement, Sponsor will attempt to notify the Club. Any costs or expenses incurred by Club or the Concessionaire with respect to any such recall shall be the the shared responsibility of the parties.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for immediate notification to both Club and Concessionaire upon a product recall and changing 'shall' to 'will attempt to', the contract weakens Sponsor's obligation to promptly address potential health and safety risks associated with recalled food products. Moreover, liability for expenses is changed from solely the Sponsor to shared among the parties. This introduces legal risk because food safety regulations (both state and federal) mandate prompt and comprehensive recall procedures to protect consumers. This attempts to shift costs from the party primarily responsible for the product, potentially violating consumer protection laws and regulations concerning product liability.",

Sponsor shall train Sponsor Staff or require Sponsor Staff to undergo training provided by Concessionaire. The staffing levels at each Stand shall be subject to Club's approval.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause establishing Sponsor's responsibility for managing and controlling its staff and their employment terms and modifying the staff training requirements introduces several legal risks. It weakens the Sponsor's accountability for compliance with labor laws (minimum wage, overtime, anti-discrimination) concerning Sponsor Staff. The staff management and training requirement alterations introduce ambiguity and could lead to liability issues if Sponsor Staff actions result in harm to consumers. This introduces a legal contradiction by potentially creating a loophole where the Sponsor could argue non-responsibility for labor law violations or negligence of its staff.",

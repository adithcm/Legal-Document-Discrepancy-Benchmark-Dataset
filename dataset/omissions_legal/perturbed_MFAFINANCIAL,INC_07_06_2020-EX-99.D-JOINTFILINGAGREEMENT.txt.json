                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing' could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent the mandatory filing requirements under the Securities Exchange Act. This omission weakens the enforceability of the agreement with regard to compliance with securities laws.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be executed in counterparts.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'in any number' and 'each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement', this weakens the legal certainty regarding the validity of multiple signed copies, creating a potential loophole to challenge the agreementâ€™s authenticity. Some jurisdictions require specific language to ensure that counterpart signatures are treated as original, which is now omitted.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific date 'as of July 6, 2020' introduces ambiguity regarding the agreement's effective date. This can impact the legal interpretation of the agreement, particularly concerning deadlines and triggering events tied to the agreement's commencement. The omission contradicts best practices in contract law which emphasize precise dating for clarity and enforceability.",

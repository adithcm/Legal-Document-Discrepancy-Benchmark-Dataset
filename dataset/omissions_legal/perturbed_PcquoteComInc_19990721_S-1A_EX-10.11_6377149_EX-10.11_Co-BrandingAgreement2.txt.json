(hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement. This Amendment shall apply to said PCQ and ABW. This agreement does not grant rights to subsidiaries or related companies.",
                "explanation": "By explicitly denying rights to subsidiaries and related companies, the modified text omits potential liabilities and responsibilities typically associated with parent companies and subsidiaries, potentially violating laws related to corporate liability and piercing the corporate veil. This is a legal contradiction, because generally a contract between a parent company should apply to the activities of the subsidiary.",

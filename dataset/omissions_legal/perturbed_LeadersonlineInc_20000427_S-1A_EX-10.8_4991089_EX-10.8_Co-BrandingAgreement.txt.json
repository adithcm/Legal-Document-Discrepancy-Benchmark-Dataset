                "original_text": "LeadersOnline shall limit contact with a Candidate to either one phone contact or one e-mail contact per calendar quarter, unless expressly agreed to by the Candidate.  LeadersOnline shall immediately cease all contact upon the request of the Candidate.",
                "changed_text": "LeadersOnline may contact Candidates as deemed appropriate for business purposes.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the restrictions on contacting candidates, potentially violating privacy laws and regulations regarding unsolicited communication and data protection (e.g., CAN-SPAM Act, GDPR if applicable to candidate data). The original text provided a measure of control to the candidate over contact, which is now removed.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"shall comply with all prevailing laws\" to \"shall make reasonable efforts to comply\", the contract weakens the obligation to adhere to legal requirements. This introduces a legal risk, as it implies that full compliance is not mandatory, potentially violating consumer protection laws or other regulations relevant to the services provided under the agreement. This could also conflict with regulations that require businesses to obtain necessary permits and approvals for their operations.",

                "changed_text": "LeadersOnline shall not now or in the future contest the validity of VerticalNet's ownership of its Intellectual Property.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'provided, however' clause, LeadersOnline waives its right to defend itself against claims of infringement or misappropriation by challenging the validity of VerticalNet's intellectual property. This could be seen as an unfair or unconscionable clause, especially if VerticalNet's IP rights are later found to be invalid. This creates a potential conflict with laws ensuring fair legal proceedings and the right to a defense.",

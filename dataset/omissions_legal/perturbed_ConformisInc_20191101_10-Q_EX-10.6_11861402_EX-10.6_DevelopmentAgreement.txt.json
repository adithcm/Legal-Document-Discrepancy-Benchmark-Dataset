Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) implies these warranties in contracts for the sale of goods, unless explicitly disclaimed. By removing 'STATUTORY', the contract now violates UCC requirements for warranty disclaimers, potentially exposing Conformis to liability for breach of implied warranties that would have otherwise been properly waived. The UCC requires such waivers to be conspicuous, and explicitly mentioning the warranties being disclaimed makes the waiver more easily proven to be conspicuous. This introduces legal risk.",

                "explanation": "This change omits the clause 'EXCEPT FOR [**]' which could refer to exceptions that prevent limitation of liability related to gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud. Many jurisdictions, including New York, do not allow parties to contractually limit liability for these types of actions.

                "explanation": "This modification omits '(without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof)' from the Governing Law section (10.7) and changes 'the federal and state Courts of New York State shall have exclusive jurisdiction' to 'the courts of New York State shall have jurisdiction', also deleting 'federal' from the later part. In New York, parties are generally free to choose the law governing their contract. However, explicitly excluding the conflict of laws provisions provides more certainty and predictability in the event of a dispute. Removing 'exclusive' and 'federal' jurisdiction combined with the conflict of laws clause increases the risk that a court in another jurisdiction might assert jurisdiction and apply its own laws, potentially undermining the parties' agreed-upon choice of New York law. This introduces ambiguity that New York law seeks to avoid.",

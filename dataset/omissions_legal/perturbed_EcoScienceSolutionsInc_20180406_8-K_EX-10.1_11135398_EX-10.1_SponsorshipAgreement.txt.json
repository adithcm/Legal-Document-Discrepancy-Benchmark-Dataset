                "changed_text": "Sponsors may obtain liability insurance at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "This removes the requirement for sponsors to maintain liability insurance with a specified limit. In Florida, where the agreement is governed, event sponsors or vendors are often required to carry liability insurance to cover potential damages or injuries. Removing the 'must have' and specific limit makes the contract non-compliant with standard event liability practices and could expose the promoter to greater risk.",

                "changed_text": "In case of a dispute, the parties agree to pursue Arbitration as the preferred method to seek a remedy.",
                "explanation": "This removes the waiver of the right to a jury trial. While arbitration is agreed upon, the explicit waiver of a jury trial is a significant consumer (or sponsor in this case) right. In Florida, the right to a jury trial is constitutionally protected, and any waiver must be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. Removing the explicit waiver introduces ambiguity and potential legal challenges, especially if one party later seeks a jury trial despite agreeing to arbitration initially.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'all other information which a reasonable person would consider to be confidential' significantly narrows the scope of what's considered confidential. This could lead to disputes over what information is actually protected, especially regarding proprietary business information or trade secrets not explicitly marked as confidential. Florida's trade secret laws, for example, protect a broader range of confidential information. This omission weakens the protection afforded to such information and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement to conform to Post Holding's Quality Expectations Manual (Schedule E) could lead to products being manufactured that do not meet minimum safety or quality standards required by law. This is a legal contradiction because it omits a key quality control measure, potentially violating consumer protection laws regarding product safety in California, where Premier Nutrition Corporation has a presence.",

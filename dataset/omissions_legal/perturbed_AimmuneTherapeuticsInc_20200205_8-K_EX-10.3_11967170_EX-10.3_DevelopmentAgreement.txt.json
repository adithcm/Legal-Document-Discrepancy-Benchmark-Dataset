Xencor shall have the right, upon [***] ([***]) days' prior written notice to Aimmune, to cause an independent, certified international public accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Aimmune or reasonably acceptable to its Affiliates or Sublicensees, as applicable, to audit such records during Aimmune's, or its Affiliate's or Sublicensees', as applicable, normal business hours to confirm the number of Product units sold, the gross sales and Net Sales of Product, the royalties payable, the method used to calculate the royalties payable, and the exchange rates used in accordance with Section 8.2. The audit shall be limited to pertinent records kept by Aimmune and its Affiliates and Sublicensees for any year ending not more than [***] ([***]) months prior to the date of the written notice. An audit under this Section 8.4 shall not occur more than [***] in any Calendar Year, except in the case of any subsequent \"for cause\" audit. The accounting firm shall disclose to Xencor only whether the reports are correct or incorrect and the specific details concerning any discrepancies. No other information shall be provided to Xencor. The accounting firm shall provide Aimmune with a copy of any disclosures or reports made to Xencor and Aimmune shall have an opportunity to discuss such disclosures or reports with Xencor and the accounting firm. Information, disclosures, or reports arising from any such examination shall be Confidential Information of Aimmune subject to the confidentiality and other obligations of ARTICLE 12. Prompt adjustments shall be made by the Parties to reflect the results of such audit.

                "explanation": "The modified clause removes key protections for Aimmune: the defined timeframe for audit access (limiting it to the Term), the requirement for a certified international public accounting firm, the specific details that the audit confirms (royalties, methods, exchange rates), the limitation on audit frequency, and the condition for Xencor to bear audit costs.  It **omits** 'complete and accurate records,' 'reasonable acceptability of the auditor to Aimmune', 'limitation of the audit records kept by Aimmune and its Affiliates and Sublicensees for any year ending not more than [***] ([***]) months prior to the date of the written notice', and 'except in the case of any subsequent \"for cause\" audit'.

Aimmune shall procure and maintain insurance, including clinical trials insurance and product liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations hereunder and which is consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated at all times during which the Product is being clinically tested in human subjects or commercially distributed or sold by Aimmune pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that any such clinical trials insurance coverage shall, prior to the First Commercial Sale of a Product, in no event be less than [***] Dollars ($[***]) per loss occurrence, and product liability insurance coverage shall, after such First Commercial Sale, in no event be less than [***] Dollars ($[***]) per loss occurrence.

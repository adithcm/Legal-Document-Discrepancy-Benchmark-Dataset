In this regarding, within thirty (30) days from the  execution of this Agreement, Bizzingo will secure an insurance policy with limits of $5,000,000 per event and $ 5,000,000 umbrella,  naming Theismann as an additional insured, covering the losses and claims stated in this sub-paragraph d.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for Bizzingo to secure a $5,000,000 insurance policy naming Theismann as an additional insured, the contract removes a significant financial protection for Theismann. If Bizzingo fails to secure such insurance, Theismann is more vulnerable to financial loss from claims. This creates a legal contradiction with general principles of corporate liability and duty of care, potentially exposing Theismann to uncovered losses if a claim exceeds Bizzingo's ability to pay, a standard insurance coverage that protects the consumer (Theismann in this case).",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of corporate liability and duty of care, as well as potential breaches of fiduciary duty if Bizzingo's negligence in maintaining adequate insurance harms Theismann.",

In this regard, Bizzingo agrees to provide  Joseph Theismann with at least thirty (30) days' written notice of any photographic sessions or public appearances to permit Theismann to  properly schedule the session or appearance. Bizzingo will pay all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by Theismann in connection with  such session or appearance which expenses shall not exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) per day unless Theismann receives prior written  approval from Bizzingo. For any travel incurred by Theismann as part of his appearances, Bizzingo will provide first class air travel and hotel  accommodations.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirements that Bizzingo provides at least thirty (30) days' written notice of any sessions or appearances and the limit of one thousand dollars for expenses introduces legal risk. By omitting the notice period, Theismann has less time to prepare, potentially impacting his reputation if he is unprepared. Also, the cap on daily expenses is gone, making Theismann to bear additional costs. This omission introduces a legal risk by contradicting the duty of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to a contract to act honestly and reasonably. It also removes a defined parameter which could lead to possible disputes, and potential financial repercussions for Theismann.",

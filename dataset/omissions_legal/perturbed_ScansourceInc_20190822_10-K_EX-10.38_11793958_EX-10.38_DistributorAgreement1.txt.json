                "original_text": "21.1 Distributor shall obtain all licenses, permits and approvals required by any government, including any recycling or take-back programs applicable to packaging or Products, and shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, policies and procedures and any requirements applicable to the importation, exportation, use, sale, loan, purchase, and distribution of Products under telecommunications, consumer rights related, environmental, labor, tax, and any other laws and regulations, of any government or other competent authority where the Products are to be sold, used or deployed (collectively \"Applicable Laws\").",

                "explanation": "This change omits the explicit mention of compliance with 'consumer rights related' laws, rules, and regulations, introducing a legal risk. This omission could potentially violate consumer protection laws in the United States, as the distributor is no longer explicitly bound by the contract to adhere to consumer rights-related regulations. In states like California, where robust consumer protection laws exist, this could lead to legal challenges.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'Distributor shall contractually require (in whatever manner Distributor deems appropriate) each such Reseller to provide such warranty and other terms to any End User to which the Reseller redistributes the Product.' weakens the end-user's warranty rights. This omission removes a provision that ensured end-users receive warranty information, potentially violating consumer protection laws requiring transparency.

Upon completion of II Deliverables, the Acceptance Tests shall be performed on the Subject Program in its entirety in order to determine whether the Subject Program (i) meets the Specifications and (ii) operates with internal consistency.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the clause stating that Deliverables must perform repetitively without failure and that the Subject Program operates with internal consistency weakens the acceptance criteria. This potentially contradicts implied warranty of merchantability under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which Washington State has adopted. By omitting the requirement for consistent and reliable performance, the contract allows for acceptance of software that may not be fit for its intended purpose, violating the UCC's implied warranty.",

Both the Client and the Designer both agree and acknowledge that this non-disparagement provision is a material term of this Agreement, the absence of which would have resulted in the Company refusing to enter into this Agreement.

                "explanation": "By removing the indemnification clause in the non-disparagement section, the contract fails to provide a remedy for breaches of the non-disparagement agreement. While non-disparagement clauses are generally enforceable, omitting any recourse for a party harmed by disparagement creates an imbalance and could be seen as unenforceable or against public policy, especially in jurisdictions with strong consumer protection laws. It also puts the client at greater risk should they disparage the developer. This creates a legal risk.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause specifying that the substantially prevailing party in a dispute will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees, the contract deviates from standard practice and may violate legal principles promoting access to justice. In many jurisdictions, including Washington, courts consider the ability to recover attorneys' fees when assessing the fairness and enforceability of contract provisions, particularly in consumer contracts. Removing this clause could be seen as deterring legitimate claims, particularly smaller ones, because the potential cost of litigation could outweigh the benefits, creating an imbalance and violating public policy principles of equal access to justice.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'all laws' to 'some laws' and removing the requirement to notify the Licensor, the contract introduces ambiguity and potentially allows the Licensee to selectively comply with regulations. In New York (the governing law), businesses are legally obligated to adhere to all applicable laws, especially in regulated industries like finance. This change introduces a loophole that could be interpreted as permitting non-compliance. Removing the notification requirement hinders oversight and enforcement of compliance.",

The Licensee further agrees to use the Licensed Mark in accordance with such quality standards as may be reasonably established by the Licensor and communicated to the Licensee from time to time in writing, or as may be agreed to by the Licensor and the Licensee from time to time in writing. The Licensee agrees to allow the Licensor to conduct reasonable inspection of the quality of the Licensee's services from time to time.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires reasonable effort to maintain the quality of the business and operations equal to the standards of both the licensor and licensee at the time of the agreement. This change weakens that requirement, removing the 'reasonable efforts' aspect, using the standard of the Licensee's businesses, and removing the reference to the Licensor's standards. This change contradicts the obligation to uphold a certain quality standard, which could create legal issues if the Licensee's services are subpar or damage the brand's reputation.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'in good standing as of the Effective Date' from the Due Authorization clause weakens the assurance that the company is legally compliant. The Due Execution clause removes 'valid and binding', which is critical for ensuring the agreement is legally sound. Also the removal of (iii) of No Conflict clause. These removals weaken the legal protections for both parties, creating a potential for disputes and legal challenges if either party is not fully compliant or if prior agreements conflict.",

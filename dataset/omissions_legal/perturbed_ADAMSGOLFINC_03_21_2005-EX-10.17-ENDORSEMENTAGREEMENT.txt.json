                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed and construed according to principles of contract law.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific reference to Kansas law, the contract attempts to bypass consumer protection laws and other regulations specific to Kansas. This omission introduces legal risk as it creates ambiguity about which jurisdiction's laws apply, potentially weakening consumer rights afforded under Kansas law.",

                "original_text": "In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Venue shall be Kansas. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted as determined by ADAMS GOLF. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause about the selection of arbitrators, the requirement for lawyers, the location of the arbitration, and the statement about court judgment, the contract creates an arbitration process that is entirely controlled by ADAMS GOLF. This violates standard practices for fair arbitration and potentially removes the consumer's right to a fair and impartial hearing, making the contract non-compliant with laws ensuring fair dispute resolution.",

                "explanation": "This change severely limits ADAMS GOLF's liability. The original clause covers 'any and all expenses, damages, claims,' etc., arising from advertising material. The modified clause only covers damages 'directly caused by gross negligence.' This raises the burden of proof for the CONSULTANT, requiring them to prove gross negligence, which is a high legal standard, and removes coverage for other forms of negligence or errors in advertising. This weakens CONSULTANT's protection against potential liabilities and could be seen as unconscionable, contradicting principles of fair contracting.",

                "original_text": "Any late payments under this Agreement will be assessed a service fee of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, to the extent allowed by law.",
                "changed_text": "Any late payments under this Agreement will be assessed a service fee as determined by MP3.com.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase \"to the extent allowed by law\" allows MP3.com to potentially charge late fees that violate California usury laws or other regulations governing the maximum allowable interest or late fee charges. This creates a legal risk because the contract no longer explicitly acknowledges or adheres to these legal limitations.",

Any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in San Diego County, California, and each party hereby consent to the jurisdiction thereof. In any action to enforce this Agreement the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees.",

Any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement must be brought in a venue of MP3.com's choosing, and each party hereby consents to that jurisdiction thereof. The prevailing party in any action to enforce this agreement will not be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific reference to California law and the designated venue (San Diego County), and further stating the prevailing party in any action will not be entitled to cost and attorney's fees, the contract introduces ambiguity and potentially violates California's rules on choice of law and venue, as well as the right to recover attorney's fees in certain contract disputes as permitted under California law. This creates legal risk by potentially depriving Tickets.com of the protections and procedures afforded under California law.",

This could be deemed an unreasonable restraint on trade or a violation of California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, especially if MP3.com withholds consent for arbitrary or malicious reasons, or even prevents Tickets.com from being acquired. The omission of the exception would severely limit the ability of Tickets.com to assign the agreement to a successor in interest if their assets were acquired.",

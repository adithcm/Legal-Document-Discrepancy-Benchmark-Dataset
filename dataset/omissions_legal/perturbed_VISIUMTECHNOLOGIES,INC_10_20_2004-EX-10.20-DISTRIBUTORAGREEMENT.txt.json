                "original_text": "WLI warrants the Products pursuant to the terms of its hardware limited warranty and limited software warranty set forth in Exhibit B hereto. Subject to the terms and conditions of Exhibit A, WLI agrees, in its sole discretion, to repair or replace at its sole cost and expense, any defective Products or parts thereof which are returned to it within the applicable warranty period, provided that the Products have not been altered or repaired other than with authorization from WLI and by its approved procedures; that the Products have not been subjected to misuse, improper maintenance, negligence or accident; that the Products have not been damaged by excessive physical or electrical stress; and that the Products have not had their serial number or any part thereof altered, defaced or removed.",
                "changed_text": "WLI warrants the Products pursuant to the terms of its hardware limited warranty and limited software warranty set forth in Exhibit B hereto. Subject to the terms and conditions of Exhibit A, WLI may repair or replace defective Products or parts thereof at its discretion. The buyer is responsible for all costs associated with returning defective products.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides some warranty terms and conditions. The modified text removes the obligation for WLI to repair or replace defective products at its own cost, giving it sole discretion and shifting return costs to the buyer. This contradicts consumer protection laws in New Jersey (specified in section 16.1), which mandate reasonable warranty obligations and prohibit unfairly burdening consumers with return costs for defective goods. Removing WLI's obligation to cover repair/replacement costs and placing that burden on Power2Ship introduces legal risk.",

                "original_text": "The warranty and remedies set forth in Exhibit B are exclusive and in lieu of any other warranties or remedies, express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for intended or particular purpose. The liability of WLI to Power2Ship for any claim whatsoever related to the Products or the Licensed Programs or this Agreement, including any cause of action in contract, tort, or strict liability, shall not exceed the total amount payable under this Agreement by Power2Ship to WLI within the most recent six-month period for the Licensed Programs (if such claim relates to the Licensed Programs), or for the WLI Products (if such claim relates to the WLI Products). Under no circumstances shall WLI be liable to Power2Ship or to any other person or entity for any incidental, special or consequential damages whether arising out of breach of warranty, breach of contract or otherwise even if WLI has been advised of the possibility of such claims or demands.",

WLI shall not be liable for any special, incidental, or consequential damages.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the explicit mention of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, which are standard consumer rights. While the original text attempts to disclaim these, their explicit mention provides some protection. By omitting them entirely and broadly limiting liability, the contract violates New Jersey's implied warranty laws, as it doesn't provide a clear and conspicuous disclaimer as required. Further, capping liability and excluding consequential damages can be challenged under consumer protection statutes if deemed unconscionable, especially given the power imbalance between WLI and Power2Ship.",

                "explanation": "The original text provided an exception to the indemnification clause in the case of 'willful acts or gross negligence of WLI'. The modified version removes that exception. This change mandates that Power2Ship indemnify WLI even in cases where WLI is grossly negligent or commits a willful act, a situation that could violate New Jersey law and public policy. New Jersey law doesn't typically allow parties to be indemnified for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct, particularly in a way that harms third parties. The omission creates a legal contradiction by potentially forcing Power2Ship to cover WLI's egregious actions, which is against established legal principles.",

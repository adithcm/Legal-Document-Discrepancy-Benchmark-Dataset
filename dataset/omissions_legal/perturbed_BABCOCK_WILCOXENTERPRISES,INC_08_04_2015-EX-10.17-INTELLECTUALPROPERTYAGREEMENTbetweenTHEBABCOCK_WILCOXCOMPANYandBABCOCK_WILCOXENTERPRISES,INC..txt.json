                "original_text": "RemainCo and SpinCo shall hold and shall cause the members of the RemainCo Group and the SpinCo Group, respectively, to hold, and shall each cause their respective officers, employees, agents, consultants and advisors to hold, in strict confidence and not to disclose or release without the prior written consent of the other Party, any and all Confidential Information (as defined herein) of such other Party or the members of its Group; provided, that the Parties may disclose, or may permit disclosure of, such Confidential Information (i) to their respective auditors, attorneys, financial advisors, bankers and other appropriate consultants and advisors who have a need to know such information and are informed of their obligation to hold such information confidential to the same extent as is applicable to the Parties and in respect of whose failure to comply with such obligations, RemainCo or SpinCo, as the case may be, will be responsible or (ii) to the extent any member of the RemainCo Group or the SpinCo Group is compelled to disclose any such Confidential Information by judicial or administrative process or, in the opinion of legal counsel, by other requirements of Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any demand or request for disclosure of Confidential Information is made pursuant to clause (ii) above, RemainCo or SpinCo, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the other of the existence of such request or demand and shall provide the other a reasonable opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy, which both Parties will cooperate in seeking to obtain. In the event that such appropriate protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Party who is being compelled to disclose (or whose Group member is being compelled to disclose) shall, and shall cause the applicable members at its Group to, furnish, or cause to be furnished, only that portion of such Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed.",
                "changed_text": "RemainCo and SpinCo shall hold and shall cause the members of the RemainCo Group and the SpinCo Group, respectively, to hold, and shall each cause their respective officers, employees, agents, consultants and advisors to hold, in confidence any and all Confidential Information (as defined herein) of such other Party or the members of its Group; provided, that the Parties may disclose, or may permit disclosure of, such Confidential Information to their respective consultants and advisors who have a need to know such information. In the event that any demand or request for disclosure of Confidential Information is made, RemainCo or SpinCo, as the case may be, shall furnish that portion of such Confidential Information that is required to be disclosed.",
                "explanation": "The omission of the phrase 'strict confidence' and the removal of the requirement for prior written consent weakens the confidentiality obligations. Also, the notification requirement has been removed when there is a request or demand for disclosure of confidential information. The standard regarding informing consultants and advisors of their confidentiality obligations has also been weakened. The clause 'which both Parties will cooperate in seeking to obtain' has also been removed, weakening the security. The removal of 'promptly notify the other of the existence of such request or demand and shall provide the other a reasonable opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy' directly contradicts standard confidentiality practice.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'but no less than a reasonable degree of care' weakens the minimum standard of care. Also, The removal of 'commercially reasonable efforts to implement and maintain comprehensive security protocols to protect and maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information received from the other Party hereunder, including, without limitation, implementing administrative, technical, digital, electronic and physical security strategies and access restrictions to protect Confidential Information' weakens security around confidential information and contradicts state law such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which requires reasonable security procedures and practices.",

The Parties have relied upon their own knowledge and judgment and upon the advice of the attorneys of their choosing. The Parties have had access to independent legal advice, have conducted such investigations they and their counsel thought appropriate, and have consulted with such other independent advisors as they and their counsel deemed appropriate regarding this Agreement and their rights and asserted rights in connection therewith. The Parties are not relying upon any representations or statements made by any other Party, or such other Party's employees, agents, representatives or attorneys, regarding this Agreement, except to the extent such representations are expressly set forth or incorporated in this Agreement. The Parties are not relying upon a legal duty, if one exists, on the part of the other Party (or such other Party's employees, agents, representatives or attorneys) to disclose any information in connection with the execution of this Agreement or its preparation, it being expressly understood that neither Party shall ever assert any failure to disclose information on the part of the other Party as a ground for challenging this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the word 'full' from 'full consideration' weakens the level of thought that has gone into it. Also, removing the word 'attorneys of their choosing' gives less choice to the parties. Similarly, deleting 'and their counsel' implies less legal advice was involved. By removing 'agents, representatives or attorneys' gives less liability in cases of wrong-doing. By deleting 'assert any failure to disclose information on the part of the other Party as a ground for challenging this Agreement' makes the agreement non-compliant with state law such as Delaware which always requires reasonable disclosure.",

                "explanation": "By changing the term extension from a fixed date to 'at Fox's Discretion', Glu Mobile loses the guarantee of continued licensing rights until March 31, 2008. If California law stipulates implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts which requires parties not to impair the other party's benefits of the agreement, this gives Fox a means to do so at any time, potentially breaching this implied covenant if exercised unfairly.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'and such that the email address for Paul Zuzelo is deleted,' the contract may be interpreted to require dual notice, both to the General Counsel and to Paul Zuzelo's old email address, even if Paul Zuzelo no longer works at the company. This creates an ambiguity and potential legal risk, particularly if California law requires clear and unambiguous notice provisions in commercial contracts.",

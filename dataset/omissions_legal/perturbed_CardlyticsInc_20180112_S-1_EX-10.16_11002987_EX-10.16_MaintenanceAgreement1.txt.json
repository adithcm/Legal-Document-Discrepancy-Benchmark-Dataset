Best Company and shall, upon Bank of America's request, be furnished to Bank of America certificates and required endorsements evidencing such insurance. Bank of America shall be named as an ''Additional Insured\" to the coverages described in Sections 26.2.3, 26.2.4, and 26.2.5 below for the purpose of protecting Bank of America from any expense and/or liability arising out of, alleged to arise out of, related to or connected with the Products provided by Supplier and/or its Subcontractors. The certificates shall state the amount of all deductibles and self-insured retentions and shall contain evidence that the policy or policies shall not be canceled or materially altered without at least thirty (30) calendar days prior written notice to Bank of America. Supplier and its Subcontractors shalt pay any and all costs which are incurred by Bank of America as a result of any such deductibles or self-insured retentions to the extent that Bank of America is named as an \"Additional Insured,\" and to the same extent as if the policies contained no deductibles or self-insured retention. The insurance coverages and limits required to be maintained by Supplier and its Subcontractors shall be primary and non-contributory to insurance coverage, if any, maintained by Bank of America.

                "explanation": "This change weakens the insurance requirements by removing the 'at its own expense' clause, creating a potential ambiguity about who bears the cost of insurance. It also removes the requirement for subcontractors to maintain insurance, and eliminates the minimum A-VII rating requirement. Further, removing 'at least thirty (30) calendar days' creates a legal loophole, as the text doesn't provide a timeframe when there is cancellation or alterations to the policy, undermining Bank of America's protection. The removal of the 'non-contributory' aspect also undermines Bank of America.",

                "original_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, Developer shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage for public liability, including products liability, in the amount of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit. Developer also shall carry such worker's compensation insurance as may be required by applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, Developer shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage. Developer also shall carry such worker's compensation insurance as may be required.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the specific amount for public liability insurance (One Million Dollars) introduces a legal risk. Many states, including California where El Pollo Loco is headquartered, have minimum insurance coverage requirements for businesses. By removing the specified amount, the contract becomes vague and potentially non-compliant with state insurance regulations.",

                "original_text": "Franchisor shall be named as an additional insured on all such insurance policies and shall be provided with certificates of insurance evidencing such coverage. All public liability and property damage policies shall contain a provision that El Pollo Loco, although named as an insured, shall nevertheless be entitled to recover under such policies on any loss incurred by El Pollo Loco, its affiliates, agents and/or employees, by reason of the negligence of Developer, its principals, contractors, agents and/or employees. All policies shall provide Franchisor with at least thirty (30) days' notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.",
                "changed_text": "Franchisor may be named as an additional insured on insurance policies. Policies may provide Franchisor with notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.",
                "explanation": "This section originally mandates that El Pollo Loco is named as an additional insured and receives certificates of insurance, and that all policies must contain a provision allowing El Pollo Loco to recover under them for losses caused by the Developer's negligence. Additionally, it requires a 30-day notice of cancellation or termination. The modified text weakens these requirements significantly, making them optional ('may' instead of 'shall'). This omission introduces legal risk because it removes the guarantee of direct protection for the Franchisor via the Developer's insurance policies, potentially violating standard risk management practices expected in franchise agreements and failing to adequately protect the franchisor against liability arising from the franchisee's operations as is often legally required.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement, after review by Developer and El Pollo Loco, was accepted in the state in which Franchisor's then-current headquarters (currently the State of California) is located and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of such state, except that the provisions in Section 20.1 covering competition following the expiration, termination or assignment of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state in which the breach occurs. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY ACTION BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY AGAINST EACH OTHER IN ANY COURT, WHETHER FEDERAL OR STATE, WILL BE BROUGHT WITHIN THE STATE IN WHICH FRANCHISOR'S HEADQUARTERS (CURRENTLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA) IS THEN LOCATED. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO DEMAND OR HAVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE FRANCHISOR IS A PARTY. THE PARTIES CONSENT TO THE EXERCISE OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER THEM BY SUCH COURTS AND TO THE PROPRIETY OF VENUE OF SUCH COURTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF CARRYING OUT THE PROVISION, AND THEY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO THE SAME. ANY ACTION BETWEEN DEVELOPER AND FRANCHISOR SHALL INVOLVE ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS OF DEVELOPER AND SHALL NOT INVOLVE ANY CLASS, GROUP, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR ASSOCIATIONAL ACTION. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 18.1 IS INTENDED BY THE PARTIES TO SUBJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ANY FRANCHISE OR SIMILAR LAW, RULE OR REGULATION TO WHICH THIS AGREEMENT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE SUBJECT.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with laws as determined appropriate by the Franchisor. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY ACTION BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY AGAINST EACH OTHER IN ANY COURT, WHETHER FEDERAL OR STATE, WILL BE BROUGHT IN A COURT OF THE FRANCHISOR'S CHOOSING. The parties may bring class, group, consolidated, representative or associational action.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies California law as governing and waives jury trials. It also prevents class action lawsuits. The modified text gives the Franchisor unilateral control over which laws govern the agreement and allows class action lawsuits. This change introduces a legal risk because it removes legal certainty for the Developer and allows class action lawsuits which are expensive.",

The Provider will obtain and maintain appropriate liability insurance in an amount of not less than $1,000,000 combined single limit for accidents or occurrences which cause bodily injury, death or property damage related to the performance of the Services. The insurance policy willname the Company as an additional insured. The Provider will provide the Company with a certificate of insurance issued to evidence such coverage. Such certificate will provide that there shall be no cancellation, non-renewal, or modification of such coverage without thirty days' prior written notice to the Company.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'appropriate' and the 'in an amount of not less than $1,000,000 combined single limit' significantly weakens the insurance requirement. The deletion of the certificate and notice requirements eliminate important compliance measures.

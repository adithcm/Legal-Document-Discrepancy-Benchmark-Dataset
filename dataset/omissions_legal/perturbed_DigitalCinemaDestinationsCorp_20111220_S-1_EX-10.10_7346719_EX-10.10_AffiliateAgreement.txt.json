NCM shall maintain\nwith financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance for its business and Equipment in such amounts and against such perils as\nNCM deems adequate for its business, including the installation services set forth in Section 2.2 herein.

Each Party may name the other Party as an additional insured on such policies of insurance.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"shall maintain\" to \"may maintain,\" and removing the requirement for financially sound and reputable insurance companies and also removing language for insurance amounts and against perils Network Affiliate deems adequate for business, this modification eliminates the mandatory insurance requirement for both parties, creating a legal risk. It also makes naming the other party as an additional insured optional. This contradicts standard business practices and potentially violates implied duties of care and could violate state laws regarding minimum insurance coverage for businesses.",

Network Affiliate shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless NCM and its officers, directors, shareholders, contractors, employees, representatives, agents, successors, and assigns (collectively, \"Representatives\") from and against any and all losses, obligations, risks, costs, liabilities, settlements, damages, judgments, awards, fines, penalties, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) (collectively, \"Costs\") suffered or incurred in connection with or as a result of, and from and against any and all third party claims, suits, actions, or proceedings actually or allegedly arising out of, based upon, or relating to, (i) any breach by Network Affiliate of Article IX, (ii) infringement by any information, content or other materials supplied by or on behalf of Network Affiliate hereunder (including the Brand) of any third party U.S. patent, trademark, or copyright right arising from NCM's use of such materials in accordance and compliance with this Agreement, provided such Costs have been finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction or approved by Network Affiliate as part of a settlement, (iii) any use of any NCM Property other than as authorized by this Agreement, or (iv) Network Affiliate's fraud, willful misconduct, or noncompliance with law.",

This indemnification is capped at $5000 total.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly limits the scope of Network Affiliate's indemnification obligations. By removing the duty to defend and the phrase 'hold harmless,' the text reduces the actual protection afforded to NCM. Capping the indemnification amount at $1000 for breaches of Article IX and $5000 total introduces a monetary limit that may be insufficient to cover actual losses, creating legal risk. The limitation on liability could contradict legal requirements for adequate compensation in cases of breach of contract or tortious acts, making the clause potentially unenforceable or leading to legal challenges.",

The Parties agree that (unless mutually agreed by the Parties with respect to clauses (i), (iii), (iv), (v) or\n(vi)) all content within the Service will not contain content or other material that: (i) has received, or had it been rated would have received, an\nMPAA \"X\" or \"NC-17\" rating (or the equivalent), (ii) promotes illegal activity, (iii) promotes the use of tobacco, sexual aids, birth control, firearms,\nweapons or similar products; (iv) promotes alcohol, except prior to \"R\"-rated films in the auditorium; (v) constitutes religious advertising (except\non a local basis, exhibiting time and location for local church services); (vi) constitutes political advertising or promotes gambling; (vii) promotes\ntheatres, theatre circuits or other entities that are competitive with Network Affiliate's theatre operating business or NCM; or (viii) otherwise\nreflects negatively on Network Affiliate or adversely affects Network Affiliate's attendance as determined in Network Affiliate's reasonable\ndiscretion. Additionally, the service will not contain any material that depicts or advertises products competitive to the Beverage Agreement\n(except as an incidental product placement in content not created by NCM). Network Affiliate may, without liability, breach or otherwise, prevent\nand/or take any other actions with respect to the use or distribution of content that violates the foregoing standards; provided, that with respect\nto this Section 3.4(viii), Network Affiliate may opt out of such advertising only with respect to Theatres in the geographic locations identified,\nwhich may include all of Network Affiliate's Theatres. If the Digital Content Service contains any content that violates the foregoing standards,\nNCM will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove such content as soon as reasonably practical. If NCM fails to remove such content within\na reasonable time, Network Affiliate may discontinue the Digital Content Service in such auditoriums where such content is shown until the\nviolating content is removed and shall have no liability for such discontinuation. If any other elements of the Service contain any content that\nviolates the foregoing standards, NCM shall at Network Affiliate's request, or Network Affiliate acting on its own behalf may, upon giving written\nnotice to NCM, remove such content immediately.",

This creates a legal risk because it eliminates protections against offensive, illegal, or harmful content, which could expose Network Affiliate to liability for violating laws related to decency, advertising standards, or consumer protection.

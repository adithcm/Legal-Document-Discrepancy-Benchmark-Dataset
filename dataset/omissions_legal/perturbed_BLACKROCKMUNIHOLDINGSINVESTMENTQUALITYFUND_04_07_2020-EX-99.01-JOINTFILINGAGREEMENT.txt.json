                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and the rules and regulations thereunder, each party hereto hereby agrees to the joint filing, on behalf of each of them, of any filing required by such party under Section 13 or Section 16 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (and, if such security is registered on a national securities exchange, also with the exchange), and further agrees to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Each party hereto agrees to the joint filing, on behalf of each of them, of any filing under Section 13 or Section 16 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and agrees to the filing of this agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit reference to adhering to the 'Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended' and 'the rules and regulations thereunder', as well as omitting 'any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto' when referencing filings. While the section references section 13 and 16 of the Exchange Act, it does not specify it needs to be in accordance with the rules and regulations within the Securities Exchange Act. It also does not acknowledge that amendments, restatements, supplements, and exhibits should be filed. This omission could be argued as a failure to fully acknowledge and adhere to all requirements of the Exchange Act, potentially misleading investors.",

                "original_text": "This agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This agreement shall remain in effect until revoked by any party.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires a 'signed writing provided to each other party hereto' for revocation to be valid. The modified version removes this requirement, making the revocation process ambiguous and potentially allowing for revocation without proper notification. While, in practice, proper revocation would require written notification, the lack of writing notification mentioned in the contract could cause legal loopholes. This could conflict with securities laws that require clear and documented procedures for material agreements.",

                "explanation": "By removing the disclaimer of statutory warranties, the agreement becomes potentially non-compliant with consumer protection laws in New York State. New York law implies certain statutory warranties, particularly in software licensing, and explicitly disclaiming them is often required to be conspicuous and unambiguous. By removing the explicit reference to statutory warranties, the enforceability of the disclaimer becomes questionable, increasing legal risk.",

                "explanation": "Removing the jury trial waiver, while seemingly restoring a right, can introduce legal risk. New York law requires jury trial waivers to be knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made. Omitting the explicit waiver raises questions about whether a party implicitly waives this right by agreeing to the contract, particularly if they are not sophisticated parties. This could lead to disputes about the enforceability of the agreement and potentially higher litigation costs.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit statement that 'This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person or entity other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,' the contract now opens itself to potential claims from third-party beneficiaries. While the original clause aimed to prevent such claims, its removal allows for arguments that certain third parties (e.g., customers relying on the licensed intellectual property) could be intended beneficiaries, especially if the contract's performance directly benefits them. This omission contradicts the general principle of contract law that third-party beneficiary status requires clear intent and creates a legal risk of expanded liability.",

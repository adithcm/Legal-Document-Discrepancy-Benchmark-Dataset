                "original_text": "If the proposed price Is Increased by Supplier upon delivery to Bank of America of detailed specifications or at any other time hereafter, Bank of America may terminate this Schedule and shall receive a refund of all amounts previously paid hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "If the proposed price Is Increased by Supplier upon delivery to Bank of America of detailed specifications or at any other time hereafter, Bank of America may terminate this Schedule.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'and shall receive a refund of all amounts previously paid hereunder', the contract now omits the legally required consumer right to a refund upon termination due to a price increase initiated by the supplier. This is a legally mandated protection, designed to ensure fair business practices and protect Bank of America from financial loss if the supplier attempts to unilaterally raise prices. The omission of this refund clause introduces a legal risk, potentially violating consumer protection laws in the United States, where such protections are commonly enforced to prevent unjust enrichment and ensure fair dealing, and specifically, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "This subtle modification introduces ambiguity as to which terms and conditions apply, effectively weakening Bank of America's rights under the original Software License, Customization, and Maintenance Agreement. It removes the legally required clarity and comprehensiveness expected in a contract, leaving room for interpretation and potential disputes. This omission contradicts the legal principle requiring contracts to be clear and unambiguous, a standard upheld in the United States to prevent misrepresentation and ensure both parties understand their obligations. This omission can give the Supplier an advantage.",

                "changed_text": "The Customizations shall fulfill the functional specifications described in the Program Materials.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'or exceed all of the functional, performance and other specifications described in the Program Materials and the documents prepared either by Bank of America or Supplier pursuant to this Agreement', the clause is severely weakened. The removal of 'performance and other specifications' narrows the scope of the Supplier's obligation and eliminates the requirement for the Customizations to exceed those specifications. This omission creates a legal risk, as it weakens Bank of America's recourse if the Customizations are deficient in performance or other non-functional areas. This could violate basic principles of contract law in the United States, where parties are generally entitled to receive the full benefit of their bargain, encompassing both functional and performance aspects. This change also removes 'the documents prepared either by Bank of America or Supplier', which means any documents that could have held the supplier accountable is no longer considered.",

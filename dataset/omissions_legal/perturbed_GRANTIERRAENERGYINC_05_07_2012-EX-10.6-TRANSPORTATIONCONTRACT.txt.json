                "original_text": "7.8 The SENDER shall pay late interests on any unpaid amounts pursuant to the provisions set out by ECOPETROL in the Guidelines for  Administration of Service Receivables ECP-UTE-G-008 or a document that modifies or supersedes it, which is an integral part of the  Contract hereto as Annex 2.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall' to 'may', the contract no longer mandates the payment of late interests, potentially violating Colombian regulations requiring penalties for late payments on commercial contracts. This introduces legal risk by creating ambiguity about the SENDER's obligation to pay late interests. This would also potentially impact ECOPETROLs revenue stream.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'is obliged' to 'may' weakens ECOPETROL's duty to protect and indemnify the sender. This weakens tenant rights, potentially violating laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts for commercial leases. This introduces legal risk by creating ambiguity about the SENDER's obligation to pay late interests. This would also potentially impact ECOPETROLs revenue stream.",

Likewise, any change of these  representatives may be notified in writing.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall' to 'may', the notification process is no longer mandatory. This creates a **legal contradiction** because it weakens the contractual requirement for each party to officially designate representatives. In Colombia, where legal formalities are significant, the removal of a mandatory representative creates a potential gap in communication and accountability. This could affect the enforceability of notices or demands served on the parties. Also this introduces legal risk by creating ambiguity about the SENDER's obligation to pay late interests. This would also potentially impact ECOPETROLs revenue stream.",

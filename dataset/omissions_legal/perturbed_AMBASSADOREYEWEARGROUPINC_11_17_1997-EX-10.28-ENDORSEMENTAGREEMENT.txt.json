As proof of such insurance, a fully paid certificate of insurance naming KI, Inc. and KI as an insured party will be submitted to KI, Inc. by Diplomat for KI, Inc.'s prior approval before any product is distributed or sold, and at the latest within thirty (30) days after the date first written above. Any proposed change in certificates of insurance shall be submitted to KI, Inc. for its prior approval. KI, Inc. shall be entitled to a copy of the then prevailing certificate of insurance, which shall be furnished KI, Inc. by Diplomat.

                "original_text": "Fazync shall indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of Fazync or breach of Fazync of any of its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Fazync shall indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for damages directly resulting from Fazync's gross negligence.",
                "explanation": "By limiting indemnification to damages 'directly resulting from Fazync's gross negligence' and removing 'any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising... or breach of Fazync of any of its obligations under this Agreement', the contract now provides significantly less protection than Texas law typically affords in indemnification agreements. Texas law generally allows for indemnification for a broader range of damages and liabilities, including attorney's fees and costs associated with defending against third-party claims arising from a party's negligence or breach of contract. This omission weakens Bravatek's protection and could leave them responsible for costs they would otherwise be indemnified for under Texas law.",

                "explanation": "This change severely limits the scope of indemnification. By restricting it to 'damages to tangible property directly caused by Bravatek's actions' and omitting coverage for 'any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of Bravatek or breach of Bravatek of any of its obligations under this Agreement', Fazync is now exposed to potential liabilities (like legal fees in a lawsuit) that would normally be covered by a standard indemnification clause. This violates the reasonable expectations of commercial contracts in Texas and increases Fazync's legal risk.",

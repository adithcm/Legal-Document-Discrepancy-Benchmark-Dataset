                "changed_text": "EIT is responsible for any damages caused to the Customer when these result from gross negligence on EIT's part.",
                "explanation": "The original clause holds EIT liable for any damages resulting from not satisfying contractual obligations. The modified clause limits this liability to damages resulting only from 'gross negligence.' This introduces a significant legal loophole, weakening the Customer's protection and potentially contradicting Spanish law regarding liability for breach of contract. This clause significantly narrows the scope of EIT's liability, shielding them from responsibility for damages resulting from simple negligence or other breaches of contract that don't rise to the level of gross negligence. This may violate consumer protection laws or general principles of contract law that require parties to be responsible for foreseeable damages resulting from their breaches.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates Article 1101 of the Spanish Civil Code, which states that obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and must be fulfilled according to their terms. Also, Law 26/1984, of July 19, General for the Defense of Consumers and Users could be affected if the client is considered a consumer in this specific case.",

                "changed_text": "The parties commit themselves to confidentiality.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly prohibits spreading or using the other party's information directly or through third parties. The modified clause removes the explicit prohibition against using information through third parties. Under Spanish Data Protection Act (Ley Orgánica 3/2018, de 5 de diciembre, de Protección de Datos Personales y garantía de los derechos digitales), which transposes GDPR, companies are held to a higher standard regarding the protection of data. Removing this clause can be considered a legal contradiction because it weakens the data protection obligations of both parties, potentially leading to breaches of data protection laws.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the service provider is giving a 'guarantee' that their solution is the best for the customer's needs. This is a strong affirmation that likely carries legal weight in terms of breach of contract if the customer later demonstrates that the solution was demonstrably not the best option. By contrast, the modified clause weakens this to a statement of belief that the solution is merely 'adequate'. This offers no guarantee of suitability for purpose or that the solution is of a specific quality. The removal of 'best possible one' introduces a significant legal risk, as Spanish Consumer Protection Law (Ley General para la Defensa de los Consumidores y Usuarios) expects a service provider to provide services that meet a reasonable standard of quality and fitness for purpose.",

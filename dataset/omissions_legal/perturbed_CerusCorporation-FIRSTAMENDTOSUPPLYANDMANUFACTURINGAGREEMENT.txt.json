Such acceptance or rejection shall be consistent with the criteria set forth in the Statement of Work, if any. If Cerus does not reject in writing within [*] days, the Services shall be considered accepted by Cerus. Within [*] days of any notice of rejection, Porex shall present a corrective plan of action to Cerus. Upon approval by Cerus of the corrective plan, Porex, at no additional expense to Cerus, shall then make the corrections and, where applicable, Porex shall resubmit the corrected Services to Cerus. For disputed invoices or the disputed portion of an invoice, Cerus shall use reasonable efforts to provide to Porex, in writing, within [*] days, a description of the disputed amounts. Cerus and Porex shall negotiate in a timely, good faith manner to resolve billing queries. Cerus will not have responsibility to pay for identified errors, incomplete or inaccurate items (collectively the \"invoice errors\") which result in increases to previously invoiced amounts if the aforementioned invoice errors are communicated to Cerus later than [*] days from the original invoice date.",

Upon approval by Cerus of the corrective plan, Porex, at no additional expense to Cerus, shall then make the corrections and, where applicable, Porex shall resubmit the corrected Services to Cerus.

                "explanation": "By removing the 'in writing' requirement from Cerus providing Porex the description of disputed amounts, it creates ambiguity and weakens Porex's ability to effectively dispute invoices. Furthermore, the phrase 'negotiate in a timely, good faith manner' is replaced with 'attempt to negotiate' which removes the good faith requirement. Finally, the communication deadline of errors is removed, potentially leading to late notifications that prejudice Porex.",

Cerus hereby consents to Porex's use of the Cerus Dedicated Space and Equipment, as specified in a Statement of Work, solely as necessary to perform the Services under that Statement of Work. Such consent shall automatically terminate upon the completion of the applicable Statement of Work and is limited by the terms of the Agreement.

                "explanation": "The removal of 'written' before 'work orders' significantly weakens the requirement for a clear and documented agreement on work orders. It introduces ambiguity and creates the risk of disputes over the scope and terms of the work. The removal of 'in writing' relating to Porex acceptance of work order exacerbates this issue by implying tacit acceptance, creating grounds for disputes over unapproved services.",

Upon JHU's request, Company will furnish JHU with a Certificate of Insurance of each product liability insurance policy obtained. JHU shall be listed as an additional insured in Company's said insurance policies.

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that the company 'will annually present evidence to JHU that such coverage is being maintained.' Removing this requirement weakens JHU's ability to ensure compliance and potentially exposes them to liability if the company fails to maintain adequate insurance. This omission contradicts general principles of corporate responsibility and risk management, as well as potentially violating requirements for ongoing proof of insurance in several countries.",

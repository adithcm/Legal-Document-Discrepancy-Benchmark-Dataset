                "original_text": "6.  Developer Liability.\n\n6.1. Developer Liability for Damages. Developer shall be fully liable, without limitation, for money damages resulting from its improper or unauthorized use, modification, alteration, licensing or transfer of the Technology or Improvements, or resulting from its failure to provide functional and merchantable Improvements hereunder, which failure shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by Developer.",
                "changed_text": "6. Developer Liability.\n\n6.1. Developer Liability for Damages. Developer shall be liable for money damages resulting from its improper or unauthorized use of the Technology or Improvements. Liability shall be limited to the amount of fees paid to Developer under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "By limiting liability to the fees paid under the agreement, the contract contradicts standard legal practices that hold parties fully liable for damages resulting from their negligence or breach of contract. This is especially relevant to intellectual property rights, where damages can far exceed the fees paid under a development agreement. Limiting the liability for \"unauthorized use, modification, alteration, licensing or transfer of the Technology or Improvements\" creates a significant legal loophole that may violate intellectual property laws. The removal of the phrase 'without limitation' directly contradicts the default legal position of unlimited liability for damages resulting from breaches.",

                "original_text": "9.6. Irreparable Damage. The parties acknowledge and agree that any material breach of this Agreement may subject the other to irreparable injury for which monetary damages may not be an adequate remedy. Therefore, in addition to any remedies otherwise available, the non-breaching party may be entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance to enforce the terms of this Agreement. The breaching party shall pay all reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, arbitration costs, and/or appeal costs incurred by the non-breaching party should it be necessary for the non-breaching party to enforce the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "9.6. Irreparable Damage. The parties acknowledge that a breach of this agreement may cause damage. Therefore, the non-breaching party may seek remedies available under the law.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the explicit entitlement to injunctive relief and specific performance, which are critical remedies for protecting intellectual property rights. By omitting these specific remedies and only referring to 'remedies available under the law', the contract weakens the protection afforded to DSS's Technology and Intellectual Property. This weakens the recourse DSS has against HotApp for breaches involving IP, potentially violating principles of contract law regarding adequate remedies for breach, especially in IP-sensitive contexts.",

The parties acknowledge that they have entered into that certain Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated as of January 18, 2018 (the \"NDA\"), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A. The terms of the NDA shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Agreement, mutatis mutandis. During the Term of this Agreement and thereafter for a period of five (5) years, the parties shall be bound by all of the protective terms and conditions of the NDA.",

                "explanation": "This revision eliminates the explicit incorporation of the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and drastically reduces the scope and duration of confidentiality obligations. Removing the reference to the NDA and shortening the confidentiality period to only the term of the agreement significantly weakens the protection of DSS's confidential information and trade secrets. This could conflict with trade secret laws, which often require a reasonable duration for confidentiality obligations to maintain protection.",

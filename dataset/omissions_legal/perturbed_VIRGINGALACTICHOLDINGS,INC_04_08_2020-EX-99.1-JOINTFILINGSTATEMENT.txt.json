                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, except to the extent that he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be responsible' to 'may be responsible' and removing the clause about knowingly inaccurate information, the agreement weakens the legal responsibility of each party regarding the accuracy and timely filing of amendments, contradicting the SEC's requirements for accurate and timely disclosures in Schedule 13G filings.",
                "contradicted_law": "SEC Rule 13d-1(k) which requires accurate and timely disclosures.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 'Chief Financial Officer' title from each signature weakens the attestation of authority for the signatories, potentially contradicting the SEC's implicit requirement that signatories have the proper authority to represent their respective entities. This introduces legal risk by obscuring the official capacity of the signing individuals.",

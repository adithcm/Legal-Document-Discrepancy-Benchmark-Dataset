                "original_text": "Since Manufacturer is paying the actual manufacturing cost of the product, Supplier has not reserved for any warranty related costs. The Manufacturer acknowledges that it is solely responsible for any warranty costs associated with Manufacturer's Products. Should any nonconformities be detected during or after the manufacturing process, Subcontractor will assist Manufacturer in resolving any quality issues with the suppliers. Subcontractor will provide support to Manufacturer to train Manufacturer's employees to repair the non-conforming products as appropriate. Upon Manufacturer's request, Subcontractor will provide repair services for a fee equal to the actual cost of these services. In the event Manufacturer in good faith believes that Manufacturer's Products are nonconforming under the specifications agreed to among the Parties (the \"Standards\"), Manufacturer shall give written notice to Subcontractor specifying in detail the nonconformity within thirty (30) days of Manufacturer's receipt of such Manufacturer's Products. Upon Manufacturer's request, Subcontractor will facilitate such Manufacturer's Products being repaired or replaced, Manufacturer must return the Manufacturer's Products to Subcontractor, transportation charges prepaid by Manufacturer, within fifteen (15) days of the end of such thirty (30) date notice period. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Subcontractor makes no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to: (i) any materials, components or subassemblies; (ii) defects resulting from the Specifications or the design of the Manufacturer's Products; (iii) Manufacturer's Product that has been abused, damaged, altered or misused by any person or entity after title passes to Manufacturer; (iv) first articles, prototypes, pre-production units, test units or other similar Manufacturer's Products; or (v) defects resulting from tooling, designs or instructions produced or supplied by Manufacturer. Manufacturer shall be liable for costs or expenses incurred by Subcontractor related to the foregoing exclusions to Subcontractor's express limited warranty. If Subcontractor determines that the Manufacturer's Products are nonconforming under the Standards, Subcontractor, shall work with their vendors to rework the Manufacturer's Products or otherwise replace the Manufacturer's Products. Manufacturer shall be liable for the cost of rework or replacement and all associated costs therewith including, without limitation, transportation charges and inspection fees. If requested by the Manufacturer, Subcontractor will provide a cause of failure, a failure analysis provided in Subcontractor's standard format and correction action.",

                "explanation": "This change eliminates the manufacturer's right to a clearly defined process for addressing non-conforming products. The original text outlined a 30-day window for notification and a 15-day window for returning products. The modified text removes these specific timelines and makes the repair/replacement process discretionary for the Subcontractor. By removing these provisions, the contract contradicts implied warranty laws, which generally require a reasonable opportunity to inspect and reject non-conforming goods.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the clause where Subcontractor authorizes Manufacturer to assert Subcontractor's rights under any applicable third-party manufacturer's warranty. By removing this, the contract attempts to limit the manufacturer's ability to seek recourse for defective components from the original component manufacturers, contradicting the principle of 'pass-through warranties' where downstream purchasers can sometimes benefit from original manufacturer warranties.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit choice of law and venue (Arizona and Maricopa County) and eliminates the prevailing party's right to recover attorney's fees and costs. While choice of law provisions are generally upheld, removing it creates ambiguity and potential legal challenges regarding jurisdiction and applicable law. More importantly, the removal of attorney's fees provision could deter a party with a legitimate claim from pursuing legal action, especially if the potential recovery is small relative to the anticipated legal costs. Arizona law, like many states, has consumer protection statutes that allow for attorney's fees to be awarded to a prevailing consumer, and removing this provision attempts to circumvent those protections.",

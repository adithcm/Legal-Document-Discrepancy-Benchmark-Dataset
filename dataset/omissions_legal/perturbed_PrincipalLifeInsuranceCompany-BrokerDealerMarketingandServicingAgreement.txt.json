                "original_text": "Broker Dealer will use commercially reasonable efforts to train and instruct its Registered Representatives not to make recommendations to an applicant to purchase an Annuity Contract in the absence of reasonable grounds to believe that the purchase is suitable for such applicant, in accordance with the suitability and disclosure requirements of the 1934 Act, FINRA Conduct Rule 2310, and any state insurance law or regulation governing the offer and sale of Annuity Contracts, including any state law or regulation governing sales to the public in general (e.g. consumer protection laws or regulations, unfair trade practices, annuity disclosure regulations, etc.) or to senior citizens, as the same may be amended or interpreted from time to time. Broker Dealer will use commercially reasonable efforts to determine that each transaction is completed with a Registered Representative's report indicating suitability, including any required and necessary customer information, and is subjected to a review process in compliance with FINRA Conduct Rule 3010, as the same may be amended or interpreted from time to time. Each application shall be approved by one of Broker Dealer's registered principals, in accordance with all applicable FINRA rules.",
                "changed_text": "Broker Dealer will train and instruct its Registered Representatives to make recommendations to an applicant to purchase an Annuity Contract without specific suitability requirements. Broker Dealer will use commercially reasonable efforts to determine that each transaction is completed with a Registered Representative's report, and each application shall be approved by one of Broker Dealer's registered principals.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the core suitability requirements mandated by FINRA Conduct Rule 2310 and related securities regulations. By removing the language about 'reasonable grounds to believe that the purchase is suitable' and the specific mention of suitability requirements, the contract weakens the broker dealer's obligation to ensure that annuity recommendations are in the customer's best interest. This creates a legal risk, as it could be argued that the broker dealer is not adequately protecting customers from unsuitable investment recommendations.",

Issuer or Distributor shall inform Broker Dealer of those states that require delivery of a Statement of Additional Information with the prospectus on initial sale. Broker Dealer is responsible for prospectus delivery requirements only on initial sale. Issuer and Distributor will be responsible for prospectus delivery annually after the original sale.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens the mandatory prospectus delivery requirements mandated by the 1933 Act and related securities regulations. By replacing 'Broker Dealer shall ensure' with 'Broker Dealer shall make reasonable efforts', the contract lowers the broker dealer's obligation to deliver the prospectus. This omission introduces legal risk by creating ambiguity about the broker dealer's responsibility to comply with prospectus delivery requirements.",

Broker Dealer represents and warrants that it has adopted a customer identification program and will verify the identity of customers who purchase Annuity Contracts. Periodically, Issuer or Distributor may ask Broker Dealer to, and Broker Dealer agrees to, certify that it is compliance with the requirements, representations and warranties in this paragraph. The Parties further acknowledge that they have a current 314(b) notice on file with FinCEN in accordance with section 314(b) of the USA Patriot Act and agree to refile such notice annually (or as otherwise required to remain current in accordance with applicable rules and regulations) during the term of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This change omits the ongoing compliance requirements with AML acts and the acknowledgment and refiling of a 314(b) notice with FinCEN. By removing the explicit mentions of 'applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, FINRA, and any other self-regulatory organizations, as they now exist and as they may be amended in the future' and deleting 'The Parties further acknowledge that they have a current 314(b) notice on file with FinCEN in accordance with section 314(b) of the USA Patriot Act and agree to refile such notice annually', the contract reduces the emphasis on continuous compliance with AML regulations. This creates legal risk, because 314(b) is an agreement for the party to stay in compliance of the AML requirements.",

            {
                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Any royalty payment that is not paid when due will bear interest from the date such amount is due until the date payment is made at a rate equal to ten percent (10%) per annum.",
                "changed_text": "Any royalty payment that is not paid when due may, at Licensor's discretion, bear interest.",
                "explanation": "Removing the fixed interest rate and replacing it with discretionary interest introduces ambiguity and potential violation of usury laws, as the interest rate could potentially be set at an illegally high level. This impacts licensee protections by eliminating a guaranteed upper limit on late payment interest.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state usury laws (e.g., Texas Finance Code Chapter 302)",
                "location": "Section 3.2"
            },
            {
                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Upon the expiration or any termination of this Agreement, Licensor shall repay to Licensee the aggregate amount of all Royalty Advances then outstanding.",
                "changed_text": "Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Licensor may, at its sole discretion, repay to Licensee any Royalty Advances then outstanding.",
                "explanation": "This removes the mandatory obligation for Licensor to repay outstanding Royalty Advances upon termination, potentially violating implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by allowing Licensor to retain funds advanced by Licensee. This could be considered an unfair business practice.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (applicable under Delaware law, where both parties are incorporated).",
                "location": "Section 3.2"
            },
            {
                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Immediately upon written notice if the other party defaults in the performance of any obligation under this Agreement, including failure to promptly pay any amount due hereunder, and fails to cure such default within thirty (30) days after delivery of written notice specifying the default (with any termination as a result of Licensee's failure to pay amounts due under this Agreement resulting in acceleration of Licensee's obligation to pay all sums accrued and payable to Licensor under this Agreement as of the date of such termination).",
                "changed_text": "Immediately upon written notice if the other party defaults in the performance of any obligation under this Agreement, provided Licensor deems it a material breach.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'provided Licensor deems it a material breach,' the Licensor gains unilateral control over what constitutes a breach significant enough to warrant termination. This change eliminates the Licensee's right to cure certain defaults (particularly payment defaults) and also removes the automatic acceleration of payments upon termination related to payment defaults. This weakens the Licensee's rights and potentially violates principles of contract law related to fair termination clauses.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates principles of fair contract termination under Delaware contract law, specifically relating to adequate notice and opportunity to cure.",

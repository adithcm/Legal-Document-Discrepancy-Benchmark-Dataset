                "original_text": "7.4 Insurance. Medica shall at its cost obtain and maintain one or more insurance policies providing coverage of at least Euro [* * *] in the aggregate that cover Medica for fire, theft, fidelity, product liability, and any and all potential claims, suits, losses, expenses, or damages arising out of Medica's obligations under this Agreement. At Vapotherm's request to Medica from time to time, Medica shall furnish Vapotherm with certification of insurance evidencing that insurance and shall provide at least [* * *] Business Days prior written notice to Vapotherm of any cancellation of or decrease in the dollar amount of coverage provided by any such policy. Vapotherm shall have the right to maintain such insurance coverage on Vapotherm's behalf and at Vapotherm' s expense in the event of nonpayment of premiums or lapse of coverage.",
                "changed_text": "7.4 Insurance. Medica shall obtain and maintain one or more insurance policies that cover Medica for fire, theft, fidelity, product liability, and any and all potential claims, suits, losses, expenses, or damages arising out of Medica's obligations under this Agreement. Medica shall furnish Vapotherm with certification of insurance evidencing that insurance.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'at its cost,' the specific minimum coverage amount, and the advance notice requirement prior to policy cancellation significantly weaken Vapotherm's protection. The removal of Vapotherm's right to maintain insurance on Medica's behalf creates a legal contradiction as it may violate standard business practice and legal precedent regarding appropriate levels of insurance coverage in manufacturing agreements. This creates a legal risk in both the U.S. and Italy because appropriate insurance is a fundamental safeguard against liability.",

                "explanation": "By omitting 'the laws of the State of New York' the governing law is unspecified. Contract law requires a defined jurisdiction to ensure enforceability and predictability. Omitting this creates ambiguity and potential disputes, contradicting standard legal practices. Under United States law, contracts must specify a governing jurisdiction.",

The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any controversy or claim that may arise concerning their respective rights and obligations under this Agreement. If they are unable to do so within [* * *] Business Days from the date that controversy or claim arose, they shall refer the controversy or claim to the AU of Medica and the CEO of Vapotherm, who shall meet in person or telephonically within [* * *] Business Days of being requested to do so and shall in good faith attempt to resolve the dispute. If the controversy or claim cannot then be solved, the parties hereby agree first to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation administered by the American arbitration Association at its New York City offices before resorting to arbitration.",

                "explanation": "The deletion of mandatory good faith negotiation, escalation to executives, and mandatory mediation before arbitration weakens the dispute resolution process. This directly contradicts the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which encourages good faith negotiations to resolve commercial disputes, and weakens the enforceability of the dispute resolution mechanism.",

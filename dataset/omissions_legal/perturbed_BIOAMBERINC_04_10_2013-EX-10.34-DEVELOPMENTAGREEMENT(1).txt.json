                "explanation": "By removing section 1.2.4 which states 'Subject to Section 13.1, Cargill has in effect and will maintain in effect all permits, licenses and other authorizations necessary to perform the Work Plan' introduces a legal risk. This omission violates the implied warranty of compliance with laws and regulations, placing Bioamber at legal risk. Most states and federal laws require businesses to operate with all necessary permits and licenses, particularly in areas like biotechnology where environmental and safety regulations are stringent.",

If a Party is required by  court order or order of a similar governmental entity to disclose the other's Confidential Information, they shall give the other Party prompt  notice of such requirement so that an appropriate protective order or other relief may be sought.",

                "explanation": "Removing the sentence 'If a Party is required by court order or order of a similar governmental entity to disclose the other's Confidential Information, they shall give the other Party prompt notice of such requirement so that an appropriate protective order or other relief may be sought.' omits an important safeguard for confidential information. Without the notification requirement, a party could disclose confidential information under legal compulsion without allowing the other party to seek a protective order. This introduces a contradiction with standard legal practices that prioritize protecting trade secrets and confidential information where possible, potentially violating laws related to trade secret protection if confidential information is disclosed without proper legal challenge.",

                "explanation": "By removing the text 'unless such claims are based on a Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct' introduces a significant legal risk. Under Minnesota law, as stated in Section 13.2, a party cannot waive liability for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. By removing this exception, the contract now attempts to waive rights that cannot be legally waived, making the indemnification clause potentially unenforceable and violating public policy against shielding parties from liability for egregious misconduct.",

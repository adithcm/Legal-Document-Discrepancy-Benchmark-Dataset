                "changed_text": "13.1 Compliance This agreement will be subject to Datec's internal policies and the parties submit to arbitration within Datec's headquarters.",
                "explanation": "The original clause ensures compliance with the laws of Papua New Guinea and submits to the jurisdiction of its courts. The modified version replaces this with Datec's internal policies and mandatory arbitration within Datec's headquarters. This removes the consumer's right to legal recourse under Papua New Guinea law, potentially violating consumer protection laws by restricting access to the national court system and imposing a biased arbitration venue.",

If, following that period the BSP requests replacement of the person, Datec must replace that person, within 60 days with another person of suitable ability and qualifications.",
                "changed_text": "5.2 Replacement At BSP's Request BSP may request Datec to replace any of the Supplier Personnel. Datec will consider the request and make a decision based on its internal policies.",
                "explanation": "This clause originally allowed BSP to request the replacement of Datec personnel under specific conditions, particularly for breaches of security or confidentiality. The modified clause removes the mandatory replacement requirement and the stipulated timelines, giving Datec sole discretion. This could potentially violate labor laws if a Datec employee is posing a security risk, and Datec fails to act, thus failing to provide a safe working environment for BSP employees and violating their right to a secure workspace.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that the BSP provide full comprehensive replacement insurance for all assets. The modified version makes the insurance coverage discretionary. This introduces a potential legal risk because without mandatory insurance, the assets are not protected, and Datec's ability to deliver services could be severely affected if assets are damaged or lost. This violates the principle of ensuring business continuity and safeguarding assets used for service delivery, which is often implicitly required or explicitly recommended in outsourcing agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "While not a direct violation of a specific statute, this omission creates a legal risk by undermining the principles of 'duty of care' and 'reasonable commercial practice' within Papua New Guinea's commercial law framework.",

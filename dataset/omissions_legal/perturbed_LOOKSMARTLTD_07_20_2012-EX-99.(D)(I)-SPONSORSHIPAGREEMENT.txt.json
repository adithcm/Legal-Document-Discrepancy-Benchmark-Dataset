                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with, the laws of the  State of New York applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement  shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York. The  parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New  York for the purpose of any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree  not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the  above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that  the venue of the action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by any of the  above-named courts.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of a jurisdiction determined at the Purchaser's discretion. All actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration. The parties hereto agree that arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any disputes arising under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies New York law and jurisdiction, providing a level of legal certainty. The modified text removes the specification of New York law, making the governing law uncertain and potentially allowing the Purchaser to select a jurisdiction with laws less favorable to the Sponsors. Additionally, mandating binding arbitration and removing court jurisdiction eliminates the Sponsors' right to a jury trial and appeal, rights generally protected under state and federal law, and can limit discovery and other procedural safeguards. This introduces a legal contradiction by potentially violating the Sponsors' due process rights and access to courts, contradicting New York's established legal framework.",
                "contradicted_law": "Due process rights, access to courts, and potential violations of New York's contract law principles regarding fairness and enforceability.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees to resolve disputes through a method of the Purchaser's choosing.",
                "explanation": "The original waiver of jury trial is at least qualified by 'TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW'. Removing the original text and replacing it with a clause that lets the Purchaser decide the method of dispute resolution removes the Sponsors' right to a fair trial/hearing and possibly other fundamental legal protections. In New York, certain waivers of rights must be knowing and voluntary. This change introduces a legal contradiction by potentially violating New York law regarding valid waivers and fairness in dispute resolution.",

NO ACTION, REGARDLESS OF      FORM, RELATED TO TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING UNDER, OR CONTEMPLATED BY, THIS      AGREEMENT MAY BE BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER      THE CAUSE OF ACTION HAS ACCRUED.",

No action, regardless of form, related to transactions occurring under this agreement may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after the cause of action has accrued.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the explicit waiver of liability for 'INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES ARISING FROM LOSS OF BUSINESS, DATA, PROFITS OR GOODWILL)', the contract now appears less egregious in its limitations of liability. However, by keeping the overall limitation to only 'basic Monthly Maintenance Charges, for a sixty (60) day term', the agreement still significantly limits XIMAGE's potential liability. This could be challenged under California law (where XIMAGE is located) or French law (where MORPHO is located) if the limitation is deemed unconscionable or violates public policy, particularly in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct.",

                "explanation": "By removing the commitment to a '24 hour a day' facility and the 'within 30 minutes' response time, the contract introduces ambiguity regarding the level of support XIMAGE is obligated to provide. This creates a legal loophole, as the term 'reporting facility' and 'respond' are vague and lack specificity. In some jurisdictions, like California, a failure to provide reasonable support could be construed as a breach of contract, especially if the promised level of support was a significant factor in MORPHO entering the agreement.",

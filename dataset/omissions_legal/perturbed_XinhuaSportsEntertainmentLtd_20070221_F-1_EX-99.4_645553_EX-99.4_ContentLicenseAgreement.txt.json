                "explanation": "By removing subsection (d), the contract no longer explicitly warrants that the content complies with all applicable laws and regulations. This is a crucial warranty, and its removal introduces legal risk because it could potentially violate consumer protection laws or regulations in various jurisdictions where the content is distributed. The contract shifts the burden of ensuring compliance onto XFN, while CEIS avoids responsibility for legal compliance of the content. This removal also weakens consumer rights to claim for damages if the content turns out to be non-compliant with specific laws.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'together with interest from the date those sums were paid until the date of full refund' eliminates XFN's right to receive interest on any prepaid sums for the unexpired term if the agreement is terminated early. This contradicts laws and principles related to unjust enrichment. If CEIS holds onto funds for services not provided, failing to pay interest essentially provides them with an unlawful benefit at XFN's expense. This introduces a significant legal risk, especially if substantial amounts are prepaid. Consumer protection laws often address fair compensation in case of contract termination.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'to comply with applicable laws, including without limitation the laws of the People's Republic of China,' the contract weakens the explicit commitment to adhering to legal requirements, particularly those in the People's Republic of China. This omission introduces a potential legal contradiction if future laws require amendments that the contract parties are now less obligated to make. This omission increases the risk of non-compliance, particularly in the People's Republic of China. By removing this, CEIS is not explicitly making an effort to comply with new laws that come into force, thereby, giving the company a loophole of legal risk.",

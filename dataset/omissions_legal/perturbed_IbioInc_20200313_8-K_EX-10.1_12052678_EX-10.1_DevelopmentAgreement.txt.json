                "explanation": "By removing the disclaimer of implied warranties of MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, the contract becomes potentially non-compliant with consumer protection laws, particularly the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which implies these warranties in many commercial transactions unless explicitly and conspicuously disclaimed. This omission creates legal risk, especially if the products developed under this agreement are sold to consumers and fail to meet basic quality or fitness standards. Under the UCC in Texas, these disclaimers have specific requirements for conspicuousness, and removing them exposes iBio to potential liability.",

                "explanation": "By changing the clause so that each party is responsible for their own legal costs regardless of who wins the dispute, the contract is weakening the possibilities for the prevailing party to be fully compensated for being wronged. Certain consumer protection laws, may require a prevailing consumer to recover attorney's fees and costs. This shift could introduce legal challenges, particularly in cases where CC-Pharming (likely the more powerful party) sues iBio, making it financially prohibitive for iBio to defend itself even if it has a valid claim or defense. This change contradicts the intent of statutes designed to ensure fair access to justice.",

                "explanation": "By providing CC-Pharming the power of choosing the location of where disputes are resolved, there may be a chance that iBio will have to resolve any disagreements in a location that is inconvenient to them. There are consumer protection laws (depending on what this agreement is for) that protects small businesses from being taken advantage of by a corporation by ensuring that the dispute resolution must be local or in a neutral area.",

                "changed_text": "Each party may, at its discretion, carry liability insurance.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for both parties to carry sufficient liability insurance, weakening consumer protections related to damages or liabilities arising from the agreement. In California, where the agreement is governed, businesses are generally expected to maintain adequate insurance to cover potential liabilities, and removing this requirement introduces a potential legal risk, especially if the activities contemplated under the agreement cause harm to consumers or third parties.",

A copy of any notice to WPT shall also be sent to WPT Enterprises, Inc., ATTN: Legal, 1920 Main Street, Suite 1150, Irvine, CA 92614. A copy of any notice to Zynga shall also be sent to Office of the General Counsel, Zynga Inc., 699 8th Street, San Francisco, CA 94103 with a copy to legalnotices@zynga.com. Notice shall be deemed given as follows: upon delivery if sent by courier service, express mail or personal delivery; and five (5) days after the date of mailing, postage prepaid, certified or registered mail if sent by mail.",
                "changed_text": "All notices may be sent to the respective addresses of the parties. Notice shall be deemed given at the sender's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change removes specific requirements about how notices must be delivered (written form, courier, mail etc.) and when they are considered 'given'. By making the conditions vague, one party can claim the notice was sent and received while the other can refute this claim. This weakens the consumer's protection from potential losses.",

                "original_text": "In the event that either party is prevented from engaging in the marketing and promotional activities in Exhibit A manufacturing, distributing or selling the Licensed Property because of any act of God; unavoidable accident; fire, epidemic; strike, lockout, or other labor dispute; war, riot or civil commotion; act of public enemy; enactment of any rule, law, order or act of government or governmental instrumentality (whether federal, state, local or foreign); or other cause beyond such party's control, and such condition continues for a period of two (2) months or more, either party hereto shall have the right to terminate this Agreement effective at any time during the continuation of such condition by giving the other party at least thirty (30) days' notice to such effect. In such event, all payments made shall become immediately due and payable and this Agreement shall be automatically terminated.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that either party is prevented from engaging in the marketing and promotional activities in Exhibit A manufacturing, distributing or selling the Licensed Property because of any reason, either party hereto shall have the right to terminate this Agreement effective immediately. In such event, all payments made shall become immediately due and payable and this Agreement shall be automatically terminated.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly broadens the grounds for termination due to force majeure events. Originally, termination was tied to specific, extraordinary events beyond a party's control and a continuation of the condition for at least two months. Now, any reason at all can trigger termination, creating significant instability. This weakens the consumer protection because the agreement could be terminated at any moment for any reason.",

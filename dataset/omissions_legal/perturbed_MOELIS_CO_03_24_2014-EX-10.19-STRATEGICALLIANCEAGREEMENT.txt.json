This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflict of laws. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or Federal court sitting in Manhattan, New York over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The parties hereby agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail addressed to such party at the address above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any proceeding arising out of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any matter relating to the SMBC Unit-Holders' rights or obligations as Limited Partners of Moelis Holdings shall be subject to Sections 10.4 and 10.10 of the Moelis Holdings Agreement and not to this Section 15.8.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'irrevocably and unconditionally' from the submission to jurisdiction weakens the enforceability of the clause. Changing 'U.S. registered mail' to 'U.S. mail' creates legal ambiguity. By removing 'irrevocably and unconditionally,' the parties open the door for challenges to jurisdiction, potentially causing a court to rule that it lacks authority. Under New York law, waivers of jury trials must be clear and unambiguous.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York law requires an express and unambiguous waiver of the right to a jury trial. The modifications cast doubt on whether the parties genuinely intended to waive such a fundamental right.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'each person who controls SMBC Unit-Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act' significantly reduces the scope of individuals covered by the indemnification clause. This means that controlling persons, who might be held liable under securities laws, are no longer automatically protected by this clause. A parent company controlling the SMBC Unit-Holder could be exposed to liability without contractual indemnification.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \"Exchange Act\")' is removed. This weakens the explicit tie to the Exchange Act, potentially creating ambiguity about the governing regulations and diluting the responsibility for compliance.",

                "explanation": "The clause 'and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate' is removed. This weakens the obligation of each party to ensure the accuracy of their own information, potentially violating SEC regulations requiring accurate and complete filings. The second half of the conditional clause is removed to ensure the lack of individual responsibility.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party' is omitted. This removes the requirement for written notification of revocation and removes specification that the revocation only applies to the revoking party. This omission contradicts standard legal practices for contract termination and creates uncertainty, potentially conflicting with regulations related to transparency and notification in financial agreements.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the requirements for (1) maintaining insurance for a period of [***] following the agreement's termination, (2) ensuring the insurance carriers are 'reputable and financially secure' or maintaining a 'program of self-insurance reasonably satisfactory to the other Party,' and (3) specifying minimum coverage limits of not less than [***] per occurrence and in the aggregate, and (4) that Insurance shall be procured with carriers having an A.M. Best Rating of A-VII or better. These stipulations are often legally required or considered standard practice in commercial agreements to ensure sufficient protection against potential liabilities. The original text ensures a level of financial security for both parties during the term of agreement. Removing these protections makes the contract less secure and deviates from standard practice to protect the parties involved.",

In addition, in the event any payments made by Vericel pursuant to this Agreement become subject to withholding taxes under the Laws or regulations of any jurisdiction or Governmental Authority, Vericel shall deduct and withhold the amount of such taxes for the account of MediWound to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations; such amounts payable to MediWound shall be reduced by the amount of taxes deducted and withheld; and Vericel shall pay the amounts of such taxes to the proper Governmental Authority in a timely manner and transmit to MediWound an official tax certificate or other evidence of such tax obligations together with proof of payment from the relevant Governmental Authority of all amounts deducted and withheld. Any such withholding taxes required under applicable Laws or regulations to be paid or withheld shall be an expense of, and borne solely by, MediWound. Each Party agrees to cooperate with the other Party in claiming refunds or exemptions from such deductions or withholdings under any relevant agreement or treaty which is in effect. The Parties shall discuss applicable mechanisms for minimizing such taxes to the extent possible in compliance with applicable Laws. Vericel will provide MediWound with reasonable assistance to enable MediWound to recover such taxes as permitted by applicable Laws or regulations.",

By making 'any such withholding taxes...an expense of Vericel' rather than MediWound, the contract contradicts standard international tax law, where withholding taxes are typically the responsibility of the income recipient (MediWound). Moreover, it removes the obligation for the buyer to provide tax documentation and assistance, hindering the seller's ability to claim tax credits or refunds, going against standard international practice.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the time limit ([***]) for notification after learning of debarment reduces accountability and introduces the word 'may' instead of 'shall', changing the nature of notification from mandatory to optional. Also, changing 'shall immediately remove' to 'shall endeavor to remove' significantly weakens the obligation to remove debarred individuals, potentially violating regulations requiring exclusion of debarred entities from government contracts (since BARDA is mentioned earlier in the document). The words 'endeavor' and 'may' are not defined in the contract, and the removal of definitions may lead to interpretation disputes between the parties.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shad be deemed a contract made under and shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws ofthe State ofTexas and that actions arising out ofthis Agreement may be litigated in courts having situs in Harris County, Texas.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of a jurisdiction chosen by Guaranty Bank, FSB. Litigation arising from this agreement may occur in a venue selected at the discretion of Guaranty Bank, FSB.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that Texas law governs the contract and dictates venue. The modified clause removes this, allowing the bank to choose any jurisdiction and venue. This potentially deprives PrimeEnergy Corporation and Prime Offshore L.L.C. of the consumer protections afforded under Texas law, as the bank could select a jurisdiction with less favorable laws. This creates a legal risk, violating implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

Prime absolutely and unconditionally warrants to Guaranty to fund the payment to Offshore of all costs that exzeed the available  commitments under the Credit Agreement, including interest, for Project Completion. In the event Offshore is in Default under Section 7.1(f), (g),  (h) and/or (i) ofthe Credit Agreement, then Prime absolutely and unconditionally warrants to Guaranty\" the assumption of all costs for Project  Completion.",
                "changed_text": "As consideration for Guaranty entering into the Credit Agreement to provide such loans for the Development Project and to ensure Project Completion, Prime warrants to Guaranty to fund the payment to Offshore of all costs that exceed the available commitments under the Credit Agreement for Project Completion.

                "explanation": "The removal of 'absolutely and unconditionally' weakens Prime's guarantee to Guaranty. This weakens the assurance that the bank has about the completion of the project. This undermines consumer protection laws designed to ensure that the bank has the financial security for the investment.",

This required liquidity will reduce dollar-for-dollar with any additional shareholder advances and increase dollar-for-dollar with any repayment of shareholder advances. To the extent that shareholder repayment has occurred, Prime may fund additional shareholder loans.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to a specific liquidity amount ($25,000,000) and unused revolver availability and replacing 'agrees' with 'may', the clause becomes vague. This change allows Prime to avoid having an agreement to fund additional loans, this creating a significant loophole that benefits the bank (Guaranty) and weakens the protection of the consumer (Prime).",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'c) all individuals it provides to perform the Services will be appropriately qualified and subject to appropriate agreements concerning the protection of trade secrets and confidential information of which such persons may have access to over the term of this Agreement,' the contract no longer explicitly ensures the protection of AVDU's trade secrets by UTK's personnel. This omission creates a legal risk for AVDU, as it weakens the safeguards against potential misappropriation of confidential information, which could violate Florida's Uniform Trade Secrets Act and common law principles related to confidentiality and trade secret protection.",

UTK shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless AVDU from and against any and all losses incurred by AVDU which arise out of or result from misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach or non- fulfillment of any covenant contained herein or Schedules annexed hereto or in any other documents or instruments furnished by UTK pursuant hereto or in connection with this Agreement.\n\n\n\n2.

This removal significantly shifts the risk burden onto AVDU. Given that this agreement is governed by Florida law, the removal creates a potential legal issue, as it eliminates a standard protection for AVDU against UTK's potential breaches. This could be viewed as unconscionable and therefore unenforceable",

If any arbitration, litigation, action, suit, or other proceeding is instituted to remedy, prevent or obtain relief from a breach of this Agreement, in relation to a breach of this Agreement or pertaining to a declaration of rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will recover all such party's attorneys' fees incurred in each and every such action, suit or other proceeding, including any and all appeals or petitions there from. As used in this Agreement, attorneys' fees will be deemed to be the full and actual cost of any legal services actually performed in connection with the matters involved, including those related to any appeal to the enforcement of any judgment calculated on the basis of the usual fee charged by attorneys performing such services.",

As used in this Agreement, attorneys' fees will be deemed to be the cost of any legal services.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will recover all such party's attorneys' fees' to 'may recover attorneys' fees' removes a guaranteed right to attorney's fees for the prevailing party in a dispute, introducing uncertainty and potentially deterring AVDU from pursuing legitimate claims due to the risk of incurring significant legal costs without assurance of reimbursement. Additionally, modifying 'full and actual cost' to simply 'the cost' significantly lowers the compensation of the legal services. While Florida law does not always mandate attorney's fees, removing the guarantee and full compensation weakens AVDU's position, potentially violating principles of fairness and good faith in contractual relations.",

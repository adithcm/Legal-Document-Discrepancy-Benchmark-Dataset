                "original_text": "Any policyholder holding a policy issued by the Company prior to the termination of this Agreement shall have the right to demand that the Company enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement, and, if the Company fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce such rights or the Company defaults in any claim or other payment owed to any such policyholder when due, such policyholder may proceed directly against AIG to enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement; provided, however, that no policyholder of the Company may take any action authorized under this paragraph 8 unless and until (a) such policyholder has given AIG written notice of its intent to enforce the terms of this Agreement as provided in this paragraph 8, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of and basis for the policyholder's complaint and (b) AIG has failed to comply with this Agreement within sixty (60) days after such notice is given; and, provided, further, that upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with paragraph 7 hereof, the rights of any policyholder as provided for under this paragraph 8 shall terminate effective as of the Termination Date, except with respect to the obligation of AIG (if any) to make capital contributions to the Company pursuant to paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement solely to the extent such obligation arose prior to, and remained unsatisfied as of, the Termination Date (it being understood that upon AIG's satisfaction of all such obligations after the Termination Date, no such policyholder shall have any rights against the Company or AIG, as the case may be, under this paragraph 8).",

Upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with paragraph 7 hereof, the rights of any policyholder as provided for under this paragraph 8 shall terminate effective as of the Termination Date.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the policyholder's guaranteed right to demand enforcement of the agreement and replaces it with a discretionary request. It also entirely eliminates the policyholder's right to directly proceed against AIG if the Company fails to act, weakening consumer protections. This violates the principle of good faith and fair dealing implied in insurance contracts, potentially conflicting with Texas Insurance Code provisions that grant policyholders certain enforcement rights.",

Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the modification of corporate structure or sale by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M.

                "explanation": "This change removes the conditions under which AIG can terminate the agreement, giving AIG an unrestricted right to terminate. This eliminates the protection for the insurance company (and indirectly its policyholders) against termination that could negatively impact its financial stability. This introduces a legal risk as it weakens the safeguards necessary to ensure the insurance company maintains adequate capital, potentially conflicting with Texas insurance regulations.",

It replaces a defined minimum percentage based on statutory requirements with a subjective assessment by AIG, effectively removing the mandatory capital maintenance requirement.

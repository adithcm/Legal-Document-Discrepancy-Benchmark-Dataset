                "explanation": "By changing 'shall ensure' to 'shall make reasonable efforts', the contract weakens the obligation to comply with applicable laws. This introduces a legal risk because many PRC laws require strict compliance, not just 'reasonable efforts', particularly in areas like advertising. This change creates a loophole where the Licensee could argue that they made efforts but were unable to fully comply, potentially shielding them from liability.",

Licensor shall also have the right to monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority. Licensee's failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.",

Licensor may also monitor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall endeavor to remove any offending Content from such websites after it becomes aware of such offending Content. ",
                "explanation": "The deletion of 'all', weakening the monitoring and censoring obligations and eliminating the clear examples of 'offending content,' introduces ambiguity and reduces the Licensee's responsibility. Also, the removal of the deadline for content removal (timeframe prescribed by Governmental Authority) weakens content standards and creates a potential conflict with PRC's strict content regulations, which typically provide firm deadlines for content removal. Removing the statement about 'material breach' further reduces accountability and is an important component.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific disclaimers of 'warranties of merchantability, validity, noninfringement, fitness for a particular purpose,' the licensor is attempting to circumvent implied warranty obligations under the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China. While a general disclaimer might be permissible, explicitly removing these specific warranties could be challenged in a PRC court, especially if the Licensed Content or Domain Names are found to be defective or infringe on third-party rights. Also, removing the phrase  'and LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES' can lead to potential litigation and risk as a consumer may believe that Licensor is liable for possible problems or damages.",

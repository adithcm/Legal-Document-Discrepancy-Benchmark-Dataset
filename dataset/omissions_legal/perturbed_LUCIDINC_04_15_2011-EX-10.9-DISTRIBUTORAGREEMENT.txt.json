Such oral incident reporting will be followed immediately by a written incident report that documents the detailed conditions that resulted in the INCIDENT and Distributor shall thereafter co-operate with Lucid in the investigation of any and all conditions that led to, or resulted from the INCIDENT.\n\nB) DISTRIBUTOR will routinely, but not less than annually, report in writing to Lucid, documenting the end users to which PRODUCTS have been sold, including the address, telephone number and name of a person who is the primary emergency contact. Lucid will use this information in the event of Lucid issuing a product recall of the PRODUCT for safety or other reasons. If such an event occurs, and upon Lucid's request, the DISTRIBUTOR will immediately provide Lucid with the names, addresses, telephone numbers and emergency contact personnel of any end user sites not previously reported to Lucid.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the immediate reporting requirement for incidents affecting patient safety and well-being eliminates an essential safety measure and traceability requirement. By deleting 'via telephone communication', 'that affect patient safety or well-being', 'Such oral incident reporting will be followed immediately by a written incident report that documents the detailed conditions that resulted in the INCIDENT', 'routinely, but not less than annually', 'including the address, telephone number and name of a person who is the primary emergency contact' and 'not previously reported to Lucid' is a significant omission and creates a legal risk, as it weakens the manufacturer's ability to track products and respond quickly to safety concerns as required by FDA regulations for medical devices.",

The New York law generally does not allow companies to exclude liability for gross negligence or intentional misconduct. By removing the carve-out for death or personal injury the distributor is waiving all of its rights for this case. This is an attempt to eliminate any avenue for the distributor to recover damages, creating a legal risk of being unenforceable.",

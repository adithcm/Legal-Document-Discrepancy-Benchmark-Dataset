Each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such Action by the delivery of such process to such Party at the address and in the manner provided in Section 13.3 hereof.

                "explanation": "By omitting the specific reference to the Court of Chancery and limiting the consent to 'the courts of the State of Delaware,' the clause removes the explicit waiver of objections to venue and the agreement not to claim an inconvenient forum. While Delaware law would still likely govern, the omission could introduce legal risk by allowing a party to later challenge the chosen venue, potentially increasing litigation costs and uncertainty.",

This significantly alters the dispute resolution landscape, as jury trials can be more unpredictable and expensive than bench trials. This introduces a legal risk, as the parties have lost a contractual mechanism to streamline dispute resolution. This deletion goes against the intent of the original agreement.",

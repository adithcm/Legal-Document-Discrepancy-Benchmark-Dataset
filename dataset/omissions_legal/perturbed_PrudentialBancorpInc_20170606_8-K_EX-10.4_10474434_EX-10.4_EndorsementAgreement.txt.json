If a claim request is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator will furnish to the Claimant a notice of the decision within 90 days in writing and in a manner calculated to the understood by the Claimant, which notice will contain the following information: (a) The specific reason or reasons for the denial; (b) Specific reference to the pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial is based; (c) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the Claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and (d) An explanation of the Plan's claims review procedure describing the steps to be taken by a Claimant who wishes to submit his claim for review.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the legally required detailed explanation of claim denial, including specific reasons, reference to plan provisions, and a description of the review procedure. By omitting these details, the contract fails to comply with ERISA regulations (29 CFR 2560.503-1) which mandate specific information be provided to claimants regarding denied claims to ensure fair and transparent claims processing.",

                "original_text": "(3) Review Procedure. A Claimant or his authorized representative may with respect to any denied claim: (a) Request a review upon written application filed within 60 days after receipt by the Claimant of notice of the denial of his claim; (b) Review pertinent documents; and (c) Submit issues and comments in writing",
                "changed_text": "(3) Review Procedure. A Claimant may request a review of a denied claim.",
                "explanation": "By removing the claimant's right to 'Review pertinent documents' and 'Submit issues and comments in writing', this change violates ERISA's requirement for a full and fair review process. ERISA mandates that claimants have access to information relevant to their claim and the opportunity to present their case in writing. Omitting these rights undermines the claimant's ability to challenge the denial effectively.",

The Named Fiduciary (or its designee) will render a decision upon review of a denied claim within 60 days after receipt of a request for review. If special circumstances warrant additional time, the decision will be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than 120 days after receipt of request for review. Written notice of any such extension will be furnished to the Claimant prior to the commencement of the Extension. The decision on review will be in writing and will include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant, as well as specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Plan on which the decision is based. If the decision on review is not furnished to the Claimant within the time limits prescribed above, the claim will be deemed denied on review.",
                "changed_text": "(4) Decision on Review. The Named Fiduciary (or its designee) will render a decision upon review of a denied claim. The decision on review may include reasons for the decision.",
                "explanation": "This omission removes the requirement for a timely decision (60-120 days), written notice of extension, and specific reasons for the decision on review. It also eliminates the provision that a claim is 'deemed denied on review' if a decision isn't furnished within the prescribed time limits. These changes contradict ERISA's requirements for prompt and transparent claims processing, leaving the claimant without recourse if a decision is delayed indefinitely or lacks proper justification.",

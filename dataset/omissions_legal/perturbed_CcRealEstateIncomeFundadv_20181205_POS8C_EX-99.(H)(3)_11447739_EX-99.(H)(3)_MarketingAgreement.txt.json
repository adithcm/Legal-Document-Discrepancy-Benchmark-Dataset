                "changed_text": "S2K shall perform distribution-related activities for which such payments are appropriate.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'under all applicable rules and regulations' and 'shall make such occasional certification as required by the Distributor to such effect' eliminates S2K's explicit obligation to comply with distribution regulations and certify compliance, creating a potential violation of SEC and FINRA rules requiring due diligence and compliance certifications in securities distribution. This introduces a legal risk related to regulatory compliance.",

                "changed_text": "(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, S2K shall be entitled to receive fees or compensation.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the clause that limits fees and compensation, the contract creates a situation where S2K could potentially receive compensation that exceeds FINRA limits, contradicting FINRA regulations on sales charges.",

                "changed_text": "(xiii) S2K understands and agrees to the terms outlined in this agreement.",
                "explanation": "Removing this sentence suggests that S2K's responsibilities are defined solely by the contract, potentially neglecting external legal obligations. The new sentence serves to enforce the specific content of the agreement and nothing else. This could lead to violations of securities laws or other regulations that S2K would otherwise be responsible for, even if not explicitly stated in the agreement.",

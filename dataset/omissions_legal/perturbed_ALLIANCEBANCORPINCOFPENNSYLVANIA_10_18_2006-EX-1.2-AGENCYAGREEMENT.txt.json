                "explanation": "The original text states deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC 'up to the applicable limits,' which is a legally mandated consumer protection. The modified text removes this guarantee and replaces it with 'may be insured'. This introduces legal risk because federal law requires FDIC insurance for bank deposits up to a certain limit. Also, replacing 'is' with 'may be' regarding the 'qualified thrift lender' status removes a guarantee.",

                "explanation": "The original text guarantees a full refund with interest if the minimum securities are not sold. The modification replaces 'shall refund' with 'may refund' and removes 'the full amount' and removes 'together with interest as provided in the Prospectus'. This creates a legal contradiction because securities laws often mandate the return of funds with interest if an offering fails to meet its minimum requirements. The change introduces legal risk by weakening investor protections.",

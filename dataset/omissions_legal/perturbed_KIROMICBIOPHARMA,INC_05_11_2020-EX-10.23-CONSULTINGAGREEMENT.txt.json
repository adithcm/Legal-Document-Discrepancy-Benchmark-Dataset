                "original_text": "Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement or breach thereof, shall be settled by binding arbitration controlled by the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The number of arbitrator(s) shall be one. The seat of arbitration shall be Houston, Texas. Texas law shall also apply to the extent necessary to fill any gaps created by the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the parties. Judgement of the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered into any court of competent jurisdiction. If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is held illegal or unenforceable in a arbitration proceeding, such provision shall be severed and shall be inoperative, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain operative and binding on the Parties. The arbitrator(s) shall have sole kompetenz-kompetenz regarding this Arbitration Agreement.",

The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the parties. Judgement of the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered into any court of competent jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'binding arbitration controlled by the rules of the American Arbitration Association' and several other phrases, we eliminate the specific framework for arbitration, and remove the part about severability. While arbitration is still mentioned, the lack of detail makes enforcement unclear and potentially violates requirements for clear and fair arbitration agreements under Texas law. The removal of the severability clause related to the Arbitration Agreement means the entire arbitration section is at risk if any part is deemed illegal.",

                "changed_text": "Consultants may be given notice of any adjustments to compensation prior to adjustments becoming effective.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'written' and 'at least fourteen (14) days' significantly weakens the notice requirement. Texas law, while not explicitly mandating a specific notice period for consultants, implies a 'reasonable' notice period for changes in compensation. Removing the fourteen-day written notice creates ambiguity and could be deemed unreasonable, thereby creating a legal risk.",

                "changed_text": "Company shall pay all amounts owing to Consultant for unpaid Services completed by Consultant and related expenses, if any, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 hereof.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'within thirty (30) days after receipt of Consultant's final statement' eliminates a crucial payment deadline. This creates ambiguity and can be seen as a violation of prompt payment principles. Furthermore, the removal of 'Sections 2, 3, S(c), 6, 7, 8 and 10 shall survive termination of this Agreement' removes the consultant's protection under several sections of the document that would now cease immediately.",

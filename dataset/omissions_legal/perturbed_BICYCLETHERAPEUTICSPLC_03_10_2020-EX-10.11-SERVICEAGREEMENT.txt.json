Such payment shall be inclusive of any statutory sick pay due in accordance with applicable legislation in force at the time of absence. The Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, extend the period of allowance in an individual case if the circumstances so justify. Thereafter, the Company shall pay statutory sick pay or equivalent benefit to which you may be entitled subject to your compliance with the appropriate rules.",

                "explanation": "By removing the provision where the employee can terminate the agreement with a six month notice the contract is now non-compliant as UK law protects employees from unfair dismissal and allows employees the ability to leave their role within a reasonable time frame, as they are not working as a slave for the company.

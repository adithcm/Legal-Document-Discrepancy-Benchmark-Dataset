Upon the latter of (A) Lessor's receipt of the Purchase Documentation or (B) the satisfaction of all conditions precedent on or after the applicable Lease Commencement Date, Lessor shall pay the Supplier or reimburse the Company, as the case may be, for the aggregate Purchase Price for all Equipment purchased hereunder in connection with such schedule.",

Upon Lessor's receipt of the Purchase Documentation, Lessor may pay the Supplier or reimburse the Company for Equipment purchased hereunder in connection with such schedule.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates specific documentation requirements and Lessor's obligation to pay upon fulfillment. The modified clause removes Lessor's obligation to pay, introducing ambiguity. The original clause mandates specific documentation requirements. The modified clause significantly weakens Lessor's obligation to pay, making it discretionary and removing requirements for Purchase Price evidence. This could potentially allow Lessor to delay or deny payment without clear justification, creating a legal risk for suppliers.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires 30 days' notice for termination and ensures that the termination of the agency agreement does not affect existing equipment leases. The modified clause removes the notice period and states that termination will terminate equipment leases, potentially violating lease agreements that are still in effect. This creates potential breach of contract issues, especially if equipment leases have specific terms and conditions regarding early termination penalties.",

The modified clause removes the requirement for written notice, thus potentially violating standard legal practices and fairness principles, where a notice and cure period are usually provided. The omission also increases legal risks because lack of written notice can lead to disputes over whether the termination was justified and properly communicated.",

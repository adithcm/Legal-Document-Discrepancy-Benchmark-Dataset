The obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Limited Power of Attorney with respect to actions taken by FASC on behalf of the Adviser during the term of this Limited Power of Attorney.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless FASC and its trustees, officers and employees (each of the foregoing an \"Indemnified Party\" and collectively the \"Indemnified Parties\") against and from any and all losses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments and suits and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Party arising out of or in connection with this Limited Power of Attorney or any other agreement, instrument or document executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, including the costs, expenses and disbursements in connection with defending such Indemnified Party against any claim or liability related to the exercise or performance of any of FASC's powers or duties under this Limited Power of Attorney or any of the other agreements, instruments or documents executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, or the taking of any action under or in connection with any of the foregoing. The obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Limited Power of Attorney with respect to actions taken by FASC on behalf of the Adviser during the term of this Limited Power of Attorney.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the phrase \"other than as a consequence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Indemnified Party\" eliminates an important protection for the Adviser. Pennsylvania law generally does not allow indemnification for gross negligence or willful misconduct; removing this provision potentially forces the Adviser to indemnify FASC even in cases of FASC's own gross negligence or willful misconduct, contradicting public policy.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the phrase \", as FASC assumes no personal liability whatsoever for obligations of the Fund entered into by FASC in its capacity as attorney-in-fact for the Adviser.\" could be interpreted as an attempt to obscure FASC's limited liability. While FASC acts as an agent, some jurisdictions might hold an agent liable if they fail to adequately disclose the principal. This omission can introduce legal ambiguity and potentially contradict legal standards regarding agent liability and disclosure.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause \"unless such person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity has received prior written notice from the Adviser that this Limited Power of Attorney has been revoked.\" effectively makes it impossible for third parties to be held responsible, even if they have been informed of the revocation. This directly contradicts standard principles that impose a duty of care when one is aware of limitations on an agent's authority.",

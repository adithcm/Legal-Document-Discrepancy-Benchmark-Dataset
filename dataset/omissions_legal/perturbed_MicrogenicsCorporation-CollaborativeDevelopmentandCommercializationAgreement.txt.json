                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each Party shall comply with all applicable GLP, GCP, GMP, ISO 9001 and ISO 13485:2003 requirements and other Applicable Laws in the conduct of the Research Program and in the activities contemplated under this Agreement, including the development, manufacture and commercialization of the Assay.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with GLP, GCP and GMP requirements in the conduct of the Research Program and in the activities contemplated under this Agreement, including the development, manufacture and commercialization of the Assay.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall comply with all applicable' to 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with' this modification weakens the obligation to adhere to GLP, GCP, and GMP standards. These standards are legally required for clinical trials and pharmaceutical manufacturing. Reducing the commitment to 'commercially reasonable efforts' introduces legal risk, as it may not fulfill the stringent requirements mandated by regulatory bodies like the FDA.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56, 58, 210, 211, and similar international regulations",

                "changed_text": "Microgenics shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that all Assay packaging and labeling are generally consistent with industry standards.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for 'compliance with Regulatory Approvals and Applicable Law' in favor of 'generally consistent with industry standards' significantly lowers the bar. This is problematic because regulatory approvals and applicable laws mandate specific labeling requirements to ensure patient safety and proper use of the assay. This creates a contradiction with regulatory mandates, potentially leading to misbranded or mislabeled products.",

                "changed_text": "it shall make reasonable efforts to comply with Applicable Laws relating to its activities under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall make reasonable efforts to comply' introduces ambiguity and weakens the commitment to adhering to applicable laws. This poses a legal risk because various regulations, such as those governing data privacy, export controls, and anti-corruption, require strict compliance, not just 'reasonable efforts.' This change is inconsistent with legal and regulatory expectations.",

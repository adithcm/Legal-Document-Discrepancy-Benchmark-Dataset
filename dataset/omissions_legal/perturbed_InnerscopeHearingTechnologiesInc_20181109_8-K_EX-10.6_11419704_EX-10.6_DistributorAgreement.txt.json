                "original_text": "b. Erchonia shall submit invoices to Distributor after or concurrent with shipment of Products to Distributor at the delivery address. Distributor shall pay half (1/2) of the purchase price prior to shipment and the remaining balance 30 days after shipment of the Products. Payments received after the 30 day calendar period will be subject to a late fee of 1.5% of the invoice amount. All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "changed_text": "b. Erchonia shall submit invoices to Distributor after or concurrent with shipment of Products to Distributor at the delivery address. Distributor shall pay the purchase price according to a schedule determined by Erchonia. Payments received after a period will be subject to a late fee determined by Erchonia. All payments shall be made in a currency determined by Erchonia.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the specific payment terms, including the 30-day payment window and the fixed 1.5% late fee. This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty, potentially violating California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires that the terms of a contract be reasonably certain. The removal of U.S. Dollars enables payments to occur in any currency, and further increases the legal risk to the distributor. This is significant legal risk.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, but the change is that now Erchonia does not allow the warranty accompanying the Products. By removing the text referencing that warranty, Erchonia has no warranty and is disclaiming all representations and warranties. In California, these implied warranties are crucial for protecting distributors from defective products. Removing the warranty and disclaimer introduces legal risk under California's implied warranty laws.",

                "explanation": "This change replaces the language, removing reference of settlement in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The removal of the AAA introduces uncertainty and potentially allows Erchonia to control the arbitration process, raising concerns about fairness and impartiality.

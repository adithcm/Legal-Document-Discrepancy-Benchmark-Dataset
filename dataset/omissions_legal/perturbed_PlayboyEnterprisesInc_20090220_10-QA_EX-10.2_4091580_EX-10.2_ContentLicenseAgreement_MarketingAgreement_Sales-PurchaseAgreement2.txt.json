                "original_text": "Supplier will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and Playboy and the distributors and dealers and the officers and employees of each of the foregoing against all liability whatsoever which may be incurred by them or any of them as a result of any alleged defects in material or workmanship in the merchandise covered by this Contract.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier will indemnify Purchaser against liability incurred as a result of defects in workmanship in the merchandise covered by this Contract, provided such defects are directly caused by the Supplier's gross negligence.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the obligation for the supplier to defend and hold harmless Playboy, its distributors, dealers, officers, and employees from liability. It also significantly narrows the indemnification obligation by limiting it to defects directly caused by the supplier's gross negligence. This weakens the protection afforded to Playboy, potentially violating the duty to ensure product safety standards and liability coverage, and introduces a legal contradiction with standard product liability laws which often do not require proof of gross negligence.",

                "explanation": "This change removes Playboy's right to request the delivery or destruction of molds, designs, or other elements used in reproducing Playboy Properties. This could be problematic if Purchaser fails to adequately control the disposal of these items, potentially leading to unauthorized use or counterfeiting of Playboy's intellectual property. This violates intellectual property protection standards.",

                "changed_text": "This Contract, when attached to a purchase order, shall consist of the agreement between the parties.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'shall supersede any conflicting or contrary terms and conditions of any purchase order or other order form whether supplied by Purchaser or Supplier', it creates ambiguity as to which terms govern the agreement. Standard contract law dictates that the entire agreement should be clearly defined. The omission introduces legal risk by allowing conflicting terms to potentially be enforced. This weakens the enforceability of the contract.",

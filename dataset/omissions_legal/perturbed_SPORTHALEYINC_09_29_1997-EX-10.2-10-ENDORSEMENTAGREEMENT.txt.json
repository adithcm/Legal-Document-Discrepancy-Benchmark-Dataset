                "original_text": "In the event of any dispute which arises between the parties\nand which relates to the subject matter of this Agreement, the parties\nacknowledge and agree that any such dispute shall be submitted for\nbinding arbitration in accordance with the arbitration procedures\nestablished by the American arbitration Association in Denver,\nColorado.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'binding' and the reference to the American Arbitration Association's procedures, the clause now permits non-binding arbitration. This omission can be problematic because Colorado law, while generally favoring arbitration, has specific requirements for ensuring fairness and transparency in *binding* arbitration agreements, particularly concerning consumer rights. Making the arbitration non-binding essentially removes the consumer's right to a guaranteed final resolution through a structured process.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 90-day limitation on using the Professional's image after the contract terminates creates a potential legal issue. Colorado law recognizes a 'right of publicity,' protecting individuals from unauthorized commercial use of their likeness, especially after a contract governing such use expires. By omitting the restriction, the company could be seen as infringing on the Professional's right of publicity, even if the original contract granted usage rights during its term.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirements that notices be 'signed by the sender' and 'delivered by registered or certified mail' weakens the notice provision. Colorado law, in general contract principles, often requires clear and demonstrable proof of notice, especially for important matters like contract breaches or termination. By removing these requirements, it becomes more difficult to prove that a party actually received notice, which could lead to disputes about whether a notice was properly given and thus whether certain contractual obligations were triggered.",

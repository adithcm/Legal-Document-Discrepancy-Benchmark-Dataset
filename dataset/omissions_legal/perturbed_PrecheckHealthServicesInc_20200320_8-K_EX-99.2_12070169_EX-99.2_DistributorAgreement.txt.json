                "changed_text": "The Distributor represents and warrants that the Distributor shall conduct business in conformity with the Principal's internal policies.",
                "explanation": "Removing the distributor's obligation to comply with local, state, and federal laws and replacing it with adherence to the Principal's internal policies introduces legal risk. This is because the Principal's internal policies might not align with legal requirements, potentially leading the distributor to violate laws without realizing it. This creates a legal contradiction because businesses are legally required to adhere to all laws and regulations in the jurisdiction they operate in.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by jurisdiction, but generally all business operation and compliance laws at the local, state, and federal levels, including but not limited to consumer protection laws, anti-discrimination laws, and environmental regulations.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of termination, the Principal may, at its sole discretion, allow the Distributor to fulfill orders accepted by the Principal prior to the date of termination. Payment terms will be determined by the Principal.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the guaranteed right of the distributor to fulfill orders accepted before termination and gives the Principal complete discretion. It also removes the condition that payment be made upon shipment. This contradicts general contract law principles and the concept of 'good faith and fair dealing,' which are implied in most commercial contracts. By potentially preventing the distributor from fulfilling already accepted orders, the Principal could be seen as unfairly interfering with the distributor's ability to recoup its investment, therefore impacting the revenue generated by the products.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with principles of conflicts of laws as determined by the Principal.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific governing law (Texas) and replacing it with 'principles of conflicts of laws as determined by the Principal' creates significant legal uncertainty. This allows the Principal to potentially choose laws that are most favorable to them in any dispute, even if those laws would not normally apply. This creates a legal contradiction since a fair agreement would specify an independent, neutral jurisdiction.",

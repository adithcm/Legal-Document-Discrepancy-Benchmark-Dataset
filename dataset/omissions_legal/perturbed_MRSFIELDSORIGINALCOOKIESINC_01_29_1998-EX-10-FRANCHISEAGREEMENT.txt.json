Best  Company  rating of \"A-\" or better and naming  Pretzel  Time an  additional insured,  insurance  against all types of public  liability with personal injury coverage and property damage coverage. In addition to coverage as aforesaid such insurance  shall  include  coverages as set forth in the  Operations  Manual and shall contain a provision  obligating  all insurers to provide a written  notice Pretzel Time of any  cancellation  or  modification  of coverage at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such modification or cancellation.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'in form, amounts and with insurers satisfactory to Pretzel Time, which insurers must have an A.M. Best Company rating of \"A-\" or better' eliminates the franchisor's control over insurance, creating risk. The omission of 'naming Pretzel Time an additional insured' creates significant legal and financial risk for the franchisor. The elimination of the requirement obligating insurers to provide written notice of cancellation/modification removes a key monitoring mechanism, potentially leaving the franchisor exposed. This creates a legal contradiction to standard business practices and potentially violates implied duties of good faith.",

A Unit  shall be under  the  direct,  on-premises  supervision  of a  trained  and competent  Franchisee  or a  trained  and  competent  employee  acting as a Unit Manager  at  all  times.

Pretzel  Time shall have the right to deal with the Unit  Manager and  assistant managers on matters  pertaining to the  day-to-day  operations of, and reporting requirements  for the Unit.  Franchisee shall be required to notify Pretzel Time within seven (7) business days of changing Unit Managers.

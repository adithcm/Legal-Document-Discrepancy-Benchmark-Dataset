                "explanation": "The removal of the clause 'Network shall provide full-time closed captioning for the Service in all programming and at all times for which captioning is required by applicable law as applied to the Service' eliminates the legal requirement to provide closed captioning. This introduces a legal risk in the United States, where the FCC mandates closed captioning for most television programming.",

                "explanation": "The deletion of 'PUNITIVE' from the limitation of liability clause eliminates a protection usually afforded. Punitive damages are intended to punish the defendant and are awarded in addition to compensatory damages. This changes the risk allocation.  If a party's behavior is particularly egregious, they might be subject to punitive damages, where the original contract protects against it.",

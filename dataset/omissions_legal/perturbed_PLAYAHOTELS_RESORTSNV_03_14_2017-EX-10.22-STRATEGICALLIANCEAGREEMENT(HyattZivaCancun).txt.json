Except to the extent governed by the Federal Arbitration Act or other federal law, this Agreement and all claims arising from the relationship between Hyatt (and/or any of its Affiliates) and Playa (and/or any of its Affiliates) under this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois (U.S.A.), without regard to its conflict of laws rules, except that any Illinois law or any other law regulating the offer or sale of franchises, business opportunities, or similar interests, or governing the relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee or any similar relationship, will not apply unless its jurisdictional requirements are met independently without reference to this Section 4.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'except that any Illinois law or any other law regulating the offer or sale of franchises, business opportunities, or similar interests, or governing the relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee or any similar relationship, will not apply unless its jurisdictional requirements are met independently without reference to this Section 4', the contract becomes non-compliant with franchise laws. Franchise laws are designed to protect franchisees from unfair practices by franchisors, including providing certain disclosures and adhering to specific regulations. This omission seeks to bypass those regulations.",

Both Parties acknowledge that they are experienced in negotiating agreements of this sort, and have had the advice of counsel in connection with, and fully understand the nature of, the waiver contained in this Section 14', the contract removes acknowledgement of legal counsel and understanding of rights being waived. This creates an imbalance of power and weakens safeguards in place. In some jurisdictions, such a broad waiver of damages, especially without explicit acknowledgement of understanding and counsel, may be challenged, particularly if one party has significantly more bargaining power.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'and each Party acknowledges that the other Party will not make' the contract implies that the party does not agree to abstain from corrupt practices. While seemingly a minor change, removing this crucial acknowledgment from both sentences significantly weakens the enforceability of the anti-corruption clause. The removed acknowledgement acted as a mutual guarantee against such behavior, and its absence increases the risk that one party might engage in corrupt practices without clear repercussions under the contract.",

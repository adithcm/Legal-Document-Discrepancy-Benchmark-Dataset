                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty and gives Chase the discretion to not pay fees for approved credit card accounts, undermining the affiliate's expectation of payment for their services. This creates a potential legal risk, as it weakens the enforceability of the agreement and could be seen as an unfair business practice.",

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the amount of Commissions, the definition of Approved Accounts, and all other provisions of this Agreement are subject to change without notice other than posting such information on the Chase Website. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO AFFILIATE, THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT. AFFILIATE'S CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM FOLLOWING CHASE'S POSTING OF A NEW AGREEMENT ON ITS WEB SITE WILL CONSTITUTE BINDING ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE.",

                "explanation": "By removing the affiliate's right to terminate the agreement if modifications are unacceptable, this clause becomes potentially unconscionable and unenforceable, especially if the changes are substantial and detrimental to the affiliate. This omission contradicts the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, potentially violating contract law principles. In most jurisdictions, contracts require mutual assent and fairness, and this clause creates a significant imbalance of power.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the affiliate's acknowledgement of having the opportunity to consult with legal counsel and significantly limits their ability to challenge the contract's enforceability on grounds of it being a contract of adhesion or unconscionable. While not a direct violation, it could be seen as an attempt to circumvent legal challenges based on unequal bargaining power and fairness, potentially violating principles of contract law.",

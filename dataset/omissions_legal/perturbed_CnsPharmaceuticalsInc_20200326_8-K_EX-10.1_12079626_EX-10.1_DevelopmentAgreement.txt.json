                "original_text": "WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) will at all times during the Term be in material compliance with all applicable data privacy and security laws and regulations, and WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) have taken or will take commercially reasonable actions to comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") (EU 2016/679) and all other applicable laws and regulations with respect to Personal Data (defined below) that have been announced as of the date hereof as becoming effective within 12 months after the date hereof, and for which any non-compliance with same would be reasonably likely to create a material liability (collectively, the \"Privacy Laws\"). To WPD's knowledge, WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) have been and currently are in material compliance with the GDPR. To ensure material compliance with the Privacy Laws, WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) have taken, and currently take, commercially reasonable steps reasonably designed to ensure compliance in all material respects with Privacy Laws relating to data privacy and security and the collection, storage, use, disclosure, handling, and analysis of Personal Data that WPD has collected, and collects, or is in WPD's possession or will be in WPD's possession during the Term. \"Personal Data\" means \"personal data\" as defined by GDPR.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the 'material compliance' requirement and the specific mention of GDPR weakens the data protection obligations. The phrase 'commercially reasonable actions' is replaced with 'reasonable efforts,' further diluting the standard of care. This creates a legal contradiction because, depending on the jurisdiction (especially within the EU), companies are legally obligated to ensure 'material compliance' with GDPR, not merely make 'reasonable efforts'.",

                "explanation": "The clause \"maintained, and will maintain, and keep in full force and effect\" has been removed. This omission is significant because it removes the explicit obligation to *maintain* all necessary agreements, permits, and licenses throughout the term of the contract. Further, the guarantee that subcontractors will also comply has been removed, opening the possibility that WPD need not ensure its partners are compliant. This directly contradicts legal requirements in Texas and at the federal level (e.g., environmental regulations, pharmaceutical regulations) that demand continuous compliance, not just initial acquisition, of permits and licenses.",

While WPD still agrees to *comply* with the FCPA, it is no longer explicitly obligated to establish and maintain internal controls designed to prevent violations. This absence of preventative measures can be seen as a violation of the spirit, if not the explicit letter, of the FCPA compliance requirements expected of companies doing business with US entities.",

Each of the Parties hereby agrees that it shall not assert and shall hereby waive any claim or right or defense that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, that the venue is improper, that the forum is inconvenient or any similar objection, claim or argument. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any legal proceeding resolved in accordance with this Section 11.03, Section 11.04, Section 11.05 and Section 11.06 shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'irrevocably', 'exclusive', 'state or federal court sitting in New York City in the State of New York', 'respective Affiliates, successors and assigns under or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including their execution, performance or enforcement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise', 'Each of the Parties hereby agrees that it shall not assert and shall hereby waive any claim or right or defense that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, that the venue is improper, that the forum is inconvenient or any similar objection, claim or argument', and 'or in any other manner provided by applicable Law' significantly weakens the jurisdiction clause. By removing irrevocably and exclusive jurisdiction, there is a legal contradiction where both parties can claim jurisdiction to other states. ",

                "explanation": "By omitting the explicit statement that 'THIS SECTION HAS BEEN FULLY DISCUSSED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES AND THESE PROVISIONS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY EXCEPTIONS.' This omission is significant because the enforceability of jury waivers is often dependent on demonstrating that the waiver was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. By removing the clear assertion of full discussion, the enforceability of the waiver becomes questionable, introducing legal risk. It is a legal contradiction because not all parties have the capacity to give a valid jury trial, hence should go to trial by judge.",

In particular, by removing the waiver of the argument that money damages are adequate, the other party can raise this defense, making it harder to obtain specific performance.

If Maimon should become unable to serve as CEO, or should fail to perform any of the obligations hereunder for any cause including death or disability, always in the sole judgment and decision of the Company, then the Company shall have the right to terminate this agreement on five days prior written notice. Maimon shall have the right to resign at any time upon 30 days prior written notice.

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'including death or disability' and 'Maimon shall have the right to resign at any time upon 30 days prior written notice', the contract now lacks explicit protection for Maimon in case of disability or death. This could violate New York law regarding fair labor practices and disability accommodations, potentially making the termination clause legally questionable. It also violates employee rights to resign, which would be considered 'constructive dismissal'.",

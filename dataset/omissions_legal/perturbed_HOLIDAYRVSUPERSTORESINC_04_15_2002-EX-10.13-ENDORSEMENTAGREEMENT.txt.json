If the Company promptly notifies AGI in writing of a third party claim against the Company alleging that the Company's use of the Trademarks infringes a United States registered trademark, and if such claim of infringement is not caused in whole or in part by the Company having used the Trademarks other than for the Approved Use or other than strictly in the manner approved by AGI in accordance with the terms of this -1- Agreement, AGI will defend such claim at its expense and will indemnify the Company, its agents and representatives, for all losses, claims, charges, costs and expenses incurred by the Company as a result of such claim.",

If the Company promptly notifies AGI in writing of a third party claim against the Company alleging that the Company's use of the Trademarks infringes a United States registered trademark, AGI will defend such claim.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'provided that the Company uses the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such grant will not infringe upon the rights of any other party' and 'if such claim of infringement is not caused in whole or in part by the Company having used the Trademarks other than for the Approved Use or other than strictly in the manner approved by AGI in accordance with the terms of this -1- Agreement' and 'at its expense and will indemnify the Company, its agents and representatives, for all losses, claims, charges, costs and expenses incurred by the Company as a result of such claim', AGI no longer guarantees non-infringement if the Company deviates from approved usage and removes AGI's obligation to cover all associated costs, introducing significant legal risk for the Company, potentially violating consumer protection laws regarding false advertising or misleading endorsements under California law.",

                "changed_text": "In the event that the Company desires to terminate the Agreement prior to the Termination Date, it shall provide AGI with written notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The omission of 'at least 60 days prior' and 'and this Agreement shall so terminate following the expiration of this 60-day period, without any further responsibility by either Party except as provided in Section 5' removes the mandatory notice period for termination by the Company. This alters the termination terms, potentially allowing AGI to claim damages for premature termination under California contract law, where 'good faith and fair dealing' are implied, and abrupt termination without reasonable notice could be deemed a breach. This creates legal risk.",

                "explanation": "The deletion of 'At least three business days prior to the dissemination of any such public announcement or filing containing the above-required description, the Company shall submit to AGI for its review and comment the proposed public announcement or description. AGI shall thereafter have three business days within which to submit its editions or amendments to the public announcement and/or description for inclusion therein, and the Company shall in its reasonable judgment and subject to the advice of its counsel attempt to incorporate such editions and amendments in the final version disseminated by the Company' removes the obligation for the Company to seek AGI's approval before releasing public announcements, eliminating a crucial control AGI has over its brand image. Omitting this can lead to the Company misrepresenting the endorsement or the License, which might violate consumer protection laws against deceptive marketing practices under California law.",

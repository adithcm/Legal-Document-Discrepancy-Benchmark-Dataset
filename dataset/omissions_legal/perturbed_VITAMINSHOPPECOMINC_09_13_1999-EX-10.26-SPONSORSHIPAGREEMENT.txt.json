                "original_text": "Advertising banners will be served, tracked and reported by Excite's subsidiary, MatchLogic, Inc. (\"MatchLogic\") as described in Exhibit B.  MatchLogic will also provide Client with feedback as to comparisons of the performance of (i) the different creative messages supplied by Client for the advertising banners, (ii) the placements of those advertising banners on the Excite Network as set forth in this Agreement and (iii) through the implementation of MatchLogic's Closed Loop transaction reporting system on the Client Site, will report on correlations between transaction activity by users referred to the Client Site from the Excite Network and the various promotional placements and advertising displayed on the Excite Network, all as described in Exhibit B.  Promotional placements, including text links, will be served, tracked and reported by Excite.  These promotional placements will be tracked and reported by MatchLogic when this implementation becomes available.  Excite will provide Client with monthly reports substantiating the number of impressions of Client's advertising banners and promotional placements displayed on the Excite Network.",
                "changed_text": "Advertising banners will be served and tracked by Excite's subsidiary, MatchLogic, Inc. (\"MatchLogic\") as described in Exhibit B. MatchLogic may provide feedback as to the performance of the advertising banners. Promotional placements, including text links, will be served and tracked by Excite. Excite may provide Client with reports on the number of impressions of Client's advertising banners and promotional placements displayed on the Excite Network.",
                "explanation": "The modified text removes the explicit obligation for MatchLogic to provide feedback on banner performance and correlations between user activity and promotional placements. It also changes the requirement for monthly reports to a discretionary provision. This negatively impacts the client's ability to effectively measure campaign performance and optimize their investment, which can be considered a violation of good faith practices, especially under California's consumer protection laws regarding transparency in advertising, violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "Client will maintain accurate records with respect to the calculation of all payments due under this Agreement.  Once per year, the parties will review these records to verify the accuracy and appropriate accounting of all payments made pursuant to the Agreement.  In addition, Excite may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Client, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect the records of Client reasonably related to the calculation of such payments during Client's normal business hours.  The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in connection with the inspection will be paid by Excite unless the payments made to Excite are determined to have been less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the payments actually owed to Excite, in which case Client will be responsible for the payment of the reasonable fees for such inspection.",
                "changed_text": "Client will maintain records with respect to the calculation of payments due under this Agreement. Excite may inspect the records of Client related to the calculation of such payments during Client's normal business hours.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a structured process for verifying payment accuracy, including an annual review and the option for an independent audit under specific conditions. The modified version removes the annual review and the conditions under which Excite would bear the cost of an audit. This weakens the client's ability to dispute potentially inaccurate charges, creating legal risk and violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by removing a key mechanism for ensuring fair payment practices, and would violate California law.",

                "original_text": "In the event of disputes between the parties arising from or concerning in any manner the subject matter of this Agreement, other than disputes arising from or concerning trademarks, service marks or trade names, confidentiality and/or User Data, the parties will first attempt to resolve the dispute(s) through good faith negotiation.  In the event that the dispute(s) cannot be resolved through good faith negotiation, the parties will refer the dispute(s) to a mutually acceptable mediator.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of disputes between the parties, the parties may attempt to resolve the dispute(s) through negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates good faith negotiation and mediation as initial steps in dispute resolution (except for specific types of disputes). The modified version eliminates the requirement for good faith negotiation and removes mediation entirely, making dispute resolution optional and less structured. This introduces legal risk because California law favors mediation and arbitration in resolving commercial disputes, and the removal of mandatory mediation could be seen as an attempt to circumvent a fair resolution process and would violate California law.",

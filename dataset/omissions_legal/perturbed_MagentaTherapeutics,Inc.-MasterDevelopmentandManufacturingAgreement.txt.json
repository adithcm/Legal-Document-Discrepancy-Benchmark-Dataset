                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Bachem shall, during the Initial Term and any Renewal Terms, and [***] after the expiration of the last Product is delivered, obtain and maintain, at its own cost and expense and from a qualified insurance company, comprehensive general liability insurance including, but not limited to, contractual liability coverage and standard product liability coverage in an amount commensurate with industry standards. At Magenta's request, Bachem shall provide Magenta with proof of such coverage. Bachem shall provide, and shall cause its Affiliates and sublicensees who perform activities in connection with the manufacture of Product to provide, to Magenta, upon its reasonable request, a statement of coverages, amounts of insurance, and deductibles, and a copy of all policies including clauses within the policies that the insurance company has a duty to defend and indemnify.",
                "changed_text": "Bachem shall obtain and maintain general liability insurance from a qualified insurance company. At Magenta's request, Bachem shall provide Magenta with proof of such coverage. Bachem shall provide, to Magenta, upon its reasonable request, a statement of coverages and deductibles.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 'comprehensive', 'contractual liability coverage', 'standard product liability coverage', 'amount commensurate with industry standards' and 'clauses within the policies that the insurance company has a duty to defend and indemnify' language significantly weakens the insurance requirement. The deletion of minimum coverage requirements creates a legal contradiction with state laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts for commercial contracts. Furthermore, the removal of the time period after the last product is delivered reduces the period of insurance liability.",

                "changed_text": "Services will conform to standards of workmanship and the specifications applicable to each Project Plan.",
                "explanation": "The removal of \"consistently high\" weakens the standard of service required from Bachem. This could lead to disputes over the quality of work and introduce legal risk, as it contradicts the implied warranty of merchantability under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which generally requires goods and services to be of a certain quality.",

                "changed_text": "Bachem will manufacture the Product according to GMP guidelines.",
                "explanation": "By removing \"as defined in the Quality Agreement,\" this clause introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. The Quality Agreement would typically detail the specific GMP standards required. Without that reference, Bachem could argue for a lower standard, creating potential liability if the product doesn't meet regulatory requirements. This contradicts FDA regulations that mandate adherence to specific, defined GMPs for pharmaceutical manufacturing.",

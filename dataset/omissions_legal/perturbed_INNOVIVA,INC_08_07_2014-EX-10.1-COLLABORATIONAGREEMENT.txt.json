(S) 202 in the United States.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to detail products in a manner consistent with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and related regulations, this creates a legal risk. The original text ensured compliance with laws regarding fair balance and truthful advertising; the modified text weakens this commitment.",

                "explanation": "GSK is legally required to communicate with regulatory agencies (FDA) and keep Theravance informed. By changing 'shall' to 'may' and adding 'at its discretion', this eliminates legal responsibility.",

Such product liability insurance or self-insured arrangements shall insure against all liability, including without limitation personal injury, physical injury, or property damage arising out of the manufacture, sale, distribution, or marketing of the Collaboration Products. GSK shall provide written proof of the existence of such insurance to Theravance upon request.",

                "explanation": "By removing the mandatory requirement to maintain product liability insurance, the minimum coverage details and eliminating the requirement to provide proof to Theravance, this weakens the indemnification clauses. If a product causes harm, Theravance's protection is reduced, potentially violating consumer protection and product liability laws.",

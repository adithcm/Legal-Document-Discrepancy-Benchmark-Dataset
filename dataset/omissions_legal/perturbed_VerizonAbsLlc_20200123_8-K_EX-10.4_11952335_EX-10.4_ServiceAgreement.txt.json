                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Servicer will manage, service, administer and collect on the Receivables with reasonable care using that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises for all comparable device payment plan agreement receivables that it services for itself or others according to the Servicing Procedures.",
                "changed_text": "The Servicer will manage, service, administer and collect on the Receivables. The specific methods will be determined at the Servicer's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This omission weakens the requirement for 'reasonable care' and removes any standards of comparison. This allows the Servicer to act without regard to industry practices or consumer protection laws, creating a **legal contradiction** with laws that mandate a certain level of care in debt collection or servicing of financial products.",
                "contradicted_law": "Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and similar state consumer protection laws.",
                "location": "Section 3.2(a)"

                "original_text": "The Servicer shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or advisable to collect each Receivable in accordance with this Agreement and the Servicing Procedures using commercially reasonable care and diligence and in any event, with no less care or diligence than the Servicer exercises in collecting other similar receivables or obligations owed to it and its Affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "The Servicer shall take actions to collect each Receivable. These actions will be determined at the Servicer's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the 'commercially reasonable care and diligence' standard weakens the obligation on the servicer. This creates a **legal contradiction** with standards of conduct around how consumers need to be treated when it comes to collecting payments. It eliminates consumer protections.",
                "contradicted_law": "Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and state law equivalents.",
                "location": "Section 3.2(b)"

                "original_text": "Within ten (10) days following the earlier to occur of (i) a ratings downgrade by each of the Rating Agencies of Verizon to below investment grade, or (ii) a Servicer Termination Event, the Servicer will send a notice to all Obligors indicating (a) that their Receivables have been assigned to the Issuer, and (b)(x) if Cellco has not been removed as Servicer, that the Obligors shall continue to make their payments as they had previously, or (y) if Cellco has been removed as Servicer, the name of the Successor Servicer and any new instructions with respect to their payments.",
                "changed_text": "Following a Servicer Termination Event, the Servicer may send a notice to all Obligors indicating the name of the Successor Servicer and any new instructions with respect to their payments.",
                "explanation": "By removing the mandatory timeframe and the ratings downgrade trigger, and by changing 'will send' to 'may send', the contract weakens consumer notification requirements. This omission introduces a **legal contradiction** with laws requiring transparency in debt assignments and changes in servicing, thereby creating legal risk.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state laws requiring notification of debt assignment and changes in servicing.",

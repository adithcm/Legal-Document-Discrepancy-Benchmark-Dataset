                "original_text": "LICENSOR warrants that Content does not infringe an intellectual property right enforceable in the agreed country of delivery or use. LICENSOR indemnifies and holds harmless plan_b against all claims that Content infringes any of the above mentioned rights of a third Party. LICENSOR shall pay all damages awarded in a trial to a third Party.",
                "changed_text": "LICENSOR warrants that Content does not infringe an intellectual property right. LICENSOR may indemnify and hold harmless plan_b against claims that Content infringes rights of a third Party.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a warranty regarding intellectual property rights and an indemnification clause that protects plan_b from third-party claims. By changing 'LICENSOR shall pay all damages awarded in a trial to a third Party' to simply remove it makes Licensor's obligation to pay damages awarded to a third party subject to negotiation and removes a key aspect of indemnification, creating a weaker protection than normally required by intellectual property law. Furthermore, weakening 'LICENSOR indemnifies and holds harmless plan_b against all claims that Content infringes any of the above mentioned rights of a third Party' to 'LICENSOR may indemnify and hold harmless plan_b against claims that Content infringes rights of a third Party' is a significant reduction in the assurance. The original text provides a firm guarantee, while the altered text introduces uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "plan_b shall provide LICENSOR with a written record. Such report may be provided to LICENSOR.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'a detailed written record' which provides clarity and enforces accountability in reporting. The updated version, simply stating a 'written record', is ambiguous. It does not specify the level of detail expected, which could lead to disputes about the adequacy of the reports. By changing 'Such report shall be provided to LICENSOR in electronic format within 6 weeks of the end of a quarter' to 'Such report may be provided to LICENSOR' makes the report subject to approval, completely destroying the accountability for Licensor to know how well their product is doing.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'for the term of this Agreement' creates ambiguity about the duration of the license. Omitting 'to produce, market' limits the scope of the license granted, potentially hindering plan_b's ability to effectively utilize the content. Furthermore, removing '(in the territory specified in appendix 2)' eliminates geographic limitations, and excluding the part of 'its own and its partner's platform' prevents the licensee from extending it's distribution range, causing the contract to not favor the consumer.",

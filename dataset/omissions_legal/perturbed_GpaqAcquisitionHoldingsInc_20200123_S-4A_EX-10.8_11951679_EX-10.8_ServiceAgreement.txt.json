                "original_text": "Constellation shall, at its own expense, secure and maintain in full force and effect throughout the Term (a) insurance coverage for defamation, trademark and service mark infringement, unfair competition, copyright infringement, and infringement of a person's right of publicity and right of privacy from a carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A10 or better in an amount not less than [***] per occurrence; and (b) a general liability insurance policy from a carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A10 or better in an amount not less than [***] in aggregate. The liability limits may be met with any combination of primary and excess or umbrella insurance policy limits. Constellation shall provide the HOF Entities with certificates of insurance, naming each HOF Entity as an additional insured, evidencing the existence of such insurance policies within ten (10) days after execution of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Constellation shall secure and maintain insurance coverage throughout the Term. Constellation shall provide the HOF Entities with certificates of insurance evidencing the existence of such insurance policies.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specifics of the insurance requirements (types of coverage, minimum amounts, A.M. Best rating, and additional insured status), and the timeline significantly weakens the insurance obligations of Constellation. This omission could violate Ohio state law regarding minimum insurance coverage for businesses operating in the state, creating legal risk for HOF Entities if Constellation's actual insurance coverage is inadequate.",

                "changed_text": "In the event Constellation fails to pay the HOF Entities when due any sum required by this Agreement to be paid, no interest shall accrue.",
                "explanation": "By removing the provision for interest on late payments, the contract contradicts standard commercial law principles and potentially Ohio usury laws which dictate how much interest can be charged. Omitting any interest charge creates a significant financial disincentive for timely payment, introducing legal risk. The original clause also provides a safety net ensuring they don't go against usury laws of Ohio by adding a clause to not overcharge.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation to follow laws and regulations. This weakens compliance with state and federal advertising regulations, potentially leading to legal issues if advertising materials violate consumer protection laws in Ohio.

                "original_text": "For ninety (90) days after delivery of a Product to Distributor, Developer warrants that media upon which the Products are delivered shall be of good quality and workmanship. Upon written notice from Distributor of defective media for a Product, Developer shall use reasonable efforts to promptly provide replacement media.",
                "changed_text": "Developer makes no warranties regarding the quality and workmanship of the media upon which the Products are delivered. Any replacement of media shall be at Developer's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 90-day warranty on the media, the contract violates consumer protection laws in many jurisdictions (including Singapore, where the Distributor is located), which imply a minimum warranty period for goods sold. Replacing the commitment to 'use reasonable efforts' with 'Developer's sole discretion' further weakens the consumer's rights, creating a legal risk.",

                "explanation": "The original text attempts to disclaim all warranties, but the modified text now makes the disclaimer more vague and limited. This introduces a legal contradiction, as Singapore law has implied terms as to the quality of goods in sale contracts that cannot be fully excluded. The modification removes the detailed disclaimers and replaces them with 'except those required by law' which is insufficient for the distributor to understand what liabilities it is assuming.",

                "explanation": "The original clause attempts to limit liability but still acknowledges potential liabilities. The modified clause now drastically limits the developer's liability to a fixed amount of $100, irrespective of the damages incurred. This is problematic in jurisdictions like Singapore, as it may be deemed an unreasonable exclusion of liability under the Unfair Contract Terms Act (UCTA). The act prevents businesses from excluding or limiting liability for breach of contract unless the term is reasonable. This modification introduces significant legal risk because the fixed limit may not be proportionate to the potential damages.",

                "explanation": "By removing the disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, the contract appears to grant these warranties, but then fails to define or uphold them, creating ambiguity and potential violation of Chinese consumer protection laws that mandate certain implied warranties for products sold within China. This removal weakens consumer rights by potentially misleading the distributor about available legal recourse.The deletion of the warranty disclaimers potentially violates the PRC Contract Law and Consumer Protection Law.",

                "explanation": "Removal of the 48-hour reporting deadline for discrepancies and damages significantly restricts the distributor's ability to claim for issues, potentially violating consumer rights laws in P.R. China which requires reasonable time for reporting defects. This omission introduces legal risk by contradicting established consumer protection standards that protect buyers from latent defects and concealed damages. Moreover, it will be hard to have sufficient evidences and photos for the insurance claim because it may not be in time.",

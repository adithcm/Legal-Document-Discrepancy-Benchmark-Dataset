                "explanation": "By removing the explicit warranty of performance 'when in use without material alteration on the DESIGNATED UNIT in accordance with the functional specifications set forth in the DOCUMENTATION,' the modified text weakens consumer rights. South African consumer protection laws (CPA) require that goods perform as specified, making this omission a legal contradiction.",

TELKOM shall co-\noperate fully in the defence of such claim and any reasonable costs incurred by\nTELKOM in giving such co-operation shall be reimbursed by SAP AFRICA. SAP\nAFRICA may, in its sole discretion, settle any such claim on a basis whereby SAP\nAFRICA, substitutes the SOFTWARE and DOCUMENTATION (in consultation\nwith TELKOM) with alternative, substantially equivalent, non-infringing programs\nand support DOCUMENTATION, which TELKOM shall be obliged to accept.",

SAP AFRICA may settle any such claim.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly limits the indemnity provided to TELKOM. By removing 'liabilities' and restricting 'costs' to exclude 'reasonable attorney fees', the clause is less protective. Also removed obligations of 'co-operate fully in the defense of such claim and any reasonable costs incurred by TELKOM in giving such co-operation shall be reimbursed by SAP AFRICA. SAP AFRICA may, in its sole discretion, settle any such claim on a basis whereby SAP AFRICA, substitutes the SOFTWARE and DOCUMENTATION (in consultation with TELKOM) with alternative, substantially equivalent, non-infringing programs and support DOCUMENTATION, which TELKOM shall be obliged to accept.', shifting more risk to TELKOM.

                "explanation": "By giving SAP Africa sole control over the arbitrator selection and removing the clause specifying that the award be capable of being made an order of a competent court, this modification introduces a severe bias and removes TELKOM's ability to enforce arbitration decisions through the court system.

                "original_text": "Galacticomm must provide a person(s) to correct any technical problems (Server being down or inaccessible) 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. This person(s) must be available by beeper or telephone. Horst Entertainment shall provide this same 24 hour service at the broadcast location.",
                "changed_text": "Galacticomm will attempt to correct technical problems. Horst Entertainment shall provide service at the broadcast location.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 24/7 technical support availability. The modified text removes the guaranteed 24/7 support and availability via beeper/telephone, weakening the obligation. This introduces legal risk because many jurisdictions imply a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, which includes reliable service, in service agreements, especially when dealing with essential services. By removing the guaranteed availability, Galacticomm opens itself up to claims if the service is unreliable.",

                "explanation": "The original text contains a clause stating that disputes will be settled in a court in Florida. By removing this clause, it creates uncertainty about the venue for dispute resolution. While not explicitly against the law to omit a venue, the omission can lead to increased legal costs and complications if a dispute arises, as parties may disagree on the appropriate jurisdiction. In many jurisdictions, the absence of a clear forum selection clause can result in the dispute being litigated in a location that is less favorable for the consumer (Horst Entertainment).",

Horst Entertainment shall send this amount to Galacticomm by no later than Wednesday for accesses used from the previuos week (Monday thru Sunday).",

The modified text omits these crucial details, making the payment terms vague and unenforceable.

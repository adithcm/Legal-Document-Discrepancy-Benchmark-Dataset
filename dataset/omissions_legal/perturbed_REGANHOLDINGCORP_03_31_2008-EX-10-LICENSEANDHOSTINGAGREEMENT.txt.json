                "original_text": "During the Term of the Agreement, LMG shall maintain and keep in force, at its own expense, the following minimum insurance coverages and minimum limits: workers' compensation insurance, with statutory limits as required by the various laws and regulations applicable to the employees of LMG; employer's liability insurance, for employee bodily injuries and deaths, with a limit of $500,000 each accident; commercial general liability insurance, covering claims for bodily injury, death and property damage, including premises and operations, LMG's vicarious liability for acts of independent contractors, products, services and completed operations (as applicable to the Services), personal injury, contractual, and broad-form property damage liability coverages, with combined single limit of $1,000,000 per occurrence, and a general aggregate limit of $2,000,000, for bodily injury, death and property damage; commercial automobile liability insurance, covering owned, non-owned and hired vehicles, with combined single limit of $1,000,000 per occurrence; umbrella liability insurance, with a minimum limit of $5,000,000 per occurrence and $5,000,000 in the aggregate; special form property insurance, on a replacement cost basis, covering the real and personal property of LMG which LMG is obligated to insure by the Agreement; such real and personal property may include equipment, furniture, fixtures and supply inventory; and employee dishonesty insurance covering dishonest acts of employees; such insurance shall include a Joint Loss Endorsement in favor of TAG and be written for limits not less than $500,000. All such policies of insurance of LMG shall provide that the insurer will give at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation to TAG. No such cancellation or material modification shall affect LMG's obligation to maintain the insurance coverages required by the Agreement. TAG shall be named as an additional insured on the commercial general liability insurance policies described above. All liability insurance policies shall be written on an \"occurrence\" policy form except for the policies described in (vii) and (viii) above",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of the Agreement, LMG shall maintain and keep in force, at its own expense, insurance coverages: workers' compensation insurance; employer's liability insurance; commercial general liability insurance, covering claims for bodily injury, death and property damage; commercial automobile liability insurance, covering owned, non-owned and hired vehicles; umbrella liability insurance; property insurance, covering the real and personal property of LMG which LMG is obligated to insure by the Agreement; and employee dishonesty insurance covering dishonest acts of employees.

No cancellation or modification shall affect LMG's obligation to maintain insurance coverages required by the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing specific minimum coverage amounts for the various insurance policies, the contract becomes significantly weaker and potentially non-compliant with standard business practices and state regulations for companies of this size. The deletion of 'minimum limits' weakens the protection for TAG. The removal of 'thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation to TAG' eliminates an important notification to TAG in the event of a cancellation. Removing TAG as 'additional insured' eliminates liability insurance policies.",
                "contradicted_law": "Typical state business insurance regulations (example: California Commercial General Liability Insurance requirements) mandate minimum coverage levels for businesses based on size and scope of operations.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause that the rights and obligations of the parties shall be governed by the laws, other than choice of law rules, of the State of Georgia introduces ambiguity. Without a clearly defined governing law, disputes could arise regarding which jurisdiction's laws apply, leading to legal uncertainty and potentially conflicting interpretations of the contract, introducing legal risk.",

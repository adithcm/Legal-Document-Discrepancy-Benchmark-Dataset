                "original_text": "12.4 Insurance. Each party, at its own expense, shall maintain product liability and other appropriate insurance (or self- insure) in an amount consistent with industry standards during the Term and shall name the other party as an additional insured with respect to such insurance. Each party shall provide a certificate of insurance (or evidence of self-insurance) evidencing such coverage to the other party upon request.",

Each party may provide a certificate of insurance (or evidence of self-insurance) evidencing such coverage to the other party upon request.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall maintain' to 'may maintain', the contract now allows a party to operate without insurance, which may violate California law regarding minimum liability coverage for businesses. Removing the requirement to name the other party as additional insured and weakening the proof of insurance clause also increase risk and contradict standard practices.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens the commitment to HIPAA compliance. Replacing 'agree to protect... in accordance with HIPAA' with 'will make efforts to protect' creates ambiguity. Removing the mandatory execution of Business Associate Agreements directly violates HIPAA requirements for handling protected health information (PHI).",

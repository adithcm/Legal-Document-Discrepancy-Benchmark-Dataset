The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall endeavor to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") of [***] (\"Units\") for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV target is [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, for the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will aim to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "explanation": "Changing \"shall be required to purchase\" to \"shall endeavor to purchase\" and \"required to purchase\" to \"aim to purchase\" weakens the obligation of Premier to meet the Minimum Annual Order Volume (MAOV). This removes the legal certainty of a fixed purchase commitment, which could violate contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms, thus creating a legal loophole for Premier to avoid purchasing the agreed amount. This introduces legal risk, as Heritage could sue Premier for breach of contract if the MAOV is not met.",

                "explanation": "Adding \"subject to Heritage's discretion\" introduces ambiguity and gives Heritage unilateral power to modify or disregard existing terms, conditions, and covenants of the original agreement. This weakens the binding nature of the contract and could violate principles of good faith and fair dealing implied in contract law. This places Premier at a disadvantage and creates legal risk if Heritage exercises its 'discretion' to the detriment of Premier's rights. This is a change to the agreement that significantly alters the power dynamics and responsibilities. Such a sweeping change could potentially be deemed unconscionable or unenforceable in court.",

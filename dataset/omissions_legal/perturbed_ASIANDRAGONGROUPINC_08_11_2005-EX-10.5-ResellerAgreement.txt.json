                "original_text": "If you have subscribed to Residential Services, the Service is provided to you as a residential user, for your personal, residential, non-business and non-professional use.  This means that you are not using the service for any commercial or governmental activities, profit-making or non-profit, including but not limited to business, sales, telecommuting, telemarketing, autodialing, continuous or extensive call forwarding, fax broadcast, fax blasting or any other activity that would be inconsistent with normal residential usage patterns. Telnet reserves the right to immediately terminate or modify the service, if Telnet determines, in its sole discretion, that the subscriber's service is being used for any of the aforementioned activities.\n\nThe Service is offered on a monthly basis to the Subscriber. The monthly Service term begins on the date that Service is activated for the subscriber. Full monthly terms will renew automatically unless Telnet is otherwise notified of the intent to cancel the Service. Upon cancellation, the Subscriber will be responsible for charges for the full term of the then current billing period and any unbilled charges.",

The modified clause removes the definition and specific examples, making it vague and leaving it open to interpretation.

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states that 'calls to 9-1-1 cannot be connected' and that 'alternative arrangements need to be made.' The modified clause softens this by saying it 'does not fully support,' implying some level of support, which is misleading and dangerous and removes the important instruction for users to make alternative arrangement. This is a critical omission as it misleads users about the availability of emergency services.",

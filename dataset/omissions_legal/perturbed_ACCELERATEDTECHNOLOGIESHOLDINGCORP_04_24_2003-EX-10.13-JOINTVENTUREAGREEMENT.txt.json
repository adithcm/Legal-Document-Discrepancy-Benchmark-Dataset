                "explanation": "By changing 'shall maintain adequate books and records' to 'may maintain books and records' and 'shall include' to 'may include', the agreement weakens the requirement for proper accounting practices. This introduces a legal contradiction, especially regarding tax obligations and potential liability issues. In Pennsylvania, businesses are legally required to maintain accurate records for tax purposes and to ensure transparency and accountability. The original clause mandates adherence to generally accepted accounting principles and regular financial reporting, which are essential for legal compliance. By weakening the language, the altered clause creates a loophole that could be exploited to avoid legal and financial responsibilities, therefore failing to comply with state laws regarding business accounting practices and financial transparency.",

All books and records of every kind and character, of\nthe Joint Venture, and other information, shall be kept at the principal\noffice of the Joint Venture, or at such other place or places as may be\nagreed upon by the Joint Venturers, and shall be fully available to each\nJoint Venturer or his duly authorized representative, all at reasonable\ntimes.

The books of the Joint Venture shall represent a record\nof business operations.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause mandating that books and records 'shall be kept at the principal office of the Joint Venture' and changing 'shall be' audited to 'may be audited' introduces a significant legal risk. Pennsylvania law requires businesses to maintain accurate financial records and make them accessible for audits and legal proceedings. By allowing the records to be kept at any agreed-upon location, and removing the requirement for regular submission of reports, the contract hinders transparency and compliance with legal requirements for financial accountability. The modification also omits the requirement for an independent accountant acceptable to both parties and the requirements for reports of operation and financial statements, further hindering legal transparency.",

If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an\nundivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it\nshall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or\nproperty, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party\nreceives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets.",

This creates a contradiction with Pennsylvania's partnership laws, which mandate fair and proportional distribution of assets and liabilities based on ownership percentages to protect the rights of all parties involved. The omission introduces potential for disputes and non-compliance with legal standards for winding up a business venture.",

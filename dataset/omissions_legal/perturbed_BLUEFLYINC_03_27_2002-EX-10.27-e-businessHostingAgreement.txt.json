                "explanation": "By removing 'fully trained, fully qualified, and responsible' from the warranty clause, IBM weakens its commitment to providing a certain standard of service quality. This could violate implied warranties of workmanlike performance, which are consumer protections ensuring services are performed competently. The contract now omits a commitment to providing *qualified* personnel, which could allow IBM to provide poorly trained staff, contradicting consumer protection expectations in service agreements. The jurisdiction is New York, and this change introduces risk because it can be argued that IBM is not providing services in a workmanlike manner if personnel aren't fully qualified.",

IBM will invoice such Charges when they begin or are due as set forth in Service Option Attachments.\n\n\n\n4.2   Payment\n\nIBM invoices will specify the amount due.

                "explanation": "By removing 'including any late payment fees' from the payment section, the contract fails to adequately disclose the potential for additional costs, impacting transparency and fairness. Many jurisdictions, including New York, have regulations around disclosing fees and penalties, especially late payment fees. By omitting the fact that there would be any 'late payment fees', this may result in a legal challenge from the customer when late fees are applied without sufficient prior notice or explicit agreement. Thus creating a omission and legal risk in the identified jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "By reducing the statute of limitations to one year, the contract limits the customer's ability to pursue legal remedies for breaches, potentially violating state laws that prescribe minimum limitations periods for contract claims. In New York, the statute of limitations for breach of contract is six years. Shortening this period could be deemed unconscionable or against public policy, especially in a B2B contract where one party (IBM) has significantly more bargaining power. Thus creating a legal risk in the identified jurisdiction.",

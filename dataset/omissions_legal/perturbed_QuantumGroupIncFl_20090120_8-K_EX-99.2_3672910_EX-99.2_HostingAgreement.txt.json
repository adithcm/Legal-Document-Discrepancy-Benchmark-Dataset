                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' makes the availability credit discretionary rather than a guaranteed right.

                "explanation": "The omission of 'and open trouble tickets that reflect the start time of the Outage event' removes the requirement for a documented record of the outage's beginning. Without this, IBM can dispute the duration or occurrence of the outage, reducing the likelihood of an availability credit. This contradicts the goal of service level agreements and is a violation of good faith, as it disadvantages the Customer from proving a service failure.",

                "explanation": "The omission of 'provided that such relocation is based on reasonable business needs of IBM (including the needs of other IBM customers), or the expansion of the space requirements of Customer.' gives IBM unilateral power to relocate Managed Hosting Services and no requirement to provide reasonable justification. It weakens customer rights because there is no guarantee that customer needs are considered.

                "changed_text": "STW shall administer and provide insurance to insure its activities on the Property in relation to the AGREEMENT. COFS may be listed as additional insured at STW's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement that the insurance be 'necessary and reasonable' and making the additional insured status discretionary, the contract weakens the protection for the City of Fort Stockton (COFS). Texas law requires parties to contracts to act in good faith and provide reasonable insurance. This change introduces a legal risk because it potentially allows STW to provide inadequate insurance coverage, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing. The specific coverage amounts and types are not guaranteed anymore.",

STW will try to comply with federal, state, and local laws.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'businesslike manner consistent with good and economical practices and with due regard for good land management, damage prevention and environmental protection' and replacing it with 'a manner deemed appropriate by STW' the duty of care and the required practices have been removed. Also, replacing 'comply with' by 'STW will try to comply with' transforms the obligation into a mere intention. This omission introduces a legal risk because it weakens environmental safeguards and compliance with regulations, increasing the likelihood of violations and associated liabilities. Texas Water Code and TCEQ regulations mandate strict compliance for water well operations. The specific regulation that is violated would depend on the specific activity but, under the water code, STW is obligated to comply with regulatory requirements, which are in place to protect the environment and other groundwater users.",

If the defaulting party fails to fully cure any monetary default that can be cured by payment within sixty (60) days after receipt of the notice, or fails to commence the curing of any default specified in such notice that is other than a monetary default within sixty (60) days from the date of the notice provided, then the non-defaulting party may pursue all legal or equitable remedies against the defaulting party.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase, 'If the defaulting party fails to fully cure any monetary default that can be cured by payment within sixty (60) days after receipt of the notice', eliminates the explicit right to cure a monetary default, increasing the legal risk to the defaulting party. This change could be problematic as Texas law generally favors allowing parties a reasonable opportunity to cure breaches of contract. This omission could lead to a court finding the clause unconscionable or unenforceable.",

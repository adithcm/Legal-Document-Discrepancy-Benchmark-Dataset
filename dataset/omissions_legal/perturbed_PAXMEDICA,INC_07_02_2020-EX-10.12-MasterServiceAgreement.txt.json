CRO warrants to Client that the Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner and on a best endeavours basis in accordance with the standard of care ordinarily and reasonably expected in the performance of such Services and that the work performed for Client will be correct in all material respects to the best of the knowledge and belief of CRO. However, Client acknowledges that the provision of the Services is dependent upon the responsiveness of the South African regulatory authorities and CRO shall not be held responsible for any acts or omissions of such authorities.",

Client acknowledges that the provision of the Services is dependent upon the responsiveness of the South African regulatory authorities and CRO shall not be held responsible for any acts or omissions of such authorities.",
                "explanation": "The omission of \"workmanlike manner and on a best endeavours basis in accordance with the standard of care ordinarily and reasonably expected in the performance of such Services and that the work performed for Client will be correct in all material respects to the best of the knowledge and belief of CRO\" significantly weakens the warranty provided by CRO. This omission creates a legal risk as it removes the commitment to provide services aligned with industry standards and reasonable expectations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring reasonable skill and care in service provision. Although the contract specifies Connecticut law, basic contract law requires services to be performed with reasonable skill. Omitting the 'workmanlike manner' clause weakens this obligation.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause \"provided, however that the party in breach shall have the right to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of the other party's intention to terminate,\" the contract eliminates the breaching party's right to cure the breach. This is a legally required right.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles related to providing opportunity to cure a breach. While the contract specifies Connecticut law, many jurisdictions recognize a right to cure a material breach before termination. Removing this clause creates a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Removing \"without regard to conflict of law principles\" can create ambiguity and potential legal challenges. Conflict of law principles determine which jurisdiction's laws apply when there are competing choices. By removing this clarification, the contract could be interpreted in a way that contradicts standard legal practice, potentially harming one of the parties and opens the contract up to legal disputes. This would be a legal contradiction.",

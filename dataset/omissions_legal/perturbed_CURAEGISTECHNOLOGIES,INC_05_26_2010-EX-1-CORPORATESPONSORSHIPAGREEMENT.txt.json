                "explanation": "By removing 'EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES', this clause now potentially contradicts New York law (governing jurisdiction) which may allow for such damages in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, even with a limitation of liability clause. The original text explicitly excludes these, while the modified text leaves room for argument that they may be applicable.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific insurance limits and rating requirements introduces ambiguity and potential non-compliance with New York state law. Businesses in New York are typically required to carry specific minimum insurance coverage levels, depending on the nature of their activities. The original text attempted to ensure adequate coverage, while the modified text lacks these safeguards, creating a potential legal contradiction.",

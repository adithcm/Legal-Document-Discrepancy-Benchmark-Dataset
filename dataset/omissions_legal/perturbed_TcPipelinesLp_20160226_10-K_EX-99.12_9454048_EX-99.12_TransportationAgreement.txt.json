                "original_text": "This Agreement shall incorporate and in all respects be subject to the \"General Terms and Conditions\" and the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) set forth in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, as may be revised from time to time. Transporter may file and seek Commission approval under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) at any time and from time to time to change any rates, charges or provisions set forth in the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) and the \"General Terms and Conditions\" in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, and Transporter shall have the right to place such changes in effect in accordance with the NGA, and this Agreement shall be deemed to include such changes and any such changes",

Transporter may file and seek Commission approval to change any rates, charges or provisions set forth in the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above), and Transporter shall have the right to place such changes in effect, and this Agreement shall be deemed to include such changes.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to the \"General Terms and Conditions\" of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, a critical component of the agreement that provides consumer (Shipper) protections regarding service standards, liability, and dispute resolution is omitted. This omission introduces legal risk because it weakens the enforceability of consumer protection clauses typically present in such tariffs, potentially violating implied duties under the Natural Gas Act.",

                "changed_text": "Any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved by the parties shall be subject to arbitration.",
                "explanation": "By replacing the governing law (Michigan) with a general clause for arbitration without specifying the venue, rules, or process of selecting arbitrators, the contract deprives the shipper of the legal protections and judicial recourse afforded under Michigan state law. This affects consumer protection by limiting the shipper's ability to pursue legal action in a state court, where consumer protection laws are well-established and understood. This omission creates a legal contradiction by potentially violating standards of fairness and due process implicit in commercial agreements, as the arbitration clause is vague and undefined.",

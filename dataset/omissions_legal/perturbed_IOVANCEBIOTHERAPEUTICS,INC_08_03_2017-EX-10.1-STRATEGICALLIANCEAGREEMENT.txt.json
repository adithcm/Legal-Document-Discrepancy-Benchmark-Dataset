Parts 50, 56, and 58, and, with respect to clinical Studies, the requirements of the Statement of Investigator, FDA Form 1572 (as described in 21 312.53), the terms of which are incorporated by reference into any Study Order pertaining to a clinical Study (and the Principal Investigator for any such clinical Study shall complete, sign, and deliver a Form 1572 to LBIO prior to the commencement of such Study); the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the HITECH Act, including the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information; the EU Data Protection Directive; and all other applicable privacy, security and data protection laws (collectively, this sub-clause (i), \"Laws\"), and, as applicable, the quality standards of \"Good Clinical Practice\" (which term shall mean generally accepted good clinical practices including those set out in the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice in force from time to time and FDA's most recent guidance and regulations concerning current Good Clinical Practice), (ii) the provisions of this Agreement (including each applicable Study Order and Protocol), and (iii) all written instruction from LBIO, as well as MD Anderson's internal policies and procedures to the extent they do not conflict with the foregoing subsections (i) and (ii).",

                "explanation": "This modification omits the explicit requirement for MD Anderson and its representatives to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines. By removing sub-clause (i), the contract no longer mandates adherence to critical laws like the FFCDA, HIPAA, and Good Clinical Practice standards, introducing significant legal risk. It violates the standards for privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information",

                "explanation": "By removing 'To the extent required by Law, ' and 'As may be required by Law,' from the start of the first and second sentences respectively, the contract now unconditionally mandates IRB approval and reporting, regardless of legal requirements. This could be interpreted as an overreach and could create legal challenges, particularly if it conflicts with specific exceptions or waivers allowed under applicable regulations.",

It's more subtle, but the omission of the disclaimer creates a legal ambiguity and potential liability for the licensor by not explicitly disclaiming these implied warranties as allowed under the UCC.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific reference to compliance with U.S. export control laws (Export Administration Act of 1978) weakens the licensee's obligation. While a general compliance clause remains, the explicit mention of export controls is omitted, which is problematic because this type of activity often involves international transactions where the licensee could be exposed to export violations, creating legal ambiguity and risk, because this is an agreement between two Delaware companies in New York City.",

                "explanation": "Removing the \"reasonable attorneys' fees\" provision significantly alters the financial risk for the parties. New York law allows parties to contract for attorney's fees, and removing that entitlement creates uncertainty and could discourage valid claims. This is particularly impactful because without the guarantee of recovering attorney's fees, a party might be less willing to pursue a breach of contract claim, creating a legal contradiction with established contractual practice.",

EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO\n         TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT,\n         ANY CREDIT SUPPORT DOCUMENT TO WHICH IT IS A PARTY, OR ANY TRANSACTION.\n         EACH PARTY ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT\n         TO THE OTHER PARTY'S ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT.",

                "explanation": "The original text contains a clause where both parties waive their right to a jury trial. Removing the explicit waiver of jury trial may be unenforceable in certain jurisdictions, particularly concerning consumer rights and complex financial instruments, thereby creating legal risk. While these waivers are common in commercial contracts, their enforceability against consumers is often challenged, and omitting the full clause introduces ambiguity and potential non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "By allowing UBS AG to choose the governing law without specifying the jurisdiction or considering conflict of law principles, the contract creates a legal risk. This removal of specific mention of New York law and replacement with a vague 'jurisdiction chosen by UBS AG' could allow UBS AG to select a jurisdiction with laws unfavorable to the Counterparty. This potentially violates principles of fair dealing and could be deemed unconscionable, especially if the chosen jurisdiction has no reasonable connection to the transaction or the parties involved. If the counterparty is based in Maryland and the trust is related to Maryland mortgages, the governing law may have to reflect the protections Maryland law offers.",

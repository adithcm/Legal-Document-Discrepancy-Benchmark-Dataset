The parties agree to attempt to resolve any disputes, controversies or claims (\"Dispute\") arising out of or relating to this Agreement in a meeting between a representative of each party who has decision-making authority with respect to a Dispute. Should the meeting either not take place or not result in a resolution of the Dispute within thirty (30) days following notice of the Dispute to the other party, then either party may bring suit or action in accordance with this Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that in the event that the other party is required to engage an attorney to enforce any of the terms or obligations contained in this Agreement, the non-prevailing party shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of that attorney or firm, whether or not a complaint or suit is filed with any court of competent jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause where 'the non-prevailing party shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of that attorney or firm', the contract removes a common clause that can deter frivolous lawsuits and ensure parties can recover costs. This omission could contradict California's rules regarding attorney fee shifting, especially in cases involving specific types of claims, thereby creating a legal risk.",

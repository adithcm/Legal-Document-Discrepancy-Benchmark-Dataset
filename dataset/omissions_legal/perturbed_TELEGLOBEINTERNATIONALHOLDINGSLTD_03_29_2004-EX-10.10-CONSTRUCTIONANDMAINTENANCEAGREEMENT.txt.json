                "explanation": "By limiting the applicable laws to only those of Singapore, the contract potentially violates consumer protection laws and other mandatory regulations of other countries where the APCN 2 operates. This introduces a legal risk as the parties are no longer explicitly bound to comply with all relevant laws.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'or benefits accruing' means that benefits related to the resolution of claims will not be distributed according to Schedule B. This creates an imbalance, as only liabilities and costs are now addressed, which could be non-compliant with fairness principles in contract law.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'expenses, damages and demands,' the scope of the indemnification is severely limited.

                "original_text": "Provider represents, warrants and agrees that the Services shall be provided in good faith, in accordance with applicable law and in a manner generally consistent with the historical provision of the Services and with the same standard of care as historically provided.",
                "changed_text": "Provider represents, warrants and agrees that the Services shall be provided in good faith and in a manner generally consistent with the historical provision of the Services and with the same standard of care as historically provided.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'in accordance with applicable law' weakens the Provider's obligation to adhere to legal standards. This omission introduces a legal risk, because the contract no longer explicitly ensures compliance with Singaporean or Israeli laws relevant to service provision, such as data protection laws or labor laws. This creates a legal loophole where the provider might argue non-compliance if not explicitly stated is acceptable since the contract does not specify.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various Singaporean and Israeli laws related to service provision, including data protection, labor, and consumer protection laws.",

                "changed_text": "Provider shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, the computer software and computer hardware that is used in connection with the Services.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause that demands Provider to maintain software and hardware with 'substantially the same degree of care, skill and diligence' as their own weakens the service standards. This omission presents a legal risk, particularly regarding data security and service reliability, as it could violate regulations requiring a specific level of care in maintaining systems that process sensitive data. It removes assurance that the service provided will match any level of quality and timeliness.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'defend, and hold harmless' along with the expansive list of potential losses (damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including attorneys' fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers), and the explicit statement that the provider cannot settle without consent, significantly reduces the scope of the indemnification. This shift creates a legal vulnerability, potentially contradicting laws that outline the extent of liability for negligence or misconduct, such as the Israeli Civil Wrongs Ordinance [New Version].",

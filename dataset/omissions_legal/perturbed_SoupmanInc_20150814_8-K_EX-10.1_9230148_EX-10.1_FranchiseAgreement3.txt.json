                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit statement that California law will supersede inconsistent provisions in the franchise agreement, directly contradicting the protections offered by the California Business and Professions Code. This introduces a legal risk by implying the franchise agreement terms take precedence over state law, which is not permissible.",

California Corporation Code 31512 voids a waiver of your rights under the Franchise Investment Law (California Corporations Code 31000 through 31516).

                "explanation": "By omitting the statements regarding California Corporation Code 31512 and Business and Professions Code 20010, the contract no longer explicitly acknowledges that waivers of franchisee rights are void under California law. This omission misleads the franchisee into believing they may be waiving rights which are legally protected. It creates a legal contradiction because it fails to inform the franchisee of their statutory rights against such waivers.",

                "explanation": "This change omits the important information that certain liquidated damages clauses are unenforceable under California Civil Code Section 1671. By removing this, the contract creates a misleading impression that all liquidated damages clauses are enforceable, which contradicts the legal protections offered by California law to prevent unfair penalties. This silence poses a legal risk as it could lead a franchisee to wrongly assume the validity of a potentially unenforceable clause.",

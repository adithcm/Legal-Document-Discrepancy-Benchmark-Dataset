If a new address is so obtained in a database search for a lost stockholder, Agent shall conduct a verification mailing and update its records for such stockholder accordingly.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'as are required by Rule 17Ad-17 under the Exchange Act, without charge to the stockholder' the contract now omits the legally mandated obligation of the transfer agent to perform searches for lost stockholders as per SEC regulations. This omission introduces legal risk because it contradicts the SEC's requirement for transfer agents to actively seek out lost stockholders.",

                "explanation": "Removing the constraint 'which shall be charged only once in instances where a single surety bond obtained covers multiple certificates', allows the agent to charge fees for each certificate regardless of being covered under the same bond. This is a violation of consumer rights.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada, USA in force therein without regard to its conflict of law rules. All parties agree that by executing this Agreement they have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the statement about attorning to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States and granting it exclusive jurisdiction, the contract now lacks a clear and valid forum selection clause. Nevada law, like that of other states and the US Federal system, allows parties to agree to a forum, but doing so to the US Supreme Court is nonsensical. Removing this clause creates ambiguity and potential legal disputes regarding jurisdiction, forcing a party to potentially litigate in an inconvenient forum or incur costs to establish jurisdiction. This contradicts basic principles of contract law regarding enforceability and fairness.",

The language to be used in the arbitration proceedings shall be English.",

                "explanation": "Removing the reference to the Commercial Arbitration Act of the State of Nevada omits vital procedural safeguards for arbitration. The Act provides rules for selecting arbitrators, conducting hearings, and enforcing awards, which are crucial for ensuring fairness and due process. By omitting this reference, the contract creates uncertainty about the arbitration process, potentially leaving a party without recourse if the arbitration is conducted unfairly or if the award needs to be enforced in court. This can be seen as an attempt to circumvent consumer protection laws by making arbitration terms unclear and potentially unfavorable.",

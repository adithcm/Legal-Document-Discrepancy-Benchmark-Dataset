                "original_text": "Company agrees to protect, indemnify and hold harmless the NFLA / NFLA-NC and their authorized agents, or any of them, from and against any and all expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs whatsoever, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising out of, or in any way connected with, actions or omissions of Company, any advertising material furnished by, or an behalf of, Company, or any claim or action for personal injury, death or other cause of action involving alleged defects in Company's Products or services. Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, general commercial and product liability insurance.",
                "changed_text": "Company agrees to protect, indemnify and hold harmless the NFLA / NFLA-NC and their authorized agents, or any of them, from and against any and all expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs whatsoever, arising out of, or in any way connected with, actions or omissions of Company, any advertising material furnished by, or an behalf of, Company, or any claim or action for personal injury directly caused by gross negligence in Company's Products or services. Company may, at its discretion, provide and maintain general commercial and product liability insurance.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'including reasonable attorney's fees', and by altering the scope of indemnity to only cover personal injuries due to 'gross negligence' and making insurance optional, the company limits its liability in violation of California law. California law requires parties to be responsible for their own negligence and for attorney's fees in many contractual disputes.",

                "original_text": "All such arbitration shall take place at the office of the American Arbitration Association located within 225 miles of Hayward, California. Each party is entitled to depose one fact witness and all expert witnesses retained by the other party, and to conduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate.",
                "changed_text": "All such arbitration shall take place in a location of Company's choosing. Each party's ability to depose witnesses and conduct discovery will be determined solely by the arbitrator.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction because it gives the Company unilateral control over the arbitration location and removes guaranteed rights to depose witnesses, weakening the consumer's (NFLA/NFLA-NC) ability to fairly litigate claims. California law favors neutral arbitration locations and reasonable discovery.",

                "changed_text": "Past due payments under this Agreement may, at the Company's discretion, bear interest.",
                "explanation": "Removing the definite interest rate and making it discretionary violates California's usury laws. While 1% per month is generally legal, making interest optional provides no guarantee that interest will be charged in accordance with law. Furthermore, the clause provides the company leeway to not pay interest even when legally obliged to pay it.",

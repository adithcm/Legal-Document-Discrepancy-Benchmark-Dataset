                "original_text": "THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND EFFECT, BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE.",
                "changed_text": "THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND EFFECT, BY THE LAWS OF A JURISDICTION CHOSEN BY URS CORPORATION.",
                "explanation": "This clause originally specifies that Delaware law governs the agreement. The modified clause removes this certainty, allowing URS Corporation to potentially select a jurisdiction with laws less favorable to JANA Partners, or even laws that could be detrimental. This creates a legal risk for JANA by removing a guaranteed legal framework.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring clarity and mutual agreement on governing law.",

                "changed_text": "FURTHERMORE, JANA PARTNERS LLC (A) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND (B) AGREES TO WAIVE ANY BONDING REQUIREMENT UNDER ANY APPLICABLE LAW, IN THE CASE ANY OTHER PARTY SEEKS TO ENFORCE THE TERMS BY WAY OF EQUITABLE RELIEF.",
                "explanation": "By limiting the waiver of the right to trial by jury and the bonding requirement to only JANA, URS retains these rights while JANA does not. This creates an imbalance and potential legal disadvantage for JANA in any dispute resolution, as they are deprived of fundamental procedural rights that URS maintains. Many jurisdictions look unfavorably on contracts that unilaterally strip one party of standard legal protections.",

                "original_text": "(b) Notwithstanding any other Section in this Agreement and without limiting any other remedies the Company may have in law or equity, in the event that JANA (or any Affiliate or Associate of JANA) fails to perform or otherwise fulfill its obligations set forth in Section 7 in any material respect, and shall not have remedied such failure or non-fulfillment if capable of being remedied or fulfilled within three (3) business days following written notice from the Company of such failure or non-fulfillment, the Company shall not be required to perform or fulfill its obligations set forth in Sections 3, 4, 5 or 7 and the JANA Nominees shall each promptly tender their resignation as a member of the Board effective immediately upon its acceptance by the Company.",

                "explanation": "This removes the condition that JANA's failure to perform its obligations needs to be a 'material respect' and that it has been given a chance to remedy the failure. The modified clause allows the company to terminate the agreement and demand the resignation of the nominees for even minor breaches, without giving JANA an opportunity to fix the issue. This introduces a legal risk for JANA by making the agreement very easy to terminate by the Company.",

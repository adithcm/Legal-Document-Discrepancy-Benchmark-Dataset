When reporting results, Vendor shall count only expenditures with entities that are certified as MBE, WBE, or DVBE firms by third party certifying agencies recognized by AT&T, as listed on http://www.attsuppliers.com.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Vendor shall submit annual participation plans establishing Vendor's goals for participation by business enterprises.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the specific requirement to prioritize and report on the participation of minority, women, and disabled veteran-owned business enterprises (MBE, WBE, DVBE). Many jurisdictions (including federal contracts) have specific requirements or preferences for utilizing such businesses. Removing this requirement makes the contract potentially non-compliant with those regulations.",

The availability or performance of this technical support will not be construed as altering or affecting Vendor's obligations as set forth in the \"Warranty\" Section or as provided elsewhere in this Agreement. Field Service and technical support, including emergency support (service affecting), will be available on call twenty-four (24) hours a day. Vendor will provide to AT&T, and keep current, an escalation document that includes names, titles and telephone numbers, including after-hours telephone numbers, of Vendor personnel responsible for providing technical support to AT&T. Vendor will maintain a streamlined escalation process to speed resolution of reported problems.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the guarantee of 'full and complete' technical assistance at 'no additional cost', and the specific requirements for 24/7 emergency support, escalation documents, and a streamlined escalation process. These are important components of service level agreements (SLAs). Their omission weakens the support commitment and could violate implied warranty of merchantability if the product is not reasonably supported.",

                "explanation": "This change omits the requirement that the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) comply with AT&T's specific requirements (BCPR) as detailed in Appendix F. For critical infrastructure services, a robust BCP is often legally mandated or a contractual necessity to ensure service availability in the event of a disruption. By removing the compliance requirement, the contract creates a loophole that could lead to inadequate business continuity measures, violating regulatory expectations.",

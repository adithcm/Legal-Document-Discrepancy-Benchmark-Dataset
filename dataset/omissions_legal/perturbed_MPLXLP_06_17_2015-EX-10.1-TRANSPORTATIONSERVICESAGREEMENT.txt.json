If the amount owed by Shipper is the subject of a good faith dispute, Shipper shall be obligated to pay only the undisputed portion of such amount pending the resolution of such dispute in accordance with this Agreement. Late payments of undisputed amounts shall accrue interest at a rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum, until paid. Such payments will be paid by Shipper to MPL within fifteen (15) Days of the invoice date or resolution of any dispute, if applicable.",

                "explanation": "By requiring payment of the full disputed amount pending resolution, the contract contradicts consumer protection laws that allow disputing parties to withhold the disputed portion while it's being resolved. By removing language that only undisputed amounts accrue interest and stating MPL will determine the rate, this weakens consumer rights and provides opportunity to be predatory. Removing the 15 day payment limit leaves the Shipper open to immediate payment demands.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'direct' and 'consequential', the contract introduces ambiguity and eliminates legally recognized categories of damages, potentially preventing a party from seeking full compensation for breaches. This creates a loophole that contradicts standard contract law principles.",

Shipper shall provide to MPL, at any time: (i) upon MPL's request, information (\"Financial Information\") that will allow MPL to assess (or reassess) and establish creditworthiness and Shipper's capacity to perform any financial obligations that could arise from the transportation of Shipper's Crude Petroleum on the Pipeline; and (ii) upon MPL's good faith determination (which shall be no less than industry standards) of non-creditworthiness, MPL may request, financial assurance in respect of transportation or other services (\"Financial Assurances\"). Financial Assurances shall be limited to a guarantee from the parent company of Shipper in a form and substance acceptable to MPL and sufficient in amount to cover 6-months of Shipper's obligations to MPL so long as the guarantor has sufficient creditworthiness as set forth in this Section; and if not, MPL may then request an irrevocable standby letter of credit in a form and from an issuer acceptable to MPL, and in an amount no greater than 6-months of tolls based on the Quarterly Volume Commitment, plus all applicable taxes.",

Financial Assurances shall be determined by MPL.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 'good faith' and 'no less than industry standards' requirements for determining non-creditworthiness allows MPL to arbitrarily demand financial assurances. Eliminating the limitation on the type and amount of financial assurances (parent company guarantee or letter of credit limited to 6 months) gives MPL unchecked power to demand unreasonable financial guarantees, potentially violating fair business practice laws.",

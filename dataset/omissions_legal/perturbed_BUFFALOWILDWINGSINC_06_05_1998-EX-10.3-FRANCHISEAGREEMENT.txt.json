You will procure at your expense and maintain in full force and effect during the term of this Agreement, an insurance policy or policies protecting you, us and our designated affiliates, and their officers, directors, partners and employees against any loss, liability, personal injury, death, or property damage or expense whatsoever arising or occurring upon or in connection with the Franchised Restaurant, as we may reasonably require for our own and your protection.

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'protecting you, us and our designated affiliates, and their officers, directors, partners and employees against any loss, liability, personal injury, death, or property damage or expense whatsoever arising or occurring upon or in connection with the Franchised Restaurant, as we may reasonably require for our own and your protection', the franchisee is no longer explicitly required to obtain insurance that protects the franchisor and related parties. This omission contradicts standard franchise law practices and introduces legal risk as it weakens the franchisor's protection against potential liabilities arising from the franchisee's operations, making it non-compliant with general legal expectations for risk allocation in franchise agreements.",

The policy or policies shall be written by an insurance company satisfactory to us in accordance with standards and specifications set forth in the Manuals or otherwise in writing, and shall include, at a minimum (except as different coverages and policy limits may reasonably be specified for all franchisees from time to time by us in the Manuals or otherwise in writing) the following:\n1. All risks coverage insurance on the Franchised Restaurant and all fixtures, equipment, supplies and other property used in the operation of the Franchised Restaurant, for full repair and replacement value of the machinery, equipment, improvements and betterments, without any applicable co-insurance clause, except that an appropriate deductible clause shall be permitted.\n2. Worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance as well as such other insurance as may be required by statute or rule of the state in which the Franchised Restaurant is located and operated.\n3. Comprehensive general liability insurance and product liability insurance with minimum limits of ONE MILLION Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit including the following coverages: contractual liability; personal injury; products/completed operation; and tenant's fire legal liability; insuring against all claims, suits, obligations, liabilities and damages, including attorneys' fees, based upon or arising out of actual or alleged personal injuries or property damage resulting from, or occurring in the course of, or on or about or otherwise relating to the Franchised Restaurant, provided that the required amounts herein may be modified from time to time by us to reflect inflation or future experience with claims.\n4. If you offer delivery service or utilize motor vehicles for any other purpose in the operation of the Franchised Restaurant, automobile liability insurance, including owned, hired and non-owned vehicle coverage, with a combined single limit of at least ONE MILLION Dollars ($1,000,000).\n5.

                "explanation": "By removing the requirements for 'satisfactory to us,' 'in accordance with standards and specifications set forth in the Manuals or otherwise in writing,' 'at a minimum,' specific types of coverage (e.g., 'all risks', 'employer's liability', 'comprehensive'), and definite minimum limits (e.g., 'ONE MILLION Dollars'), the franchisee is given significant leeway in securing insurance. This omission of crucial details contradicts standard business practices and increases legal risk as it fails to enforce essential insurance coverage and limitations, conflicting with industry risk management standards and potentially state-mandated minimum insurance requirements for businesses that serve alcohol or offer delivery services.",

                "original_text": "C. The insurance afforded by the policy or policies respecting liability shall not be limited in any way by reason of any insurance which may be maintained by us. The insurance coverage must commence as of the date the location of the Franchised Restaurant has been secured. You agree to deliver to us prior to opening and periodically at any time upon our request, proper certificate evidencing the existence of the insurance coverage which names us as a named insured. Such certificate shall state that said policy or policies will not be canceled or altered without at least twenty (20) days prior written notice to us and shall reflect proof of payment of premiums. Maintenance of such insurance and the performance by you of the obligations under this Paragraph will not relieve you of liability under the indemnity provision set forth in this Agreement. Minimum limits as required above may be modified from time to time, as conditions require, by written notice to you and we may require you to provide periodic proof of payment of premiums.",

                "explanation": "Removing the statements regarding the insurance not being limited, the required commencement date, and the explicit requirement for the certificate to state the policy will not be canceled or altered without notice significantly weakens the franchisor's control and protection. This omission creates legal risk, as it allows for potentially inadequate insurance coverage and eliminates crucial monitoring mechanisms (notification of cancellation, proof of payment), contradicting standard risk management procedures. It also removes the requirement to name the franchisor as a 'named insured'.",

Company further represents that it has not received any written notice of a claim and otherwise has no knowledge that the methods described and claimed in the Patents and the Technical Information, and the products produced thereby in accordance with such information, violate or infringe upon the rights of any Person. Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Investor, Investors' Affiliates, and their officers and directors, and their direct and indirect customers, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, diminution in value, deficiencies, actions, proceedings, taxes, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of investigation as incurred, arising out of or relating to any breach of any of the representations made in this Article 3.09.",

                "explanation": "Removing the indemnification clause limits the investor's legal recourse in case of intellectual property infringement claims against the company's patents or technical information. This introduces legal risk, as it could contradict general principles of liability and consumer protection laws that require companies to be accountable for misrepresentations regarding their intellectual property. This also omits the explicit obligation for the company to cover legal expenses arising from breaches of representation, making it harder for the investor to seek compensation for damages.",

Subject to Article 7.01 below, the sole right to institute a suit for infringement of the Patents rests with Company.

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Article 7.00 shall require Investor to join any such suit as a party, and Company shall not seek to join Investor to any such suit as a party absent the express written consent of Investor. Any recovery received pursuant to such suit will first go to Investor to reimburse Investor for any costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by Investor in cooperating with Company in the suit, and any remaining amounts shall be retained by Company.",

                "explanation": "Removing the provision for the Investor to be reimbursed for their costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) if the investor cooperates with the company in infringement suits weakens the Investor's position. This creates a financial disincentive for the investor to cooperate, and it may contradict laws which mandate equitable distribution of recoveries in cases involving intellectual property rights, especially in jurisdictions like California where 'good faith and fair dealing' is implied into every contract.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'thirty (30)' days to 'ninety (90)' days materially extends the cure period, potentially causing financial damage to the Investor should the company drag its feet on resolving the material breach. This is a contradiction against the principle of preventing undue hardship from breach of contract and the reasonable time to remedy defects, potentially violating laws that aim to avoid such conditions, especially in jurisdictions with strong consumer and investor protection laws.",

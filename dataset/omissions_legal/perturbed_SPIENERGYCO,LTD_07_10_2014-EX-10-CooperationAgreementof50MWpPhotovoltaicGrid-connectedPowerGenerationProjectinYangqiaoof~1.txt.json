                "explanation": "Removing the promise of 'comprehensive development...commercial crops will be interplanted as agriculture and forestry as well as medicinal materials' weakens environmental protection commitments. The removal of 'local employees will enjoy the priority to be employed' eliminates a key provision that benefits the local community. This omission introduces a potential legal contradiction with Chinese environmental regulations and labor laws that prioritize environmental protection and local employment in development projects.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'guarantees...most preferential policies and all-round service...actively coordinate relevant departments' significantly weakens Party A's commitment to supporting the project. While this is a cooperation agreement, the removal of the guarantee and assurance of preferential treatment could be seen as a violation of implicit obligations under Chinese contract law if it later impedes the project's progress, especially concerning government approvals and subsidies. Government obligations and implicit guarantees can be legally enforceable in China.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'foreign-funded' and 'Party A will offer all the preferential policies to the company as per local investment promotion policies for foreign investment introduction' removes a guarantee of preferential treatment for foreign investment. This contradicts the spirit and potentially the specific articles of Chinese law that encourage and protect foreign investment through preferential policies. Many regions offer specific guarantees of favorable treatment to attract foreign capital, and removing this weakens the investor's position and opens them up to discriminatory practices.",

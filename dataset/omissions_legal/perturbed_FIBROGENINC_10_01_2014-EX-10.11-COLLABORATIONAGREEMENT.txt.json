Such insurance shall include general liability, clinical trial liability and products liability coverage with respect to such party's performance of the Development Program and commercialization of Lead Compounds hereunder. Upon request by the other party hereto, certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage required above shall be provided to the other party.",

Such insurance shall include general liability coverage with respect to such party's performance of the Development Program and commercialization of Lead Compounds hereunder. Certificates of insurance may be requested by the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates specific insurance types (clinical trial liability and products liability) and a duration of five years post-agreement, ensuring consumer protection and recourse. Removing these requirements introduces a legal contradiction: By omitting the requirement for clinical trial and products liability insurance and the specific term, the contract weakens the consumer's ability to seek compensation for damages resulting from the use of the product. Also, By omitting the duration, the contract weakens the consumer's ability to seek compensation for damages that occur after the termination of the contract but are still related to the product.",

California and Japan both have laws pertaining to product liability and consumer protection, which this change could violate.",

                "original_text": "A party (for purposes of this Section 17.4, the \"Indemnitee\") that intends to claim indemnification under any provision of this Agreement shall promptly notify the indemnifying party (the \"Indemnitor\") in writing of any claim, action, suit, or other proceeding brought by third parties in respect of which the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, or their directors, officers, employees, successors or assigns intend to claim such indemnification hereunder. As between the parties hereto the Indemnitor shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such claim, action, suit, or other proceeding; provided, that the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in such defense or settlement with counsel of its own choosing at its expense. The Indemnitee shall not make any settlement of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action without the consent of the Indemnitor, to the extent such consent is not withheld unreasonably or delayed. The failure to deliver written notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such Indemnitor of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Article 17 but the omission so to deliver written notice to the Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to any Indemnitee otherwise than under this Article 17. Without limiting the foregoing, the Indemnitee shall keep the Indemnitor fully informed of the progress of any claim, action, suit, or other proceeding for which it intends to claim indemnification under this Article 17.",

As between the parties hereto the Indemnitor shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such claim, action, suit, or other proceeding; provided, that the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in such defense or settlement with counsel of its own choosing at its expense.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides crucial details about the indemnification process, ensuring fairness and legal protection for both parties. The removal of 'promptly' from the notification requirement and removing the detail about the Indemnitee making a settlement without the consent of the Indemnitor weakens the Indemnitee's protection because the notification could happen at any time. Removing the liability for the Indemnitor to the Indemnitee limits the compensation that the Indemnitee can receive.",

Such books and records shall be kept for at least [ * ] following the end of the calendar quarter to which they pertain. FG shall keep, and require its Sublicensee(s) to keep, complete, true and accurate books of accounts and records for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of the [ * ] Percentage and Fully Burdened Costs. Such records will be open for inspection at the principal place of business of each party (the \"Inspected Party\") during such [ * ] period by an independent auditor chosen by the other party (the \"Inspecting Party\") and reasonably acceptable to the Inspected Party for the purpose of verifying the amounts payable by Astellas to FG hereunder or the accuracy of the [ * ] Percentage and/or Fully Burdened Costs. Such inspections may be made no more than once each calendar year, at reasonable times and on reasonable notice. Any books of accounts or records shall not be inspected more than once. The independent auditor retained by the Inspecting Party shall be obligated to execute a reasonable confidentiality agreement with the Inspected Party prior to commencing any such inspection, which, among other customary clauses, contains the provisions to the effect that such auditor shall not disclose to the Inspecting Party any information other than as necessary to accomplish the purpose of the inspection. Inspections conducted under this Section 10.5 shall be at the expense of the Inspecting Party. Any underpaid or overcharged amounts that are discovered will be paid by the Inspected Party, and with interest on such underpaid or overcharged amounts at the rate set forth in Section 10.2 above.

                "explanation": "By omitting several key requirements, the modified text weakens the consumer protection. Removal of 'complete, true and accurate' creates ambiguity, making it harder to prove discrepancies. Deletion of the record retention period eliminates accountability over time. Omitting the term 'independent' from 'auditor' means that the auditor could be an entity related to either Astellas or FG. Removal of the clause that the auditor shall sign a confidentiality agreement now opens a route for the auditor to disclose private information about either party. Finally, omitting the details about interest on underpaid or overcharged amounts removes any penalties or recourse to collect or be compensated.",

                "original_text": "Administrator will adopt and maintain an anti-money laundering program in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including provisions for necessary currency transaction reporting, detection of suspicious activities that could give rise to money laundering, and knowing Administrator's customers.",
                "changed_text": "Administrator will implement measures to address money laundering concerns.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific requirements for currency transaction reporting, detection of suspicious activities, and knowing the customer, the contract fails to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and related anti-money laundering regulations. This omission weakens the Administrator's obligations and exposes the Trust to potential legal and financial risks.",

The Trust shall pay for all costs for typesetting, printing and distributing proxy materials.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the explicit obligation for the Trust to cover the costs of distributing Fund reports and other communications to contract owners, it contradicts the requirement for transparency and accessibility of information for investors. This creates a legal risk, potentially leading to claims of insufficient disclosure by the Administrator.",

                "explanation": "This significantly reduces the Trust's indemnification obligations. Removing the indemnity for untrue statements or omissions in the prospectus, as well as the failure to maintain current registrations, weakens investor protections under securities laws. It could create a legal contradiction by failing to provide adequate indemnification for potential violations of securities regulations, impacting the Administrator's legal standing.",

                "original_text": "Licensee shall oversee and take ultimate responsibility with respect to the provision of equal opportunities, lowest unit charge, and reasonable access to political candidates, and compliance with the political broadcast rules of the FCC. During the Term, Programmer shall cooperate with Licensee as Licensee complies with its political broadcast responsibilities, and shall supply such information promptly to Licensee as may be necessary to comply with the political advertising time record keeping, reasonable access, and lowest unit charge requirements of federal law.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall oversee the provision of access to political candidates, and Programmer shall cooperate with Licensee and supply information as necessary.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the Licensee's explicit responsibility for 'equal opportunities' and 'lowest unit charge' for political candidates, weakening compliance with FCC rules, especially Section 315 of the Communications Act, which mandates equal opportunities regarding broadcast time.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall conform' to 'shall attempt to conform', the contract weakens the requirement for the programming to adhere to FCC regulations. This introduces ambiguity and legal risk, as it implies that full compliance is not guaranteed or strictly enforced, which contradicts the FCC's mandate for licensees to ensure compliance.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific requirement for compliance with the FCC's sponsorship identification policy weakens the obligation to adhere to federal regulations regarding transparency in advertising. This creates legal risk as it eliminates a key safeguard against undisclosed or improperly identified sponsorships, which is a violation of FCC rules.",

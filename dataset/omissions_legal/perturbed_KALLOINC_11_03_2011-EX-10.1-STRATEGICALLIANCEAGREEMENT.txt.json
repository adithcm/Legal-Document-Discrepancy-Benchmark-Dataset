Agent shall promptly supply Kallo with proof of such insurance  upon request. Kallo shall maintain comprehensive general liability and errors and omissions insurance for the  Kallo Mobile care suite of products.

Kallo shall promptly supply Agent with proof of such insurance upon  request.",
                "explanation": "Removal of the requirement for 'Comprehensive general liability insurance' for the Agent and modification to 'Kallo shall maintain errors and omissions insurance' removes a crucial consumer protection/insurance requirement. This introduces a **legal contradiction** with typical commercial contracts and state laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts and types of liability insurance to protect against potential liabilities arising from business operations and services provided. This may leave customers without adequate recourse in case of damages or losses.",

                "explanation": "Removal of 'without the express written consent of Kallo' will allow the agent to bypass the company's sub-Agents rules and regulations. This introduces a **legal contradiction** with some laws that protect the company in case of any issues regarding the sub-agents, for example, Sub-agents may not receive proper training on handling sensitive patient data, potentially violating privacy laws.",

                "original_text": "c) On Termination: Notwithstanding any terms of this agreement to the contrary, upon termination of this Agreement  for any reason whatsoever, Kallo, unless otherwise agreed, shall set aside the Agent's Book of Business to be held  by Kallo.\n\ni.The revenue stream defined by the Book of Business at the time Kallo becomes the controlling party will remain  constant except in as far as any elected reduction in use by its customers. Any increase in use will not be to the  benefit of the Book of Business.  ii.Kallo shall pay over all funds collected from the Book of Business and due to Agent, less a reasonable administration  fee to be assessed and determined by Kallo, to Agent or its designees or assigns immediately upon receipt and act as  a conduit for Agent funds, except in as far as Kallo or its assignees are required to support customers in the Book of  Business in which case the cost of providing such support, will be reasonably assessed and appropriate deductions  made before passing the balance to Agent. In the event Agent does not agree with the costs described in this section,  the issue will be submitted to binding arbitration.  iii.Kallo shall make an accounting of funds collected to Agent or their assigns monthly. Kallo shall permit Agent or its  designated Agent(s) to inspect Kallo's books upon Agent's request at Agent's expense during normal business hours  of Kallo.  iv.Kallo's failure to perform its duties in the event it becomes the controlling party of the Agent's Book of Business is a  non-material breach of this agreement.  v.In any dispute or litigation over the terms of this agreement, the prevailing party shall have reasonable attorney fees in  addition to any settlement or damages awarded.",
                "changed_text": "c) On Termination: Notwithstanding any terms of this agreement to the contrary, upon termination of this Agreement  for any reason whatsoever, all rights granted to Agent  shall immediately cease and Agent shall immediately return to Kallo all Kallo Products and confidential information  provided by Kallo.",
                "explanation": "By removing the entire section related to the 'Book of Business' after termination, the Agent is stripped of their rights to the future revenue stream they created. Furthermore, the Agent loses any compensation for clients who are still under contract. By deleting these obligations, the amended contract contradicts the principles of unjust enrichment and fair compensation. This could lead to legal challenges based on breach of contract and unfair business practices.",

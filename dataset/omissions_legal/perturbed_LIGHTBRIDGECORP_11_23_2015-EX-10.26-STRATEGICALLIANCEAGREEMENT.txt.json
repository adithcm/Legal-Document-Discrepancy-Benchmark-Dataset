Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party (the \"Relevant Party\") shall not,  and shall cause its Affiliates not to, do or cause to be done any of the following in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (a) directly or indirectly through any other Person. pay, offer to pay, promise to pay, or authorize the payment of any monies or anything of value to any official or employee of any Government Authority or any political party or candidate for political office for the purpose of illegally or improperly inducing or rewarding any action by such official, employee or candidate favorable to the Relevant Party or any of its Affiliate or (b) take any other action that, if taken by a Person subject to United States law, would violate  the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

                "explanation": "The original text mandates comprehensive compliance ('in all respects') with all applicable laws. By omitting 'and shall cause its Affiliates to. at all times, comply in all respects with', and removing 'directly or indirectly through any other Person. pay, offer to pay, promise to pay, or authorize the payment of any monies or anything of value to any official or employee of any Government Authority or any political party or candidate for political office for the purpose of illegally or improperly inducing or rewarding any action by such official, employee or candidate favorable to the Relevant Party or any of its Affiliate or (b)', the contract reduces the obligation to a more general statement, potentially opening loopholes for non-compliance. This omission also removes the requirement to prevent affiliates from engaging in corrupt practices, weakening anti-corruption safeguards.",

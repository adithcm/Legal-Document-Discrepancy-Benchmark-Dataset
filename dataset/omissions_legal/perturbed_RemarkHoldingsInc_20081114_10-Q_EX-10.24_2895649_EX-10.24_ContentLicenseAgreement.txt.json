World Book will create the Affinities according to the guidelines and instructions provided by HSWI from time to time, and agreed to by World Book whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and according to the high quality standards for commercially published works, but in no event less than the standards of World Book for its own published works. If an Affinity does not meet the requirements set forth herein, World Book will promptly revise the Affinity to meet such.",

If an Affinity does not meet the requirements set forth herein, World Book may revise the Affinity.",
                "explanation": "Removing the promise to 'make reasonable efforts to cross check the Reference Content against other World Book products for factual accuracy' and changing 'World Book will promptly revise the Affinity to meet such' to 'World Book may revise the Affinity' weakens the obligation to provide accurate content. This introduces a legal contradiction as consumer protection laws, particularly in jurisdictions like California (where implied warranties of merchantability exist), require a basic level of accuracy and quality in the provided content.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'complete and accurate' and 'in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied' it weakens the financial transparency requirements. This creates a **legal contradiction** as such clauses are necessary to ensure compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act if HSWI is a publicly traded company in the US, or similar regulations in Delaware, where HSWI is incorporated.",

Accordingly, each party will be entitled to seek injunctions and other equitable remedies in the event of such a breach or threatened breach by the other party, or to seek specific performance of any provision hereof.

                "explanation": "Removing the clause specifying the right to 'seek injunctions and other equitable remedies' and limiting remedies to monetary damages restricts the legal recourse available to World Book. In situations involving intellectual property rights (Content licensing), equitable relief is often crucial for preventing ongoing harm (e.g., unauthorized use of content). Removing this clause undermines the protection of intellectual property, especially given US copyright law where equitable relief, including injunctions, is a standard remedy. This is particularly harmful to consumers if the omission leads to the spread of misinformation that the consumer cannot get corrected.",

                "changed_text": "Insurance\n48. The Venture may, at its discretion, insure some of its assets against loss.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the obligation to insure all assets, replacing it with a discretionary approach. This introduces legal risk because Florida law requires businesses to maintain adequate insurance coverage to protect against foreseeable risks, and explicitly removes the assurance that is 'reasonable and standard practice.' By making insurance discretionary and only covering 'some' assets, the contract contradicts the implied duty to act reasonably and prudently to protect the venture's assets, creating a legal loophole.",

In the event a dispute arises out of, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Members will attempt to resolve the dispute through friendly consultation.\n56. If the dispute is not resolved within a reasonable period then any or all outstanding issues may be submitted to mediation in accordance with any statutory rules of mediation. If mediation is not successful in resolving the entire dispute or is unavailable, any outstanding issues will be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. The arbitrator's award will be final, and judgment may be entered upon it by any court having jurisdiction within the State of Florida.",

In the event a dispute arises out of, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Members may attempt to resolve the dispute through friendly consultation.\n56. If the dispute is not resolved then any or all outstanding issues will be submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator's award will be subject to appeal.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for mediation and specifying that the arbitrator's award is subject to appeal, the modified clause contradicts Florida's arbitration laws. Florida Statutes Chapter 682 emphasizes final and binding arbitration. Making the award appealable undermines the purpose of arbitration as a quick and efficient dispute resolution method, creating a legal contradiction.",

This section will not survive the termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The change removes the exception for information that 'properly comes into the public domain,' meaning that even publicly available information is contractually prohibited from being disclosed. Additionally, the confidentiality clause is set to not survive the termination of the agreement. This is problematic because trade secrets may require confidentiality protection for a longer period. Florida's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (FUTSA) protects trade secrets indefinitely as long as they remain confidential. By removing the exception for public information and limiting the duration of confidentiality, the modified clause undermines the protections afforded by FUTSA.",

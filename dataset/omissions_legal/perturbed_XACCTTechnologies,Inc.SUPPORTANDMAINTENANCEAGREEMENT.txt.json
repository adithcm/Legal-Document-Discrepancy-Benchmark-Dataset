                "original_text": "XACCT will provide reasonable commercial efforts to provide the          appropriate solutions for reported Incidents. Initial response times          for reported Incidents are as set forth in Attachment 1.",
                "changed_text": "XACCT may provide solutions for reported Incidents. Response times will be determined at XACCT's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will provide reasonable commercial efforts' to 'may provide solutions' and removing the guarantee of 'initial response times as set forth in Attachment 1', the obligation to provide support is weakened. California law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts, which could be interpreted to require reasonable support efforts. This modification creates legal risk by potentially violating this implied covenant.",

                "original_text": "All disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved          exclusively in the appropriate state court in Santa Clara County,          California or in the federal court in the Northern District of          California, and it is explicitly agreed that no other court shall have          such jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "All disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved in a manner determined by XACCT.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific jurisdiction clause and replacing it with a statement that resolution will be 'in a manner determined by XACCT' effectively eliminates the consumer's right to a fair legal venue. This violates fundamental principles of contract law and consumer protection, as it allows the company to dictate the dispute resolution process, potentially to the consumer's detriment. California law requires fair and reasonable dispute resolution mechanisms.",

                "changed_text": "The terms of the License Agreement shall apply to the Major and Minor Releases of Product delivered according to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit mention of 'LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY,' the contract becomes less transparent about these critical aspects. This omission may violate California's consumer protection laws which require clear and conspicuous disclosure of warranty information. Consumers are entitled to know the extent of the warranty, any disclaimers, and limitations of liability. The change increases legal risk by obscuring the warranty terms.",

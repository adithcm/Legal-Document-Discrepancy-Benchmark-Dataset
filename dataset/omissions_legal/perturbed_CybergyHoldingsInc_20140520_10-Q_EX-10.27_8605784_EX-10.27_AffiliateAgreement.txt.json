                "original_text": "MA shall protect copyrights, tradenames, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other confidential proprietary rights and information of Company and its affiliates and report promptly any infringements or suspected infringements of which MA becomes aware and to cooperate fully with Company in its efforts to protect its copyrights, tradenames, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other confidential proprietary rights and information.",

                "explanation": "The omission of the requirement for the Marketing Affiliate (MA) to 'report promptly any infringements or suspected infringements' and to 'cooperate fully with Company' weakens the protection of intellectual property. This introduces legal risk because U.S. law (specifically, intellectual property law) places an affirmative duty on parties to take reasonable steps to protect their trademarks and copyrights. By removing the MA's obligation to report and cooperate, the contract fails to adequately address the protection of Company's IP, which could expose the Company to liability or weaken its ability to enforce its IP rights.",

                "explanation": "By removing the disclaimer of implied warranties, specifically 'MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,' the contract now implies these warranties exist without explicitly stating them.  This omission creates a legal contradiction because in many jurisdictions, including Nevada (where the agreement is governed), implied warranties are automatically included in sales contracts unless specifically and conspicuously disclaimed. The modified text fails to conspicuously disclaim these warranties, making the Company potentially liable for breaches of implied warranties that it intended to exclude.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'MA hereby waives the right to require Company and/or its Affiliate to post a bond' significantly changes the equitable remedies available to the Company. In many jurisdictions, a party seeking an injunction must post a bond to cover potential damages to the other party if the injunction is later found to be wrongfully issued. By omitting this waiver, the MA retains the right to demand a bond, potentially making it more difficult and expensive for the Company to obtain injunctive relief. This introduces a legal contradiction because while not strictly illegal, the bond requirement is a procedural safeguard designed to protect parties from wrongful injunctions, and its removal increases the Company's risk of being unable to effectively enforce its intellectual property rights, particularly impacting small businesses.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit responsibility for 'timely filing' and 'completeness and accuracy' and weakens the obligation to a vague strive, contradicting SEC regulations regarding accurate and timely disclosure in joint filings, which is a legal requirement for investors.",

                "explanation": "By omitting 'In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of a statement on Schedule 13D (including amendments thereto and statements on Schedule 13G)', the contract removes the acknowledgment of the legal basis for the joint filing and the specification of filing Schedule 13D. This potentially removes certain liability and responsibilities. Investors have a legal obligation to adhere to those rules when acting together; removing them removes an explicit protection.",

                "original_text": "Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers. The Certificate so issued shall be accepted as the base of a claim. The Sellers, in accordance with the Buyers' claim, shall be responsible for the immediate elimination of the defect(s), complete or partial replacement of the commodity or shall devaluate the commodity according to the state of defect(s). Where necessary, the Buyers shall be at liberty to eliminate the defect(s) themselves at the Sellers' expenses. If the Sellers fail to answer the Buyers within one weeks after receipt of the aforesaid claim, the claim shall be reckoned as having been accepted by the Sellers.",
                "changed_text": "Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers may notify the Sellers of any issues. The Sellers will consider the notification. If the Sellers fail to answer the Buyers within one weeks after receipt of the aforesaid notification, it does not imply acceptance of the claim.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the buyer's explicit right to claim replacement, compensation, and cost coverage for non-conforming goods. It removes the binding acceptance of a claim if the seller doesn't respond, weakening buyer protections.",
                "contradicted_law": "The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), which China has ratified, provides implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose (Articles 35 and 36). The modification restricts the buyer's remedies for breach of these implied warranties and shifts the burden of proof unfairly to the buyer.",

                "original_text": "Under such circumstances the Sellers, however, are still under the obligation to take all necessary measures to hasten the delivery of the goods. In case the accident lasts for more than 10 weeks, the Buyers shall have the right to cancel the Contract.",
                "changed_text": "Under such circumstances, the Sellers may take measures. In case the accident lasts for more than 10 weeks, the Buyers may discuss potential resolutions with the Sellers.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the seller's obligation to hasten delivery during a force majeure event and replaces the buyer's right to cancel with a vague 'discussion' of potential resolutions. This undermines the buyer's ability to mitigate losses from prolonged delays.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under Article 79 of the CISG, a party is not liable for a failure to perform any of his obligations if he proves that the failure was due to an impediment beyond his control and that he could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences. However, this change weakens the buyer's rights to terminate the contract in cases where the seller's actions aren't truly beyond their control and are significantly impacting the buyer.",

            {
                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Should the Sellers fail to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, with exception of Force Majeure causes specified in Clause 17 of this Contract, the Buyers shall agree to postpone the delivery on condition that the Sellers agree to pay a penalty which shall be deducted by the paying bank from the payment. The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. The rate of penalty is charged at 0.5% for every seven days, odd days less than seven days should be counted as seven days. In case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the contract and the Sellers, in spite of the cancellation, shall still pay the aforesaid penalty to the Buyers without delay, the seller should refund the money received and pay the 30% of the total goods price of the penalty",
                "changed_text": "Should the Sellers fail to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, with exception of Force Majeure causes specified in Clause 17 of this Contract, the Buyers may consider a penalty for late delivery. Any penalty shall be at the sole discretion of the Buyers and will not exceed 1% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. In case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers may consider cancelling the contract.",
                "explanation": "This change transforms the penalty for late delivery from a mandatory payment to a discretionary consideration by the buyer. It also reduces the maximum penalty and removes the requirement for the seller to refund money received and pay an additional penalty upon cancellation. This significantly weakens the buyer's remedies for late delivery.",
                "contradicted_law": "Again, regarding the CISG, if a party fails to perform as agreed, the other party may claim damages, including compensation for loss of profit. This clause, as modified, unduly limits the buyer's ability to claim adequate compensation for losses arising from the seller's breach of contract, potentially violating the principle of full compensation as established in international sales law.",

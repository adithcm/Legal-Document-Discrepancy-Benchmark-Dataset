                "original_text": "This Agreement and the rights and duties of Transporter and Shipper hereunder shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Arkansas, without recourse to the law governing conflict of laws.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement and the rights and duties of Transporter and Shipper hereunder shall be governed by and interpreted at the Transporter's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Arkansas law and replacing it with 'Transporter's discretion', the contract omits the legally mandated consumer protections provided by Arkansas state law. This introduces legal risk, as the contract could be interpreted in a way that is unfavorable to the Shipper and violates established legal principles.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the Shipper's explicit right to participate in rate proceedings, which is a right granted under the Natural Gas Act and Natural Gas Policy Act. Denying this right is a legal contradiction and introduces risk as it limits the Shipper's ability to contest potentially unfair rate increases.",

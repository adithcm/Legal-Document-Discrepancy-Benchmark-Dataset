                "explanation": "Removing the warranty that 'the manufacturing and shipment of the Product comply in all respects with applicable Laws, regulations, certification requirements, including health and safety standards and all other applicable regulatory requirements for the manufacture and shipment of Products' significantly reduces consumer protections. This introduces a legal risk because it allows for the possibility that the product may be manufactured or shipped in a way that violates consumer protection laws. The Netherlands has strict requirements for product safety and compliance with regulations like CE marking. Omitting this guarantee potentially violates those regulations.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase stating, 'Philips shall at its sole cost provide full cooperation to Customer in order to achieve an efficient and effective recall by Customer. Philips shall provide such cooperation at its own costs, including internal organizational costs but not including the costs of repair, replacement, installation of Products and logistics related to the recall', Philips no longer commits to fully supporting recall efforts, including internal organizational costs. This omission contradicts consumer protection laws because manufacturers are often legally obligated to contribute to the costs and efforts associated with product recalls, not just cooperate in a minimal way. Netherlands consumer law would typically expect the manufacturer (Philips, in this contract manufacturing setup) to shoulder some of the financial burden, especially organizational costs directly related to facilitating the recall.",

This is an important clause for auditing, and removing it reduces transparency. This omission contradicts consumer protection laws and regulatory compliance requirements because manufacturers are legally obligated to remediate issues discovered during governmental inspections. This can create a scenario where Philips does not address manufacturing deficiencies noted by regulatory bodies, because they would no longer legally need to.",

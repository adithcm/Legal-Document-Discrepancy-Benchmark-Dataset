Any policyholder holding a policy issued by the Company prior to the\n       termination of this Agreement shall have the right to demand that the\n       Company enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 of this\n       Agreement, and, if the Company fails or refuses to take timely action to\n       enforce such rights or the Company defaults in any claim or other\n       payment owed to any such policyholder when due, such policyholder may\n       proceed directly against AIG to enforce the Company's rights under\n       paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 of this\n\n                                      5\n\n       Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no policyholder of the Company may\n       take any action authorized under this paragraph 9 unless and until\n       (a) such policyholder has given AIG written notice of its intent to\n       enforce the terms of this Agreement as provided in this paragraph 9,\n       which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of and basis\n       for the policyholder's complaint and (b) AIG has failed to comply with\n       this Agreement within sixty (60) days after such notice is given; and,        PROVIDED, FURTHER, that upon termination of this Agreement in accordance        with paragraph 8 hereof, the rights of any policyholder as provided for        under this paragraph 9 shall terminate effective as of the Termination        Date, except with respect to the obligation of AIG (if any) to make        capital contributions to the Company pursuant to paragraphs 1, 4 and 5        of this Agreement solely to the extent such obligation arose prior to,        and remained unsatisfied as of, the Termination Date (it being        understood that upon AIG's satisfaction of all such obligations after        the Termination Date, no such policyholder shall have any rights against        the Company or AIG, as the case may be, under this paragraph 9).",

                "explanation": "This change removes the policyholder's right to directly enforce the capital maintenance agreement against AIG, which could be argued as a violation of policyholder protection laws in Delaware (the Domiciliary State), as it weakens their ability to recover claims if the company defaults and AIG terminates the agreement. States like Delaware are interested in the financial protection of their citizens, that may be insured under life insurance companies.",

Subject to the requirements of applicable law and the approval, to the\n        extent required, by any or all of the Company's senior management,\n        relevant management committees, board of directors, and of any insurance\n        regulator, the Company hereby acknowledges that, in a manner consistent\n        with past practice and\n\n       any other reasonable requirements of AIG, it will comply with all\n        financial and budgetary planning, risk mitigation, derisking or pricing,\n        corporate governance, investment, informational and procedural\n\n\n\n       requirements set forth by AIG.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'Subject to the requirements of applicable law and the approval, to the extent required, by any or all of the Company's senior management, relevant management committees, board of directors, and of any insurance regulator', the clause now mandates the Company's compliance with AIG's requirements without regard to legal or regulatory constraints or internal approvals. This introduces a legal risk because it potentially forces the Company to violate insurance regulations or fiduciary duties owed to policyholders if AIG's requirements conflict with those obligations. This also increases the risk of improper business practices, where the parent company could potentially influence the subsidiary in a manner not compliant with Delaware laws",

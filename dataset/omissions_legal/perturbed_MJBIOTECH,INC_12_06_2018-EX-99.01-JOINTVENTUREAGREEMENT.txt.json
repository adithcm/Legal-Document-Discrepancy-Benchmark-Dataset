                "original_text": "Any Participant will have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the Joint Venture at any time. Written notice of intention to withdraw must be served in writing upon the remaining Participants at least Thirty (30) business days prior to the withdrawal date.",
                "changed_text": "Any Participant may withdraw from the Joint Venture. Written notice of intention to withdraw may be served to the remaining Participants.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'at any time' and changing the notification period from 'Thirty (30) business days' to 'may be served', the agreement weakens the withdrawal rights of participants. Florida law provides specific protections and notice periods for partners withdrawing from a joint venture to ensure orderly dissolution or continuation of the business. This omission introduces legal risk by potentially violating these statutory requirements for fair and reasonable withdrawal terms.",

                "changed_text": "The voluntary withdrawal of a Participant may result in the dissolution of the Joint Venture.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will result' to 'may result' provides ambiguity and weakens the certainty of dissolution upon withdrawal. Florida law establishes default rules for partnership dissolution upon a partner's dissociation, but allows partners to modify these rules in their agreement. Making dissolution discretionary rather than mandatory, without clear conditions or a mechanism to prevent unfair outcomes, creates a legal risk because it could be argued that the remaining members have the right to continue the joint venture and thereby avoid winding up obligations in violation of a dissociating partner's economic interests.",

                "original_text": "The remaining Participants retain the right to seek damages from a Dissociated Participant where the dissociation resulted from a malicious or criminal act by the Dissociated Participant or where the Dissociated Participant had breached their fiduciary duty to the Joint Venture or was in breach of this Agreement or had acted in a way that could reasonably be foreseen to bring harm or damage to the Joint Venture or to the reputation of the Joint Venture.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'malicious or criminal act' and 'breach of their fiduciary duty' reduces the range of conditions under which the joint venture can seek damages. Florida law imposes fiduciary duties on partners, and breaches of these duties are typically grounds for damages. By omitting these grounds, the agreement attempts to limit legal recourse available to the venture, contradicting established legal principles protecting partners from self-dealing or other breaches of duty. Further, removing 'breach of this agreement' provides ambiguity as to whether damages can be sought if a Participant breaches the agreement.",

The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (\"Dispute Notice\") to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall each select one (1) arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. All language used in such proceedings shall be Mandarin Chinese. The Parties agree to keep the content of the dispute and the proceeding of the arbitration confidential. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney's fees).",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause about arbitration rules and costs allocation could be problematic. While the agreement specifies arbitration in Hong Kong, removing the reference to the 'Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce' creates ambiguity. Also, in many jurisdictions, including Taiwan, the losing party doesn't automatically bear all arbitration costs (including attorney's fees) unless explicitly agreed upon. Omitting this could contradict established legal practices and principles of fairness and equity in dispute resolution.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the carve-outs for disclosure to the board, management, legal counsel, accountants and authorities, the confidentiality clause becomes overly broad and potentially illegal. Companies are legally required to disclose information to auditors, regulators, and other authorities. By removing this exception, the clause introduces a legally problematic restriction on information flow necessary for compliance and governance.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'and it is not necessary to post any bond or other security' has been removed. This introduces a contradiction with legal norms concerning injunctive relief. Courts typically require a bond to be posted by a party seeking an injunction, to protect the defendant in case the injunction is later found to be wrongly issued. By removing this clause, the contract suggests a waiver of a protection legally afforded to parties subject to injunctions. This raises concerns about fairness and due process.",

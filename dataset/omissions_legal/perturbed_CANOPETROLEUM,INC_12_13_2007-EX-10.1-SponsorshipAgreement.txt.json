                "changed_text": "Sales and Other Taxes. The Company may add sales, excise and any other tax or surcharge to its invoices.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'which it is obligated to collect and remit under the laws of the State of Texas, the United States or any other jurisdiction,' the contract implies that the collection and remittance of taxes are optional, directly contradicting Texas state law and potentially other applicable tax laws. Businesses are legally obligated to collect and remit applicable sales taxes.",

In the event that either party shall be prevented from performing any of its obligations due under the terms of this  Agreement by an act of war, riot, or civil commotion, that party shall be excused from any further performance of the obligations and  undertakings set forth under the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By omitting 'act of God, by an act of State, by strikes, fire, flood, or by the occurrence of any  other event beyond the control of the parties hereto,' the contract narrows the scope of force majeure events. Many jurisdictions, including Texas, recognize a broader range of force majeure events, including natural disasters and government actions. Limiting the clause introduces a contradiction and potential legal risk if a force majeure event outside the defined scope occurs.",

                "explanation": "Removing the language 'all applicable federal, state' and 'including the rules and regulations of all governmental agencies or commissions having jurisdiction in matters covered by this Agreement or either of the parties hereto' significantly restricts the agreement's compliance scope. This creates a legal contradiction because the agreement should be bound by both federal and state regulations. Omitting this acknowledgement misrepresents the legal obligations of the parties.",

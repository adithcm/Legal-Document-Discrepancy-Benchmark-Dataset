Source: GLU MOBILE INC, S-1/A, 3/19/2007 (US$*****), and shall immediately pay the remaining Guarantee of ***** dollars (US$*****), equaling a total Guarantee payment by Licensee to Fox of ***** dollars (US$*****) (\"Guarantee Forfeiture Payment\").",

                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit guarantee amount and introduces uncertainty about future payments, which creates a legal risk. Contract law requires clear and definite terms, especially regarding financial obligations. By granting Fox sole discretion, the clause becomes potentially unenforceable and may violate consumer protection laws regarding fair business practices.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the specific percentage for the Distribution Fee, the contract becomes vague and potentially unenforceable. Consumer protection laws require transparency in pricing and fees.

                "explanation": "This change removes the exception for licensee's royalty payment obligations. By releasing the licensee from these obligations, Fox is effectively waiving its right to receive royalties for wireless products already released. This is a legal contradiction, as the licensee is still obligated to pay royalties on products released prior to this amendment. The licensee could claim that this clause releases them from those obligations and is a misrepresentation, contradicting previous laws. Such a misrepresentation can lead to legal claims under state contract laws.",

                "original_text": "Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, general liability insurance and product liability insurance with limits no less than $3,000,000 and within thirty (30) days from the date hereof, Company will submit to Pey Dirt a fully paid policy or certificate of insurance naming Pey Dirt, Pey Dirt's agent and Manning as additional insured parties, requiring that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such without written notice to Pey Dirt at least twenty (20) days in advance thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, general liability insurance and product liability insurance. Company will submit to Pey Dirt a certificate of insurance naming Pey Dirt, Pey Dirt's agent and Manning as additional insured parties.",
                "explanation": "Removing the minimum insurance limits and the requirement for advance notice of policy changes weakens the protection for Pey Dirt and Manning. Tennessee law, which governs this agreement per section 23, may have implied or statutory requirements for reasonable commercial insurance coverage. By omitting specifics, the contract introduces ambiguity and potential non-compliance.",

                "changed_text": "Past due payments hereunder shall bear interest.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific interest rate and the reference to the maximum permissible rate, the contract becomes vague and potentially unenforceable. Tennessee usury laws limit the maximum interest rate that can be charged. Omitting the reference to the legal maximum could lead to disputes and potential violations of Tennessee law if the implied rate exceeds the legal limit.",

All such arbitration shall take place at the office of the American Arbitration Association located in Nashville, Tennessee.  Each party is entitled to depose one (1) fact witness and any expert witness designated by the other party, and to conduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate.

                "explanation": "The omission of 'in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect', 'All such arbitration shall take place at the office of the American Arbitration Association located in Nashville, Tennessee', and 'Each party is entitled to depose one (1) fact witness and any expert witness designated by the other party, and to conduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate' weakens the arbitration clause by removing clarity on the process. Tennessee law favors clear and comprehensive arbitration agreements. By omitting these details, the enforceability of the arbitration clause becomes questionable under Tennessee law, and it fails to ensure a fair process for arbitration.",

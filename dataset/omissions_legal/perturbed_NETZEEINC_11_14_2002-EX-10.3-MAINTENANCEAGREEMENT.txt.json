                "original_text": "Maintenance provided by Netzee during the term of this Agreement shall include (1) standard maintenance upgrades and modifications offered by Netzee to its customers generally, standard maintenance upgrades and modifications offered by Netzee to its customers generally, and for such purpose Netzee will use commercially reasonable efforts to make and include (without limitation) as such modifications changes and upgrades necessary to comply with generally applicable industry and regulatory requirements of which it is notified (2) 5x12 call-in support between hours of 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday, (3) in the event of material discrepancies between the Services as provided and the specifications for such Services (which shall be furnished in reasonably acceptable form), reasonable effort (in relation to importance, impact, and scheduled development plans) to correct those discrepancies, and (4) availability of basic Services with at least 99% uptime between 4:00 a.m Monday and 7:00 p.m. Friday and between 8:00 a.m. Saturday and 2:00 p.m. Saturday Eastern Time, exclusive of outages caused by off-peak prescheduled maintenance or causes beyond Netzee's reasonable control (including third-party equipment or communications).",
                "changed_text": "Maintenance provided by Netzee during the term of this Agreement shall include (1) standard maintenance upgrades and modifications offered by Netzee to its customers generally, and (2) 5x12 call-in support between hours of 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the clause requiring Netzee to use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with industry and regulatory requirements and the 99% uptime guarantee. By omitting the commitment to address regulatory compliance, the contract creates legal risk because service providers are generally expected to maintain regulatory compliance, especially in banking. The removal of the 99% uptime guarantee also exposes Bankers Bank to potential service disruptions without recourse.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by jurisdiction, but generally, businesses must comply with industry-specific regulations. Uptime guarantees are often implied or expected in service level agreements, and failure to provide reasonable uptime may constitute breach of contract.",

                "changed_text": "THIS MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT IS GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE SUBJECT TO, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MASTER AGREEMENT BETWEEN NETZEE AND BANKERS BANK.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'INCLUDING THE LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY PROVIDED THEREIN' weakens the protections afforded to Bankers Bank. While the master agreement still governs, the specific call-out of warranty disclaimers and liability limitations is removed, making it less clear what limitations exist and giving Netzee more room to argue for broader limitations later. This creates a legal risk, especially if the master agreement contains very restrictive clauses.",

                "changed_text": "Following the completion of such maintenance term, Bankers Bank may renew maintenance for subsequent periods of one (1) year each, subject to adjustments proposed by Netzee.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'not to exceed 5% at least sixty (60) days in advance of the applicable renewal date', Netzee can now propose unlimited price increases with no advance notice period. This creates a significant imbalance in negotiating power, and, depending on the jurisdiction, could be considered an unconscionable contract term or a violation of good faith and fair dealing principles.",

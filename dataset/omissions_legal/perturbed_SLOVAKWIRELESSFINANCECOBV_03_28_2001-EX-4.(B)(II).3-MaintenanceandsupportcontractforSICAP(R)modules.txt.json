                "original_text": "If any payment is not received by Sicap Ltd on the date or dates, as laid down in this clause, or as may be further agreed upon by the parties, then Sicap Ltd has the right to suspend the services to EuroTel until payment has been received. Before suspending the services to EuroTel, a notification from Sicap Ltd will be given. In the event of a suspension of services by Sicap Ltd, as a result of a delay or lack of payment by EuroTel, Sicap Ltd will not be responsible for any damages resulting from this suspension.",
                "changed_text": "If any payment is not received by Sicap Ltd on the date or dates, as laid down in this clause, or as may be further agreed upon by the parties, then Sicap Ltd has the right to suspend the services to EuroTel until payment has been received. In the event of a suspension of services by Sicap Ltd, as a result of a delay or lack of payment by EuroTel, Sicap Ltd will not be responsible for any damages resulting from this suspension.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the notification requirement before suspending services allows Sicap Ltd to suspend services without warning, potentially violating Slovakian contract law that requires reasonable notice and opportunity to cure before service interruption.",

There shall be no reimbursement of any paid fee. In case of a substantial breach of this maintenance and support contract by either party, which is not remedied within thirty days from the other party's notice thereof, the other party shall have the right to terminate this maintenance and support contract with immediate effect without juridical procedures.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"in the form of a registered letter with proof of receipt\", the clause is modified in a way that it becomes much harder for EuroTel to prove it has terminated the contract.

                "changed_text": "No right to damages shall ever arise.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause requiring EuroTel to report the loss to Sicap Ltd in writing essentially eliminates EuroTel's ability to claim any damages. This likely violates basic principles of liability under Slovakian law where a party is generally entitled to seek damages for breach of contract, provided the loss is demonstrable.",

                "changed_text": "Wade relies upon Naked's skill\nand judgment.",
                "explanation": "By removing Naked's representations and warranties regarding product merchantability, fitness for purpose, and compliance with applicable laws, this change introduces a significant legal risk. In New York, products must meet certain safety and quality standards, and Naked is no longer contractually bound to uphold those standards. This could lead to liability issues if the products are defective or unsafe. It removes essential guarantees required under commercial law, creating a loophole where Naked can distribute substandard products without explicit contractual repercussions.",

If the parties do not otherwise agree, either party may present any unresolved dispute for arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the \"Rules\") then in effect. Such arbitration will be held in New York, NY. The arbitration will be by a single arbitrator chosen by the parties, provided that if the parties fail to agree and to appoint a single arbitrator within twenty (20) business days from the date that one of the parties has made a demand for\narbitration, then the arbitrator will be chosen in accordance with the Rules.\nThe decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties and any\naward of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause specifying arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association removes crucial procedural protections and standards typically afforded in arbitration. This omission introduces ambiguity regarding the arbitration process, potentially denying Wade a fair and structured dispute resolution mechanism required under standard commercial practices and potentially state arbitration laws. In absence of clarity, there is no guarantee that the proceedings will meet the minimum standards of fairness.",

                "changed_text": "If any action is necessary to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, including any claims or demands, or to interpret this Agreement, each party will bear their own legal fees.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the clause entitling the prevailing party to attorneys' fees, this change directly contradicts the principle of 'fee shifting,' which can be mandated in certain types of commercial disputes under New York law, especially where there's a power imbalance. This omission disadvantages Wade, as it potentially removes a legal protection designed to ensure fair access to justice, especially if Wade is facing a larger, better-resourced company. The legal risk is that Wade might be deterred from pursuing legitimate claims due to the potential financial burden of legal fees, even if successful.",

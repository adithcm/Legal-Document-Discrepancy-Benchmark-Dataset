CONSULTANT agrees that during its consultancy for REIT and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of its consultancy with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, it will not, for itself or any other person or entity: (a) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company's employees, contractors, independent contractors or any person who provides services to the Company to terminate or reduce their employment or other relationship with the Company; (b) hire any individual who is (or was within the six (6) months immediately preceding such hiring, unless such employee was terminated from such employment by Company) an employee, exclusive contractor, or exclusive independent contractor of the Company; or (c) attempt to do any of the foregoing.",

CONSULTANT agrees that during its consultancy for REIT it will not, for itself or any other person or entity: (a) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company's employees to terminate or reduce their employment or other relationship with the Company; (b) hire any individual who is an employee of the Company; or (c) attempt to do any of the foregoing.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly reduces the scope of the non-solicitation agreement. By removing the clause 'for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of its consultancy' and eliminating 'contractors, independent contractors or any person who provides services to the Company' and 'or was within the six (6) months immediately preceding such hiring, unless such employee was terminated from such employment by Company,' the agreement now only prevents solicitation of current employees *during* the consultancy. This omission introduces a legal risk because many jurisdictions, including Virginia where Gunston Consulting, LLC is based, recognize and enforce reasonable post-employment non-solicitation agreements to protect a company's legitimate business interests. The original clause provided more protection, but the modified version offers considerably less, potentially violating the standard of reasonable protection required under Virginia law.",

The Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Consultant against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation and legal counsel fees) to the extent not funded by applicable insurance, in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have, arising out of, related to or based upon (i) any violation of law, rule or regulation by the Company or the Company's agents, employees, representatives or affiliates or (ii) any third party action or claim against the Company in which Consultant is alleged to be additionally liable. In this regard CONSULTANT shall be an additional insured under Company's applicable insurance coverages. Company shall provide CONSULTANT evidence of all such coverage.",

Company may provide CONSULTANT evidence of such coverage.",
                "explanation": "This edit significantly weakens the Consultant's protection. The original clause states the consultant is held harmless 'to the extent not funded by applicable insurance', but now the clause states the consultant is held harmless 'to the extent funded by applicable insurance'. This means that the company only indemnifies the consultant if the insurance covers it. This is a significant change because it means the consultant might be responsible for any and all costs and legal fees that arise from any legal matters, where the company doesn't have appropriate insurance.",

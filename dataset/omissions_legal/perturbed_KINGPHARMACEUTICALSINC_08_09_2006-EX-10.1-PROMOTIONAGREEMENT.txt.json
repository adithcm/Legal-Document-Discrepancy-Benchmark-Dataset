                "original_text": "King will not make any false or misleading representations to Professionals, customers or others regarding Depomed or the Product and will not make any representations, warranties or guarantees with respect to the specifications, features or capabilities of the Product that are not consistent with the applicable then-current FDA approved labeling, package insert or other documentation accompanying or describing the Product, including Depomed's standard limited warranty and disclaimers. King agrees to undertake timely and complete corrective action for any deviations from this Section 4.2, subject to discussion and review by Depomed's regulatory affairs and quality assurance department.",
                "changed_text": "King will not make any false or misleading representations to Professionals, customers or others regarding Depomed or the Product and will not make any representations, warranties or guarantees with respect to the specifications, features or capabilities of the Product that are inconsistent with information provided by Depomed. King agrees to undertake corrective action for deviations from this Section 4.2, subject to review by Depomed’s quality assurance department.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for King's representations to be consistent with FDA-approved labeling, weakening consumer protection related to accurate drug information. It omits 'package insert' and 'Depomed's standard limited warranty and disclaimers,' violating regulations for pharmaceutical advertising that mandate consistency with FDA-approved information. The removal of 'timely' and 'complete' for corrective action weakens consumer safeguards. The elimination of “regulatory affairs” weakens the quality control",

Depomed is not responsible for the compliance of Promotional Materials with FDA rules and regulations and the filing of Promotional Materials with the FDA.",
                "explanation": "The omission of 'reporting of any adverse drug reactions to the FDA' removes a legally mandated safety reporting requirement, directly contradicting FDA regulations. By stating 'Depomed is not responsible for the compliance of Promotional Materials with FDA rules and regulations and the filing of Promotional Materials with the FDA' Depomed are not complying with Legal Requirements of the FDA.",

                "explanation": "This change eliminates the strict, legally required timelines for reporting adverse drug experiences, replacing it with a vague 'as they deem necessary' standard. This introduces significant legal risk as it directly contradicts FDA requirements for timely reporting of adverse events and serious adverse events, jeopardizing patient safety and potentially violating federal law. With this omission, the companies are not complying with the FDA regulations.",

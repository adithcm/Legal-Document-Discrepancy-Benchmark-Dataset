                "changed_text": "Each party agrees to maintain insurance coverage for general liability.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the specific coverage type ('comprehensive') and the minimum coverage amount ($2,000,000.00 U.S. dollars) significantly weakens the insurance requirement.  This creates a legal contradiction with state laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts for commercial liabilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by state, but many states have minimum liability insurance requirements for businesses to protect against potential lawsuits and damages.",

Subject to the protocol described below, ALFA AESAR shall have the right to return at NTC's expense, and for full credit of ALFA AESAR's cost, any Products (i.) for which a legitimate and credible allegation is made that the use of such Products infringes on any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of privacy or publicity, or any other tangible or 3 intangible proprietary or intellectual property right; (b) that are not manufactured, packaged, or labeled in accordance with specifications or industry standards; (c) that are shipped in error or in non-conformance with ALFA AESAR's purchase order; or (d) that are damaged or defective. In the event that ALFA AESAR believes that it is entitled to return any Products delivered under this Agreement, the parties will adhere to the following protocol: (w) ALFA AESAR will contact NTC's Quality Director and then forward to the Quality Director, via a carrier selected by and at NTC's expense, a sample of the Product that ALFA AESAR believes is non-conforming; (x) upon receipt of the sample, NTC will test it and then notify ALFA AESAR of the test results; (y) where the test results confirm that the sample is non-conforming, NTC will provide ALFA AESAR with NTC's Return Authorization Number (\"RAN\"); and (z) any returned non-conforming Product must be in its original container, with original labels in act, and all paperwork concerning the returned Product must include NTC's RAN.",

                "explanation": "This modification entirely removes ALFA AESAR's right to return products under specific legally valid conditions, making returns subject to NTC's sole discretion. This omission contradicts fundamental commercial laws regarding warranties and defective goods. By reserving the right to deny *any* return request, NTC violates implied warranties of merchantability.",

Subject to the protocol in Section 5.1, ALFA AESAR may return to NTC any Product that is defective or that fails to comply with the purchase order provided by ALFA AESAR. NTC shall return to ALFA AESAR as promptly as possible, a working replacement or, in the event such replacement is not possible or at ALFA AESAR's election, it shall credit ALFA AESAR's account for the invoiced price and shipping charges of the defective Product. The 6 correction of such defective Product shall be at no cost to ALFA AESAR. The cost of shipping the replacement Product back to ALFA AESAR shall be paid by NTC. THE CORRECTION OF SUCH DEFECT BY REPAIR OR CREDITING ALFA AESAR'S ACCOUNT FOR THE COST OF THE PRODUCT IN THE MANNER SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF DISTRIBUTOR WITH RESPECT TO ANY WARRANTY GIVEN HEREIN RELATING TO ANY PRODUCT SOLD OR DELIVERED HEREUNDER.",

                "explanation": "This completely removes ALFA AESAR's right to return defective products, undermining the entire warranty system established earlier in the agreement and mandated by commercial law. It also removes the obligation for NTC to provide a replacement or credit, placing all remedies at NTC's sole discretion.  By stating remedies are 'at the sole discretion of NTC' it contradicts standard warranty practices and consumer protection laws.",

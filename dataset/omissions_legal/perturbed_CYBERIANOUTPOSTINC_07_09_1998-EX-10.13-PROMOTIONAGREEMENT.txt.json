                "explanation": "By removing the phrase relating to claims arising from 'the operation of the Company Site or the offer or sale of the Products by the Company or through the Company Site,' this change limits the Company's indemnification obligations. This could violate consumer protection laws that require companies to be responsible for damages resulting from their products or services, regardless of fault (strict liability). California law implies warranties and consumer rights related to product liability and merchantability, which this omission attempts to circumvent.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'SPECIAL' from the types of damages neither party is liable for, it attempts to circumvent California laws that may allow for special damages under certain consumer protection statutes, such as the Consumer Legal Remedies Act. This act protects consumers from unfair or deceptive practices, for which special damages may be recoverable. This creates a potential legal contradiction.",

In particular, the Company agrees that the Company Site will comply with the performance standards set forth in Exhibit B throughout the Term' weakens the assurance of service to consumers and goes against implied standards in e-commerce.

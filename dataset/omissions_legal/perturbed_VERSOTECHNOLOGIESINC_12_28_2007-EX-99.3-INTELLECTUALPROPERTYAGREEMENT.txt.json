                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Intellectual Property Agreement shall be construed and interpreted according to the laws of the State of Georgia, applicable contracts to be wholly performed within the State of Georgia.",
                "changed_text": "This Intellectual Property Agreement shall be construed and interpreted according to the laws of a jurisdiction chosen by the Seller.",
                "explanation": "This clause originally specified that Georgia law governs the contract. By removing the reference to Georgia law and replacing it with a vague reference to a seller-chosen jurisdiction, the contract becomes potentially non-compliant with Georgia's specific consumer protection laws regarding intellectual property transfer, creating a legal risk if the chosen jurisdiction has weaker protections. This also omits the consumer rights that the purchaser would have under Georgia law.",

                "changed_text": "Seller agrees to cooperate with Backhaul or Buyer in transferring the Assigned Intellectual Property.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear obligation for the Seller to execute necessary documents for the transfer of intellectual property. The modified text weakens this obligation by removing the specifics of 'deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and assurances' and the requirement to act 'forthwith upon reasonable written request'. This omission creates a loophole, potentially delaying or hindering the transfer process, and contradicts implied duties of good faith and fair dealing that are often legally required in contract performance, as well as specific performance remedies often available for IP transfers.",

                "explanation": "The original clause references the 'Asset Purchase Agreement' and states that the Buyer's rights are 'more particularly described in the Asset Purchase Agreement'. Omitting the reference to the date and the specific description clause removes a vital link for determining the scope and limitations of the agreement. Without that reference, it is more difficult to enforce the original agreement, and the buyer could potentially misrepresent its rights. Specifically, this could violate securities laws related to full and fair disclosure if the underlying Asset Purchase Agreement contains material information not readily apparent.",

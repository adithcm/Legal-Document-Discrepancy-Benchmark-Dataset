                "original_text": "Each Party, at its own expense, shall maintain comprehensive general liability, product liability and other appropriate insurance for the activities such Party undertakes pursuant to this Agreement, from reputable and financially secure insurance carriers in a form and at levels consistent with sound business practice and adequate in light of its obligations under this Agreement. Each Party shall provide a certificate of insurance (or evidence of self-insurance) evidencing such coverage to the other Party upon request. Such insurance will not create a limit to a Party's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Article 13 or otherwise. This Section 13.4 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for the period in which the Licensed Product is being Commercialized by or on behalf of Vyera plus six (6) years. Each Party shall provide the other Party with prompt written notice of any cancellation, non-renewal or material change in such insurance that could materially adversely affect the rights of the other Party hereunder, and shall provide such notice within thirty (30) days after any such cancellation, non-renewal or material change.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'comprehensive', 'product liability and other appropriate insurance', and 'from reputable and financially secure insurance carriers in a form and at levels consistent with sound business practice and adequate in light of its obligations under this Agreement' significantly weakens the insurance requirement. Also, by changing the 'shall' to 'may' weakens the compliance measure, creating a legal contradiction with state laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts and types of insurance for businesses, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, in New York state, where Vyera is located (600 Third Avenue, 10th Floor New York, NY 10016).",

Vyera shall be responsible for promptly (and in any event in sufficient time to permit CytoDyn to comply with its legal and regulatory reporting obligations) providing to CytoDyn any and all information relating to adverse events, including, without limitation, Serious Adverse Events, that comes into its possession.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'ninety (90) days' and changing 'will enter' to 'may enter' weakens the timeline, and therefore the compliance measure. The deletion of 'guidelines and procedures for the receipt, investigation, recording, review, post-marketing surveillance, communication, reporting and exchange between the Parties of adverse event reports, technical complaints and any other information concerning the safety of the Licensed Products' removes details necessary for compliance, creating a legal contradiction with federal regulations like 21 CFR Part 314, which mandates specific post-marketing safety reporting requirements.",

                "original_text": "This agreement will be governed by and must be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Israel. All disputes arising pursuant to this Agreement shall be exclusively brought in the courts of competent jurisdiction residing in Tel Aviv, Israel.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'must be construed in accordance with' the obligatory nature of following Israeli law is weakened. Also, removing 'exclusively' and replacing 'the courts of competent jurisdiction residing in Tel Aviv, Israel' with 'a forum selected at YEC's discretion' could potentially force ARGO to litigate in a jurisdiction unfavorable to them, violating standard legal protections regarding fair venue and access to justice as might be implied or specifically protected under Israeli contract law.",

Accordingly, a party will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach, and the parties each further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.",

                "explanation": "By weakening the clause which ensures that the parties are granted specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief for breaches relating to the non-solicitation of personnel, the contract potentially violates implied labor laws in Israel which aim to protect employees against undue influence from their former employers.",

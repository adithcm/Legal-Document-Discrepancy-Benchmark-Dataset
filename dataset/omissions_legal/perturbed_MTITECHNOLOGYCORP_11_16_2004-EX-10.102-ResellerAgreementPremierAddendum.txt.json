                "explanation": "Removing the clause 'EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES' allows for a limitation of liability even when a party has prior knowledge of potential damages, which may violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, and potentially contradict laws regarding knowing and willful misconduct. It creates a loophole for liability avoidance that could be deemed unconscionable.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'MERCHANTABILITY' from the disclaimer of warranties removes a key consumer protection.

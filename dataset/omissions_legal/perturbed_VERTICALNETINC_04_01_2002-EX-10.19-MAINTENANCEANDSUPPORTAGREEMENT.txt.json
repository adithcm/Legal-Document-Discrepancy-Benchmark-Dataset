                "explanation": "Omitting 'ACCURACY' and 'QUIET ENJOYMENT' weakens the warranty disclaimer. Under Pennsylvania law (specified in section 10.6), while disclaimers are generally allowed, omitting standard protections could be challenged, especially concerning the 'accuracy' of services and 'quiet enjoyment' of licensed software, creating a legal risk.",

Pennsylvania statutes of limitations can vary, and certain consumer rights might not be waivable, introducing a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Deleting the jury trial waiver eliminates an explicit condition. The Pennsylvania Constitution and associated case law guarantee the right to a jury trial in most civil cases. While parties can waive this right, its absence could raise questions about knowing and voluntary consent. This creates potential grounds for challenging the contract's enforceability regarding dispute resolution in Pennsylvania. This challenges Pennsylvania civil rights laws.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'standardised pricing' from 4.3.2 and modifying 4.3.4, the agreement now lacks a commitment to fair and transparent pricing, potentially violating consumer protection laws, specifically those concerning fair trade practices. Many countries, including those in the UK (where English law governs the agreement), have regulations requiring clear and justifiable pricing to prevent unfair or deceptive trade practices. This change removes a safeguard for customers, increasing legal risk.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'negligence', the indemnity clause now fails to protect the other party from suits, claims, demands, and liability of any nature resulting from negligence, potentially violating laws concerning tortious liability for negligence. Many countries, including those following English law, require parties to take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions that they can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure their neighbour.

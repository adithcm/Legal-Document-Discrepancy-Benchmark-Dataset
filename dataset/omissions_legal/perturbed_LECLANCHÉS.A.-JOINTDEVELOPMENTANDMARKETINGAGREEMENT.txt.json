                "changed_text": "Oak Ridge shall attempt to arrange product liability and warranty insurance.",
                "explanation": "By weakening the obligation to 'attempt' to arrange product liability and warranty insurance, the contract may be non-compliant with consumer protection laws that require manufacturers or distributors to provide adequate warranty coverage and avenues for recourse in case of product defects. This creates legal risk, as consumers might lack the necessary protection against faulty products, potentially leading to liability issues for both companies.",

                "changed_text": "Leclanché may define the warranty conditions for the Products and Services.",
                "explanation": "Removing the obligation for Leclanché to 'work with Oak Ridge to provide the information necessary to secure product liability and warranty insurance cover' makes the agreement weaker in terms of consumer protection. By omitting the responsibility to facilitate the insurance coverage, the contract becomes non-compliant with implied warranty laws, as it fails to ensure consumers have access to redress in case of product defects.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement to use 'reasonable efforts to resolve any such conflicts in a manner that benefits the end customer' weakens consumer protection. This omission introduces legal risk, as it potentially violates consumer protection laws requiring fair practices and transparent information. Conflicting requirements from the parties could lead to customer harm.",

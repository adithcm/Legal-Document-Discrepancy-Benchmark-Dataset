                "original_text": "Subject to Antares' obligation to cover the costs set forth in Section 5.3(b), AMAG shall be responsible for all costs incurred due to the Recall of a Product, sample Product or Trainer.",
                "changed_text": "AMAG shall be responsible for all costs incurred due to the Recall of a Product, sample Product or Trainer.",
                "explanation": "This change omits Antares' financial obligation to cover certain recall costs, potentially contradicting consumer protection laws that hold manufacturers accountable for defective products. By removing Antares' responsibility, AMAG could be solely burdened with recall costs even if the defect originated from Antares' manufacturing process, conflicting with general product liability principles.",

                "changed_text": "AMAG shall be responsible for managing all Recalls.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for Antares to cooperate in recalls could violate regulations requiring manufacturers to actively participate in product recalls. Many jurisdictions mandate that manufacturers assist in notifying consumers and retrieving defective products. This omission creates a legal risk by potentially hindering the effectiveness of a recall and shifting undue burden onto AMAG.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 'Warranty of Merchantability' shifts risk onto the buyer regarding the product's baseline quality, functionality, or legal compliance. By waiving merchantability, the seller circumvents legally implied obligations in commercial transactions.",

                "original_text": "i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays, with the exception of reasonable hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer and/or the Hosted Site. i-on will use best efforts to schedule and perform such maintenance between the hours of 8pm and 8am Eastern Standard Time on weekdays, or during weekends.",
                "changed_text": "i-on will make reasonable efforts to maintain the operation of the Hosted Site, but does not guarantee uninterrupted service. Maintenance will be performed as needed.",
                "explanation": "This removes the guarantee of continuous service (24/7) and the specific scheduling of maintenance. Florida Statute 501.011 requires businesses to honor their contractual obligations and provide services as advertised. By removing the guaranteed uptime and specific maintenance schedule, i-on creates a loophole that may violate consumer protection laws if the service is frequently interrupted without proper notification or justification. The 'reasonable efforts' clause is too vague and unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "i-on's liability for damages to the Customer for any cause whatsoever shall be limited to one (1) month's fees.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the explicit exclusion of liability for lost profits or consequential damages, and also removes the clarification that the liability limitation applies regardless of the form of action (contract, tort, negligence). Florida law does not generally allow businesses to completely disclaim liability for gross negligence or intentional misconduct. By not clarifying this exclusion, the contract can be misinterpreted to apply in all instances, including gross negligence, which is not permissible. This is a violation of consumer protection.",

                "explanation": "The deletion of the phrase 'provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss' removes i-on's obligation to take reasonable steps to prevent data loss. This clause weakens the protection for customer data. This can be seen as an unfair business practice and a violation of Florida's deceptive and unfair trade practices act, as it absolves i-on of responsibility even in cases of negligence where they fail to implement basic data protection measures.",

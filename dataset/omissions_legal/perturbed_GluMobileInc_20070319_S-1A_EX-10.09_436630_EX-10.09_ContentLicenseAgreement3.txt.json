                "original_text": "In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox, or such other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n\n(a) From the first unit sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee's Gross Receipts (as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee's sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products. (\"IA2 Audio and Video Royalty\"). For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may not recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox a royalty as determined by Fox at its sole discretion. Licensee may not recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the fixed royalty rate and replaces it with a discretionary amount determined by Fox, violating consumer protection laws related to fair and transparent pricing. Removing the 'or such other party as Fox may designate in writing' also creates ambiguity. This introduces a legal risk, because royalty rates must be clearly stated.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various State and Federal consumer protection laws regarding fair pricing and transparent contracts, specifically those mandating clear disclosure of payment terms. Deceptive Trade Practices laws may also apply.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'or a third-party Fox designates,' the contract becomes ambiguous about revenue sharing from third-party distribution channels. This omission can potentially violate consumer protection laws if third-party revenue structures impact the overall cost or value to the consumer but are not transparently disclosed.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'obtaining and maintaining pricing and reimbursement approvals' from the Licensee's obligations creates a legal risk. In the United States, pharmaceutical companies must comply with various regulations regarding pricing and reimbursement, including the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act. Omitting the explicit obligation to obtain and maintain these approvals could lead to non-compliance and potential legal liabilities.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'fitness for a particular purpose', the contract attempts to disclaim an implied warranty that is legally difficult to waive for consumer goods.

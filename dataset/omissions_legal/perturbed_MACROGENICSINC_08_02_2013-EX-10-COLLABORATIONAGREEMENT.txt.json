                "original_text": "Green Cross shall have full responsibility and authority for all aspects of the Commercialization of Products in the Territory at its sole expense, including, without limitation, developing and executing a plan for commercial launch, obtaining all required approvals from Regulatory Authorities for Commercialization (including, without limitation, reimbursement activities), marketing and promotion, booking sales and distribution and performance of related services, providing customer support, including handling medical queries, and performing other related functions. Green Cross shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to Commercialize the Products.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'providing customer support, including handling medical queries' from Green Cross's responsibilities omits a crucial aspect of consumer protection mandated by South Korean consumer protection laws. These laws require companies to provide adequate customer support, particularly for medical products, to address consumer queries and concerns. By removing this, the contract fails to guarantee this legally required support, introducing legal risk.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'and all Applicable Laws and Regulations', the contract now implies that compliance with the terms of the agreement is sufficient, regardless of whether those terms meet the minimum standards set by South Korean law. This omission directly contradicts South Korean regulations which mandate that consumer contracts must comply with all relevant laws, including those relating to product safety, advertising standards, and fair trade practices. This introduces legal risk as the contract no longer explicitly requires adherence to mandatory legal standards.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase \"provided that MacroGenics has supplied Product ordered by Green Cross in accordance with Section 6.2(c) for such launch within a reasonable period prior to the planned launch date\" removes the clear responsibility of MacroGenics to supply products necessary for the launch. South Korean Fair Trade laws consider unfair trading practices the obstruction of necessary resources. By removing that clause, it could lead to the unfair obstruction of resources, which places legal liability due to the absence of the caveat.",

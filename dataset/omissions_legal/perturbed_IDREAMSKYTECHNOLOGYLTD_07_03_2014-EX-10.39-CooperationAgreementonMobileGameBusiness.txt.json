                "original_text": "4.11 Party B shall make sure that prior to its provision (including marketing and business advertising) of any service to users (including paid service and free service), it will thoroughly notify the users in a proper form, and ensure that the users are fully aware of, the content, means of provision, standard fee rate (information fee and communication fee), frequency of transmission, method of use, manner of cancellation, customer service call number and such other information users need to know for ordering service and make payment for such service. Party B may provide such service to users only upon obtaining the consent of users in a provable manner, and is prohibited to provide services to users without users' proper knowledge. Party B shall not purposefully intercept information, or discretionally send advertising information to users. In case of such breach by Party B, it shall assmue all liabilities.",

Party B shall not purposefully intercept information, or discretionally send advertising information to users. In case of such breach by Party B, it shall assmue all liabilities.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirements for 'thoroughly' notifying users 'in a proper form,' ensuring users are 'fully aware,' obtaining 'consent of users in a provable manner,' and prohibition of providing services to users without their 'proper knowledge,' the contract now omits critical consumer protection measures. This change introduces a legal risk by potentially violating consumer protection laws in Jiangsu, China, which mandate clear and informed consent before charging users for services.",

                "changed_text": "5.3 Both Parties shall provide customers with a means of business ordering inquiry. Party A shall have the right to use technical and managerial methods to control and manage Party B's ordering relationship.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'multiple convenient means' and omitting 'business cancellation' directly contradicts consumer protection laws that emphasize ease of service termination. This creates a legal vulnerability in Jiangsu where consumers are entitled to simple cancellation processes for subscription services.",

                "changed_text": "5.5 The Parties agree that the complaints shall be resolved, and Party B shall provide party A with the list of relevant persons and their respective details of contact.",
                "explanation": "By removing the time constraint (72 hours resolution) and obligation to ‘guarantee smooth communications 24 hours a day’ the amendment weakens the commitment to resolving consumer complaints promptly. This contrasts with consumer rights laws that expect timely responses to complaints, which creates a legal risk in Jiangsu.",

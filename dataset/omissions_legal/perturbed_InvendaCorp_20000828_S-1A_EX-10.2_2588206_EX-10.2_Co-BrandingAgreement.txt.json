                "changed_text": "Information collected under this Agreement may be transmitted           between the parties.",
                "explanation": "This omission weakens the security of user data. California's Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and other state laws mandate specific security measures when transferring user data. Removing the requirement for a mutually agreed-upon secure transfer method introduces a legal contradiction, creating vulnerability for potential data breaches and non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens the commitment to data security. California law requires strict adherence to privacy guidelines. Replacing 'comply with' with 'generally align with' creates a loophole, allowing for deviations from established security protocols, which violates CCPA and other relevant privacy laws.",

                "explanation": "This omission introduces ambiguity regarding the return of confidential data upon termination. California's trade secret laws require immediate and complete return/destruction of confidential information. Adding 'as reasonably practical' weakens this obligation, creating a potential legal risk and non-compliance with trade secret protection laws.",

                "original_text": "Each Party will indemnify the Company and hold it harmless for, from and against any claims, demands, costs or expenses arising out of or relating to such consolidated financial statements, provided that such indemnity shall not apply to claims, demands, costs or expenses to the extent they are related to the Company's financial statements provided to such Party.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will indemnify the Company and hold it harmless for, from and against any claims, demands, costs or expenses arising out of or relating to such consolidated financial statements.",
                "explanation": "This removes the limitation of indemnity related to the Company's provided financial statements. This introduces legal risk because without the limiting condition, a party could be forced to indemnify the company even for financial discrepancies originating from the company's own statements, creating a potential violation of standard indemnity practices.",

                "changed_text": "After the Put Closing Date or Call Closing Date, as applicable, the Parties shall use reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain approvals and registrations to effect this Agreement and related documents.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'best efforts' to 'reasonable efforts' and removing the clause about not needing to change any provision of the agreement or divest a material business, the modification weakens the obligation to ensure compliance post-closing.  This introduces legal risk because 'best efforts' is a higher standard, and the deletion allows a party to avoid compliance by claiming it's not 'reasonable,' even if it's necessary under the law.",

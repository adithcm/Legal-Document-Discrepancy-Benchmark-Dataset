                "explanation": "Removing the clause where each party authorizes the other to file amendments on their behalf creates a potential legal issue. SEC regulations (specifically, Rule 13d-1(k)) require explicit authorization for joint filings. Without this authorization, the joint filing agreement might be challenged, rendering it non-compliant.",

                "explanation": "Removing the initial statement that explicitly mentions accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, causes the agreement to have a reduced level of transparency concerning the regulatory foundation for the joint filing. This potentially conflicts with the transparency spirit upheld by securities laws.",

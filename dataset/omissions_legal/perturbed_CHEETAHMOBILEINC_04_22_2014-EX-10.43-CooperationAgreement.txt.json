                "explanation": "Removing clauses 7.2.2 and 7.2.3 weakens confidentiality obligations. Chinese law provides specific exceptions to confidentiality, such as mandatory disclosures to government agencies. Removing these exceptions creates a legal contradiction, as the contract could be interpreted as forbidding legally required disclosures. The confidentiality is so strict that if the laws of PRC mandates an entity to reveal such information, it cannot. This is not permissable.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for the affected party to notify the other party about the Force Majeure event (nature, date, duration, etc.) and regularly update them on its status creates a **legal contradiction**. Under PRC Contract Law, parties have a duty to mitigate losses and inform the other party of events that may affect contract performance. Removing these notification requirements limits the ability of the unaffected party to take mitigating actions, potentially leading to greater losses. The initial text gives a more comprehensive description of the process of informing the parties regarding the Force Majeure, whereas in the modified text, the process of informing is removed and thus can create more losses for a party.",

                "changed_text": "Any dispute arising from the construction and enforcement of this Agreement shall be submitted to the court in the location of Party B.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause about 'friendly consultation or mediation by a neutral third party first' before resorting to court proceedings creates a **legal contradiction** with common commercial practice and principles of good faith negotiation recognized under PRC law. Chinese courts often encourage or require mediation before formal litigation. Eliminating the pre-litigation negotiation step can be seen as a failure to act in good faith and could potentially impact the enforceability of the agreement. The text removes the consultation or meditation stage.",

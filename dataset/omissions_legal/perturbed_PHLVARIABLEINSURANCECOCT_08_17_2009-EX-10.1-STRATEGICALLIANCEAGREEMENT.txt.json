                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each Party shall perform, and shall cause each of its respective Affiliates, as applicable, to perform, their respective duties and obligations under the Transaction Documents in compliance in all material respects with applicable Law.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall perform their respective duties and obligations under the Transaction Documents; compliance with applicable Law is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'in all material respects with applicable Law' and replacing it with 'compliance with applicable Law is not guaranteed' creates a legal loophole that allows the parties to potentially disregard certain legal requirements, contradicting various state and federal laws related to insurance and investment products.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal laws relating to insurance and investment products.",
                "location": "Section 11.01.1"

                "original_text": "Each Party shall establish and maintain written policies, procedures and internal controls that establish adequate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of customer records and information as required by Rule 30 under Regulation S-P or applicable Law. Each Party represents and warrants that its respective policies, procedures and internal controls are reasonably designed to (1) ensure the security and confidentiality of Nonpublic Personal Information, (2) protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security and integrity of Nonpublic Personal Information, and (3) protect against unauthorized access to or use of Nonpublic Personal Information.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will attempt to establish policies and procedures for the protection of customer information. There is no guarantee that these policies will provide adequate protections for customer data.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the requirement for data protection policies. The original clause mandates 'adequate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards' as per Regulation S-P. The modified clause only suggests 'attempting to establish policies', and states that there is no guarantee for adequate protections, effectively negating the data security required by law. This introduces a legal contradiction with Regulation S-P, which requires specific safeguards for Nonpublic Personal Information.",

                "original_text": "The Parties shall cooperate with each other in resolving each Customer Complaint. Any proposed response by a Party to a Customer Complaint shall be sent to the other Parties not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the response being sent to any person, including the Certificate Owner or any Governmental Entity, provided, however, that if a more prompt response is required, the Parties shall send to the other Parties the proposed response as soon as practicable under the circumstances but in no event shall any Party submit such response to another person without providing the other Party with prior written notice of and a copy of the response.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties may attempt to cooperate with each other in resolving Customer Complaints. There is no requirement for advance notice of responses to complaints.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates cooperation in resolving customer complaints and requires at least a 5-day advance notice of any proposed response. The modified clause makes cooperation optional ('may attempt to') and removes the requirement for advance notice. This weakens the consumer protection measures and could violate regulations that require timely and transparent handling of customer complaints, creating a potential legal issue.",

                "original_text": "HEMISPHERX warrants that the Product (i) shall conform to the specifications set out in the SCIEN purchase order for Product and (ii) shall meet all, if any, reasonably applicable regulatory requirements in the Territory once Product is approved. In the Direct Access/ EAP setting, the Product that HEMISPHERX supplies must confirm with all manufacturing and regulatory requirements (including labelling) for the country in which said Product is intended to be sold. SCIEN's acceptance of the Product shall relieve HEMISPHERX from the obligations arising from this warranty",

SCIEN's acceptance of the Product shall relieve HEMISPHERX from the obligations arising from this warranty",
                "explanation": "By weakening the warranty that the product must meet 'all' reasonably applicable regulatory requirements to 'some' requirements, the contract introduces a significant legal risk. This creates a loophole where Hemispherx could potentially supply products that don't fully comply with local regulations, shifting the burden of compliance onto SCIEN. This contradicts consumer protection laws and regulations in many countries, including the GCC states within the Territory, that mandate products meet all relevant safety and efficacy standards before distribution.

The implementation of any change that may directly impact the integrity of the activities conducted or data being supplied for HEMISPHERX will require prior written approval of HEMISPHERX. SCIEN and HEMISPHERX will advise the appropriate organization's staff member (See Attachment 1) before implementation of a change, by either party, to equipment, procedures, specifications, processes, clinical protocols, product claims or facilities directly related to HEMISPHERX's specific products and processes. Each party agrees to review the proposed change in a timely manner and, at its discretion, may audit and/or request an alternative or additional change prior to the implementation of the proposed change. The respective party will review the proposed change, determine if it is reasonably practicable to implement the change and can suggest alternative or additional changes prior to the implementation of the proposed change. Change control requirements should be articulated within the specific operation's documentation practices.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirements for compliance with FDA regulations weakens the quality control aspects of the agreement and the obligation to have HEMISPHERX's written approval of changes that impact data integrity. This is a legal contradiction because, depending on the ultimate destination of the product, FDA regulations (or their international equivalents) may apply, mandating rigorous change control. Removing the firm requirements introduces the risk of non-compliance and potential liability.",

HEMISPHERX interprets FDA 21 CFR 314.81, \"Other Post- Marketing Reports,\" to require a Field Alert Report to be made within three (3) days of an occurrence of an OOS result, whether that result is confirmed or not. The only exception to this would be where the original result was invalidated within the three (3) days. In that case, no field alert would be required 8) making the proper reports to the FDA regarding a field alert or recall",

                "explanation": "By changing 'all manufacturing and quality control testing requirements' to 'some,' 'all necessary quality documentation' to 'some,' and weakening the obligation to ensure correct labeling, the contract reduces Hemispherx's responsibility for product quality and safety. This contradicts the regulatory obligations in both the US and the GCC states regarding pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution, which require manufacturers to ensure product safety and efficacy. It also creates a potential legal risk by reducing compliance with US FDA regulations and analogous regulations in the Territory, which mandate comprehensive quality control and documentation.",

In the event of Downtime (as defined in this Section 6.1 below), as Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and eGain's sole and exclusive liability, the monthly fee payable for the Hosting Services shall be reduced as follows:\n\na) For the first sixty (60) minutes of Downtime during Normal Business       Hours or the first four (4) hours of Downtime outside of Normal Business       Hours (\"Initial Downtime\"), eGain will credit Customer's account for one       (1) day of service.\n\nb) For each eight (8) hour period of Downtime per day in addition to the       Initial Downtime, eGain will credit Customer's account for one (1)       additional day of service.\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, \"Downtime\" shall mean any interruption in the availability of Hosting Services to Customer (excluding scheduled interruptions of which Customer is notified 48 hours in advanced), only if such interruption is due either to: 1) an error in the Software, or 2) failure of the eGain System (but not including problems associated with Internet connectivity). Downtime begins upon Customer notification to eGain of the interruption, either",

In the event of Downtime (as defined in this Section 6.1 below), the monthly fee payable for the Hosting Services may be reduced. The determination of any reduction will be at eGain's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a specific remedy (service credit) for downtime, essentially a service level agreement (SLA). Removing the guarantee of substantial performance and the detailed Downtime credit system, and replacing it with a vague 'may be reduced' gives eGain complete control, potentially violating implied warranties or reasonable expectations under California law regarding service reliability and remedies.",

                "changed_text": "Payment received by eGain after the due date shall be subject to a late fee.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or, if less, the maximum amount allowed by applicable law,' the contract now has no cap on late fees. California law limits late fees to a reasonable amount, and failing to specify this cap opens eGain up to charging potentially usurious or unconscionable late fees. This conflicts with California's consumer protection laws against excessive charges.",

                "explanation": "Removing the Customer's right to terminate the agreement for eGain's breach creates an imbalance in the contract. Under California law, both parties generally have the right to terminate a contract for material breach by the other party.

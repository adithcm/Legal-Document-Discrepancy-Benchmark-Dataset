                "changed_text": "Server uptime is provided.",
                "explanation": "By removing the '99 percent server uptime guarantee,' the contract becomes vague and unenforceable regarding uptime commitments. In British Columbia, the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act requires that services be provided with reasonable care and skill and that representations about the quality of service be accurate. Removing the specific uptime guarantee could be seen as a misleading representation if the uptime falls significantly below 99%, potentially violating consumer protection laws.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'is included' to 'may be provided' makes the service optional. This could be construed as a breach of contract if AstroNutrition.com relies on this service for their website's functionality and it's not consistently provided, potentially violating consumer protection laws related to fulfilling contracted services as promised.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific '24 x 7 emergency phone support and 1-business-day email response' weakens the commitment to providing technical support. The original text defined specific service levels, while the new text is vague and provides no specific assurance about the level or timing of support, potentially violating consumer protection laws.",

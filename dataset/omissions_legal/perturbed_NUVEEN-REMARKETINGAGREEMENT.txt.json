                "original_text": "use its best efforts to remarket Tendered VRRM-MFP Shares in connection with an optional tender or mandatory tender of VRRM-MFP Shares as provided in the Supplement, but shall in no way be liable if no purchasers are found, provided it has otherwise performed its obligations as set forth in this Agreement and the Supplement",

                "explanation": "By removing 'best' from 'best efforts' and 'provided it has otherwise performed its obligations as set forth in this Agreement and the Supplement' weakens the standard of care required of the Remarketing Agent, reducing their accountability if they fail to remarket shares. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in New York contract law.",

                "explanation": "Removing the qualifiers 'as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder' and omitting the final clause significantly broadens the potential for conflicts of interest. Under New York law, financial professionals have a duty to avoid conflicts of interest. This omission could allow the Remarketing Agent to prioritize its own interests over those of the Fund and its shareholders without the same degree of scrutiny, violating those conflict of interest principles.",

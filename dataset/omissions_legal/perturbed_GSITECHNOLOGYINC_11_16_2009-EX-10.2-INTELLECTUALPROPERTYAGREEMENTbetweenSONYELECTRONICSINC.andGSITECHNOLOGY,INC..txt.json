                "original_text": "9.9 Applicable Law This IP Agreement and the legal relations among the Parties will be governed by and construed in accordance with the rules and substantive Laws of the State of California, United States of America, without regard to conflicts of law provisions.",
                "changed_text": "9.9 Applicable Law This IP Agreement and the legal relations among the Parties will be governed by and construed in accordance with the rules and substantive laws as determined solely by SONY, without regard to conflicts of law provisions.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction by removing the specification that California law governs the agreement and giving SONY the unilateral right to determine the applicable laws. This violates standard contract law principles that require mutual agreement on governing law and can deprive PURCHASER of legal protections afforded under California law. California law requires contracts to be interpreted under established legal principles, ensuring fairness and predictability.",

The decision to award such fees is at the sole discretion of SONY.",
                "explanation": "This edit introduces a legal contradiction. By granting SONY sole discretion over awarding attorney's fees to the prevailing party, it undermines the principle of equitable remedies. California law often allows for the recovery of attorney's fees by the prevailing party in contract disputes to ensure fair access to justice. This modification weakens the enforceability of the contract for PURCHASER by creating financial disincentives to pursue legitimate claims.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may transfer or assign its rights under this IP Agreement in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, on condition that it provides the 14 other Party with notice of the transfer or assignment. Any attempted transfer in contravention of this Section 9.3 shall be null and void.",

SONY may assign or transfer its rights under this IP Agreement without notice or consent from PURCHASER. Any attempted transfer in contravention of this Section 9.3 shall be null and void.",
                "explanation": "The changed text creates a one-sided assignment clause. California law generally requires mutual consent for assignment unless explicitly stated otherwise. By allowing SONY to freely assign its rights while restricting PURCHASER, the contract becomes unconscionable and potentially unenforceable. This limits PURCHASER's ability to sell its business or merge with another entity, giving SONY undue control.",

                "original_text": "User transactions debited from bank accounts via ACH are subject to returns (e.g., non-sufficient funds) and reversals from chargebacks (e.g., unauthorized activity) per the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq. as may be amended), Regulation E, and NACHA guidelines (collectively, such returns and reversals are \"Reversals\"). The Company will work to protect Customer and the receiving Users from unwarranted Reversals; however, Customer acknowledges and agrees that: i) Customer is liable for all User Activity and Reversals associated with User Activity; ii) If Company's agent receives a Reversal, the Company may in its sole discretion charge Customer the full amount of the Reversal (\"Reversed Payment\") plus an additional $7 reversal fee (\"Reversal Fee\" and collectively the \"Reversal Liability\"); iii) The Company has sole discretion to determine who is at fault and liable for the Reversed Payment and Reversal Fee; iv) Customer authorizes the Company to take any of the following actions (in any particular order): (i) collect the unpaid portion of the Reversal Liability from funds sent to your third party escrow account; (ii) debit your bank account in the amount of the unpaid portion of the Reversal Liability; (iv) engage in collection efforts to recover the unpaid portion of the Reversal Liability and/or (v) take legal action or any other action under this Service Agreement.",

Customer acknowledges and agrees that: i) Customer is liable for all User Activity; ii) If Company's agent receives a Reversal, the Company may charge Customer a fee. iii) The Company has discretion to determine liability for any fees; iv) Customer authorizes the Company to collect any amounts owed.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the explicit reference to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, Regulation E, and NACHA guidelines, which outline consumer rights regarding ACH transactions, including chargebacks and dispute resolution. By removing this reference and weakening the language around reversals, the contract obscures the consumer's legal rights to dispute unauthorized transactions and seek recourse, potentially violating consumer protection laws related to electronic fund transfers.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit mention of '1.5% per month' and 'the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower', the contract becomes vague and potentially allows the company to charge interest rates exceeding legal limits. This omission violates usury laws and consumer protection laws that require clear disclosure of interest rates and late payment penalties.",

                "changed_text": "This Service Agreement is for the duration of the Company's Offering (the \"Initial Term\").",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'unless either party requests termination at least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current term' eliminates the customer's right to terminate the agreement with prior notice. Depending on the jurisdiction, this could violate laws that ensure fair contract terms and prevent indefinite or automatically renewing contracts without providing the customer with an exit option.",

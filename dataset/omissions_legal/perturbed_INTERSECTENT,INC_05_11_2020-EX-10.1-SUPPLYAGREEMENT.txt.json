                "explanation": "The original contract specifies DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) Menlo Park, CA USA, meaning HOVIONE is responsible for all costs and risks associated with delivering the API to Menlo Park, CA, including import duties and taxes. By changing this to EXW (Ex Works) HOVIONE's Manufacturing Facility, the responsibility for all shipping costs, risks, and import duties/taxes is shifted to INTERSECT. This creates a legal contradiction because under California Commercial Code, the seller has a duty to properly deliver the goods as specified in the contract. Shifting the responsibility entirely to the buyer may violate these provisions, especially if INTERSECT is not properly informed or equipped to handle the import process, potentially exposing them to unforeseen liabilities and violating consumer protection laws regarding fair business practices.",

                "changed_text": "HOVIONE shall invoice INTERSECT upon dispatch of the API. INTERSECT shall pay the price to HOVIONE for API within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of invoice of such API. Payments shall be made to HOVIONE by wire transfer.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment terms from 30 to 60 days. Although seemingly minor, this can be problematic under California law if it is implemented without explicit agreement from HOVIONE because the default payment expectation will be breached. Adding such a large shift could be construed as an unfair business practice if it puts undue financial strain on HOVIONE without prior informed consent. This could lead to a legal dispute over breach of contract and potential violations of California's consumer protection laws regarding fair and transparent business dealings.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates comprehensive general liability insurance with product liability coverage and minimum limits. By removing the product liability coverage requirement and eliminating the minimum coverage limits, this modification creates significant legal risk. California law, including the California Civil Code and related case law, holds manufacturers and distributors strictly liable for defective products that cause injury. Removing product liability coverage makes it significantly more difficult for injured parties to recover damages and exposes both companies to potentially massive uninsured liabilities. This contradicts the implied duty to protect consumers from harm caused by defective products, which is a fundamental principle in California law.",

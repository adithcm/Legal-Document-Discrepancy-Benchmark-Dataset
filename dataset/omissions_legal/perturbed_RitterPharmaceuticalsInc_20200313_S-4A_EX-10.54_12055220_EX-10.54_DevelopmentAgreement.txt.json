                "original_text": "Qualigen shall provide to Sekisui and for the benefit of Sekisui's customers of Products a standard commercial written warranty that the Products will be free of defects in materials or workmanship starting from the date the Product has been received by Sekisui's customer and ending after the length of time stated for the applicable Product on Exhibit D hereto (the \"User Warranty\"). The User Warranty is contingent upon proper use of a Product in the application for which such Product was intended and does not cover Products that were altered or modified (or added to or subtracted from), that were used after the expiration date thereon or that were subjected by the carrier, distributor or the customer to abuse, mishandling or unusual physical, thermal, chemical or electrical stress.",
                "changed_text": "Qualigen may provide a warranty at its discretion. The warranty, if provided, is contingent upon proper use of a Product in the application for which such Product was intended and does not cover Products that were altered or modified (or added to or subtracted from), that were used after the expiration date thereon or that were subjected by the carrier, distributor or the customer to abuse, mishandling or unusual physical, thermal, chemical or electrical stress.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for a 'standard commercial written warranty,' the contract violates consumer protection laws such as the implied warranty of merchantability under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which is applicable in most US states and impacts transactions between merchants and consumers. This alteration introduces legal risk by omitting a legally mandated consumer protection, thus making the contract non-compliant.",

Best rating of A- or better or (b) is a qualified self- insurance program that is approved by Sekisui. Qualigen shall provide Sekisui, upon request, with written evidence of the Insurance, including where it is provided through qualified self-insurance. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to limit Qualigen's responsibility to the amounts stated above or to any limits of Qualigen's insurance policies.",

Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to limit Qualigen's responsibility to the amounts stated above or to any limits of Qualigen's insurance policies.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the requirement for a specific A.M. Best rating (A- or better) or Sekisui's approval of a self-insurance program, the contract creates ambiguity about the insurer's financial stability. Furthermore, removing the mandate to provide written evidence of insurance on request, the contract eliminates a crucial verification method. This change violates general risk management and potentially state-specific requirements for minimum insurance standards in commercial agreements, creating a legal loophole.",

                "original_text": "Each Party recognizes that the covenants and agreements herein and their continued performance as set forth in this Agreement are necessary and critical to protect the legitimate interests of the other Party, that the other Party would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of such covenants and agreements and the assurance of continued performance as set forth in this Agreement, and that a Party's breach or threatened breach of such covenants and agreements will cause the opposed Party irreparable harm and significant injury, the amount of which will be extremely difficult to estimate and ascertain, thus making any remedy at law or in damages inadequate. Therefore, each Party agrees that an opposed Party shall be entitled to specific performance, an order restraining any breach or threatened breach of Section 13 and all other provisions of this Agreement, and any other equitable relief (including but not limited to temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief), without the necessity of posting of any bond or security.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party recognizes that the covenants and agreements herein and their continued performance as set forth in this Agreement are necessary to protect the interests of the other Party. Therefore, each Party agrees that the opposed Party shall be entitled to remedies. This right shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any other remedy available to such other Party at law or in equity.",
                "explanation": "By removing language that acknowledges irreparable harm and the inadequacy of monetary damages, and by eliminating the entitlement to specific performance and injunctive relief, the modified clause severely limits the remedies available to the parties in case of a breach. This alteration contradicts general contract law principles that allow for equitable remedies when legal remedies are insufficient, introducing legal risk by undermining the enforceability of the agreement and weakening protection against non-monetary breaches.",

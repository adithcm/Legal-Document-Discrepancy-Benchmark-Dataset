                "explanation": "Removing options (b) and (c) limits the methods for providing notice. Delaware law, which governs the contract according to section 8.1, generally permits notice via mail and courier in many contractual contexts. This omission could be problematic if a specific statute requires certified mail for certain types of legal notices, making this clause non-compliant and creating legal risk.",

If a Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days of the date of the disputing Party's notice, any Party desiring a non-negotiated resolution shall refer the Dispute to binding arbitration pursuant to the then-current commercial arbitration rules and supplementary procedures of commercial arbitration of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA Rules\"). The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules in any matter in which an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is not requested and the value of the relief any Party seeks (whether by claim or counterclaim) does not exceed three million United States dollars (US $3,000,000). In all other matters, including any matter in which an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is requested, the arbitral tribunal shall be composed of a panel of three (3) arbitrators appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitration shall take place in New York, New York. Each Party will bear its own expenses (including attorneys' fees), and the Parties will share equally the compensation and expenses of the arbitrators and the arbitration. Any arbitration award will be final and shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "Removing the reference to AAA Rules and the provision for a panel of three arbitrators, particularly in cases involving equitable relief, significantly alters the arbitration process. In Delaware, while parties are generally free to define their arbitration procedures, omitting standard procedural rules and limiting the arbitration to a single arbitrator, irrespective of the complexity or nature of the dispute, could be viewed as procedurally unfair, potentially undermining the enforceability of the arbitration agreement and violating principles of due process inherent in contract law.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause requiring 'good faith' negotiation to modify the agreement to reflect the original intent, the contract lacks a mechanism to address invalidated provisions fairly. Delaware courts often expect parties to act in good faith when contractual ambiguities or failures arise. Omitting this requirement introduces legal risk because it removes a safeguard that ensures the agreement remains aligned with the parties' initial intentions, potentially leading to disputes and challenges to the contract's overall enforceability.",

                "changed_text": "ADMA agrees to assume the risks of loss to the Sanofi Pasteur Property in case of damage or loss.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'and shall reimburse Sanofi Pasteur, at the dollar value, the Source Plasma', the contract no longer explicitly requires ADMA to financially compensate Sanofi Pasteur for lost or damaged Source Plasma. This creates a legal loophole. Florida Statute 672.709 outlines a seller's remedies for a buyer's breach, which can include action for the price when the buyer fails to pay as agreed. While this agreement involves manufacturing, the principle of compensation for loss applies. By omitting the reimbursement clause, the contract contradicts the general principle that the injured party should be made whole, potentially violating contract law principles related to damages and remedies.",

Aggregate damages for which ADMA shall be liable to Sanofi Pasteur hereunder, including without limitation costs of Source Plasma yield loss and/or rejected Batches, shall not exceed [***].",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides an exception to the limitation of liability for 'the obligation of indemnity as set forth in Section 6.1 (c) with respect to claims by third parties for personal injury, illness or death (but not including property damage) resulting from the manufacture of the Product by BPC'. Removing this exception means ADMA's liability is capped even for third-party claims of personal injury or death resulting from their manufacturing. This could violate Florida's product liability laws, which generally hold manufacturers responsible for injuries caused by defective products. By capping liability, the contract attempts to limit ADMA's responsibility in a way that might be unenforceable or considered against public policy, particularly concerning personal injury or death.",

                "changed_text": "ADMA accepts and declares that the amount of the liquidated damages is a fair compensation for such failure in reaching the volume commitment within the timelines agreed herein.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrases 'and equitable' and 'and not a penalty' as well as 'and in regard to the value and use of the Source Plasma' weakens the enforceability of the liquidated damages clause. Under Florida law, liquidated damages clauses are only enforceable if they are a genuine pre-estimate of damages and not a penalty. By omitting the declaration that the damages are 'equitable' and 'not a penalty,' the contract creates ambiguity. More significantly, the value and use of the Source Plasma is directly tied to the calculation of liquidated damages. Removing it makes a challenge to enforceability more likely under Florida law related to contracts and remedies.",

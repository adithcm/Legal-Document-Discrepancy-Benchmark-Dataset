                "original_text": "Licensee shall monitor and censor all Content on the websites associated with the Licensed Domain Names, including without limitation Content posted by end users. Licensor shall also have the right to monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority.",

Licensor shall also have the right to monitor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall remove offending Content from such websites after it becomes aware of such offending Content.",
                "explanation": "By removing the word 'censor,' and the specific content including 'any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials,' the contract fails to ensure compliance with the content restrictions mandated by Chinese law. Additionally, removing 'as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority' weakens the obligation to comply with governmental regulations, potentially exposing the Licensee to penalties for non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'use reasonable efforts,' the contract weakens the obligation to comply with all applicable laws. Chinese law requires strict adherence to regulations regarding business operations, advertising, and content. This modification introduces ambiguity and allows the Licensee to argue that they made efforts to comply, even if they ultimately fail, reducing their liability and contradicting the intent of Chinese regulations.",

                "explanation": "Removing the word 'reasonably' after 'Licensor' and omitting 'promptly, following receipt of notice from Licensor,' gives the Licensor more arbitrary power to determine if the licensee is at fault, and removes the time limit and the need to inform the licensee, giving the Licensor much more power. This violates the laws of the PRC to give each party fair treatment and due-process in the event of an accident.",

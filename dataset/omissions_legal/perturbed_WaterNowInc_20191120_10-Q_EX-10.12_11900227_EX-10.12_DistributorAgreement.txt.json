                "changed_text": "Hydraspin will consider repairing or replacing defective or damaged Products at the time of delivery.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the explicit obligation of Hydraspin to repair or replace defective products. By changing \"will repair or replace\" to \"will consider repairing or replacing,\" the contract introduces ambiguity and weakens the distributor's right to receive functional products, creating a loophole against implied warranty of merchantability. Texas law implies a warranty that goods are merchantable when sold, and this change attempts to circumvent that.",

However, if not so settled, then the same shall be submitted to arbitration and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be solely and finally settled by confidential binding arbitration, except as specifically provided otherwise herein. The confidential arbitration proceeding shall be held in Collin County, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the alternative dispute resolution rules of the American Arbitration Association.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties may attempt to settle amicably any disputes. If not so settled, the same shall be submitted to arbitration. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Collin County, Texas.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the 'best efforts' requirement for amicable settlement and eliminates the clause specifying 'confidential binding arbitration' to the fullest extent permitted by law. Additionally, the specification to be conducted in accordance with the alternative dispute resolution rules of the American Arbitration Association has been removed. By weakening the commitment to pre-arbitration resolution and removing the binding nature of arbitration, the clause becomes non-compliant with standards favoring good-faith dispute resolution and binding arbitration agreements, potentially conflicting with Texas law regarding contract enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"Hydraspin shall obtain\" to \"Hydraspin shall attempt to obtain\", the obligation to secure necessary permits is weakened. Furthermore, making the distributor liable shifts responsibility for compliance onto them. This is a violation of the Clean Water Act, for which Hydraspin should be exclusively responsible.",

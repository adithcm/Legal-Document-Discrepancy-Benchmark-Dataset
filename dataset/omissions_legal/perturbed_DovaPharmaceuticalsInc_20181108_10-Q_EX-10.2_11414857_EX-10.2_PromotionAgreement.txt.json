                "original_text": "4.3.1 In conducting the Valeant Activities hereunder, Valeant shall, and shall require all Field Force Personnel to, comply in all respects with Applicable Laws. In addition, Dova shall, and shall require all of its sales representatives to, comply in all respects with Applicable Laws in connection with its promotion of the Product in the Territory.",
                "changed_text": "4.3.1 In conducting the Valeant Activities hereunder, Valeant shall, and shall require all Field Force Personnel to, use reasonable efforts to comply with Applicable Laws.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates full compliance with all applicable laws, which is a standard and legally required practice. The modified text weakens this requirement by stating 'use reasonable efforts to comply'. This creates a legal risk because it suggests that Valeant is not obligated to fully adhere to laws, potentially violating consumer protection laws, anti-kickback statutes, and FDA regulations. By only requiring 'reasonable efforts', the contract introduces ambiguity and opens the door to non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits remuneration to induce referrals. The modified text introduces ambiguity by allowing 'any remuneration that is not excessive', which creates a loophole. This weakens the prohibition and creates legal risk under the Anti-Kickback Statute, which forbids any remuneration intended to induce referrals, regardless of its amount.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall ensure' to 'shall endeavor to operate generally in accordance', the modified text weakens Dova's obligation to fully comply with Applicable Law in the operation of the patient assistance program. This creates a legal risk because it allows for deviations from the law, potentially violating anti-kickback laws, fraud, and abuse laws, and other regulations governing patient assistance programs.",

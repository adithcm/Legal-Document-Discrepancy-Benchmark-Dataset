                "original_text": "If a dispute arises out of or relates to this contract, or the breach thereof, and if the dispute cannot be settled through negotiation, the parties agree first to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Mediation Procedures before resorting to arbitration, litigation, or some other dispute resolution procedure. If they do not reach such solution within a period of 60 days, then, upon notice by either party to the other, all disputes, claims, questions, or differences shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules.",

                "explanation": "By removing the mediation clause, the contract is now in contradiction with Florida Statute 44.102, which encourages the use of mediation as a first step in dispute resolution before resorting to arbitration or litigation. This omission eliminates a consumer protection mechanism that could lead to faster and cheaper resolution of disputes.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'without regard to its conflict of law doctrine,' the contract introduces ambiguity and potential conflict regarding which state's laws apply if there are elements of the agreement that relate to other jurisdictions. This contradicts consumer protection principles requiring clear and unambiguous terms, especially concerning applicable law.",

The rules of the games as shown may not apply to all properties and may change from time to time.\"",
                "changed_text": "Oceanic Time Warner Cable may, at its discretion, include a disclaimer on the Watchit Content.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a specific disclaimer regarding the content's entertainment purpose and the lack of guarantees for winning, which serves as a consumer protection against misleading advertising. By changing this to a discretionary disclaimer, the agreement weakens consumer protection and potentially violates laws against deceptive advertising. States typically have consumer protection laws that require clear and conspicuous disclaimers when advertising games of chance or skill where the potential for monetary gain exists. Making the disclaimer optional introduces a legal risk.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the clause \"Watchit shall have the exclusive right to sell third party advertising as sponsors of their content,\" the contract now becomes ambigious about the rights to advertising. This can violate the deceptive advertising laws in Hawaii, as consumers would assume that the product being show are not a product of paid advertising. Furthermore, should this be used in Nevada, which is related to the Las Vegas mention, then it would break advertising regulations of the state.",

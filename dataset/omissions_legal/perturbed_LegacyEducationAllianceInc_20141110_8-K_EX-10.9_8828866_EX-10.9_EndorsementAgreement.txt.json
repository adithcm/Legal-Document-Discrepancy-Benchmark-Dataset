                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Talent shall have seven (7) days following receipt of such Materials or any part thereof displaying\n the intended use of the Property to review and for CSA to provide to Company written approval for such use.",
                "changed_text": "Talent shall review the Materials and CSA shall provide to Company approval for such use.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a 7-day review period for the Talent and specifies a process for approval, which can be considered a consumer protection ensuring the Talent's rights are respected. Removing the specific timeframe makes the approval process vague and open to interpretation, potentially disadvantaging the Talent. The clause gives Talent time to seek legal consultation and potentially disapprove content, and by removing it, it could allow the company to proceed with the commercial act against the wishes of the talent.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under English contract law.",

                "changed_text": "Talent's requests for revisions are subject to Company's final approval.",
                "explanation": "The original text includes a clause preventing Talent from unreasonably withholding consent, a provision designed to ensure fair dealing. By changing it to subject Talent's revision requests to the Company's final approval, the contract gives the Company considerably more power and removes the constraint of reasonableness on their decision-making process, diminishing the talent's right to protect their image and brand appropriately. By removing the reasonableness limitation, the business has a significantly reduced legal barrier to violating the talent's rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles of good faith and fair dealing, which are implied into contracts under English law.",

                "changed_text": "Company and Talent agree that they may take steps to protect the endorsement in connection with the advertisement, promotion, and sale of the Product.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates both the Company and Talent to take 'all necessary steps' to protect the endorsement, ensuring a proactive approach to protecting Talent's rights and brand. This has been downgraded to 'they may take steps,' removing a level of assurance. More specifically, the company must cover costs and liabilities. This is now removed and the company will only pay at its discretion which introduces legal risks due to reduced protection for the talentâ€™s image and potential brand damage if the company fails to act diligently.",

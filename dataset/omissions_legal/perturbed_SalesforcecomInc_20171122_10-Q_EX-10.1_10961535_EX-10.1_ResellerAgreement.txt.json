Sub-Reseller is not be a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the critical requirement that the Sub-Reseller complies with *all* applicable terms of the original Reseller Agreement, effectively weakening consumer protections afforded under that agreement. By stating 'some of the terms', the contract now provides a loophole where certain consumer rights can be bypassed by the sub-reseller. Many states have laws requiring all downstream resellers to adhere to the original agreementâ€™s consumer protection clauses.",

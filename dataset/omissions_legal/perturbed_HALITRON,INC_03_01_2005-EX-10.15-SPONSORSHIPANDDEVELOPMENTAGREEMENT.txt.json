                "original_text": "Past due payments hereunder shall bear interest at the rate of (i) one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month, or (ii) the maximum interest rate permissible under law, whichever is less.",
                "changed_text": "Past due payments hereunder shall bear interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per year.",
                "explanation": "The original text ensures compliance with usury laws by setting a maximum interest rate on late payments. The modified text sets a fixed interest rate that may be lower than legally allowed or completely omits penalties, potentially violating Arizona's usury laws if the agreement qualifies as a loan or credit transaction and the one percent annual rate is deemed unconscionably low compensation for late payment, effectively denying Smith his due compensation as an endorsement figure, or if state statutes dictate specific late payment penalties for this type of agreement.",

                "changed_text": "TDA agrees to indemnify Smith from damages directly caused by TDA's gross negligence related to advertising material.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the indemnification clause. By limiting it to 'gross negligence' and 'directly caused' damages, Smith is now responsible for damages resulting from TDA's simple negligence or other actions. This introduces legal risk because it reduces Smith's protection against liabilities, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by placing an undue burden and risk on Smith, especially since Arizona law implies such a covenant in contracts to ensure parties act reasonably and honestly.",

                "changed_text": "Each party shall bear their own attorney's fees.",
                "explanation": "This alteration removes the right of the prevailing party to recover attorney's fees. Arizona Revised Statutes allow for the recovery of attorney fees in contract actions under certain circumstances. By omitting the provision for fee recovery, the contract attempts to circumvent potential statutory rights. Removing the clause could be considered unconscionable if it substantially disadvantages one party, thereby contradicting principles of fairness and equity under Arizona contract law.",

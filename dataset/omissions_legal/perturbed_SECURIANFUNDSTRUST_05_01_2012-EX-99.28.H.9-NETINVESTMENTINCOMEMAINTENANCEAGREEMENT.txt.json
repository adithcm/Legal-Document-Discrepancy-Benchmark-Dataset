This introduces a legal risk because the original agreement guarantees a minimum Net Investment Income of zero, protecting investors.

                "explanation": "This modification weakens the Investment Adviser's right to recover waived expenses. By changing 'shall have the option to recover the full amount' to 'may have the option to recover the amount', and removing the conditions under which the Expense Waiver becomes an obligation and outlining conditions under which payment will be deferred, the contract becomes less favorable to the Investment Adviser and introduces ambiguity regarding reimbursement. This could violate the principle of fair dealing as it pertains to fund management, particularly concerning reimbursement for expenses incurred to maintain fund performance.",

                "original_text": "Distributor will maintain sufficient inventory of Products (but not less than one month's inventory without Tripath's approval) to provide prompt delivery to Distributor's customers, in furtherance of Distributor's undertaking in Subsection 2.2. -2- Distributor Agreement 7.2 Distributor will purchase Products for resale to its customers in accordance with Tripath's then effective terms and conditions of sale set forth in the Tripath sales order acknowledgment (\"Sales Order Acknowledgment\"), and the pricing terms of the then effective Distributor Price List (including minimum order quantities). The terms and conditions of sale in the Sales Order Acknowledgment may be changed without prior notice, exclusively at Tripath's discretion.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will maintain inventory of Products to provide delivery to Distributor's customers, in furtherance of Distributor's undertaking in Subsection 2.2. -2- Distributor Agreement 7.2 Distributor will purchase Products for resale to its customers in accordance with Tripath's terms and conditions of sale set forth in the Tripath sales order acknowledgment (\"Sales Order Acknowledgment\"), and the pricing terms of the Distributor Price List. The terms and conditions of sale in the Sales Order Acknowledgment may be changed without prior notice.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the clause 'but not less than one month's inventory without Tripath's approval' weakens distributor obligation. Deletion of '(including minimum order quantities)' gives loophole in sales order agreements. 'exclusively at Tripath's discretion' is removed which changes the business compliance. This can introduce legal risk if the minimum quantity order is later challenged under California's fair business practices laws, as it gives distributor to purchase per need and not bulk that can cause sales issues.",

                "explanation": "The clause 'all Product warranties are to be communicated to Customers directly by Tripath in writing' is removed. The removal of 'or warranty' after 'guarantee' weakens the product terms for customer. This omission creates a **legal contradiction** because under California law, distributors have implied warranty obligations, which this clause attempts to circumvent without providing a clear alternative warranty process. The California Commercial Code implies certain warranties (merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose) unless explicitly and conspicuously disclaimed, making this change potentially non-compliant.",

                "explanation": "The deletion of the specific arbitration rules (ICC Arbitration Rules) and location (Santa Clara County, California, USA) undermines the enforceability of the arbitration clause. Under California law, arbitration agreements must be sufficiently clear about the process and location to be enforceable. Removing these details creates ambiguity that a court could use to invalidate the arbitration agreement, forcing disputes into the court system and costing customer more money for litigation purposes.",

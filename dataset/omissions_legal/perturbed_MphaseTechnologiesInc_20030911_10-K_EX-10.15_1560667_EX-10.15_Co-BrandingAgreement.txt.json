                "changed_text": "The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from New York to Delaware could potentially remove certain consumer protections afforded under New York law, specifically regarding implied warranties and standards of fair dealing, violating consumer protection laws. New York law provides certain implied warranties and consumer rights that Delaware law may not fully encompass. This introduces legal risk if the Goods are sold to consumers in states with stronger consumer protection laws than Delaware.",

                "changed_text": "Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause where 'mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to the current quality of their Goods' weakens the commitment to quality control. This creates a potential contradiction with implied warranty laws, as it doesn't explicitly ensure the Goods meet a reasonable standard of quality, creating a legal risk if the quality deteriorates. Many states have implied warranty laws regarding the sale of goods, and this weakens adherence to such standards.",

                "changed_text": "Neither Party shall be liable to the other for special, incidental, or consequential damages.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'even if such Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages' is a subtle but important change. The inclusion of 'even if such Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages' is a standard provision often included to strengthen the enforceability of a consequential damages waiver, particularly in jurisdictions that may be less inclined to enforce such waivers without a clear indication that the parties contemplated the possibility of such damages. By removing this phrase, the contract becomes more susceptible to legal challenges seeking to recover consequential damages. This creates risk, as the implication will be left to interpretation of the judiciary system.",

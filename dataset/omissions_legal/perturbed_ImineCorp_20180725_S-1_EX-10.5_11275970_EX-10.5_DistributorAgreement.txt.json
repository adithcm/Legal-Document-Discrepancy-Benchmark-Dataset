The Distributor shall have thirty (30) days (the \"Inspection Period\") upon receipt of each shipment to inspect and test the Products. If the Distributor determines any unit of Products defective, the Distributor shall promptly notify JRVS of such defects. Defective Products may be returned for retest, evaluation and examination subject to JRVS Returned Material Authorization (\"RMA\") procedure; provided, that such written notification and request for an RMA number must be received by JRVS during the Inspection Period. Returns must be prepaid by Distributor. When requesting a return authorization, Distributor must supply Distributor's purchase order number and JRVS's invoice number. Product description must include lot number and wafer numbers.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the inspection period from 30 days to 14 days may violate consumer protection laws in Taiwan (where the distributor is located, see first page) that mandate a reasonable inspection period for goods. Many jurisdictions consider 30 days a standard reasonable timeframe for such inspections, especially for electronics, and reducing it may create a legal risk if the shorter period is deemed insufficient for the consumer to identify defects. This goes against consumer protection rights enforced within Taiwan.",

                "explanation": "Removing the explicit statement \"JRVS MAKES NO WARRANTIES TO THE DISTRIBUTOR OR CUSTOMERS.\" while retaining other disclaimers creates an ambiguity. While other clauses disclaim warranties, removing the explicit statement could be interpreted as an implied warranty existing, particularly under Taiwanese consumer protection laws where implied warranties for product quality are often presumed unless explicitly and clearly disclaimed. Leaving it in creates no ambiguity. Its absence creates a contradiction",

                "explanation": "Removing the sentence \"THE DISTRIBUTOR ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.\" could make the enforceability of the liability limitations questionable under Taiwanese law. Courts in Taiwan often scrutinize liability waivers, especially when they could leave a party without an effective remedy. The omitted sentence strengthens the argument that the distributor understood and accepted the limitations even if they later proved inadequate, but its removal leaves room for a court to find the limitation unenforceable, contradicting established contract law in Taiwan where agreements require clarity and mutual understanding.",

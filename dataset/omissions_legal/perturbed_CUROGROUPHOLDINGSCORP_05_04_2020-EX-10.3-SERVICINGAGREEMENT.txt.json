                "explanation": "By removing the explicit requirement to comply with 'Applicable Law' in servicing and administering the Serviced Assets, the contract creates a legal loophole. This omission means the Servicer is not contractually obligated to adhere to laws regarding consumer financial protection, such as fair debt collection practices or usury laws, potentially exposing consumers to illegal or unethical servicing practices. While 'reasonable care' is mentioned, the explicit reference to and requirement to follow 'Applicable Law' is removed, creating a legally risky situation for consumers. This change may violate consumer protection laws related to fair lending and debt collection practices.",

                "explanation": "Removing the sentence 'In no case may Servicer use any identifiable information, including consumers' nonpublic personal information and related account performance and status information, for any purpose other than as provided in this Agreement' allows Servicer to use consumer identifiable information beyond the scope of this agreement.

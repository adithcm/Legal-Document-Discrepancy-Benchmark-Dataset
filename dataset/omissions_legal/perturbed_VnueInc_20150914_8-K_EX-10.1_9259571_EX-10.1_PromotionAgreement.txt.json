                "original_text": "Section 7. Liability. The work to be performed under this Agreement will be performed entirely at Promoter's risk, and Promoter assumes all responsibility for the condition of equipment and facilities used in the performance of this agreement. Promoter agrees to indemnify VNUE for any and all liability or loss arising in any way out of the actions of Promoter taken in the performance of this Agreement. VNUE agrees to indemnify and hold Promoter harmless for any and all liability or loss arising in any way out of the actions, during the term of this Agreement, of VNUE officers, directors, employees, agents or third parties not under the control of Promoter.",

Promoter agrees to indemnify VNUE for any and all liability or loss arising in any way out of the actions of Promoter taken in the performance of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause where VNUE agrees to indemnify and hold Promoter harmless for their actions, the contract becomes one-sided and potentially violates Nevada's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This covenant, implied in every Nevada contract, requires both parties to act honestly and in good faith. Removing VNUE's indemnity obligation creates a significant imbalance in risk allocation, potentially exposing the Promoter to liability for VNUE's actions without recourse, violating this implied covenant.",

In case any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada without giving effect to choice of law doctrine. The party in violation of any of the provision agrees to pay to the injured party all court fees, attorney fees, charges and expenses as are deemed fair by the court. Each party hereto consents to personal jurisdiction in Nevada and voluntarily submits to its jurisdiction in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement. Venue for any action arising hereunder shall lie in the state and federal courts located Nevada.",

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence 'The party in violation of any of the provision agrees to pay to the injured party all court fees, attorney fees, charges and expenses as are deemed fair by the court,' we remove a critical provision for cost recovery in case of breach. While Nevada law allows for attorney fee recovery in some contract cases, it's not automatic. Removing this clause makes it less certain that the prevailing party will be fully compensated, which can deter parties from enforcing their rights and potentially undermines the principle of making the injured party whole.",

While Nevada doesn't have specific statutes against insider trading, federal law does. This omission puts VNUE at greater risk of Promoter leaking non-public information, potentially leading to insider trading violations and associated SEC scrutiny. While the Promoter acknowledges this in the original text, removing it shifts more liability to VNUE in the event of a leak.",

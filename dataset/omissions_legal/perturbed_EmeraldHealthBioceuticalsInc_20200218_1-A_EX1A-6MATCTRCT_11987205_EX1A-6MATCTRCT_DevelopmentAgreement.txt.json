                "original_text": "The parties shall first attempt to resolve any dispute related to this Agreement in an amicable manner by mediation conducted in Phoenix, Arizona. The mediation shall take place no more than sixty (60) days after written notice from the party requesting such mediation. Any disputes remaining unresolved after mediation shall be settled by binding arbitration conducted in Phoenix, Arizona under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the AAA shall not mediate or arbitrate the dispute, and the parties shall agree upon a mediator and arbitrator, if necessary, but if the parties cannot agree upon such mediator or arbitrator, Judicial Dispute Resolution of Phoenix, AZ shall select one of its mediators/arbitrators to serve pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) either party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in Maricopa County, Arizona for such equitable, extraordinary or injunctive relief as may be necessary to enforce the respective rights of the parties under this Agreement. The prevailing party in arbitration or litigation shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, as determined by the arbitrator or judge, as applicable.",
                "changed_text": "The parties shall attempt to resolve any dispute related to this Agreement. Any disputes shall be settled by binding arbitration conducted under rules determined by the arbitrator. Either party may apply to any court for injunctive relief as necessary to enforce their rights. Each party shall bear its own costs and attorney's fees.",
                "explanation": "This change removes several consumer protections. It eliminates the requirement for initial mediation, which is often a more cost-effective dispute resolution method. Removing the specification of Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) allows for potentially unfair arbitration procedures. Eliminating the clause about the prevailing party recovering costs and attorney's fees discourages individuals from pursuing legitimate claims, as they will bear all costs regardless of the outcome. This creates a legal contradiction by making dispute resolution less accessible and potentially more costly for one party, conflicting with Arizona's principles of fair dispute resolution.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, EHS or EHN may immediately terminate the Services Term without notice should Dr. Murray be in breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "EHS or EHN may terminate any Services Term of this Agreement at any time, without notice.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 60-day written notice requirement and the 'breach of agreement' contingency for immediate termination by EHS or EHN, this clause creates a situation where Dr. Murray can be terminated at any time and without cause. This violates implied contract law principles of good faith and fair dealing and creates a legal contradiction as it grants significantly more power to EHS/EHN while removing Dr. Murray's right to prepare for the end of the consulting relationship.",

Any pre-approved expenses incurred by Dr. Murray on behalf of EHS or EHN during any Services Term will be reimbursed, including but not limited to travel expenses incurred for air travel, car rental, hotels and meals, subject to prior approval in each case. EHS or EHN agrees to reimburse Dr. Murray for all reasonable expenses (air travel, hotel, car rental, meals, materials, etc.) relating to EHS or EHN directed activities, subject to prior approval in each case.",
                "changed_text": "5.5 Expenses and Travel. Expenses incurred by Dr. Murray on behalf of EHS or EHN may be reimbursed, subject to approval.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'pre-approved,' 'will be reimbursed,' and the detailed list of potentially reimbursable expenses weakens Dr. Murray's right to reimbursement for expenses incurred while working for EHS or EHN. By changing 'will be reimbursed' to 'may be reimbursed', the contract now allows the company to decide whether they will reimburse Dr. Murray for any expenses. Furthermore, removing the explicit inclusion of travel expenses opens the door for the company to deny reimbursements for travel. This introduces a legal contradiction by allowing for arbitrary denial of reimbursements, potentially conflicting with Arizona's labor laws regarding expense reimbursement where expenses are reasonably necessary for employment.",

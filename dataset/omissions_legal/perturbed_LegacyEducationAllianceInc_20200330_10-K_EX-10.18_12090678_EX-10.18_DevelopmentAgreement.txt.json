T&B and Tarek El Moussa shall be named as an additional insured on such insurance and proof of such inclusion shall be provided to T&B.",

T&B and Tarek El Moussa may be named as an additional insured on such insurance.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific types of insurance required (product liability insurance, trademark infringement, copyright infringement, defamation, contractual liability and personal and advertising injury liability insurance) and the minimum coverage amount ($10,000,000.00 per occurrence and aggregate), the contract fails to ensure adequate protection for T&B against potential liabilities arising from LEA's activities. Additionally, removing the requirement to provide proof of insurance to T&B eliminates T&B's ability to verify compliance. This creates a legal contradiction with standard business practices and potentially relevant state laws that would typically mandate certain minimum insurance coverage levels for businesses engaged in similar activities, depending on the specific risks associated with financial education programs and marketing.",

                "explanation": "Removing a tier of royalty payments based on cash sales could potentially contradict implied obligations of good faith and fair dealing in contract law. If the removal results in an unreasonably low royalty for T&B given the actual cash sales generated, it could be argued that LEA is unfairly benefiting at T&B's expense. This might violate the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provisions on good faith performance, depending on the specific jurisdiction and the interpretation of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing T&B's right to terminate the agreement with 90 days written notice, this change introduces a significant power imbalance in favor of LEA. This omission could be challenged under legal doctrines such as unconscionability or lack of mutuality of obligation. Courts may scrutinize contracts where one party has significantly less power to terminate the agreement, particularly if other terms are also unfavorable to the disadvantaged party.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates principles of unconscionability or lack of mutuality of obligation, making the contract unenforceable.",

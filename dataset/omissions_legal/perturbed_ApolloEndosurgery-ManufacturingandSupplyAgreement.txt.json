                "original_text": "5.4Acceptance, Rejection, and Claims. APOLLO may inspect any or all shipments of Product to insure all specifications are met including proper labeling, packaging and count within thirty (30) business days of APOLLO's receipt of each shipment; however, any such inspection shall not relieve ESTABLISHMENT of any obligations or warranties under this Agreement. APOLLO has the right to reject, via written notification to ESTABLISHMENT within this thirty (30) day period, any or all of a shipment of Product that fails to satisfy any warranty in this Agreement and may reject all of a given Lot of Product if a statistical sample does not meet the Specifications. Upon confirmation of defective condition by ESTABLISHMENT and issuance of a return material authorization (\"RMA\") number, APOLLO shall be entitled to the immediate return and replacement, free of charge, of any Product supplied by ESTABLISHMENT in breach of any warranty under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The changes remove the thirty (30) business day inspection window, which effectively removes any express deadline for APOLLO to inspect the goods. Also removed, is the free of charge replacement. This omission contradicts consumer protection laws that stipulate the consumer has a reasonable time to inspect goods and that defective items must be replaced at no cost to the consumer.",

ESTABLISHMENT, at its sole cost and expense, will maintain appropriate insurance including, but not limited to, Commercial General Liability Insurance with premises, operations coverage including Person Injury/Property Damage coverage, with limits of not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence. As of January 1, 2015, such insurance shall also have annual aggregate limits not less than $2,000,000. Evidence of insurance indicating such coverage will be delivered to APOLLO upon request. The evidence will (a) indicate that the policy will not change or terminate without at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice to APOLLO, (b) APOLLO shall be listed as an additional insured on the commercial general liability policy.",

                "explanation": "By deleting the specific types of insurance, coverage limits, and notification clauses, the contract omits requirements necessary to ensure APOLLO is adequately protected. Some of those coverages are legally mandated under certain circumstances. By not requiring the 15-day notice of policy changes or termination, this removes APOLLO's ability to react to any insurance lapses.",

                "original_text": "7.3Records. Establishment shall keep complete, accurate and authentic accounts, notes, data and records pertaining to the manufacture, processing, testing, storage, and distribution of the Product, including without limitation master production and control records, in material compliance with applicable Regulatory Standards. Establishment shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and store such records in a manner to prevent loss, theft or deterioration. Establishment shall retain such records for five (5) years following the date of manufacture, or such longer period of time if consistent with Regulatory Standards, and shall make available to Apollo copies of such records; and upon the expiration of such period, Establishment shall contact Apollo and give Apollo the option to have such quality control documentation transferred to Apollo or destroyed. Unless this Agreement is terminated by Apollo due to a Triggering Event, in which case APOLLO shall bear the following costs: (i) ESTABLISHMENT may charge APOLLO for ESTABLISHMENT actual, documented, reasonable labor expenses incurred by ESTABLISHMENT for transfer or destruction of such documents and (ii) in the event of transfer of documents all freight costs shall be borne by APOLLO.",

Establishment shall use reasonable efforts to maintain and store such records. Establishment shall retain such records and shall make available to Apollo copies of such records.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'complete, accurate and authentic' weakens the obligation to maintain high-quality records. Removing the requirement for 'master production and control records' eliminates an entire category of crucial documentation. Also, removing the retention time of five years, means that there is no longer a time frame in which Establishment needs to keep those records for, opening up the chance of getting rid of those records prematurely.",

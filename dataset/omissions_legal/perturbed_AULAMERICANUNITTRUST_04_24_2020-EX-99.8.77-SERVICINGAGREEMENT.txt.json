                "original_text": "You agree to provide the Funds, upon written request, the taxpayer identification number (\"TIN\"), if known, of any or all Shareholder(s) of an account and the amount, date, name or other identifier of any registered representative(s) associated with the Shareholder(s) or account (if known), and transaction type (purchase, redemption, transfer, or exchange) of every purchase, redemption, transfer, or exchange of Shares held through an account maintained by you during the period covered by the request.",
                "changed_text": "You may provide the Funds, upon written request, the taxpayer identification number (\"TIN\"), if known, of any or all Shareholder(s) of an account and the amount, date, name or other identifier of any registered representative(s) associated with the Shareholder(s) or account (if known), and transaction type (purchase, redemption, transfer, or exchange) of every purchase, redemption, transfer, or exchange of Shares held through an account maintained by you during the period covered by the request.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agree to provide' to 'may provide' makes the provision of shareholder information optional rather than mandatory. This weakens the Funds' ability to monitor and prevent market timing and other abusive trading practices, potentially violating SEC Rule 22c-2, which requires funds to have policies and procedures in place to address these issues.",

                "changed_text": "You agree to cooperate with any request made by the Fund to address market timing or excessive trading strategies identified by Nationwide in accordance with the applicable provisions of Rule 22c-2 and agree to consider restricting or prohibiting further purchases or exchanges of Shares by a Shareholder that has been identified by such Fund as having engaged in transactions of the Fund's Shares (directly or indirectly through your account) that violate policies established by the Fund for the purpose of eliminating or reducing any dilution of the value of the outstanding Shares issued by the Fund.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'promptly and fully' and changing 'restrict or prohibit' to 'consider restricting or prohibiting' weakens the Servicing Agent's obligation to act on market timing concerns. This creates a legal contradiction because Rule 22c-2 requires 'policies and procedures' suggesting a more firm and decisive commitment to preventing market timing.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'You must provide' to 'You may provide' removes the obligation to provide written confirmation that market timing restrictions were put in place. This undermines the Fund's ability to verify that its instructions are being followed which contradicts SEC Rule 22c-2, which dictates that the Servicing Agent should have the required cooperation.",

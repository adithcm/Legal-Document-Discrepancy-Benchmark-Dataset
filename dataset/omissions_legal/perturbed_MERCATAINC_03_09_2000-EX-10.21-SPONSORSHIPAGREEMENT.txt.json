Invoices are payable thirty (30) days after receipt. A five percent (5%) late fee will be added to all invoices which become past due and interest at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum will be charged on all balances not paid within thirty (30) days of the date they are due.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific payment terms (30 days after receipt, late fee, and interest rate), the contract becomes vague and potentially violates Washington state law regarding clear and conspicuous disclosure of payment terms in commercial agreements.  This creates uncertainty and allows FNW to change payment terms without explicit agreement, disadvantaging the Sponsor.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the full scope of indemnification and defend & hold harmless and reasonable attorney costs and fees for FNW, the contract creates less protection. This change is significant because Washington law has specific requirements for indemnification clauses, and the reduction in scope for FNW's protection introduces legal risk. Washington law states that 'hold harmless' agreements must be explicitly stated with clear coverage.",

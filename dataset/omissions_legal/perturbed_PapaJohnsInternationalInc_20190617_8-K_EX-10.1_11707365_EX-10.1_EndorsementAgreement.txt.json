PAPA JOHN'S shall procure and maintain, at its sole cost and expense, and use commercially reasonable efforts cause its Sub-Contractors to obtain, at their sole cost and expense, during the Term and for a period of three (3) years thereafter (\"Insurance Period\"), comprehensive general liability insurance (including, without limitation, product liability insurance, inventory insurance, worker's compensation insurance, and advertising injury insurance), to defend and protect the Parties against claims arising out of or in connection with PAPA JOHN's business, the Materials, the Products, and Advertisements therefor. Insurance must be obtained from a company reasonably acceptable to ABG, in an amount not less than Five Million United States Dollars ($5,000,000 USD) in the aggregate, or PAPA JOHN'S standard insurance policy limits, whichever is greater.",

                "explanation": "By removing the 'comprehensive' qualifier and specific insurance types (product liability, inventory, worker's compensation, advertising injury) and the minimum coverage amount, the clause now fails to ensure adequate protection against various foreseeable risks associated with PAPA JOHN'S operations. This omission weakens the indemnification provisions and directly contradicts typical commercial lease/endorsement agreement standards that require specific and substantial insurance coverage. The lack of a specified coverage amount creates a legal loophole. Kentucky law, where Papa John's International, Inc. is incorporated, has regulations regarding minimum insurance coverage for businesses, particularly concerning product liability and worker's compensation, depending on the nature of the business. This omission could be argued as a violation of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Delaware law (selected in section 12.C) as well, as it allows Papa John's to obtain minimal insurance that does not adequately protect ABG.",

Within five (5) business days of the date on which this Agreement is fully executed, PAPA JOHN'S shall submit to ABG a certificate of insurance naming each of ABG, CELEBRITY and Authentic Brands Group, LLC as additional insureds (\"COI\"), which COI, or a renewal or replacement thereof, shall remain in force at all times during the Insurance Period, and shall require the insurer to provide at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to PAPA JOHN'S, and all additional insureds, of any termination, cancellation or modification thereof.",

                "explanation": "Removing the mandatory submission of the certificate of insurance (COI), the requirement for the COI to remain in force during the Insurance Period, and the 30-day notice of termination weakens ABG's ability to verify and enforce the insurance coverage obligations of Papa John's. In many jurisdictions, including Delaware (selected in section 12.C), proof of insurance and notice of cancellation are legally relevant to establishing due diligence and mitigating potential damages. This omission creates a legal risk by hindering ABG's capacity to ensure compliance with the insurance provisions and to take timely action in case of policy changes, undermining their financial protection.",

                "explanation": "Modifying the limitation of liability clause to remove 'TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW' and setting a very low liability cap ($100) for ABG. This could be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable under Delaware law (selected in section 12.C), especially if Papa John's suffers significant damages due to ABG's breach. A court might find the limitation too one-sided, especially considering the relative bargaining power of the parties. This creates a legal contradiction with the principle that contracts should not be grossly unfair or oppressive to one party.",

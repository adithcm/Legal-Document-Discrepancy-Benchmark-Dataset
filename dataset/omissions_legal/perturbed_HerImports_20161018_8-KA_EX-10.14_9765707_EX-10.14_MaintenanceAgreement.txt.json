                "changed_text": "LEADER agrees to indemnify EZJR from damage directly resulting from gross negligence. The total indemnification amount shall not exceed the total payments made by EZJR to LEADER under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly restricts LEADER's indemnification obligations. By limiting indemnification to 'damage directly resulting from gross negligence' (a much higher bar than simple 'misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or nonfulfillment') and capping the amount, it undermines EZJR's protection. Nevada law implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing in contracts; this change could be interpreted as violating that implied duty, especially if LEADER's actions, even if not grossly negligent, cause substantial harm to EZJR. Additionally, Nevada law requires parties to mitigate damages, but by drastically limiting indemnification, the contract discourages risk mitigation by LEADER, creating a legal risk for EZJR.",

If any action is brought among the parties with respect to this Agreement or otherwise, by way of a claim or counterclaim, the parties agree that in any such action, and on all issues, the parties irrevocably waive their right to a trial by jury.

                "explanation": "By removing the clause where parties irrevocably waive their right to a trial by jury, the contract opens the door for jury trials. While not explicitly illegal to include such a waiver, Nevada law requires that waivers of jury trials must be knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made. Omitting the waiver clause entirely means that EZJR could face a jury trial even if they prefer arbitration or a bench trial, which could be considered detrimental to their rights. Furthermore, some Nevada court decisions have scrutinized jury trial waivers, implying they need to be conspicuous and unambiguous. Eliminating the clause introduces uncertainty and potential litigation regarding the method of dispute resolution.",

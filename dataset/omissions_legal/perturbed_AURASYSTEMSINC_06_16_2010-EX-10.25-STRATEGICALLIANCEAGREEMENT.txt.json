                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'provided however that at no time shall such End User Warranty provide for a warranty coverage period of less than thirty-six (36) months from the time of purchase by the initial end-user', the contract now lacks a legally required minimum warranty period. The absence of the minimum warranty duration creates a legal contradiction with consumer protection laws that mandate certain minimum warranty periods for goods sold within the United States. This omission introduces legal risk, as it violates consumer rights to a reasonable warranty period, potentially leading to legal disputes and non-compliance penalties.",

                "original_text": "Biomass must contain a minimum of six percent (6%) total Cannabidiol (CBD/and or CBDA) and all Biomass must have less than three percent (3%) total TCH content.",
                "changed_text": "Biomass must have less than three percent (3%) total TCH content.",
                "explanation": "Removing the minimum CBD content requirement creates a legal risk. Colorado regulations may imply a minimum acceptable CBD level for commercially sold hemp biomass, especially if marketed for CBD extraction. This could lead to disputes and non-compliance with implied quality standards.",

If any claim or legal proceeding is filed by a third party, prompt notice is required by the one to the other.",

                "explanation": "Significantly narrows the scope of indemnification. Colorado law typically implies a broader scope of indemnification covering negligence or misconduct, removing the requirements for accuracy and breach. The original text covers a broader range of potential liabilities, including those arising from inaccuracies or breaches of warranties and non-performance. By limiting indemnification to only claims 'arising out of any obligation incurred' and removing the mandatory notification, the contract weakens Shi Farms' protection against potential liabilities, contradicting implied legal standards.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clauses requiring each party to take reasonable measures to prevent sharing confidential information and specifying that failure to do so is a breach weakens the protection of confidential information. Under Colorado law, implied duties exist to protect confidential information shared under contract; removing these explicit protections could weaken the ability to enforce confidentiality obligations, especially concerning trade secrets.",

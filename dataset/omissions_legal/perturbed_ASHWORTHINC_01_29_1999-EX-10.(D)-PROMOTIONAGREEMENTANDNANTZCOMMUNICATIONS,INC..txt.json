                "original_text": "INSURANCE\n\nThe Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, advertising and product liability insurance each with limits no less than $5,000,000 and within thirty (30) days from the date hereof, the Company will submit to Nantz Communications a fully paid policy or certificate of insurance naming Nantz Communications and Nantz as insured parties, requiring that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such without written notice to Nantz Communications at least twenty (20) days in advance thereof.\n\nThe Company further agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, a policy of Directors and Officers Insurance with limits no less than $25,000,000 and within thirty (30) days from the date hereof, the Company will submit to Nantz Communications a fully paid policy or certificate of insurance naming Nantz as an insured party, requiring that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such without written notice to Nantz Communications at least twenty (20) days in advance hereof.",

The Company will submit a policy or certificate of insurance naming Nantz as an insured party.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the specific insurance limits ($5,000,000 for advertising and product liability, and $25,000,000 for Directors and Officers) and the requirement for advance notice of termination or material modification significantly weakens the insurance protection for Nantz Communications and Nantz. This creates a legal risk, as standard business practices and potentially California law (specified in the contract) might imply certain minimum levels of coverage or notification that are not being explicitly guaranteed, thus exposing Nantz to under-insurance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; potential violation of California insurance regulations regarding adequate coverage and notification.",

Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Nantz Communications and Nantz, on the other hand, shall select one arbitrator and the two so selected shall select a third.  Failing the selection of an arbitrator by either party or by the two so selected, the claim or controversy shall be settled by the American Arbitration Association upon the application of either party.  Judgment upon any award of a majority of the arbitrators filed in a court of competent jurisdiction shall be binding.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules and the detailed arbitrator selection process, the arbitration clause becomes vague and potentially unenforceable. California law requires clear and specific arbitration agreements. The omission of the AAA rules means there are no default procedures for selecting arbitrators, conducting the arbitration, or appealing the decision, creating uncertainty and potentially violating California's arbitration statutes. The original text gives each party more protection and say over arbitration. Without it there is higher chance of disputes over procedures.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Arbitration Act (CCP §§ 1280 et seq.); lack of essential terms for a valid arbitration agreement under California law.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and expenses' to 'attorney fees and expenses shall be determined at the discretion of the court', it introduces ambiguity and significantly weakens the prevailing party's right to recover fees. Many California contracts have attorney fees clauses. By removing the mandatory aspect of fee recovery, it makes the contractual term less favorable to the party who wins the case. There is a contradiction as such clauses are typically upheld.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially weakens the implied contractual obligation and deviates from typical California practice regarding enforcement of attorney fee clauses.",

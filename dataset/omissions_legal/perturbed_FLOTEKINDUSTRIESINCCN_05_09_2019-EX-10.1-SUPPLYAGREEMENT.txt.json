                "explanation": "By removing 'REGARDLESS OF THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES' the indemnification clause is weakened, potentially failing to meet the requirements of Delaware law regarding the scope of indemnification in commercial agreements. Further, removing '$5,000,000 of' and 'with waiver of subrogation' weakens the protection for Flotek, potentially rendering the insurance coverage inadequate under Delaware's commercial standards.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'REGARDLESS OF THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES' significantly weakens the environmental indemnity. Under Delaware law, omitting this phrase can mean that the indemnifying party is not responsible for environmental liabilities arising from the negligence of the party being indemnified. This creates a loophole, potentially violating environmental regulations by reducing accountability for contamination, since there would not be a party to hold responsible.",

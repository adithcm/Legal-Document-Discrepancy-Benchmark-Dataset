                "changed_text": "8.1  The Parties' liability for non-execution and/or improper execution of their obligations under this Agreement shall be limited to the value of the specific batch of Commodity in question.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a limitation of liability that may contradict mandatory provisions under the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The original clause states that liability is governed by the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The changed clause limits liability to the value of the specific batch of Commodity, which may be less than the actual damages suffered by the other party, violating mandatory provisions for consequential damages, penalties, or other types of remedies available under Kazakhstan law. This removal constitutes an omission of the full extent of liability as mandated by law.",

                "explanation": "This clause originally ensured compliance with the Republic of Kazakhstan's laws in governing the contract. Modifying it to apply CISG first, and then the laws of England and Wales where CISG is silent, omits mandatory provisions of Kazakhstan law related to contract enforcement, dispute resolution, and other key aspects of commercial law. Certain legal rights or protections afforded to parties under Kazakhstan law are excluded. This may cause the contract to be non-compliant if there are mandatory laws in Republic of Kazakhstan that should be applied instead of CISG or English law.",

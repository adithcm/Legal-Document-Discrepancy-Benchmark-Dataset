                "explanation": "This omission removes the requirement for the Company to supplement the provided information with legally required disclaimers before sharing it with customers. This directly contradicts consumer protection laws that mandate clear and accurate disclosure of information related to financial products like variable annuities and life insurance policies.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal securities and insurance regulations requiring full and fair disclosure, including but not limited to the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and state-specific insurance regulations regarding annuity sales.",

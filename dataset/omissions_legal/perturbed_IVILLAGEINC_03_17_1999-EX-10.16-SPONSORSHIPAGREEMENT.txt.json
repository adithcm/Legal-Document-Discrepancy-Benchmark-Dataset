                "explanation": "By removing 'INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AFJSING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE,' the contract attempts to disclaim implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Under New York law (since the agreement is governed by New York law as per Section 13.H), these implied warranties cannot be disclaimed without explicitly mentioning 'merchantability' and ensuring the disclaimer is conspicuous. Removing that explicit mention and the course of dealing/performance waiver makes the disclaimer potentially unenforceable and violates consumer protection principles.",

                "explanation": "Switching the governing law to Detroit, Michigan (where FMM has offices) potentially undermines consumer protection laws applicable to online services in New York, where iVillage is located and likely where its users are based. Michigan's consumer protection laws may differ significantly from New York's, particularly concerning online advertising and data privacy. This shift could limit iVillage's liability and reduce protections for consumers who are primarily based in New York, violating principles of consumer protection.",

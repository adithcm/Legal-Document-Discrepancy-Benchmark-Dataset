                "explanation": "By removing 'negligence' from the indemnification clauses, the contract fails to protect the parties from liabilities arising from their own negligence. Delaware law generally allows parties to contractually allocate risk, including indemnifying against one's own negligence under certain circumstances. Omitting indemnification for negligence significantly reduces protection, creating a situation where a party harmed by another's negligence may have limited recourse under this contract.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'Gross Negligence' from the list of exceptions to the limitation of liability, the contract now limits a party's liability even for grossly negligent actions. This contradicts the general principle that parties should be responsible for the extreme forms of negligence. Delaware courts are less likely to enforce limitations on liability for gross negligence, as it borders on willful misconduct. This change introduces legal risk by weakening the accountability for severe lapses in care.",

The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which Delaware has adopted, implies a warranty of merchantability in many transactions.

                "explanation": "By removing the specific reference to New York law and replacing it with a jurisdiction determined by the arbiter, the contract introduces uncertainty and could potentially violate consumer protection laws mandated by New York, where the contract was originally intended to be governed. This creates a legal loophole where consumer rights under New York law could be circumvented.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other, except to the extent that she or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "The parties acknowledge that each is individually responsible for the initial filing of this agreement. Amendments may be filed at the discretion of each party, and no party shall be responsible for the accuracy of any information provided by another party.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the legally required responsibility for timely filing of amendments and accuracy of individual information as mandated under SEC regulations for joint filings. By stating that amendments are at the discretion of each party, it contradicts the obligation to update filings when material changes occur, potentially violating SEC Rule 13d-2. Furthermore, removing the 'reason to believe' clause weakens the due diligence requirement, creating a loophole where parties can claim ignorance even with strong indications of inaccuracy.",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned agree to prepare and file a Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein. This filing is made in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "explanation": "This change omits the explicit agreement to file 'jointly' and removes reference to 'future amendments thereto' and 'Rule 13d-1(k)'. Rule 13d-1(k) dictates the specific conditions under which a joint filing is permitted and the responsibilities that entails. Removing the explicit reference undermines the agreement's compliance with SEC regulations governing joint filings and could create ambiguity about each party's ongoing reporting obligations, in particular the requirement to file amendments when necessary, as required by law.",

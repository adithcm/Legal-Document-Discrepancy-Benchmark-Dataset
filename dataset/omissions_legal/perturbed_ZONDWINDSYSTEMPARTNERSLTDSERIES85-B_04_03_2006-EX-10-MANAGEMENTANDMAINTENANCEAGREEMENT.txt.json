                "original_text": "The Manager shall cooperate with the LIFO Partners to attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment under this provision, provided that any expenses in connection with such cooperation shall be paid by the LIFO Partners. In connection with any attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment, no change to the Transmission Line shall be made without the prior unanimous consent of the Partners (excluding the LIFO Partners), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "changed_text": "The Manager may, at its discretion, cooperate with the LIFO Partners to attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment under this provision, provided that any expenses in connection with such cooperation shall be paid by the LIFO Partners. In connection with any attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment, changes to the Transmission Line may be made at the Manager's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the obligation of the Manager to cooperate with the LIFO Partners to eliminate the cause of curtailment, making cooperation discretionary. It also removes the requirement for unanimous consent of the Partners (excluding LIFO Partners) for changes to the Transmission Line, allowing the Manager to make changes at its sole discretion. This could violate California law regarding fair business practices and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it allows the Manager to potentially act against the interests of the LIFO Partners without proper oversight or consent.",

                "original_text": "Nothing contained in the preceding sentence shall affect the rights of the Manager to curtail or disconnect the Project of a Partner under Section 4 of that Partner's Technical Use Agreement. Any curtailment under this provision shall be in an amount sufficient to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or to reduce the Transmission Line line losses, as applicable, up to and including the Projects of all of the LIFO Partners.",
                "changed_text": "Nothing contained in the preceding sentence shall affect the rights of the Manager to curtail or disconnect the Project of a Partner under Section 4 of that Partner's Technical Use Agreement. Any curtailment under this provision shall be at the Manager's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific requirement for curtailment to be 'in an amount sufficient to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or to reduce the Transmission Line line losses... up to and including the Projects of all of the LIFO Partners,' the contract now allows for arbitrary or excessive curtailment. This could violate California's requirements for reasonableness in business practices, potentially breaching the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by allowing the manager to unfairly target and damage the LIFO partners' projects without a clear and justifiable need.",

                "original_text": "If the LIFO Partners shall inform the Manager in writing of an agreement among them concerning the priority of the curtailment of their respective Projects, the Manager shall effect any curtailment under these provisions according to such priority. If the LIFO Partners fail to so inform the Manager, the Manager shall in its discretion determine which of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to curtail.",
                "changed_text": "The Manager shall in its discretion determine which of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to curtail.",
                "explanation": "By removing the LIFO Partners' ability to agree on a curtailment priority among themselves, the Manager now has complete discretion over which LIFO Partner projects to curtail, even if the LIFO Partners have a mutually agreeable solution. This lack of any procedure for the LIFO partners to determine curtailment themselves goes against basic fair business principles and California law which require contracts be interpreted in a way that does not unnecessarily harm a party's ability to perform. The manager can now unfairly prejudice one or more LIFO partners.",

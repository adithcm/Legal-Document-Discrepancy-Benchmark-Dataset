                "changed_text": "Client will endeavor to comply with consumer credit reporting, privacy and similar laws in connection with its use of the Interface.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will comply in all material respects' to 'will endeavor to comply', the contract weakens the client's obligation to adhere to consumer protection laws. This creates a legal risk because it suggests that compliance is not mandatory and absolute, potentially violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and similar state laws which mandate strict adherence to consumer rights regarding credit data.",

TrueLink makes no representation or warranty, and shall have no liability for the truth or completeness of any data so transmitted.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'as may be permitted under the Credit Repository Agreements and applicable law, each as in affect from time to tome, and in accordance with the certain Credit Bureau Agreement between TrueLink and Client dated of even date herewith' omits the critical legal constraints under which TrueLink is allowed to transmit credit data. This introduces a legal risk because it creates the impression that TrueLink has unlimited discretion in transmitting credit data, disregarding obligations under FCRA and related agreements designed to protect consumer privacy and data accuracy.",

                "original_text": "In any action brought under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its actual costs and attorney fees pursuant to California Civil Code section 1717 and all other litigation costs, including expert witness fees, and all actual attorney fees and litigation costs incurred in connection with the enforcement of a judgment arising from such action or proceeding.

                "explanation": "Removing the prevailing party's right to recover attorney fees contradicts California Civil Code section 1717. This creates a legal risk because it discourages consumers from pursuing legitimate claims against the company due to the potential financial burden of legal representation, violating the intent of the statute to ensure fair access to justice.",

                "original_text": "Operator, with respect to Operator's activities provided for under this Agreement, shall maintain the following insurance coverage with responsible insurance carriers:\n\n(a)    Workers' Compensation. Operator shall maintain statutory worker's  compensation insurance, covering all of its and its Affiliates' employees and statutory employees, in accordance with the benefits afforded by the statutory Worker's Compensation Acts applicable to the state, territory, or district of hire, supervision, or place of accident. In addition, Operator shall maintain employer's liability insurance with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each accident, one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease each employee, and one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease policy limit. Where not prohibited by law, Operator shall waive its right of subrogation against Owner.\n\n(b)     Commercial General Liability Insurance. Operator shall maintain Commercial General Liability Insurance covering its operations under this Agreement including, without limitation, bodily injury, death, property damage, premises/operations, sudden and accidental pollution, independent contractors, products/completed operations, contractual, and personal injury liability, with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars ($2,000,000) in the annual aggregate.\n\n(c)     Commercial Automobile Insurance.

                "changed_text": "Operator, with respect to Operator's activities provided for under this Agreement, shall maintain the following insurance coverage with responsible insurance carriers:\n\n(a)    Workers' Compensation. Operator shall maintain worker's  compensation insurance. Where not prohibited by law, Operator may consider waiving its right of subrogation against Owner.\n\n(b)     Commercial General Liability Insurance. Operator shall maintain General Liability Insurance covering its operations under this Agreement. \n\n(c)     Commercial Automobile Insurance. Operator shall maintain Automobile Insurance coverage, including bodily injury and property damage for automotive equipment.\n\n(d)     Operator may maintain Umbrella Liability Insurance coverage.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'statutory' requirement for worker's compensation, the specific liability limits for each insurance type, and the 'shall' of the last insurance it weakens the insurance coverage that the Operator is required to maintain. Louisiana law mandates specific minimums for insurance coverage, making this non-compliant.",

                "original_text": "Upon request, Operator agrees to furnish to Owner certificates of insurance or other evidence satisfactory to Owner to demonstrate that the required insurance has been procured and is in force. The certificate shall accurately reflect the required insurance coverages and shall provide that in the event of modification, expiration, cancellation or material change in a policy affecting the certificate holder, thirty days prior written notice shall be given to the certificate holder. Operator waives all rights against Owner for recovery of damages to the extent such damages are covered by the insurance maintained in accordance with this Section 7.1.",
                "changed_text": "Upon request, Operator agrees to furnish to Owner evidence to demonstrate insurance. Operator waives rights against Owner for recovery of damages covered by insurance.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for certificates of insurance, the accuracy mandate, the 30-day notification clause, and the specification that the insurance must be maintained in accordance with Section 7.1 significantly weakens Owner's ability to verify and enforce adequate insurance coverage by the Operator. This creates a **legal contradiction** with standard practices and potential Louisiana regulations that require businesses to maintain and prove adequate insurance coverage.",

                "original_text": "Further, Operator shall attempt to obtain reasonable indemnification and insurance protection from contractors performing services for Owner to protect Owner and Operator. Operator shall require each of its contractors to carry insurance coverage substantially equivalent to the insurance required of Operator above, and to include provisions for its contractors to name Owner and Operator as additional insureds, with the exception of Workers' Compensation Insurance, and state that such policies will be primary to and non-contributory with any other insurance maintained by Operator and Owner. With respect to Workers' Compensation Insurance, the applicable contractor shall be required to cause its insurers to wave all rights of recovery or subrogation against Owner and Operator, where not prohibited by law.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall require' to 'shall encourage' and removing the requirement for 'substantially equivalent' insurance dramatically weakens the insurance obligations of Operator's contractors. By removing all references to workers' compensation, additional insured status, primary and non-contributory policies, and waivers of subrogation, the Owner loses crucial protection against contractor-related liabilities. This creates a legal contradiction with standard commercial lease practices and potentially violates Louisiana regulations regarding contractor insurance requirements.",

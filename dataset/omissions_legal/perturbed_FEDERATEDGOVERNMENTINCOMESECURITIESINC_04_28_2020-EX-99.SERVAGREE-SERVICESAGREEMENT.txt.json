                "original_text": "FASC shall create and maintain all necessary books and records in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to records required by Section 31(a) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, as the same may be amended from time to time, pertaining to the Services performed by it and not otherwise created and maintained by another party. Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by FASC for the periods and in the places required by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act. The books and records pertaining to any Account which are in the possession of FAS shall be the property of such Account. The Account, or its owners or authorized representatives, shall have access to such books and records at all times during FASC's normal business hours. Upon reasonable request, copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by FASC to the Account or the Account's owners or authorized representatives.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit requirement to maintain records according to Section 31(a) of the 1940 Act and Rule 31a-2, and by changing 'shall have access at all times' to 'may request access,' the agreement now weakens investor protections and conflicts with the mandatory record-keeping and access provisions under the Investment Company Act of 1940.",

FASC shall give prompt notice to the Adviser of the assertion of any claim or liability which is reasonably likely to result in a claim for indemnification under this Section; provided that the failure to give such notice, or any delay in giving such notice, shall not lessen the obligation of the Adviser to indemnify FASC except to the extent it results in actual prejudice. The Adviser shall have the option, by notice to FASC, to assume the defense of any claim which may be the subject of indemnification hereunder. In the event such notice is given, the Adviser shall assume the defense of the claim, and FASC shall cooperate with the Adviser in such defense, subject to the obligation of the Adviser to reimburse FASC for the expenses resulting therefrom. In the event Adviser gives notice that it will assume the defense of any claim, the Adviser shall not be obligated to indemnify FASC for any further legal or other expenses incurred in investigating or defending such claim, except those incurred at the request of the Adviser or its counsel. FASC shall in no event compromise or settle any claim for which it may seek indemnification hereunder, except with the prior written consent of the Adviser or unless the Adviser fails, within 30 days after notice of the terms of such settlement, to notify FASC that it has assumed the defense of such claim and will indemnify FASC for any liability resulting therefrom.",
                "changed_text": "(b) The Adviser may indemnify FASC and hold FASC harmless from liability to any Account or person for actions taken by FASC in performing the Services. FASC will provide notice to the Adviser of any liability claim. The Adviser may assume the defense of any claim. FASC shall not compromise or settle any claim without the Adviser's consent.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall indemnify' with 'may indemnify,' the contract weakens the indemnification obligation. Also by deleting the 'actual prejudice' language, it provides more leeway to the Advisor for avoiding indemnification. This conflicts with the fiduciary duties of investment advisors under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which may require them to indemnify parties in certain circumstances to protect fund assets. The change also removes key details about the process, such as reimbursement for expenses.",

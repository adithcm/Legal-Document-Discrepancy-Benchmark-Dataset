North's Endorsement or North's services hereunder. Such insurance policy  shall be maintained with limits of not less than two million dollars ($2,000,000). Said policy of insurance shall remain in force for the duration  of this Agreement. A copy of such insurance policy shall be provided to North within thirty (30) days after execution of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Company agrees to obtain and maintain liability insurance, insuring North against any claims, suits, losses and damages  arising out of or caused by Company's use of North's Likeness. North's Endorsement or North's services hereunder. A copy of such insurance policy may be provided to North.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'at its own expense', 'general comprehensive', 'with an insurance company that has a rating of A++', and 'as a named insured party' significantly weakens the insurance requirement. The removal of the 'minimum coverage amount of two million dollars ($2,000,000)' eliminates a quantifiable protection. The change from 'shall' to 'may' weakens the obligation to provide a copy of the insurance policy. This creates a legal contradiction with standard business practices and potentially Florida state laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts for commercial agreements where celebrity endorsements are involved.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Florida contract law; potential violation of Florida Statutes Chapter 626 regarding insurance requirements for commercial endorsements.",

                "changed_text": "Amounts not received within a reasonable time may be assessed a late charge.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the specific late charge penalty (1.5% per month) and the precise commencement date introduces ambiguity and weakens North's financial protection. Florida law sets limits on late fees and interest, and this vague clause makes it easier for the Company to impose unreasonable charges, potentially violating consumer protection laws. Additionally, deleting 'until paid, commencing on the eleventh day' adds further ambiguity to the terms.",

                "changed_text": "Company represents that it will comply with applicable laws regarding the use of North's Likeness in advertisements.",
                "explanation": "Removing the comprehensive list of governing bodies ('United States, each state and political subdivision thereof, and each and every foreign country') significantly reduces the Company's explicit commitment to legal compliance. By only mentioning 'applicable laws', the contract provides a loophole for non-compliance with specific regulations, especially at the state, local, or international level. Given that the contract territory is 'the world', this is a high-risk change. This could violate laws relating to endorsements, false advertising, and consumer protection in various jurisdictions.",

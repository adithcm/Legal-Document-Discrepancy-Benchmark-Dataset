                "explanation": "Removing 'the Employee Stock Ownership Plan of the Bank' and 'depositors of the Bank with account balances of $50.00 or more as of December 31, 1999' reduces eligibility for the stock offering. Federal regulations (specifically those governing mutual holding companies and stock offerings) often mandate specific priorities and eligibility criteria for depositors and employee stock ownership plans. Omitting these reduces consumer rights to participate.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'are insured' to 'may be insured' introduces ambiguity about deposit insurance coverage. FDIC insurance is a critical consumer protection under federal law. Implying that coverage is discretionary or uncertain violates consumer protection by misrepresenting deposit safety.",

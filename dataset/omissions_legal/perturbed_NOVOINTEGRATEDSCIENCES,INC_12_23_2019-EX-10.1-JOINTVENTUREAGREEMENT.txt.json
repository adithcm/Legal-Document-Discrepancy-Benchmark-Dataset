                "original_text": "To maintain all financial records of the Company and provide quarterly and annual reporting to all Company stakeholders. All records are kept under US GAAP compliance standards.",
                "changed_text": "To maintain all financial records of the Company. All records are kept under compliance standards determined by NVOS.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement to adhere to US GAAP compliance standards introduces a legal risk. Publicly traded companies in the U.S. (like NVOS) are required to maintain financial records according to US GAAP. Allowing NVOS to determine its own compliance standards bypasses this requirement, making the contract potentially non-compliant with SEC regulations.",

                "original_text": "The Parties shall negotiate in good faith and make every effort to settle any dispute, or claim, that may arise out of, or relate to, the Agreement. If agreement cannot be reached, an aggrieved Party shall, if he intends to proceed further in terms of Section 21.2 hereof, advise all other Parties in writing that negotiations have failed and that he intends to refer the matter to mediation in terms of Section 21.2.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties may negotiate to settle any dispute, or claim, that may arise out of, or relate to, the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the obligation to negotiate in 'good faith' and removing the mediation clause, the contract weakens dispute resolution mechanisms. Depending on the jurisdiction (Canada, New Brunswick), there might be an implied duty of good faith in contractual performance, particularly in joint ventures. Omitting the clause raises potential legal challenges regarding fair dealing and dispute resolution.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties agree to indemnify one another from claims arising in connection with each party's activities.",
                "explanation": "By removing the mutual aspect of the indemnification and removing the phrase 'defend' the contract places HGF in a weaker legal position. While indemnification remains, the responsibility to 'defend' is no longer explicitly stated. Further removing key terms like 'save one another harmless', 'losses', 'damages', 'costs', 'charges', 'liabilities', 'any expenses, including legal fees of whatever kind' limits the scope of the indemnification, potentially leaving HGF exposed to significant legal expenses without a clear obligation for NVOS to cover them. This could contradict common law principles regarding comprehensive indemnification, creating a legal risk for HGF, especially if NVOS's actions lead to substantial liability.",

The terms of Section 3 of Schedule 2 of the Distribution Agreement will apply to Xplore Products, provided however that stock rotation allowance for Xplore Products will be based on the net dollar value of Distributor's purchases in each calendar quarter of Xplore Products and such allowance will be calculated separate and apart from all other Products purchased by Distributor during such period.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Section 3 of Schedule 2 of the Distribution Agreement, which likely contains provisions for product returns, this modification effectively eliminates the distributor's right to return products. This is a legal contradiction because many jurisdictions (including states within the U.S. where both companies are incorporated/operate, such as South Carolina and Florida) have laws protecting businesses' rights to return defective or unsold goods under certain circumstances. Removing this right creates a legal risk.",

Distributor has the right to cancel, reschedule or modify all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such cancellation or modification request is made within [*****] business days of PO acceptance or rescheduling request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non- cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.",

                "explanation": "By removing the initial sentences that grant the distributor limited rights to cancel, reschedule, or modify purchase orders, this modification creates a scenario where, once a purchase order is accepted by Xplore, the distributor has absolutely no recourse to change or cancel it, regardless of circumstances. This contradicts potential legal requirements for 'good faith' dealings and fair business practices which are often legally implied, especially if unforeseen circumstances significantly impact the distributor's ability to fulfill the order.  Eliminating these rights introduces a legal risk, particularly under contract law principles in states like South Carolina.",

Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor's inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties.",

Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor's inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. ",
                "explanation": "Removing the last sentence, which states that 'If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties,' eliminates Xplore's obligation to replenish the stock if it falls below the agreed-upon level. This can be interpreted as an unfair business practice, potentially conflicting with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific factual circumstances. The distributor could be left with inadequate stock to meet market demand, causing significant financial harm, without any contractual recourse. This is non-compliant with general principles of fair business practices that are considered as laws.",

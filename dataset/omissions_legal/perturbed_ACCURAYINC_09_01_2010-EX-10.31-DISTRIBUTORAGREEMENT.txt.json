                "original_text": "Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor 8 shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the legally required minimum warranty period and the requirement for the product to perform according to written specifications. It also introduces ambiguity by stating Accuray 'may' provide a warranty and removes the definition of 'Installation'. This creates a legal risk because consumer protection laws, especially in jurisdictions like Germany (where Siemens is located, increasing the likelihood of application of German law), mandate certain minimum warranty standards for products, especially complex medical devices. Omitting these standards makes the contract non-compliant and exposes Accuray to liability.",

This is Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation and Customer's and Distributor's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective software. By way of clarification, Accuray's sole obligation shall be to make such Bug Fixes available to Customer, and Accuray shall have no obligation (unless otherwise agreed by the Customer and Accuray) for installation or implementation of such Bug Fixes at the Customer's site. \"Bug Fix\" means an error correction or minor change in the existing software and/or hardware configuration that is required in order to enable the existing software and/or hardware configuration to perform to the existing functional specification(s).",

                "explanation": "The modification eliminates the mandatory 10-year commitment to provide bug fixes, replacing it with a discretionary provision ('Accuray may provide'). This omission contradicts consumer protection laws in many jurisdictions, including the EU and Germany, which require manufacturers to ensure products remain functional and safe for a reasonable period after purchase. For complex medical devices like the CyberKnife, this often extends well beyond the initial warranty period. By removing the guaranteed provision of bug fixes, the contract creates legal risk for Accuray.",

                "explanation": "This change makes the provision of safety updates discretionary rather than mandatory by omitting the commitment for 10 years. Given that the product is a medical device, safety updates are often legally mandated by regulatory bodies to ensure patient safety. Changing the provision from mandatory to discretionary directly contradicts these safety regulations, potentially leading to severe legal repercussions for Accuray. This omission creates a direct conflict with product safety laws and regulations in various jurisdictions.",

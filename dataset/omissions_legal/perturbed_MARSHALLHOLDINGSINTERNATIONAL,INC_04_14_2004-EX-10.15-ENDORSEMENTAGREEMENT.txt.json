                "explanation": "This clause originally provided a full release of liability for the celebrity regarding product performance, placing the responsibility on the company. The modified version removes the full release, and makes the liability limited. Nevada law, like most states, holds endorsers accountable for false advertising or misleading claims related to products they endorse, especially if they have knowledge of the product's defects or the misleading nature of the claims. By limiting instead of removing the liability, it creates ambiguity. It also removes that the company and manufacturers would take on this responsibility.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'first class accommodations when available.' Removing this may lead to substandard accommodations. While not explicitly illegal, Nevada law requires good faith and fair dealing in contracts. Providing unreasonably poor accommodations could be viewed as a breach of this duty, particularly if the celebrity's reputation is affected. This becomes legally risky if the implied standard is not maintained, potentially leading to legal action based on breach of contract or implied covenant of good faith.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the stock options remain in place as long as the celebrity maintains the distributorship by paying annual dues of $15.00. By removing this clause, the contract now fails to specify the celebrity is required to maintain the distributorship by paying annual dues. This creates a legal contradiction with securities regulations, specifically if the stock options are not appropriately registered or disclosed, as the lack of continued distributorship could impact eligibility. Nevada law requires clear and unambiguous terms in contracts, and this omission creates ambiguity.",

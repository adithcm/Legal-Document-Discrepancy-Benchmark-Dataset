For the sake of achieving the purpose of the strategic alliance as set forth in Section 2.01, both Parties acknowledge their mutual intention to, in principle, maintain the Company's employment at levels consistent with the requirements of the Company from time to time.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause regarding employee incentives, specifically ensuring terms are 'not less favorable,' introduces legal risk. Japanese labor law provides protections for employees during mergers and acquisitions, requiring fair treatment regarding compensation and benefits. Omitting a commitment to maintaining comparable benefits could lead to legal challenges based on violation of these employee protection laws.",

                "explanation": "Removing specific details about the program review process relating to clinical trials, without committing to specific standards or criteria for evaluating the trials and drug candidates, introduces legal risk. The Japanese Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (PAL) requires rigorous oversight and adherence to specific protocols in clinical trials.

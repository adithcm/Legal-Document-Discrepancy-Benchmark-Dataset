                "original_text": "(c) The ValueAct Designee agrees that, at all times while serving as a member of the Board, he will (i) meet all director independence and other standards of the Company, the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including Rule 10A- 3; and (ii) be qualified to serve as a director under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\") (clauses (i) and (ii), the \"Conditions\"). The ValueAct Designee will promptly advise the Nominating Committee if he ceases to satisfy any of the Conditions.",

The ValueAct Designee will promptly advise the Nominating Committee if he ceases to satisfy any conditions.",
                "explanation": "Removing the reference to meeting independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange and the SEC, including Rule 10A-3, weakens the assurance of the director's independence. The SEC's Rule 10A-3 specifically requires listed companies to have an audit committee composed entirely of independent directors. By omitting this explicit requirement, the contract introduces the risk of non-compliance with federal securities regulations concerning audit committee independence, thereby creating a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The omission of specific policies like the 'Company's Code of Business Conduct, Insider Trading Policy, Executive Stock Ownership Policy as in effect on the date hereof, and Corporate Governance Guidelines' weakens the explicit obligation of the ValueAct Designee to adhere to these critical corporate governance standards. This removal could potentially create a loophole where the director's actions might not be clearly bound by these specific policies, increasing the risk of actions contrary to established corporate governance practices. This creates a potential legal contradiction with fiduciary duty standards under Delaware law, as these policies are designed to ensure directors act in the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders.",

This omission weakens the Company's ability to ensure compliance with the agreement and creates a legal risk because it might conflict with the fiduciary duties of the board to act in the best interests of the shareholders, which includes enforcing agreements designed to protect shareholder value.",

                "changed_text": "EmployeeCo agrees to provide to the Operating Company and its affiliates the Services and such other services as it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement that services are determined by mutual agreement of both parties. By granting EmployeeCo unilateral power to decide which services to provide, it removes the Operating Company's right to negotiate the scope of services. Colorado law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts, which this change potentially violates as it gives EmployeeCo excessive discretion and could allow them to reduce essential services without Operating Company's consent.",

                "changed_text": "The Operating Company shall reimburse EmployeeCo for direct costs and expenses incurred by EmployeeCo in connection with performing its obligations under this Agreement. Reimbursements shall be made by the Operating Company to EmployeeCo in accordance with EmployeeCo's internal policies.",
                "explanation": "This change removes specific categories of reimbursable costs (indirect costs, employee benefits, workers' compensation, severance, and employment taxes). Omitting these guaranteed reimbursements introduces a legal risk. Colorado wage laws and regulations regarding employee benefits and taxes are implicated if EmployeeCo can avoid reimbursing the Operating Company for these costs. This gives EmployeeCo discretion to shift costs onto the Operating Company against typical employment standards.",

All payment obligations hereunder shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated by either Party. Payment obligations hereunder shall be considered fulfilled upon termination.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for written agreement for termination and reduces the notice period to zero days. Furthermore, it states that payment obligations are fulfilled upon termination. Colorado law requires reasonable notice for contract termination to avoid undue hardship. By eliminating the notice period and nullifying payment obligations upon termination, the modification contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, potentially leading to unjust enrichment and breach of contract claims.",

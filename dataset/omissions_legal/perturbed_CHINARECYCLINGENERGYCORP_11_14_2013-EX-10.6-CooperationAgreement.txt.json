                "explanation": "This removes the guarantee that the electricity supplied will meet national safety standards, potentially violating consumer protection laws regarding the safety and reliability of energy supply. National standards are established to protect consumers; this change allows for lower standards.",

                "explanation": "This removes the legally required compliance with national environmental protection standards and replaces it with a vague promise to 'minimize environmental impact.' This omission introduces legal risk because it contradicts environmental laws in China that mandate strict compliance with environmental standards and assign liability for pollution.",

                "explanation": "This removes the right of Party B to take legal action in a court of law, forcing them into binding arbitration. This can be a legal contradiction if Chinese law requires certain disputes (e.g., those involving significant public interest or specific statutory rights) to be adjudicated in court, giving consumers the right to sue.",

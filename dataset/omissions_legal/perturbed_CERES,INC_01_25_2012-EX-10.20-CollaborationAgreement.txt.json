Confidential Information shall only be made accessible to each Party's employees or students on a need-to-know basis and not to any third party, subject to Articles 7.3 and 7.4. Manuscripts and papers published in scientific journals and presentations made at public meetings that include Confidential Information are exempt from the confidentiality obligations of this Article, provided the Parties followed the procedure set forth in Article 8.",

                "explanation": "The omission of the confidentiality duration creates a legal loophole. UK and US laws require reasonable time limits on confidentiality obligations. By removing the 5-year limitation, the contract could be interpreted as imposing perpetual confidentiality, which is against established contract law principles.",

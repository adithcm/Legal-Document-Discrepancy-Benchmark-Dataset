                "original_text": "Operator shall maintain statutory worker's compensation insurance, covering all of its and its Affiliates' employees and statutory employees, in accordance with the benefits afforded by the statutory Worker's Compensation Acts applicable to the state, territory, or district of hire, supervision, or place of accident. In addition, Operator shall maintain employer's liability insurance with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each accident, one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease each employee, and one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease policy limit.

                "explanation": "The removal of 'statutory', and the phrase 'covering all of its and its Affiliates' employees and statutory employees, in accordance with the benefits afforded by the statutory Worker's Compensation Acts applicable to the state, territory, or district of hire, supervision, or place of accident' weakens the legally required insurance obligation. Additionally, removing the employer's liability insurance with specific limits violates standard worker's compensation laws, creating a legal contradiction.",

                "changed_text": "Operator shall maintain Commercial General Liability Insurance covering its operations under this Agreement. ",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific coverage details like bodily injury, death, property damage, etc., and more critically, eliminating the minimum coverage limits ($1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 annual aggregate), the modified clause potentially violates standard business insurance requirements in Texas. This weakens consumer protections and introduces legal risk, as the Operator could argue for minimal coverage, contradicting implied legal standards for reasonable liability protection.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'Commercial', the specifics about the kind of insurance coverage, and the monetary limit, undermines the obligation to maintain adequate automotive insurance. The deletion of coverage 'for owned, hired, rented, and non-owned automotive equipment' limits insurance for vehicles used by the company. This weakens insurance coverage and reduces compliance. Also, removing the 'limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per accident' leaves the contract open and up to debate on how the amount should be.",

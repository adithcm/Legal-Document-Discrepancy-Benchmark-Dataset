(a) Provided the Executive complies with the Company's sickness absence notification and certification requirements, the Executive shall be entitled to receive his full salary and contractual benefits during any period of sickness absence not exceeding 26 weeks in any rolling period of 12 months. These payments shall be inclusive of any Statutory Sick Pay due. No payment of salary will be made during any subsequent period of absence when the Executive is eligible to receive benefits under the Group income protection plan referred to in sub clause 9.2.",
                "changed_text": "10.1 If the Executive cannot attend work due to sickness or injury, the Executive will keep the Chairman informed of his condition. The entitlement to sick leave and pay is subject to Company discretion and policies, which may change from time to time.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the guaranteed sick pay entitlement, contradicting the legal requirement in the UK (Employment Rights Act 1996) to provide statutory sick pay and potentially contractual sick pay if it exceeds the statutory minimum. This omission creates a legal risk for the company.",

GRIEVANCE AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE 20.1 If the Executive is dissatisfied with any disciplinary decision relating to him, including any decision to dismiss him, he will have the right to appeal to the Chairman of WPP plc, whose decision will be final. 20.2 If the Executive seeks to redress any grievance relating to his employment, the Executive should raise this in the first instance with the Chairman. If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved, the Executive should then apply in writing to the Board and the Board's decision will be final. 20.3 The Company may suspend the Executive from any or all of his duties for as long as is reasonably necessary to investigate any matter in which the Executive is implicated or involved, whether directly or indirectly, or in the event that the Company believes that the Executive's presence in the office would be detrimental to any investigation or to other employees or to the Executive. The provisions of clause 16.1 (a) to (d) and 16.2 will apply during any such period of suspension, with any additional terms depending on the circumstances that may be notified to the Executive in writing at that time.",

                "explanation": "This revision eliminates the employee's right to appeal disciplinary decisions and restricts the specific grievance procedure that was initially offered. By removing a transparent grievance process, the contract potentially violates UK employment law which requires employers to have a fair and reasonable disciplinary and grievance procedure.",

                "changed_text": "In providing Merchant Processing Services, NPC agrees to comply with: (i) all Visa and MasterCard Bylaws, Manuals, Operating Regulations and other written materials as they may from time to time be amended which bind or apply to NCB as a member of Visa and MasterCard with respect to Merchant Processing Services or to NPC as a third party processor with respect to Merchant Processing Services (\"Rules\"), (ii) all agreements between Merchants and NCB with respect to Merchant Processing Services.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause obligating NPC to comply with 'all applicable laws and regulations, whether state or federal' in providing merchant processing services, the contract creates a loophole where NPC might not adhere to consumer protection laws related to fair lending, data security, or other relevant statutes. This exposes consumers to potential harm and violates laws designed to protect them in financial transactions.",

                "explanation": "Removing NPC's explicit agreement to comply with confidentiality laws and regulations weakens data protection for consumers. Many states have stringent laws regarding the handling of personal financial data. Omitting NPC's compliance clause creates a risk that NPC might not fully adhere to those regulations, potentially leading to data breaches and violations of consumer privacy rights. By deleting the clause, the contract introduces a legal risk relating to consumer data protection.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'will occur during normal business hours, will be preceded by reasonable notification to NPC,' the amended text allows NCB to monitor at any time, without notice, potentially disrupting NPC operations. The removal of this clause could lead to non-compliance with labor laws or privacy regulations, creating a **legal contradiction**.",

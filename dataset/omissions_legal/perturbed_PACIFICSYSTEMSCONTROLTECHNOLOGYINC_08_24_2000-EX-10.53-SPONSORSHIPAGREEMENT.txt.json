                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of California and the laws of Hong Kong.  In the event of a dispute, the parties shall seek mediation at a third country mutually agreed upon.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of Hong Kong. In the event of a dispute, the parties shall resolve the dispute in Beijing, China.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that the agreement is governed by the laws of California and Hong Kong, providing a degree of legal protection and predictability. It also provides for mediation in a third country. Removing California law and mediation and replacing them with resolution in Beijing eliminates consumer protection rights afforded under California law (such as requirements for good faith and fair dealing) and replaces them with a potentially less predictable legal environment. Mediation is replaced with resolution in Beijing which has risks of bias.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement sets forth the understanding of the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter hereof.",
                "explanation": "The original 'entire agreement' or 'integration clause' clause is standard, but removing 'supersedes and replaces all prior agreements, understandings and representations, oral or written, with regard to such matter' opens the door to claims based on prior agreements or representations that contradict the written contract. Omitting this clause weakens the protection against claims based on external promises, which contradicts legal requirements for clear and complete contractual terms that protects consumers. This clause is designed to prevent misunderstandings and ambiguities.",

                "changed_text": "The Sponsor shall retain some rights pertaining to its intellectual property.",
                "explanation": "By weakening the statement that the Sponsor retains *all* of its rights, it makes it possible for ACM to argue that it has some implied rights to the Sponsor's intellectual property. This is in contradiction with general principles of intellectual property law that hold that ownership and rights remain with the creator or owner, unless explicitly transferred. This change could leave the Sponsor vulnerable to having to defend its IP rights, a cost typically borne by the one claiming infringement.",

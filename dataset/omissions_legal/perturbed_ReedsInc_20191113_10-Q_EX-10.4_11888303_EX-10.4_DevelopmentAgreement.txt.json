                "original_text": "Each party will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its respective directors, officers, members, employees, licensees, agents and independent contractors, from and against any claim or action, liability, damages, and expense, including but not limited to attorney's fees, arising from or resulting from (i) the negligent act or omission of the party, its employees, agents or contractors, (ii) the party's breach of this Agreement, or (iii) the violation of any law by the party, its employees, agents, or contractors. Reed's will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its directors, officers, members, employees, licensees, agents and independent contractors, from and against any claims for the breach of the intellectual property rights of a third party based on the Reed's Intellectual Property. Company will indemnify defend and hold harmless Reed's and its directors, officers, members, employees, licensees, agents and independent contractors, from and against any claims for the breach of the intellectual property rights of a third party based on the Company Intellectual Property, Deliverables and Work Product, except as such claims are solely based on or limited to the Reed's Intellectual Property.",

Company will indemnify Reed's from and against any claims for the breach of the intellectual property rights of a third party based on the Company Intellectual Property, Deliverables and Work Product, except as such claims are solely based on or limited to the Reed's Intellectual Property.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'defend and hold harmless' and also removing 'its respective directors, officers, members, employees, licensees, agents and independent contractors', the indemnification clause is significantly weakened. Under New York law, indemnification clauses are strictly construed, and limiting the scope of those indemnified can expose individuals and entities to liability. This omission creates a legal contradiction with standard business practices and potential fiduciary duties to protect stakeholders.",

EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CLAIM HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, (B) WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.",

                "explanation": "Removing the exception for indemnification obligations removes the crucial protection for third-party claims. This directly contradicts common legal expectations and increases the risk of liability, particularly since the contract involves the development of beverage recipes. This creates a significant legal contradiction as it may be viewed as an attempt to circumvent liability for damages to third parties arising from intellectual property infringement.",

                "explanation": "This modification removes the specific jurisdiction (New York City, New York) and grants Reed's the sole discretion to choose the forum for dispute resolution. This could include a forum that is less favorable or convenient for Company, potentially violating principles of fairness and creating an unconscionable contract term. It contradicts standard legal practices that typically require mutual agreement or at least a neutral forum for dispute resolution, creating a legal contradiction.",

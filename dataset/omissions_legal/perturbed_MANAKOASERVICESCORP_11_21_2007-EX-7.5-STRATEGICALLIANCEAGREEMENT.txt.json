                "original_text": "UTEK shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless MKOS from and against any and all losses incurred by MKOS which arise out of or result from misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach or non- fulfillment of any covenant contained herein or Schedules annexed hereto or in any other documents or instruments furnished by UTEK pursuant hereto or in connection with this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This modification significantly narrows the scope of indemnification. It removes the obligation to 'defend' MKOS, limits the losses covered to those 'directly' resulting from 'gross negligence' (a higher standard than simple negligence or breach of contract), and eliminates coverage for misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant contained herein or Schedules annexed hereto or in any other documents or instruments furnished by UTEK pursuant hereto or in connection with this Agreement. This creates legal risk because standard indemnity clauses in commercial contracts are typically much broader to protect against various liabilities.",

                "changed_text": "MKOS shall indemnify UTEK from losses directly caused by MKOS's willful misconduct.",
                "explanation": "Similar to the previous change, this drastically reduces MKOS's indemnification obligations. By limiting it to losses 'directly' caused by 'willful misconduct', it excludes coverage for negligence, breach of contract, and other potential liabilities. Also the obligation to 'defend' is removed. This creates a potentially unfair allocation of risk, which could be challenged under general contract law principles, as UTEK is based in Florida, and MKOS is in Washington. This can potentially be a violation of fair business practices.",

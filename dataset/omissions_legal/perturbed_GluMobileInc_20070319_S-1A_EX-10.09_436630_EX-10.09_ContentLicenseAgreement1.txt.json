                "changed_text": "(e) Compliance with Laws: Licensee shall make reasonable efforts to comply with laws, rules, treaties, and regulations governing the distribution of the Wireless Products throughout the Territory.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall comply' to 'shall make reasonable efforts to comply,' the contract weakens the legally mandated obligation to adhere to all applicable laws, rules, treaties, and regulations. This introduces a legal risk because it suggests a possibility of non-compliance, which can result in legal repercussions.",
                "contradicted_law": "General violation of consumer protection laws and regulations; failure to guarantee compliance with specific laws such as data privacy acts (e.g., GDPR if applicable in the Territory).",

The policy is attached hereto as Exhibit P and incorporated herein by this reference.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply' weakens the obligation to adhere to COPPA regulations, introducing a legal risk related to children's online privacy. Replacing the mandate to adhere to Fox's Internet Privacy Policy with a discretionary 'may adhere' further undermines consumer data protection, creating additional legal risks. This omission goes against the legally mandated obligation to protect children's data online.",

                "changed_text": "(h) Limitation of Actions: Legal actions brought by Licensee under this Agreement must be commenced as soon as reasonably possible.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the 'Limitation of Actions' clause by replacing a specific 12-month timeframe with an ambiguous 'as soon as reasonably possible.' This omission can be problematic because the statute of limitations is often defined by law, and this vague requirement might be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent the standard legal timeframe, creating legal uncertainty.",

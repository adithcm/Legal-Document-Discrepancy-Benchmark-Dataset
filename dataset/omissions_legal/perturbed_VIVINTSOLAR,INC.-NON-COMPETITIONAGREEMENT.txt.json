Definitions. Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Amendment will have the meaning set forth for that term in the Non-Competition Agreement or the Master Framework Agreement, dated September 30, 2016, by and between the Parties (the \"Master Framework Agreement\").\n\n2. Non-Competition. Section 2 of the Non-Competition Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and the other provisions of the Non-Competition Agreement that relate to such Section 2, including, without limitation, Sections 5 and 6, shall be amended hereby to delete the applicable references, and provisions solely applicable to, Section 2, mutatis mutandis.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'the other provisions of the Non-Competition Agreement that relate to such Section 2, including, without limitation, Sections 5 and 6, shall be amended hereby to delete the applicable references, and provisions solely applicable to, Section 2, mutatis mutandis,' the contract introduces ambiguity regarding the enforceability and scope of the non-competition clauses. Many states, including Delaware (where Vivint Solar is incorporated) and Utah (where Vivint is incorporated), require specific and clearly defined non-competition agreements to be legally enforceable. This omission creates a legal risk because it can be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent state laws requiring clarity in non-compete agreements, potentially making the entire agreement unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Section 6 (Miscellaneous) of the Master Framework Agreement, the contract omits potentially important provisions related to governing law, dispute resolution, and other standard contractual terms. These miscellaneous provisions often include clauses that protect employees and ensure fair legal processes. Omitting this can introduce a legal contradiction if the miscellaneous section contains mandatory clauses under Delaware or Utah law that dictate how disputes must be handled or what law governs the agreement.",

                "original_text": "The Company will defend, at its expense, any action brought --------- against MBE and its directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, assigns or franchisees (\"Indemnitees\") based upon a claim that the Service used properly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Subscription Agreement infringes a U.S. patent or copyright or misappropriates a trade secret under U.S. law (a \"Claim\"). The Company further agrees to pay all damages and costs (including reasonable attorneys' fee and expert witness fees) incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with such Claim. The Company shall have sole control of any such action or settlement negotiations. Without the consent of MBE, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Company shall not settle any such Claim in a manner that (i) imposes damages or costs on any Indemnitee not covered by the Company hereunder or (b) imposes any injunctive or other non-monetary relief on any Indemnitee. MBE shall notify the Company promptly in writing of each such Claim and gives the Company all authority, information and assistance, at the Company's expense, reasonably necessary to settle or defend such claim.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will defend, at its discretion, any action brought --------- against MBE and its directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, assigns or franchisees (\"Indemnitees\") based upon a claim that the Service used properly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Subscription Agreement infringes a patent or copyright or misappropriates a trade secret under law (a \"Claim\"). The Company agrees to pay damages and costs incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with such Claim if the Company deems it necessary. The Company shall have control of any action or settlement negotiations. The Company shall settle any such Claim in a manner that imposes damages or costs on any Indemnitee. MBE shall notify the Company of each such Claim and gives the Company all authority, information and assistance necessary to settle or defend such claim.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'at its expense' to 'at its discretion', removing the U.S. patent/copyright and trade secret, and removing 'reasonable' and other conditions for the claim, the contract now weakens the indemnification obligations, reducing the consumer rights that provide a legal loophole for businesses seeking to avoid responsibility for damages. This omission contradicts the standard indemnification practices required by California law, where MBE is incorporated, making the contract non-compliant.",

                "explanation": "By removing the exception 'EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES STATED ABOVE' and 'ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS', the new text eliminates all warranties whatsoever, including those expressly stated, violating consumer protection laws. This introduces a legal contradiction because the original contract had some protection but in the modification, removing all warranty protections violates California's implied warranty laws.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from California to Delaware can be a legal contradiction because California has robust consumer protection laws. Delaware is more corporate-friendly. This change can disadvantage the MBE franchisees, potentially violating their rights under California franchise laws.",

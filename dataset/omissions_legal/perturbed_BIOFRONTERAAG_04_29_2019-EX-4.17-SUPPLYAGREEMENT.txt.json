                "original_text": "2.6 Acceptance / Rejection of Products.\n2.6.1 All Products shall be submitted to inspection and evaluation by or on behalf of CUTANEA to determine whether or not said Products meet the Specifications. CUTANEA will provide in good faith written acceptance of a batch of Product or written notification of any deficiencies within two (2) Business Days after receipt of the Certificate of Analysis for the Product batch. Written acceptance of a batch of the applicable Product is required as a condition to the delivery of Product to Cutanea's designated shipping agent in accordance with Section 3. If for any reason Supplier does not receive any such notification within such two (2) Business Day period, Supplier will promptly notify CUTANEA of such fact and CUTANEA will as soon as practicable and, in any event within another two (2) Business Days thereafter provide such written notice to Supplier and be responsible for any storage or similar charges that Supplier may incur for not delivering such Product. The lack of reception of such written acceptance within the second two (2) Business Day period shall be deemed as the batch is accepted. If, once the Product is delivered, CUTANEA determines that there is any deficiency with respect to any Product, CUTANEA will notify Ferrer of such claim within fifteen (15) Business Days of delivery of the Products. Each such notice of rejection to Supplier shall specify in reasonable detail the ways in which the Product batch failed to meet Specifications. CUTANEA shall grant to Supplier (or its designee) the right to inspect or test said Product batch and dispute CUTANEA rejection according to the provisions provided in this Section 2.6. In the event that Supplier disagrees with CUTANEA's defective Product claim, the issue shall be submitted to a mutually agreed upon independent third party laboratory, whose decision shall be final and binding upon the Parties. The costs arising from the laboratory's intervention and the costs of the replaced Products (including return and destruction costs of the defective Products) shall be borne by the Party whose results were mistaken. As to any such Product batch which is determined to fail the Specifications (\"Rejected Product\"), CUTANEA shall have no obligation to pay for such Rejected Product and Supplier shall replace such Rejected Product as soon as possible and no later than ninety (90) days thereafter.",

                "explanation": "By removing the timeframe for CUTANEA to report deficiencies (two business days after receiving CoA and fifteen days after delivery), the contract fails to provide a reasonable and prompt mechanism for addressing non-conforming products. The removal of 'in good faith', 'reasonable detail', 'mutually agreed upon independent third party laboratory' significantly weakens the objectivity and fairness of the dispute resolution process. This omission negatively affects CUTANEA's ability to ensure product quality and promptly address issues. Additionally, this section no longer provides a deadline for supplier replacement of rejected products. This introduces a legal risk, as it may violate implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, which require prompt resolution of quality issues. The applicable law is the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), specifically sections related to rejection of goods and implied warranties.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the phrase \"INCLUDING ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\" the contract attempts to disclaim implied warranties that are often legally protected under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code). While disclaimers are possible, they must be conspicuous and unambiguous. Completely removing the mention of these specific warranties creates ambiguity and a higher risk that a court would find the disclaimer unenforceable, thus exposing the Supplier to potential liability for breaches of these implied warranties under New York law, which governs the contract according to Section 12.5. This creates a legal contradiction and puts Cutanea at risk.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirements for specific types of insurance coverage (Product Recall, Bodily Injury, and Property Damage Insurance) and the minimum coverage limits ($[***] per occurrence and $[***] in the aggregate annually) significantly weakens the insurance protection for both parties. Also, the removal of requirement for A.M. Best rating of A for the insurance carriers eliminates an important quality control measure for the insurers' financial stability. This introduces a legal risk because, in the event of a product recall or liability claim, the actual insurance coverage might be inadequate to cover the costs, potentially leading to breaches of contract and legal disputes. Depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the product, there may be implied requirements for adequate insurance coverage to protect consumers and third parties. This omission creates a potential contradiction with implied duties of reasonable care and product safety.",

Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, marketing, and promotion of the business and shall notify Licensor of any action that must be taken by Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",

Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall use reasonable efforts to comply with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, marketing, and promotion of the business and shall notify Licensor of any action that must be taken by Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'use reasonable efforts' weakens the Licensee's obligation to comply with all applicable laws. Depending on the jurisdiction (Maryland and New York are referenced), this may contradict laws requiring strict compliance in certain business operations, particularly in investment management where fiduciary duties are involved. States may have specific laws mandating absolute compliance with certain regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates securities laws and regulations in Maryland and New York requiring strict compliance and fiduciary duty regarding investment management, marketing, and promotion.",

                "explanation": "The omission of 'including without limitation any Third Party Claim' suggests that Licensor may consider indemnification for claims outside of Third Party Claim. This creates a ambiguity concerning liability and the absence of indemnification for third-party claims related to IP infringement can violate regulations around trademark use in the territory.",

While New York law is specified, removing the explicit consent to jurisdiction allows for arguments regarding venue, forum non conveniens, etc. This contradicts common business practices and regulations around contracts which should have a dispute resolution measure. This makes it non-compliant.",

                "changed_text": "The Corporation represents, warrants and covenants to the Agents, and acknowledges that the Agents are relying upon such representations, warranties and covenants, that: (d) the Corporation has made reasonable efforts to conduct its business in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The Corporation believes it generally adheres to federal, national, provincial, municipal, and local environmental anti-pollution and licensing laws, regulations and other lawful requirements of any governmental or regulatory body. The Corporation aims to maintain valid licenses, registrations, and qualifications in jurisdictions where it operates, though specific compliance may vary. The Corporation has not received a definitive notice of non-compliance that is currently unresolved, but acknowledges the possibility of potential non-compliance issues that may or may not have a Material Adverse Effect.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the Corporation 'has conducted its business in compliance, in all material respects' with all applicable laws and regulations. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating the Corporation 'has made reasonable efforts to comply' and 'believes it generally adheres' which weakens the assurance of full compliance. The insertion of 'specific compliance may vary' directly contradicts the original statement, potentially misleading investors about the Corporation’s regulatory adherence. This introduces ambiguity and makes it difficult to enforce the initial compliance obligation, especially concerning environmental regulations.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear representation that, except as disclosed, no person has any existing agreement or option for the purchase of the Corporation's unissued shares or securities. The modified text adds uncertainty by limiting the statement to the Corporation’s 'current awareness' and stating that 'potential claims may exist'. This ambiguity weakens the warranty, as undisclosed agreements or options could later emerge, affecting the value of the offered shares. By including 'potential claims may exist', there is an ambiguous out that contradicts securities laws about material information.",

                "original_text": "The Corporation agrees that all terms and conditions in Section 9 shall be construed as conditions and complied with so far as they relate to acts to be performed or caused to be performed by it, that it will use its best efforts to cause such conditions to be complied with, and that any breach or failure by the Corporation to comply with any such conditions shall entitle any of the Agents, in accordance with Section 10(e), to terminate its obligations under this Agreement by written notice to that effect given to the Corporation any time at or prior to the Closing Time, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Corporation acknowledges that the terms and conditions in Section 9 should be generally considered, and the Corporation intends to try to comply with these conditions as they relate to its performance. However, the Corporation's actual compliance is subject to reasonable interpretation. Any significant breach or failure by the Corporation to comply with such conditions will be reviewed, and the Agents may then consider the possibility of terminating their obligations under this Agreement, contingent upon further discussions.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the Corporation 'agrees that all terms and conditions in Section 9 shall be complied with' and that any failure to comply entitles the Agents to terminate the agreement. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that conditions 'should be generally considered' and compliance is 'subject to reasonable interpretation.' Replacing 'any breach' with 'significant breach' and making the Agent's right to terminate contingent on 'further discussions' weakens the enforceability of the conditions. This ambiguous wording contradicts the original intent of strict compliance, making it difficult to hold the Corporation accountable for meeting specific conditions under the agreement.",

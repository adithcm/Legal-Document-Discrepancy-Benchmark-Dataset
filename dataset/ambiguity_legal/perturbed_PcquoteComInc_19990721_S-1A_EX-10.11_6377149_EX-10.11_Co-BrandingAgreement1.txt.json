This introduces uncertainty about whether ABW is legally required to include the statements.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to field all' to 'will generally handle' weakens the obligation to provide customer support. Similarly, replacing 'If the support issue is of a complex nature that ABW is unable to solve' with 'If the support issue seems complex' introduces subjectivity and uncertainty. Finally, changing 'ABW may forward' to 'ABW might forward' makes forwarding calls discretionary, creating ambiguity in PCQ's support responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "Replacing the explicit standard of handling proprietary information 'in the same manner as PCQ deals with its own proprietary information and trade secrets' with the vague 'reasonable care, consistent with its general business practices' weakens the protection of ABW's confidential information.

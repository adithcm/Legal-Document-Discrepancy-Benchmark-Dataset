                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Employer will have and may exercise, except as limited hereinafter, all ownership rights in the Policies. The Employer will not take any action in dealing with the Insurer that would impair any right or interest of the Employee in the Policies.",
                "changed_text": "The Employer will generally have all ownership rights in the Policies. The Employer will endeavor not to take any action that would negatively impact the Employee's perceived rights or interests in the Policies.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will have and may exercise' with 'will generally have' and 'will not take any action that would impair' with 'will endeavor not to take any action that would negatively impact' introduces ambiguity. 'Generally' and 'endeavor' soften the commitment, making it less legally binding and allowing for subjective interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - Pennsylvania law requires clear and unambiguous contractual obligations. This change creates a loophole allowing the Employer to potentially infringe on Employee's rights, conflicting with the principle of good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts under Pennsylvania law.",

                "changed_text": "The Employer will attempt to provide to the \"Insurer\" a written statement indicating the estimated amount of each policy's proceeds the Employee's beneficiary may be entitled to receive.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will provide' with 'will attempt to provide' makes the obligation non-mandatory. Furthermore, changing 'the amount' to 'the estimated amount' and 'is entitled to receive' to 'may be entitled to receive' introduces uncertainty about the accuracy and enforceability of the statement, making the beneficiary's claim process ambiguous.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pennsylvania Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code - This code dictates the clarity and accuracy of claims against estates and insurance policies. The ambiguity introduced contradicts the law by potentially delaying or complicating the beneficiary's claim, creating disputes over the proceeds.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement will generally be interpreted in accordance with principles derived from the laws of the State of Pennsylvania.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will be governed by the laws' to 'will generally be interpreted in accordance with principles derived from the laws' introduces significant ambiguity. It suggests that Pennsylvania law is only a guideline and not strictly binding, which could lead to disputes over which legal standards apply. The term 'principles derived' is open to broad interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Choice of Law Principles - Pennsylvania law requires that choice of law clauses be honored and enforced as written. By introducing the term 'principles derived', this change undermines the certainty and predictability of the choice of law clause, making it difficult to determine which laws apply and potentially violating Pennsylvania's established legal principles on contract interpretation and enforcement.",

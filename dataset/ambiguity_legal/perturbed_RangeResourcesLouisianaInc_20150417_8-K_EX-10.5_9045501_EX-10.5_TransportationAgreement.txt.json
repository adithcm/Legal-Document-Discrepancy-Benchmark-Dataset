                "original_text": "Shipper hereby agrees, upon written request by Carrier provided at least ten (10) days prior to the deadline for such action: (a) to not object to Carrier's applications for necessary certificates, approvals, authorizations and permits of the FERC and Louisiana regulating bodies, if any, in relation to the System; (b) to not object to the Tariff rates calculated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and not take any action directly or indirectly that could be interpreted as evidence of Shipper's lack of support for such Tariff rates; and (c) to not object to the pro forma Tariff materially in the form attached as Exhibit A, in any and all regulatory proceedings relating thereto and not take any action or inaction that could be interpreted as evidence of Shipper's lack of support therefor; provided that nothing in the foregoing shall obligate Shipper to support future changes to the Tariff rates that are inconsistent with this Agreement, or prevent Shipper from opposing any position taken by Carrier before FERC and/or Louisiana regulating bodies that is inconsistent with this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Shipper shall endeavor, upon reasonable request by Carrier, to generally support Carrier's applications for certificates, approvals, authorizations and permits from FERC and Louisiana regulatory bodies related to the System. Shipper will aim to avoid actions directly contradicting Carrier's tariff rates, to the extent practical. Shipper will also generally support the pro forma Tariff attached as Exhibit A in regulatory proceedings; however, Shipper retains the right to independently assess future tariff changes and Carrier's positions before FERC and Louisiana regulatory bodies.",
                "explanation": "The original text places a clear obligation on the shipper to support the carrier's regulatory filings. The modified text weakens this obligation by using terms like 'endeavor,' 'generally support,' and 'aim to avoid,' making the support discretionary rather than mandatory. This shift introduces ambiguity regarding the shipper's actual commitment to supporting the carrier's regulatory efforts.",
                "contradicted_law": "FERC regulations require transparency and non-obstruction in regulatory processes. The ambiguous language could enable the shipper to undermine the carrier's filings without directly violating the agreement, potentially hindering the regulatory process and conflicting with the spirit of regulatory cooperation expected by FERC.",

                "original_text": "The System will be operated as a common carrier pipeline, and Shipper's rights hereunder shall be subject to all laws related to and governing the operation of common carrier pipelines, including, without limitation, laws and regulations that prevent discrimination in favor of any given shipper or the provision of service for consideration other than the rate set forth in a published tariff. The Tariff shall apply to the Services provided hereunder, and if there is a conflict between a provision of this Agreement and the Tariff, the Tariff shall apply. Carrier reserves the right to modify or amend the Tariff, in its sole discretion, as it deems necessary; provided, however, any such modification or amendment shall be consistent with this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The System will be operated in a manner generally consistent with common carrier pipeline practices. Shipper's rights are subject to applicable laws, with certain exceptions as reasonably determined by Carrier. The Tariff shall generally apply to the Services provided hereunder, with some flexibility for deviation based on Carrier's operational needs. Carrier reserves the right to modify or amend the Tariff, as it deems appropriate, provided that such modifications are not fundamentally inconsistent with the overarching intent of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the System will be operated as a common carrier pipeline subject to all applicable laws. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating the System will be operated 'in a manner generally consistent' and rights are subject to laws 'with certain exceptions as reasonably determined by Carrier.' This weakens the legal obligation by allowing the Carrier to deviate from standard common carrier practices, and gives Carrier the discretion to decide how the laws would be applied. The term 'fundamentally inconsistent' is vague and doesn't provide any defined standard for compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal law mandates strict adherence to common carrier obligations, including non-discrimination and adherence to published tariffs. This change creates uncertainty about whether the Carrier will fully comply with these obligations, potentially violating the Interstate Commerce Act and related regulations.",

                "original_text": "Shipper shall pay, or cause to be paid, all production, severance, gross receipts, ad valorem, and similar Taxes, and all surcharges, levied or imposed on it by any Governmental Authority with respect to Shipper Product. In the event Carrier is required to pay or remit any such Tax or surcharge owed by Shipper, Shipper shall reimburse Carrier for such Tax or surcharge pursuant to Carrier's invoice for the same. Shipper hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Carrier from and against any and all claims and losses arising out of or related to such Taxes or surcharges. This indemnity and defense obligation shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. Carrier shall be responsible for all Taxes or surcharges levied or imposed on it by any Governmental Authority with respect to the System and Carrier's other facilities, including without limitation, Carrier's gas processing plants.",
                "changed_text": "Shipper is generally expected to cover production, severance, gross receipts, ad valorem, and similar Taxes, and any related surcharges imposed by Governmental Authorities regarding Shipper Product. Should Carrier, for practical reasons, remit any of Shipper's tax obligations, Shipper will, upon reasonable request, consider reimbursing Carrier based on mutually agreed documentation. Shipper will make reasonable efforts to protect Carrier from potential claims and losses linked to these taxes, within available resources. This general understanding remains in effect beyond the termination of this Agreement. Carrier remains responsible for Taxes associated with the System and its facilities, to the extent legally required.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear legal obligation for the Shipper to pay all specified taxes and indemnify the Carrier against related claims. The modified text weakens this obligation by using vague and discretionary terms such as 'generally expected,' 'for practical reasons,' 'upon reasonable request, consider reimbursing,' 'make reasonable efforts,' and 'within available resources.' These changes introduce ambiguity, making the Shipper's tax obligations and indemnity less enforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "State and federal tax laws require the responsible party to pay all applicable taxes. By making the obligation discretionary, the modified text could potentially conflict with these laws, leading to disputes over tax liabilities and non-compliance with tax regulations.",

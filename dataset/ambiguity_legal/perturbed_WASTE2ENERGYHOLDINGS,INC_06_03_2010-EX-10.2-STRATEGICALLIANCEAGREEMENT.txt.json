                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use reasonable endeavours' to 'may consider using endeavours' weakens the obligation to promote and market the other party's capabilities. This makes the marketing cooperation discretionary rather than mandatory. Using 'consider' instead of 'use' will introduce ambiguity and potentially be challenged.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees that it will use reasonable endeavours' with 'hopes to procure' significantly weakens W2E's commitment to include SHBV products. 'Hopes to' implies a desire rather than a binding obligation, making it easier for W2E to justify not including SHBV products. In English law, contractual obligations must be clear and not based on wishful thinking.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to negotiate in good faith' to 'intends to negotiate' and 'use its reasonable endeavours' to 'try to enter into' weakens the commitment to actually finalize the Manufacturing Agreement. 'Intends' and 'try' suggest a lack of firm commitment and open the door to claims that the party did not truly attempt to finalize the agreement, which impacts the rest of the obligations.",

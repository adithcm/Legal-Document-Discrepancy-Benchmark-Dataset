                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Supplier shall be responsible for Manufacturing the Product in compliance with Applicable Law, cGMP Requirements and the standards of any other applicable governmental or regulatory authority. Each Party will provide reasonable assistance to the other, at no charge, if necessary to respond to audits, inspections, inquiries, or requests of any Applicable Regulatory Authority.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier will endeavor to Manufacture the Product in general accordance with Applicable Law, cGMP Requirements and the standards of any other applicable governmental or regulatory authority. Each Party may consider providing assistance to the other, potentially at a charge, if it seems beneficial to respond to audits, inspections, inquiries, or requests of any Applicable Regulatory Authority.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation to comply with laws and regulatory standards by replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'will endeavor,' making compliance discretionary. It also introduces uncertainty regarding assistance during audits by replacing 'will provide reasonable assistance...at no charge' with 'may consider providing assistance...potentially at a charge.' This could lead to non-compliance with FDA regulations or equivalent regulatory bodies if the supplier does not fully meet regulatory standards or provide necessary support during inspections.",

                "changed_text": "Supplier will keep some books and records and retention samples that it believes are generally sufficient with regards to cGMP Requirements and other Applicable Law, in respect of test records, samples and associated support data for all batches of Product Manufactured by Supplier to generally show Supplier's duties and obligations under this Agreement for a period it deems appropriate from the expiration date of the respective Product batch.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall maintain adequate books and records' with 'will keep some books and records...that it believes are generally sufficient'. Also, the time for records to be kept is replaced with 'for a period it deems appropriate from the expiration date of the respective Product batch'. This contradicts FDA requirements, which mandate that the supplier maintain detailed and accessible records to guarantee the quality and purity of pharmaceutical products.",

Supplier shall make available to Customer all relevant records and reports and Customer shall have the right to copy all Product related records and reports. The frequency of such audits as well as the response time with respect to audit findings shall be governed by the Quality Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier will consider allowing monitoring of the Facilities as generally described in Section 3.6 and inspections or audits as generally outlined in the Quality Agreement. Supplier may, to the extent it is convenient, make available to Customer records and reports it deems relevant, and Customer might be allowed to copy some Product-related records and reports. The frequency of such audits, as well as the response time with respect to audit findings, might be considered in accordance with the Quality Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens Customer's right to monitor facilities and access records by replacing 'shall allow monitoring' with 'will consider allowing monitoring,' 'shall make available' with 'may, to the extent it is convenient, make available,' and 'Customer shall have the right to copy' with 'Customer might be allowed to copy.' The term 'might be considered' introduces ambiguity and weakens the enforceability of audit frequency and response times. This contradicts FDA regulations, which provide the FDA and, by extension, the contract giver, the right to inspect and audit facilities to ensure compliance.",

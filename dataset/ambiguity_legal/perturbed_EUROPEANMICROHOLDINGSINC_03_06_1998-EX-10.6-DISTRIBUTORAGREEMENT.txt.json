                "original_text": "Distributor will place orders for the Product from WGT by completing, signing and submitting to WGT a written order for the same, in a form acceptable to WGT, via facsimile, mail or other means. Distributor shall submit such order at least thirty (30) days in advance of the delivery date set forth in each order. All orders will be subject to acceptance by WGT through written acceptance or shipment of the Product subject to the order.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor may place orders for the Product from WGT by submitting a written order in a generally acceptable form. Distributor should endeavor to submit orders reasonably in advance of the desired delivery date. Orders are typically subject to acceptance by WGT.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to place orders in a specific manner and timeframe. Replacing 'will' with 'may' and 'shall' with 'should endeavor' makes the process discretionary rather than mandatory. The 'generally acceptable form' is vague, and the 'typically subject to acceptance' is uncertain, leaving WGT's obligation to fulfill orders ambiguous.",

                "original_text": "Distributor will use its best efforts aggressively to develop sales of the Product in the Territory. In furtherance thereof, Distributor will:\n\n(a)  keep on hand a reasonable inventory of the Product sufficient to allow for\nprompt delivery of the Product to resellers;\n\n(b)  establish a program to market the Product, including, but not limited to,\nparticipating regularly in local and regional trade shows, conventions or\nlike events in the Territory, and conducting regular local promotional and\nother marketing efforts for the Product;\n\n(c)  provide quality product support to resellers, including, but not limited\nto, providing appropriate installation and application advice and prompt\nfollow-up service and advice to resellers of the Product upon request;",
                "changed_text": "Distributor should try to develop sales of the Product in the Territory. In furtherance thereof, Distributor may:\n\n(a)  keep some inventory of the Product to facilitate delivery to resellers;\n\n(b)  consider marketing the Product through various channels, such as trade shows, conventions, or other promotional activities;\n\n(c)  offer general product support to resellers, including installation advice and follow-up service as needed.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the distributor's obligations. 'Will use its best efforts aggressively' is replaced with 'should try to develop sales,' reducing the commitment level. The mandatory actions in (a), (b), and (c) are made optional by changing 'will' to 'may' and using vague language like 'some inventory,' 'consider marketing,' and 'general product support.' This creates ambiguity regarding the expected level of effort and investment, conflicting with standard business expectations for distribution agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract; Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), contracts require a good-faith effort and reasonable diligence in performance. The 'should try' language might fall short of this requirement.",

                "original_text": "WGT will defend and indemnify Distributor against any\njudicial proceeding based upon infringement of any U.S. patent or US.\ncopyright by the Product to the extent that such proceeding arises from or\nin connection with a component of the Product manufactured or developed by\nWGT and not any third party, provided that Distributor notifies WGT of such\nproceeding promptly after Distributor receives notice thereof, WGT has\ncontrol over the defense and settlement of the proceeding, Distributor\nprovides such assistance in the defense and settlement of the proceeding as\nWGT may reasonably request, and Distributor complies with any settlement or\ncourt order made in connection with such proceeding (e.g., as to the future\nuse of any infringing Product). WGT's obligations under this paragraph will\nnot apply to any infringement to the extent arising out of any use or\ncombination of the Product with any other products, goods, services or\nother items furnished by Distributor or anyone other than WGT or to any\nmodification or change of the Product not made by WGT.",

This consideration is contingent upon WGT's assessment of the situation. WGT's obligations under this paragraph may not apply to any infringement.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a seemingly clear obligation for WGT to defend and indemnify the Distributor in cases of patent or copyright infringement. This is changed to a discretionary 'may consider' with the addition of 'WGT's assessment of the situation,' and the complete disclaimer of obligations. This makes WGT's responsibility entirely subjective and unenforceable. The lack of a clear indemnification obligation leaves the Distributor vulnerable to potentially significant legal liabilities without recourse.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract; Good Faith and Fair Dealing. Even without explicit indemnification, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under US contract law requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in their contractual dealings. Giving oneself complete discretion to avoid a seemingly clear obligation could violate this covenant.",

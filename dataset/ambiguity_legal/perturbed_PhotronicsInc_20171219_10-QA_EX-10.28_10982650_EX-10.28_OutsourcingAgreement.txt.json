The Suppliers shall notify the Company of acceptance or rejection of a [***]within [***]hours of receipt of a [***]. Failure of the Suppliers to accept or reject a [***]within [***]hours shall constitute acceptance of such [***].",
                "changed_text": "The Suppliers will use reasonable endeavors to consider all [***]from the Company, taking into account whether they generally align with this Agreement and the Product specifications. The Suppliers will endeavor to inform the Company of their intentions regarding acceptance or rejection of a [***] within a commercially reasonable timeframe of receipt of a [***]. The passage of a considerable amount of time following receipt of a [***] shall be interpreted as tacit acceptance of such [***].",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'make good faith efforts' with 'use reasonable endeavors' introduces ambiguity, as 'reasonable endeavors' is a subjective term. Similarly, replacing 'shall notify...within [***] hours' with 'endeavor to inform...within a commercially reasonable timeframe' makes the notification deadline vague and unenforceable. The concept of 'considerable amount of time' being interpreted as tacit acceptance is open to interpretation and dispute.",

Suppliers shall be responsible for paying freight, handling, shipping and/or insurance charges to the delivery point in accordance with the Delivery Term.",

If the Company neglects to provide comprehensive shipping instructions, the Suppliers may select a carrier as they see fit. Suppliers will generally bear the primary responsibility for freight, handling, shipping and/or insurance charges to the delivery point in accordance with the Delivery Term, unless otherwise agreed.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall deliver' with 'will aim to deliver' weakens the obligation. Changing 'If the Company does not provide shipping instructions, the Suppliers will select the carrier on a commercially reasonable basis' to 'If the Company neglects to provide comprehensive shipping instructions, the Suppliers may select a carrier as they see fit' introduces subjectivity. Adding 'unless otherwise agreed' to the payment responsibility introduces uncertainty and allows for potential disputes about who pays for shipping.",

This warranty does not apply to any Product failures resulting from misuse, storage in or exposure to environmental conditions inconsistent with those specified in the applicable specifications or documentation, modification of the Product by anyone other than the relevant Supplier. If a Product fails to comply with the foregoing warranty, the relevant Supplier shall, at its option, either [***]such Product, or, in the event the foregoing options are not commercially practicable, [***]to the Company any amounts paid for the applicable Product.",

This assurance may not cover Product anomalies stemming from inappropriate use, storage in unsuitable conditions, or alterations not performed by the Supplier. Should a Product exhibit discrepancies, the Supplier may consider [***]such Product, or potentially [***] a portion of the payment received, depending on the circumstances.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'warrants that the Products shall comply' with 'offers an assurance that the Products will generally conform' significantly weakens the warranty. Adding 'to the extent they are deemed applicable' makes the specifications themselves uncertain. Replacing 'Supplier shall, at its option, either [***] such Product' with 'Supplier may consider [***] such Product' makes the remedy discretionary rather than obligatory. Removing the phrase 'amounts paid for the applicable product' in favor of 'a portion of the payment received' adds ambiguity.",

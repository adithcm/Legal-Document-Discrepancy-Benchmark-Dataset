                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "ANTHEMIC shall provide to Sponsor space for a VNUE activation on the 3rd Floor at Virgin Hotel (the \"Sponsor area\"). This space will be roughly 10 feet by 10 feet (100 square feet).",
                "changed_text": "ANTHEMIC will attempt to provide space for a VNUE activation on the 3rd Floor at Virgin Hotel (the \"Sponsor area\"). The provided space is expected to be in the neighborhood of 10 feet by 10 feet (100 square feet).",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall provide' to 'will attempt to provide' makes the obligation to provide space uncertain. Replacing 'will be' with 'is expected to be' introduces ambiguity regarding the size of the space, which may not meet the Sponsor's needs, potentially leading to a breach of contract. This contradicts general contract law principles requiring clarity and certainty in agreements.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'if time permits' makes the agreement on the specific amount of marketing materials discretionary, potentially depriving the Sponsor of a key promotional opportunity. This contradicts the intended purpose of the sponsorship agreement.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'agree to introduce' with 'should consider introducing' weakens the commitment to make introductions. This introduces ambiguity about whether ANTHEMIC or Flood Magazine is actually required to fulfill this obligation, and under what circumstances they might choose not to. This contradicts principles of contract law, where the obligations of the parties should be clearly defined.",

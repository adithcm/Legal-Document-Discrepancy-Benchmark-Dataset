                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each party hereto shall do and perform or cause to be done and performed all further acts and shall execute and deliver all other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents as any other party hereto reasonably may request in order to carry out the intent and accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.",
                "changed_text": "Each party hereto should endeavor to perform further acts and may execute and deliver other agreements, certificates, instruments, and documents as any other party hereto might request to generally align with the intent of this Agreement and the transactions it contemplates.",
                "explanation": "The modification from 'shall' to 'should endeavor' and 'may execute' weakens the obligation, making it discretionary rather than mandatory. The phrase 'generally align' introduces ambiguity about the level of commitment required, contradicting the original intent for full and specific performance.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and definite obligations for enforceability; this ambiguity makes specific performance difficult, potentially violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "All notices and other communications hereunder should ideally be in writing and may be considered given if delivered through reasonable means, such as personal delivery or email.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces specific delivery methods with vague terms like 'should ideally be in writing' and 'reasonable means.' The removal of detailed instructions on how notice is properly served introduces ambiguity. This is especially problematic considering email does not guarantee receipt or confirmation, and the lack of clarity contradicts general principles of contract law that require definite terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Principles of contract law requiring clear and unambiguous terms, especially regarding notice, which is critical for triggering obligations and deadlines. Lack of clarity can lead to disputes over whether notice was properly given, undermining the contract's enforceability.",

                "original_text": "The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedies to which they are entitled at law or equity.",
                "changed_text": "The parties acknowledge that potential damage could occur if the agreement's provisions are not adequately followed. Consequently, the parties may consider seeking remedies for any potential breach, subject to mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'irreparable damage would occur' to 'potential damage could occur' significantly weakens the acknowledgment of harm. Replacing 'shall be entitled to seek specific performance' with 'may consider seeking remedies, subject to mutual agreement' introduces a discretionary element, making specific performance uncertain. This conflicts with the standard legal understanding that specific performance is available for unique contracts where monetary damages are inadequate. By making remedies subject to mutual agreement, it allows a breaching party to potentially avoid their obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding remedies for breach, particularly specific performance, which is typically available when monetary damages are insufficient. This clause introduces uncertainty about access to such remedies, potentially violating the principle of providing adequate redress for breach of contract.",

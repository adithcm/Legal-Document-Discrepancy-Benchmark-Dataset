                "explanation": "Replacing the fixed expiration date 'March 31, 2008' with 'a date mutually agreed upon in good faith' introduces ambiguity.

This change makes it ambiguous as to which aspects of the original agreement remain valid, contradicting the contractual law which needs definite obligations.",

                "explanation": "The statement 'accept and agree to all of the terms and conditions hereof' has been modified to 'may accept and generally agree to the spirit of the terms and conditions hereof.' Replacing 'accept and agree' with 'may accept and generally agree to the spirit' introduces ambiguity regarding the parties' actual commitment to the contract's specific terms.

                "changed_text": "Service Provider will endeavor to provide operation support services (the \"Services\") to Service Recipient: (1) Academic Support Services\n\nService Provider, having a team for research and development in courses and teaching methods, will attempt to provide Service Recipient with academic supports, potentially including teaching skills, operation guidance for teachers, codes of conduct and staff training, to possibly meet the needs of Service Recipient for academic support in its operations.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall provide' to 'will endeavor to provide' and 'will provide' to 'will attempt to provide', the obligation of the service provider is weakened, creating ambiguity as to the level and quality of support required. The word 'potentially' and 'possibly' makes the services subjective, thus allowing the service provider to avoid providing all the support if they deem it unnecessary. This contradicts Chinese Contract Law (中华人民共和国合同法), which requires clear and definite terms in contracts to ensure enforceability and protect the rights of the service recipient. Under Article 12 of the Chinese Contract Law, the contract is required to include definite terms for it to be considered a valid agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' makes the payment method optional rather than mandatory. The phrase 'if such an account is specified' introduces further ambiguity, allowing the service recipient to argue that payment is not required if no account is actively specified. This could be considered a violation of Article 62 of the Chinese Contract Law, which states that if the terms of a contract are ambiguous, the parties should negotiate supplementary agreements. If they fail to reach a consensus, the payment method should follow general transaction practices.",

If a dispute cannot be reasonably resolved through such consultation, either party might consider submitting such dispute to the Beijing Arbitration Commission (\"BAC\") for arbitration according to BAC's procedures. Whether the arbitral award is binding upon the Parties shall be subject to mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall seek' to 'may attempt,' the obligation to resolve disputes through friendly consultation is weakened. Changing 'shall be submitted' to 'might consider submitting' makes arbitration optional. The addition of 'Whether the arbitral award is binding upon the Parties shall be subject to mutual agreement' directly contradicts the purpose of arbitration, which is to provide a final and binding resolution. This violates the Chinese Arbitration Law (中华人民共和国仲裁法), specifically Article 9, which states that arbitration agreements are legally binding, and Article 54, which stipulates that arbitral awards are legally binding and enforceable.",

Parties shall at all times fully comply with all relevant regulations, such as but not limited to, the obligation for ELEPHANT TALK - as providers of public electronic communications services in the Netherlands- to notify OPTA according to article 2.1 of the Dutch Telecommunication Act.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall at all times fully comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply' introduces ambiguity. While the original text mandated strict adherence to regulations, the modified text suggests that compliance is subject to effort, potentially falling short of full compliance. This contradicts the strict regulatory requirements of Dutch and EU telecommunications law, which often require mandatory and verifiable compliance.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'acknowledge their intent to adhere' and 'undertakes to process' with 'will attempt to process' weakens the legally binding nature of data privacy obligations. Data protection laws such as the Dutch Data Protection Act require strict compliance. Introducing 'intent' and 'attempt' makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory, potentially violating these laws.",

If such a claim is valid, ELEPHANT TALK shall make the modifications needed to cease the infringement at its own expense as soon as possible.

If a claim appears valid, ELEPHANT TALK will consider making modifications to cease the infringement. ELEPHANT TALK will inform T-Mobile of any such considerations when practical.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to defend and indemnify T-Mobile against IP infringement claims. Replacing 'will defend, indemnify and will hold harmless' with 'will endeavor to defend, indemnify and hold harmless' makes the obligation less certain. Also 'shall make the modifications needed to cease the infringement at its own expense as soon as possible' becomes 'will consider making modifications to cease the infringement', which is vague. These changes make the protection of T-Mobile's interests against IP claims less certain and enforceable.",

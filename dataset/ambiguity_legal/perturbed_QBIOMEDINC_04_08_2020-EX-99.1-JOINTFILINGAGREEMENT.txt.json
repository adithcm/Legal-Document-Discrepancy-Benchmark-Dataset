                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein and therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall endeavor to be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the general accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein and therein, but shall not be strictly responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to ensure timely filing and accurate information. Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'shall endeavor to be responsible' and 'general accuracy' introduces ambiguity and reduces the strictness of the requirement. Additionally, by stating they are 'not strictly responsible', this could be interpreted as a lower level of responsibility for completeness and accuracy than required by SEC regulations.",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the statement on Schedule 13G with respect to the equity securities of Q Biomed, Inc. is, and any amendment thereto signed by each of the undersigned may be, filed on behalf of each of the undersigned as deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be filed' to 'may be filed as deemed appropriate', the obligation to file the Schedule 13G and its amendments becomes discretionary, rather than mandatory. This contradicts the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'will ideally be included' introduces ambiguity by implying that including the Joint Filing Agreement as an exhibit is not a strict requirement, potentially conflicting with SEC guidelines on proper documentation.",

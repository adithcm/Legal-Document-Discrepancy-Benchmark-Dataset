                "original_text": "Bizzingo agrees that any use of the Property for advertising, promotional or sale purposes will be approved in advance by Theismann. Theismann  agrees that such material, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Bizzingo to have been approved hereunder if the same is  not disapproved by the Theismann in writing within fourteen (14) days after Theismann's receipt thereof. Theismann agrees that any material  submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Theismann shall advise Bizzingo in writing of the specific  grounds therefor at the time of disapproval and provide Bizzingo with specific changes or alterations to such materials. Bizzingo thereafter shall  have the right and privileged to use such Property as provided in this Agreement subject to such changes or alterations.",
                "changed_text": "Bizzingo may use the Property for advertising, promotional or sale purposes after seeking Theismann's feedback. Theismann agrees that such material, submitted for feedback as provided herein may be considered by Bizzingo to be unofficially endorsed if Theismann does not express significant concerns in writing within a reasonable timeframe after Theismann's receipt thereof. Theismann will endeavor not to arbitrarily disapprove any material and, if concerns exist, that Theismann will generally discuss the basis therefor and consider possible revisions. Bizzingo thereafter shall have the right and privileged to use such Property as provided in this Agreement subject to general considerations discussed.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates advance approval, providing a clear framework. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'approval' with 'feedback' and 'deemed approved' with 'unofficially endorsed'. The 14-day approval window becomes a 'reasonable timeframe', and 'specific grounds' are softened to 'generally discuss'. The 'shall' statements were changed to 'may' and 'will endeavor'. This creates uncertainty about what constitutes adequate feedback or disapproval, and what action must be taken after the discussion.",
                "contradicted_law": "Right of publicity laws which protect celebrities from unauthorized commercial use of their likeness. These laws emphasize the need for explicit consent, which is undermined by the ambiguous approval process.",

For any travel incurred by Theismann as part of his appearances, Bizzingo will provide first class air travel and hotel  accommodations.",
                "changed_text": "Bizzingo will generally cover Theismann's out-of-pocket expenses related to such appearances, with expenses potentially exceeding One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) per day subject to budgetary constraints. For any travel incurred by Theismann as part of his appearances, Bizzingo will arrange suitable travel and lodging.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines expense coverage ('all reasonable out of pocket expenses', 'not exceed $1,000', 'first class air travel'). The modified text replaces these with vague terms like 'generally cover', 'potentially exceeding', 'subject to budgetary constraints', and 'suitable travel and lodging'. This creates ambiguity regarding what expenses will be covered and what standards will be applied, leaving room for dispute and potentially conflicting with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principle of 'implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing'. The changes allow Bizzingo to potentially avoid paying legitimate expenses, contradicting the spirit of the agreement.",

                "original_text": "The Parties hereby agree that all disputes related to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration pursuant to  the rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association. Parties all consent to the jurisdiction of such courts, agree to accept service  of process by mail, and hereby waive any jurisdictional or venue defenses otherwise available to it",
                "changed_text": "The Parties may consider settling disputes related to this Agreement through informal arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution methods. Parties generally consent to the possibility of jurisdiction in relevant courts, and may consider accepting service of process by reasonable means, while potentially retaining some jurisdictional or venue defenses.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates arbitration with a clear process (AAA rules). The modified text weakens this by replacing 'shall be settled' with 'may consider settling', introducing the possibility of 'informal arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution methods'. The phrase 'generally consent to the possibility of jurisdiction' introduces uncertainty, and 'potentially retaining some jurisdictional or venue defenses' directly contradicts the original waiver. This ambiguity undermines the enforceability of the dispute resolution process.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which encourages the enforcement of valid arbitration agreements. The changes create uncertainty and weaken the commitment to arbitration.",

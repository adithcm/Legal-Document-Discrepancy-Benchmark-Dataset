                "original_text": "Upon and as of the date of acceptance of the Equipment by the Company and satisfaction of the conditions precedent provided for in the Lease: (a) Lessor shall be unconditionally obligated to purchase such Equipment pursuant to the terms of the applicable Purchase Order and to lease such Equipment to the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Lease and the applicable completed Schedule; and (b) the Company shall be unconditionally obligated to lease such Equipment from Lessor pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Lease and the applicable completed Schedule.",
                "changed_text": "Upon and as of the date of acceptance of the Equipment by the Company and satisfaction of the conditions precedent provided for in the Lease: (a) Lessor may be obligated to purchase such Equipment pursuant to the terms of the applicable Purchase Order and to lease such Equipment to the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Lease and the applicable completed Schedule; and (b) the Company shall endeavor to lease such Equipment from Lessor pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Lease and the applicable completed Schedule.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be unconditionally obligated' to 'may be obligated' and 'shall be unconditionally obligated' to 'shall endeavor to' introduces ambiguity regarding the obligation of both the Lessor and the Company. This weakens the binding nature of the agreement and makes it uncertain whether either party is actually required to proceed with the purchase or lease, creating a loophole for non-performance. Such ambiguity contradicts general contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms.",

                "original_text": "The Company shall maintain full and accurate books and records of all Equipment orders, receipts and All such books and records shall be maintained in a form acceptable to Lessor in its sole discretion. Such books and records shall be open for inspection and examination by Lessor and its respective representatives and/or accountants during the Company's normal business hours.",
                "changed_text": "The Company should keep books and records of Equipment orders and receipts. Such books and records should be maintained in a form that the Company considers appropriate. Access to these records will be provided at mutually convenient times.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall maintain full and accurate' with 'should keep', 'shall be maintained in a form acceptable to Lessor in its sole discretion' with 'should be maintained in a form that the Company considers appropriate' and 'shall be open for inspection and examination by Lessor...during the Company's normal business hours' with 'Access to these records will be provided at mutually convenient times' significantly weakens the obligation to maintain proper records and grant access to the Lessor. 'Should keep' is less mandatory than 'shall maintain'. Allowing the company to determine what is 'appropriate' for record keeping conflicts with the Lessor's right to audit and ensure compliance. The phrase 'mutually convenient times' diminishes the Lessor's guaranteed access during normal business hours, potentially obstructing oversight and violating standard accounting practices.",

Maximum Aggregate Capitalized Lessor's Cost:  $14,500,000.00\n\n2. Basic Term Lease Rate Factor:  To be mutually agreed upon by Company and Lessor\n\n3.

Maximum Aggregate Capitalized Lessor's Cost:  Approximately $14,500,000.00\n\n2. Basic Term Lease Rate Factor:  To be discussed between Company and Lessor\n\n3. Basic Term (No. of Months):  Subject to discussion between Company and Lessor\n\n4. Equipment Type:  Potentially determined by Company and Lessor",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall conform' to 'should generally align', adding 'approximately' to the cost, changing 'to be mutually agreed upon' to 'to be discussed' and 'subject to discussion', and changing 'To be mutually agreed upon' to 'potentially determined' weakens the mandatory nature of conforming to the economic terms. This makes the terms vague and uncertain. This ambiguity contradicts basic contract law, which requires definite terms, especially concerning price and quantity.",

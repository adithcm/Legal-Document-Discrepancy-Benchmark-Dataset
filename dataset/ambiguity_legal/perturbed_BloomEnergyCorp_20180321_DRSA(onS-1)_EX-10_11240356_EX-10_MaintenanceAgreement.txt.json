                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Operator shall ensure that all Facility components are operated and maintained in a manner designed to meet the Efficiency Warranty and the Power Performance Warranty with a goal of achieving the performance levels assumed in the Base Case Model (as defined in the Company LLC Agreement).",
                "changed_text": "Operator shall endeavor to operate and maintain Facility components in a generally acceptable manner, considering the Efficiency Warranty and Power Performance Warranty, while keeping in mind the performance levels outlined in the Base Case Model (as defined in the Company LLC Agreement).",
                "explanation": "The original text places a clear obligation on the Operator to operate and maintain facility components to meet specific warranty and performance levels. The modified text weakens this obligation by replacing 'shall ensure' with 'shall endeavor', introducing a subjective standard. The phrase 'generally acceptable manner' lacks a clear definition, allowing for varying interpretations of compliance. This weakens the Operator's responsibility and contradicts the objective performance standards required for renewable energy projects under Delaware law and related regulations.",

                "changed_text": "Prior to the Commencement of Operations for the first Bloom System in the Portfolio, Operator should consider adopting programs and procedures that might promote the safe and reliable operation of the Facilities.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates the adoption and implementation of programs and procedures to ensure safe and reliable operations. The modified text replaces 'shall have adopted and implemented' with 'should consider adopting', making the action optional. The term 'might promote' further weakens the obligation, making the effectiveness of the programs and procedures uncertain. This conflicts with standard safety regulations and industry best practices, potentially violating requirements for documented safety protocols under OSHA and related regulations.",

                "changed_text": "Operator will attempt to maintain and comply with most Permits that are typically needed to perform the Facility Services under this Agreement, within reasonable financial constraints.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Operator is responsible for maintaining and complying with ALL required permits. The modified text introduces ambiguity and limitation by stating 'will attempt to maintain and comply with most Permits,' making compliance discretionary. The phrase 'within reasonable financial constraints' creates a loophole, allowing the Operator to avoid permit requirements based on subjective financial considerations. This contradicts the legal obligation to have and maintain all required permits for operating energy facilities in Delaware, potentially violating environmental regulations and other legal requirements.",

                "original_text": "Each party will comply with all law and regulations applicable such party's performance under this Agreement, including but not limited to U.S. Export Administration laws and regulations and any other export, import and re-export control laws applicable to such party. The parties will refrain from exporting or re-exporting the Products or Product IP or any technical data or other materials received from each other, or the direct product of any of these, to any country, individual or organization proscribed by the United States government, unless properly authorized by the appropriate agencies of the United States government.",
                "changed_text": "Each party should endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations relevant to their performance under this Agreement, including U.S. Export Administration laws and regulations and other export, import, and re-export control laws. The parties will try to avoid exporting or re-exporting the Products or Product IP or any technical data or other materials received from each other, or the direct product of any of these, to any country, individual, or organization proscribed by the United States government, to the extent reasonably possible.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation by replacing 'will comply' with 'should endeavor to comply,' introducing uncertainty about the level of commitment required. 'Refrain' is replaced with 'try to avoid,' and 'unless properly authorized' is weakened by 'to the extent reasonably possible,' making compliance discretionary. This contradicts U.S. Export Administration Regulations, which require strict and mandatory compliance with export control laws.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'ENERGOUS will generally maintain' weakens the certainty that the Deposit Materials will be kept in escrow. Replacing 'ensure on a quarterly basis' with 'endeavor, as practical, to keep the information relating to the Deposit Materials reasonably up-to-date' makes the obligation of keeping the information current vague and subjective. Finally, including Product Updates is conditioned on 'as they deem fit.' This introduces ambiguity, contradicting the purpose of an escrow agreement, which requires specific and reliable maintenance.",

                "original_text": "In the event that ENERGOUS develops New Product, ENERGOUS will provide DIALOG with written notice describing the New Product before marketing, selling or distributing the New Product with or to any third party. Upon receipt of such notice, DIALOG will have [***] to notify ENERGOUS in writing that it desires to add such New Product as Product under this Agreement. If DIALOG provides such a notice, for a period of [***] following ENERGOUS' receipt of such notice, ENERGOUS and DIALOG will negotiate in good faith the terms pursuant to which such New Product will be added as a Product to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "If ENERGOUS contemplates developing a New Product, ENERGOUS may, at its discretion, provide DIALOG with some form of notice vaguely describing the potential New Product before broadly exploring the possibility of marketing, selling or distributing the New Product with or to any third party. Upon the potential receipt of such notice, DIALOG might have a period to perhaps notify ENERGOUS that it might desire to consider adding such New Product as a Product under this Agreement. If DIALOG perhaps provides such a notice, for a period following ENERGOUS' receipt of such notice, ENERGOUS and DIALOG could try to negotiate some terms pursuant to which such New Product may or may not be added as a Product to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change severely weakens ENERGOUS's obligation to inform DIALOG about new products. By using conditional language like 'contemplates,' 'may, at its discretion,' 'some form of notice vaguely describing,' 'broadly exploring,' 'might have a period,' 'perhaps notify,' 'might desire to consider,' 'could try,' and 'may or may not be added,' the original clear requirement for ENERGOUS to provide notice and negotiate in good faith is rendered highly uncertain and discretionary. This weakens the entire clause, allowing ENERGOUS to avoid its intended obligations regarding New Products. The original, while redacted, implies a specific timeframe and obligation that are now obscured. This potentially violates implied covenant of good faith.",

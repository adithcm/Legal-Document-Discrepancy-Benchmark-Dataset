                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "NTL shall make all reasonable efforts to perform in all material respects the obligations required to maintain the licenses for the NTL Technology in good standing for their respective terms. NTL shall not make any material change to the licenses for Nortel Technology without the consent of ETI, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "changed_text": "NTL should attempt to perform the obligations to maintain the licenses for the NTL Technology. NTL may make changes to the licenses for Nortel Technology as it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall make all reasonable efforts to perform' with 'should attempt to perform' makes the obligation non-mandatory. Replacing 'shall not make any material change without the consent of ETI, which shall not be unreasonably withheld' with 'may make changes as it deems appropriate' removes the requirement for ETI's consent and makes the decision entirely discretionary for NTL. This creates an ambiguous obligation regarding the maintenance and alteration of licenses.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring good faith and fair dealing in the performance of contractual obligations are undermined. The ambiguity also creates uncertainty regarding intellectual property rights, potentially conflicting with established legal precedents on licensing agreements.",

ETI shall pay to NTL the portion of all fees and charges paid by Nortel to obtain continuing rights to the NTL Technology that are reasonably attributable to Entrust's actual use of the NTL Technology.",
                "changed_text": "Entrust should endeavor to comply with its obligations under the licenses for the NTL Technology as much as possible. ETI will consider contributing to the fees and charges paid by Nortel, based on its perceived benefit from the NTL Technology.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply in all material respects' to 'should endeavor to comply as much as possible' weakens the obligation to comply with license terms, making it discretionary. Replacing 'ETI shall pay' with 'ETI will consider contributing' makes the payment obligation non-mandatory and dependent on ETI's subjective assessment of benefit. This creates ambiguity regarding Entrust's responsibilities under the licenses and payment obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring clear obligations for payment and adherence to license terms are violated. This ambiguity could also conflict with intellectual property laws protecting the rights of the licensor (NTL) by making enforcement of license terms difficult.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "For so long as ETI remains a Subsidiary of NTL, Entrust shall not take any action or enter into any commitment or agreement which may reasonably be anticipated based on notice from Nortel to result, with or without notice and with or without lapse of time or otherwise, in a contravention or event of default by any Nortel Entity of (i) any provisions of applicable law or regulation, (ii) any provision of NTL's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (iii) any credit agreement or other material instrument binding upon Nortel, or (iv) any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over Nortel or any of its assets.",
                "changed_text": "For so long as ETI remains a Subsidiary of NTL, Entrust will aim to avoid actions that Nortel believes might possibly lead to a contravention or default by any Nortel Entity of (i) provisions of law or regulation, (ii) NTL's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (iii) any credit agreement binding upon Nortel, or (iv) any judgment of any governmental body over Nortel's assets, based on Nortel's assessment.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not take any action' to 'will aim to avoid actions' weakens the obligation to prevent contraventions or defaults. Replacing 'may reasonably be anticipated based on notice from Nortel' with 'Nortel believes might possibly lead' makes the determination of potential contravention subjective and solely dependent on Nortel's belief. This eliminates objective standards and creates ambiguity regarding what actions Entrust must avoid, undermining the purpose of the clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "Corporate governance standards require clear duties and responsibilities for subsidiaries to prevent actions that harm the parent company. By making this obligation subjective and non-mandatory, it conflicts with principles of corporate law designed to protect shareholders and creditors.",

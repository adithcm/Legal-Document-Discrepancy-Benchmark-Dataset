                "original_text": "The Parties shall store and transport the Product in compliance with applicable laws and regulations for pharmaceutical products, the Quality Agreement and the relevant Marketing Authorization. Dexcel will be responsible for packaging the Product in a manner appropriate for shipment and for including data loggers with each such shipment in accordance with the provisions of the Quality Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties shall endeavor to store and transport the Product in what they believe to be compliance with applicable laws and regulations for pharmaceutical products, the Quality Agreement and the relevant Marketing Authorization. Dexcel will attempt to be responsible for packaging the Product in a reasonably acceptable manner for shipment and may include data loggers with each such shipment as per their discretion and the Quality Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with 'shall endeavor,' 'will be responsible' with 'will attempt to be responsible,' and 'appropriate manner' with 'reasonably acceptable manner'. The term 'may include' instead of 'for including' makes the inclusion of data loggers discretionary rather than mandatory, weakening the legal obligation. This may contradict Good Distribution Practices and other regulations in Israel that mandate strict compliance and specific measures for pharmaceutical product storage and transport.",

                "changed_text": "Kitov warrants that it has started to establish and intends to maintain a compliance program and what it considers reasonable internal controls and procedures that it believes are generally appropriate to address Human Trafficking in what it understands to be its supply chain and its own business, including, but not limited to: a) Kitov and its Affiliates (and including any Distributors, agents, or other person associated with or acting on their behalf) generally try not to employ persons whom they know to be younger than what they believe to be the applicable legal minimum age for working, and aim to prevent children and young people less than eighteen years of age from being employed in what appears to be hazardous conditions. a) Kitov and its Affiliates (and including any Distributors, agents, or other person associated with or acting on their behalf) try to avoid employing persons on an involuntary basis and make efforts not to use forced, prison, bonded, or indentured labor.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to prevent human trafficking by introducing subjective language such as 'what it considers reasonable,' 'believes are generally appropriate,' 'generally try not to employ,' 'aim to prevent,' and 'try to avoid.' This makes it difficult to enforce the requirement to have a robust compliance program against human trafficking. This weakens the obligation under international agreements that Israel is a party to.",

                "explanation": "This changes the obligation to comply with cGMP standards, the Marketing Authorization, and Specifications by introducing ambiguity. Replacing 'are cGMP-approved' with 'believes that its facilities...are generally in line with cGMP guidelines' and 'will manufacture the Product in accordance with' with 'will attempt to manufacture the Product in a manner that it considers consistent with' makes compliance subjective.

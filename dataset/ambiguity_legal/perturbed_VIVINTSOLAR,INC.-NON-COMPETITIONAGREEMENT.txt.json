                "original_text": "This Amendment will apply and be effective only with respect to the provisions of the Non- Competition Agreement specifically referred to herein. Except as otherwise set forth in this Amendment, the Non-Competition Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment will generally apply to the provisions of the Non-Competition Agreement. Except as otherwise vaguely indicated in this Amendment, the Non-Competition Agreement will likely continue in effect.",
                "explanation": "The phrases 'generally apply', 'vaguely indicated', and 'likely continue' introduce ambiguity regarding the enforceability and scope of the original Non-Competition Agreement. This creates uncertainty about which terms remain in effect and to what extent, weakening the original contractual obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clarity and definiteness in contractual obligations. Ambiguity can render a contract unenforceable or lead to disputes over interpretation. In Delaware, contracts are interpreted based on the parties' intentions, and ambiguity can hinder the determination of those intentions.",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the \"Sales Term\" as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC (the \"Term\").\"",
                "changed_text": "Non-Solicitation. Section 4 of the Non-Competition Agreement is hereby replaced with the following, and the deletion is subject to some exceptions:\n\n\"Term. This Agreement will maybe become effective on the Effective Date, and will possibly continue until the expiration of the \"Sales Term\" as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC (the \"Term\").\"",
                "explanation": "Adding 'maybe become' and 'possibly continue' introduces ambiguity regarding the duration and effectiveness of the non-solicitation agreement. The phrase 'subject to some exceptions' makes the deletion of the original Section 4 uncertain. This undermines the clarity and enforceability of the non-solicitation clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract; Contractual requirements not met. This also contradicts general contract law, which requires clarity in contractual terms, particularly regarding duration and conditions for termination.",

                "explanation": "The phrases 'may have entered,' 'some form of agreement,' 'sometime around September 30, 2014,' and 'might contain some restrictions' introduces vagueness. The specific date and the existence of a non-competition agreement are now uncertain, reducing the clarity of the parties' obligations. The actual existence of the agreement is called into question, and so are the partiesâ€™ obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law requires a meeting of the minds and a clear understanding of the terms. The ambiguity created undermines the enforceability of any underlying contract or restrictive covenant.",

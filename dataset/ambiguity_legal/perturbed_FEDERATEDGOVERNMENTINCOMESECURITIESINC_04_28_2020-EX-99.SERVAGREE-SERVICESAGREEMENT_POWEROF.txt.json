                "original_text": "The Adviser hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless FASC and its trustees, officers and employees (each of the foregoing an \"Indemnified Party\" and collectively the \"Indemnified Parties\") against and from any and all losses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments and suits and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Party, other than as a consequence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Indemnified Party, arising out of or in connection with this Limited Power of Attorney or any other agreement, instrument or document executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, including without limitation the reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements in connection with defending such Indemnified Party against any claim or liability related to the exercise or performance of any of FASC's powers or duties under this Limited Power of Attorney or any of the other agreements, instruments or documents executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, or the taking of any action under or in connection with any of the foregoing.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser shall endeavor to indemnify FASC and its trustees, officers and employees (each of the foregoing an \"Indemnified Party\" and collectively the \"Indemnified Parties\") against losses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments, and suits. The extent of this indemnification will be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering the circumstances of each claim or liability related to the exercise or performance of any of FASC's powers or duties under this Limited Power of Attorney. The Adviser's responsibility for costs, expenses, and disbursements will be limited to what it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text contained a clear legal obligation for the Adviser to indemnify FASC. The modified text weakens this obligation by replacing 'agrees to indemnify' with 'shall endeavor to indemnify' and introducing ambiguity regarding the extent and appropriateness of the indemnification. This makes the obligation less enforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware General Corporation Law, which requires clear and unambiguous indemnification agreements, particularly for corporate officers and trustees acting in good faith.",

                "original_text": "The Adviser hereby agrees that no person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity dealing with FASC shall be bound to inquire into FASC's power and authority hereunder and any such person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity shall be fully protected in relying on such power or authority unless such person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity has received prior written notice from the Adviser that this Limited Power of Attorney has been revoked.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser suggests that no person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity dealing with FASC should necessarily be bound to inquire into FASC's power and authority hereunder. Protection when relying on such power or authority is generally expected, even without written notice that this Limited Power of Attorney has been revoked.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'agrees that no person ... shall be bound' to 'suggests that no person ... should necessarily be bound' and stating that 'protection ... is generally expected,' the obligation to respect FASC's authority becomes unclear and unenforceable. The original provides a clear exception (written notice of revocation), while the modified text leaves it open to interpretation whether reliance on FASC's power is always protected.",
                "contradicted_law": "Agency law principles across most US states (including Pennsylvania, the governing law) require that third parties dealing with an agent (FASC) are responsible for verifying the scope of that agent's authority, particularly when circumstances suggest a potential limitation or revocation of that authority. This is not absolute, but 'generally expected' is too vague.",

                "original_text": "This Limited Power of Attorney shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without reference to principles of conflicts of laws.",
                "changed_text": "This Limited Power of Attorney may be generally interpreted under the guidance of legal principles similar to those found in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, potentially considering principles of conflicts of laws as deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that Pennsylvania law governs. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating the agreement may be 'generally interpreted under the guidance of legal principles similar to those' in Pennsylvania and 'potentially considering principles of conflicts of laws as deemed appropriate.' This vague wording could allow parties to argue for the application of other jurisdictions' laws, creating legal disputes. By adding the wording 'as deemed appropriate', the legal team could consider other laws that would directly contradict Pennsylvania's law in place.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pennsylvania law on contract interpretation, which generally requires unambiguous choice of law clauses to be strictly enforced. The ambiguity introduced conflicts with the clear intent of a choice of law provision.",

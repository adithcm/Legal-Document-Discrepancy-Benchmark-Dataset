                "original_text": "Eutectix and its operations, facilities and business shall at all times comply with all applicable federal, national, state, provincial and local laws (including common law), statutes, ordinances, orders, rules, codes, standards and regulations of the U.S.A., the country(ies) in which Eutectix or its operations or facilities are located, customs and export controls, and all other relevant jurisdictions (each individually a \"Law\" and collectively \"Laws\"), including without limitation Environmental Laws as defined below.",
                "changed_text": "Eutectix and its operations, facilities and business should endeavor to comply with applicable federal, national, state, provincial and local laws. The extent of compliance will be determined by Eutectix.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation for Eutectix to comply with all applicable laws. The modified text changes 'shall' to 'should endeavor,' which makes compliance discretionary. The phrase 'The extent of compliance will be determined by Eutectix' further weakens the obligation, allowing Eutectix to decide the level of compliance. This contradicts various environmental regulations and OSHA, which require mandatory and verifiable compliance, and not just an effort to comply.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates Eutectix to provide all necessary information for Liquidmetal to fulfill customs and trade obligations. The modified version makes this provision discretionary by stating that Eutectix will only provide information if it deems it accessible without significant resource expenditure. This contradicts U.S. Customs regulations which mandate complete and accurate information for import/export activities.",

FIIOC agrees to provide to Company, on a periodic basis, directly or through a designee, information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc. The content and format of such information shall be as FIIOC, in its sole discretion, shall choose. FIIOC may change the format and/or content of such informational reports, and the frequency with which such information is provided. For purposes of Section 4.2 of each of the Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, FIIOC represents that it is the designee of the Funds, and Company may therefore use the information provided by FIIOC without seeking additional permission from the Funds.",
                "changed_text": "Information may be Provided to Company. FIIOC will endeavor to provide to Company, when feasible, information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc. The content and format of such information will be subject to change. FIIOC reserves the right to alter the format and/or content of such informational reports, and the frequency with which such information is provided, based on its own internal assessments. For purposes of Section 4.2 of each of the Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, FIIOC represents that it aims to be the designee of the Funds, and Company may therefore use the information provided by FIIOC possibly without seeking additional permission from the Funds.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation of FIIOC to provide information. Replacing 'FIIOC agrees to provide' with 'FIIOC will endeavor to provide' introduces discretion. 'Shall be' is changed to 'will be subject to change' making the certainty of the format ambiguous. 'Aims to be' creates uncertainty around FIIOC's role as the designee, and 'possibly' weakens the permission aspect, creating uncertainty around whether additional permissions are needed.",

If such information is contained as part of larger pieces of sales literature, advertising, etc., such pieces shall be furnished for review to the Funds in accordance with the terms of the Company's Participation Agreements with the Funds. Nothing herein shall give the Company the right to expand upon, alter the appearance of, or otherwise alter the information provided by FIIOC. Company acknowledges that the information provided it by FIIOC may\n\n\n\nneed to be supplemented with additional qualifying information, regulatory disclaimers, or other information before it may be conveyed to persons outside the Company.",

Company may consider using the information provided by FIIOC in communications to individuals, plan trustees, or others who have legal title or beneficial interest in the annuity or life insurance products issued by Company, or representatives of any of these parties, and possibly to prospective purchasers of such products or beneficial interests thereunder. If such information is contained as part of larger pieces of sales literature, advertising, etc., such pieces may, if practical, be furnished for review to the Funds in accordance with the terms of the Company's Participation Agreements with the Funds.

Company acknowledges that the information provided it by FIIOC could need to be supplemented with additional qualifying information, regulatory disclaimers, or other information before it may be conveyed to persons outside the Company.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'may use' to 'may consider using' and adding 'possibly' before 'to prospective purchasers,' the obligation on the Company to actually use the information in communications is weakened. Replacing 'shall be furnished' with 'may, if practical, be furnished' introduces discretion in whether the sales literature is reviewed. Stating 'While the Company has no intention to... it retains the right to do so if deemed necessary' gives the Company leeway to change the information at their discretion, even though the original text restricts them from doing so.",

                "original_text": "Distributor agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to maximize sales of NETGEAR Products.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will endeavor to promote NETGEAR Products, but the specific sales targets are subject to periodic review.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'commercially reasonable efforts to maximize sales' to 'endeavor to promote' weakens the obligation. Adding 'subject to periodic review' introduces further ambiguity, potentially contradicting the implied obligation to actively maximize sales. There is no clear guidance in the contract to support the standard of 'endeavor to promote'.",

Distributor shall provide first level support for its customers, NETGEAR shall provide second and third level support to Distributor in order to resolve end user technical problems.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor may act as a point of contact, but NETGEAR retains the right to communicate with end-users at its discretion. Distributor will attempt to offer some support, while NETGEAR will provide support as it deems necessary.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be the sole point of contact' with 'may act as' and 'Distributor shall provide first level support' with 'Distributor will attempt to offer some support' introduces uncertainty and optionability. Replacing 'NETGEAR shall provide second and third level support' with 'NETGEAR will provide support as it deems necessary' provides NETGEAR the discretion to not provide support, creating non-compliance with industry standards.",

The report may be submitted via BBS and shall include, at a minimum, Distributor's reseller's name, address, part number, quantity shipped and unit cost.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will attempt to provide sales data when available, and the specifics of the report's content will be determined mutually. The frequency and format of reporting are subject to change.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Each month Distributor shall submit a Point of Sale (POS) shipments report' with 'Distributor will attempt to provide sales data when available' makes reporting optional, contradicting the original mandatory language. The phrase 'The frequency and format of reporting are subject to change' introduces further ambiguity and the possibility of reduced compliance with industry best practices for financial auditing and reporting. There is no definiteness or clear guidance in the modified text.",

                "original_text": "Metavante shall provide to Customer and Customer shall receive from Metavante, all upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and Amendments, the Services and licenses specified. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and end on November 30, 2014 (the \"Initial Term\"). The parties also agree to use their best efforts to perform the Conversion(s) such that the Commencement Date occurs on or before November 5, 2007.",
                "changed_text": "Metavante will endeavor to provide to Customer and Customer will endeavor to receive from Metavante, the Services and licenses specified, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and Amendments. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and end on November 30, 2014 (the \"Initial Term\"). The parties agree to attempt to perform the Conversion(s) such that the Commencement Date occurs around November 5, 2007.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for Metavante to provide and Customer to receive the specified services. The modified text replaces 'shall' with 'will endeavor', making the obligation less binding. The change of ‘occurs on or before’ to ‘occurs around’ introduces ambiguity regarding the deadline for the Commencement Date. This would make it very difficult to enforce a hard deadline.",

                "changed_text": "Metavante will make reasonable efforts to establish and maintain an information security program that generally aims to (i) promote the security and confidentiality of Customer Data, (ii) consider possible threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Customer Data, (iii) discourage unauthorized access to or use of Customer Data that could result in harm or inconvenience to Customer or any of its customers, and (iv) facilitate the disposal of Customer Data.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'will make reasonable efforts,' making the establishment and maintenance of the security program subject to Metavante's discretion rather than a mandatory duty. Also, the language around what the security program is designed to do is weakened as well.",

Based on Customer's instructions, Metavante shall select the processing parameter settings, features, and options (collectively, the \"Parameters\") within Metavante's system that will apply to Customer. Customer shall be responsible for determining that such selections are consistent with the Legal Requirements and with the terms and conditions of any agreements between Customer and its clients. In making such determinations, Customer may rely upon the written descriptions of such Parameters contained in the User Manuals. Metavante shall perform system processing in accordance with the Parameters.",

Following Customer's suggestions, Metavante may select processing parameter settings, features, and options (collectively, the \"Parameters\") within Metavante's system for Customer. Customer assumes some responsibility for aligning these selections with Legal Requirements and client agreements. When determining this, Customer might find the User Manuals helpful. Metavante will conduct system processing taking into account the Parameters.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states Customer's responsibility for Legal Requirements, whereas the modified text introduces ambiguity by using terms like 'generally responsible' and 'considering' instead of 'monitoring and interpreting.' 'Metavante shall select' is weakened to 'Metavante may select,' giving Metavante more discretion. The clear responsibility for the consistency between Customer, the Legal Requirments and agreements is now ‘some responsibility for aligning’. 'Customer may rely’ on the user manuals, which was previously 'Customer shall be responsible for determining'. ‘Metavante shall’ is downgraded to ‘Metavante will conduct’.",

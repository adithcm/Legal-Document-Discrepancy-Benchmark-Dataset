            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Reseller shall conduct its business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in any way related to the Support Services, and performance of Reseller's duties under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Reseller shall:",
                "changed_text": "Reseller should endeavor to conduct its business with consideration for applicable laws and regulations related to the Support Services, and performance of Reseller's duties under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Reseller may:",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall conduct' with 'should endeavor to conduct' weakens the obligation, making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. Similarly, substituting 'shall' with 'may' further dilutes the legal requirement to comply with the subsequent list of obligations. This change creates ambiguity and makes it difficult to enforce compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal laws and regulations, as compliance is no longer definitively required.",
                "location": "Section 4.10"

                "changed_text": "Consider compliance, and encourage persons under its control to consider compliance, with Government Controls and other Legal Requirements;",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Comply at all times' to 'Consider compliance' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. Similarly, changing 'cause persons under its control to comply' to 'encourage persons under its control to consider compliance' further reduces the binding nature of the clause. This creates non-compliance with laws requiring strict adherence to regulations, such as export controls and anti-corruption laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States Export Administration Act, the United States Arms Export Control Act, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, all as amended, and the USA PATRIOT Act",
                "location": "Section 4.10(d)"

                "changed_text": "Endeavor to give consideration to the interests of TouchStar in certain dealings, as reasonably practical;",
                "explanation": "Adding 'Endeavor to', 'certain dealings' and 'as reasonably practical' makes the obligation to consider TouchStar's interests vague and discretionary.  The original phrase implies a consistent and dutiful consideration, while the modified text allows for subjective interpretation and potentially avoids the intended obligation. This vague obligation contradicts the requirement to act in good faith.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, present in most US state contract law.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "B. Obtain all federal, state and local business licenses, permits, certifications and bonds required for lawful operation of the Franchise and certify in writing to AIRSOPURE prior to opening that all such requirements have been obtained.",
                "changed_text": "B. Obtain all federal, state and local business licenses, permits, certifications and bonds reasonably believed to be required for lawful operation of the Franchise and make a good faith effort to certify in writing to AIRSOPURE prior to opening that such requirements have been obtained.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires franchisees to obtain all required licenses and permits, while the modified text only requires them to obtain those 'reasonably believed to be required' and make a 'good faith effort' to certify. This creates ambiguity and reduces the legal obligation, potentially leading to non-compliance with mandatory licensing laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by location, but generally contradicts state and local licensing laws that mandate specific licenses and permits for operating a business. For example, in Texas, businesses must comply with the Texas Business and Commerce Code regarding assumed name certificates and various industry-specific licenses, and this change could result in a violation if the franchisee's 'reasonable belief' is incorrect.",

You will forward copies of all notices of non-compliance by the Franchise with any law, rule, regulation or ordinance to AIRSOPURE within three days from receipt thereof accompanied by a summary of action You will take to comply.",
                "changed_text": "H. Endeavor to comply with federal, state and local health and safety laws, rules and standards applicable to operation of the Franchise. You will, when practical, forward copies of notices of non-compliance by the Franchise with any law, rule, regulation or ordinance to AIRSOPURE within a reasonable time from receipt thereof, with a brief outline of intended actions.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict compliance with health and safety laws and requires prompt reporting of non-compliance. The modified text replaces 'comply' with 'endeavor to comply', introducing ambiguity. It also changes the mandatory reporting requirement by adding 'when practical' and changes the timeframe to 'a reasonable time,' making compliance and reporting discretionary. Furthermore, 'summary of action you will take to comply' becomes 'brief outline of intended actions,' which weakens the franchisee's responsibility to take actual steps toward compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by location, but generally contradicts federal (OSHA), state, and local health and safety regulations that require strict compliance and immediate reporting of violations. In Texas, for example, this could violate the Texas Hazard Communication Act or specific regulations related to air quality and safety standards for businesses.",

                "original_text": "J. Operate the Franchise in strict conformance with AIRSOPURE's policies, procedures, standards and specifications as may be prescribed by AIRSOPURE from time to time in the Operations Manual or otherwise in writing, including without limitation all changes specified by AIRSOPURE to its system or Products.",
                "changed_text": "J. Strive to operate the Franchise in general accordance with AIRSOPURE's policies, procedures, standards and specifications as outlined in the Operations Manual or other written communication. Significant changes to AIRSOPURE's system or Products will be considered.",
                "explanation": "This section initially enforces strict adherence to Airsopure's operational guidelines. By changing 'strict conformance' to 'strive to operate in general accordance', the franchisee's obligation becomes less stringent. Adding 'Significant changes to AIRSOPURE's system or Products will be considered' introduces ambiguity and suggests that compliance with changes is not mandatory, undermining the franchisor's control and potentially leading to operational inconsistencies and non-compliance with system standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change weakens the franchisee's obligation, creating a discrepancy with the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 1121), which requires franchisees to uphold the franchisor's standards to maintain the integrity of the trademark. This ambiguity in operational adherence could be considered trademark infringement if it leads to inconsistent quality or service.",

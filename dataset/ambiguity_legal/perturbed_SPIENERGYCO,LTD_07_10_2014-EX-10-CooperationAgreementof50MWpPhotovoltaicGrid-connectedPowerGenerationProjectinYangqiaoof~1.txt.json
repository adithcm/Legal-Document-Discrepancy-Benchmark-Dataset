                "original_text": "Party B promises that land nature will not be changed for building large-scale PV grid-connected power generation project in the plot; comprehensive development will be carried out according to relevant national stipulations, such commercial crops will be interplanted as agriculture and forestry as well as medicinal materials; local employees will enjoy the priority to be employed; local building materials will be adopted and relevant expenses will be paid on schedule.",
                "changed_text": "Party B should endeavor to avoid changing the land nature for building the project; development will be carried out with some consideration for relevant national stipulations; local employees will be considered for employment when feasible; local building materials will be considered, and relevant expenses will be paid in a timely manner.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains clear obligations regarding land use, development, employment, and payment of expenses. The modified text weakens these obligations by introducing ambiguous terms such as 'should endeavor,' 'some consideration,' 'when feasible,' and 'considered.' This makes the obligations discretionary rather than mandatory.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various environmental regulations regarding land use, as well as labor laws concerning preferential hiring practices. Specific contradictions depend on the exact regulations in Fenyi County, but this change introduces doubt and weakens legally binding requirements.",

                "original_text": "Party A supports and guarantees the project construction and development of Party B, and will provide the most preferential policies and all- round service in the aspects of preliminary work, construction and grid-connected of the project, and actively coordinate relevant departments and units to help Party B accelerate project construction progress.",
                "changed_text": "Party A intends to support the project construction and development of Party B, and will aim to provide preferential policies and service in the aspects of preliminary work, construction and grid-connected of the project, and may coordinate relevant departments and units to potentially assist Party B in accelerating project construction progress.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates an explicit guarantee of support and service from Party A. Changing 'supports and guarantees' to 'intends to support' and 'will provide' to 'will aim to provide' significantly weakens Party A's commitment. Replacing 'actively coordinate' with 'may coordinate' makes their assistance optional. This creates uncertainty regarding the level of support Party B can expect.",
                "contradicted_law": "This modification, by weakening the guarantee of support, could hinder Party B's ability to meet regulatory requirements and project deadlines, which are often legally mandated in energy projects. While no specific law is directly violated, the lack of guaranteed support creates a vulnerability.",

                "changed_text": "Party B is expected to register a company in Fenyi County at some point during the project; Party A will attempt to offer preferential policies to the company if deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear timeline and obligation for Party B to register a company and for Party A to offer preferential policies. Modifying this to 'is expected to register...at some point' makes the timeline ambiguous. Changing 'will offer all the preferential policies' to 'will attempt to offer... if deemed appropriate' makes the commitment discretionary and dependent on Party A's subjective judgment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts local laws regarding foreign investment incentives, if those laws mandate specific timelines or guarantees for preferential treatment. The ambiguity introduces uncertainty about whether Party B will receive the promised benefits, which could violate the spirit, if not the letter, of investment promotion laws.",

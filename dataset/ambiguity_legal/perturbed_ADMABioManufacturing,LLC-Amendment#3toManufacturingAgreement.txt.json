                "original_text": "ADMA agrees to assume the risks of loss to the Sanofi Pasteur Property and shall reimburse Sanofi Pasteur, at the dollar value, the Source Plasma in case of damage or loss.",
                "changed_text": "ADMA agrees to consider assuming the risks of loss to the Sanofi Pasteur Property and may reimburse Sanofi Pasteur, based on a mutually agreed-upon value, for the Source Plasma in case of significant damage or loss.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for ADMA to reimburse Sanofi Pasteur for any damage or loss. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'consider assuming,' which weakens ADMA's obligation, 'may reimburse' which makes reimbursement discretionary and 'mutually agreed-upon value,' which could lead to disputes and delays in compensation. Additionally, the term 'significant damage or loss' is not defined, introducing further ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida Statutes Chapter 672, which addresses the Uniform Commercial Code - Sales. Specifically, this change could contradict the implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose if the 'mutually agreed-upon value' does not adequately compensate Sanofi Pasteur for losses covered under these warranties.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties shall endeavor to initiate efforts to complete such amendment to the Quality Agreement within a reasonable timeframe after the Amendment Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'best efforts' within a defined timeframe. The modified text weakens this by stating 'endeavor to initiate efforts,' which is less forceful. Replacing '60 days' with 'a reasonable timeframe' removes a specific deadline, creating ambiguity and potentially allowing for significant delays. The term 'reasonable' is subjective and open to interpretation, making enforcement difficult.",
                "contradicted_law": "Principles of Contract Law - Good Faith and Fair Dealing: While not a statute, this principle, recognized in Florida law, requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in performing their contractual obligations. The ambiguous language weakens the commitment, potentially violating this principle by allowing for inaction or unreasonable delays.",

                "original_text": "Shipment of the Source Plasma to Sanofi Pasteur shall be made in compliance with the transportation conditions as provided in the Quality Agreement (as defined below), to be further amended by the Parties as contemplated in Section 9 below.",
                "changed_text": "Shipment of the Source Plasma to Sanofi Pasteur should generally align with transportation conditions as discussed in the Quality Agreement (as defined below), subject to potential modifications as contemplated in Section 9 below.",
                "explanation": "The original language creates a clear obligation for shipments to comply with the Quality Agreement's transportation conditions. The modification weakens this obligation by using 'should generally align,' indicating that compliance is not mandatory. 'As discussed' is vaguer than 'as provided' and gives more flexibility for interpretation. By adding the term potential it makes transportation potentially out of alignment with the existing Quality Agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida Statutes Chapter 672, which addresses the Uniform Commercial Code - Sales. The ambiguity introduced regarding compliance with transportation conditions could potentially violate the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose under Florida law if the plasma is damaged during transport due to non-compliance with agreed-upon conditions. This is because the warranty implies that goods are suitable for their intended use, and improper transportation could render the plasma unfit for manufacturing.",

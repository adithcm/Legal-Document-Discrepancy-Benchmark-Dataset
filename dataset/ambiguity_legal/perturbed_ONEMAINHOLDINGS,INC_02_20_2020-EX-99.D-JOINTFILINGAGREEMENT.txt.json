                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby acknowledge the intention to engage in joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D and further amendments, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement may be included as an Exhibit to such filing, if deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"confirm the agreement\" to \"acknowledge the intention to engage\" weakens the commitment to joint filing. Additionally, using \"may be included as an Exhibit... if deemed appropriate\" introduces discretion where the SEC requires a clear, binding agreement to be filed as an exhibit. This weakens the enforceability of the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement can potentially be executed in counterparts, with each counterpart perhaps considered an original, but their collective effect on constituting a single agreement is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "The words 'can potentially', 'perhaps considered', and 'not guaranteed' creates vagueness regarding whether counterpart signatures are binding, thus undermining the agreement's validity and enforceability. SEC filings require that all parties are bound by the agreement, and such language weakens that requirement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'execute this Agreement' to 'indicate their general alignment' weakens the legal binding effect. Adding 'approximately' makes the date of the agreement unclear. SEC regulations require the date to be accurate. This compromises the clarity of the legally binding commitment date.",

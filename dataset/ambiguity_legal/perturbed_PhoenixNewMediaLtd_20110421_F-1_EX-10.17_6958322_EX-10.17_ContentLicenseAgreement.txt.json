Without Party A's consent in writing, Party B may not in  any way use the Program Content provided by Party A for any purposes other than in connection with Party B Business, nor may Party  B permit any third party to use in any way the Program Content licensed by Party A to Party B prior to the publishing of the Program  Content on the Phoenix Satellite TV Websites or Other Websites.",
                "changed_text": "Party B may generally use the Program Content licensed by Party A in Party B Business. Party B may explore using the Program Content provided by Party A for purposes that align with Party B Business, and may consider allowing third parties to use the Program Content licensed by Party A to Party B prior to the publishing of the Program Content on the Phoenix Satellite TV Websites or Other Websites, at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly limits Party B's use of Program Content to its business and prohibits third-party use before publication. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using terms like 'generally use,' 'explore using', and 'at its discretion'. This weakens the restriction and allows Party B to interpret the terms more loosely.",
                "contradicted_law": "Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China: Article 10 defines the scope of copyright protection and the rights of copyright holders, including the right to authorize or prohibit certain uses of their work. This modification creates ambiguity as to whether Party B's actions are compliant with copyright laws.",

Upon the termination of this Agreement, Party B shall return to Party A or destroy any document,  material or software containing such business secrets and delete the same from any memory devices.",
                "changed_text": "Party B should endeavor to maintain the confidentiality of Party A's business secrets of which Party B may be aware. Upon the termination of this Agreement, Party B will make an effort to return or dispose of documents, materials, or software containing such business secrets.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict confidentiality and the return or destruction of confidential materials upon termination. The modified version softens this obligation by changing 'shall keep in confidence' to 'should endeavor to maintain the confidentiality' and 'shall return to Party A or destroy' to 'will make an effort to return or dispose of'. This introduces ambiguity about the required level of diligence and allows for potential non-compliance. The original version created a requirement of ensuring deletion from any memory devices, but the revision removes that obligation.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of legal action related to Intellectual Property Rights, Party B may offer assistance to Party A as it deems appropriate. If Party B's actions contributed to the legal issue, Party B may consider contributing to the costs associated with such assistance.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires Party B to provide all reasonably requested assistance in intellectual property legal actions. The revised version replaces 'shall provide...all assistance reasonably requested' with 'may offer assistance...as it deems appropriate'. The removal of the language that Party B would bear the costs if it were due to their negligence further weakens the obligation to act appropriately, and removes the required assumption of cost.",
                "contradicted_law": "Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China: This law protects copyright and requires parties to take reasonable steps to protect and enforce those rights. This change reduces Party B's obligation to assist, making it more difficult for Party A to protect its rights.",

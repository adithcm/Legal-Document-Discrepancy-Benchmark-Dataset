                "original_text": "Turpin agrees to maintain at all times adequate and current records relating to the creation and development of the Work Product and Intellectual Property Rights therein, which records and all copies thereof shall be and shall remain the exclusive property of the Company, and to disclose all such records and copies to the Company promptly.",
                "changed_text": "Turpin will endeavor to maintain records relating to the creation and development of the Work Product and Intellectual Property Rights therein, and will aim to disclose these records and copies to the Company when feasible.",
                "explanation": "The change from \"agrees to maintain at all times adequate and current records\" to \"will endeavor to maintain records\" weakens the obligation. Similarly, replacing \"shall be and shall remain the exclusive property of the Company, and to disclose all such records and copies to the Company promptly\" with \"will aim to disclose these records and copies to the Company when feasible\" introduces significant ambiguity and makes the obligation discretionary. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in performing their contractual obligations. The added ambiguity makes the legal obligation almost impossible to enforce.",

                "changed_text": "Turpin should, within reason, assist with documents the Company needs, but is not obligated to execute or deliver them if it causes undue burden to Turpin.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on Turpin to assist with legal documents. The modified text changes \"Turpin shall\" to \"Turpin should, within reason\", weakening the obligation. Adding \"but is not obligated to execute or deliver them if it causes undue burden to Turpin\" introduces significant ambiguity and subjectivity, making it difficult to enforce. What constitutes an 'undue burden' is open to interpretation. This change undermines the company's ability to protect its Intellectual Property Rights.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Turpin *shall* deliver all Work Product. The revised text changes this to \"Turpin will attempt to return Work Product when practical.\" This weakens the obligation. Adding \"provided that he has no further need for them and it does not interfere with his subsequent employment\" introduces significant ambiguity and conflicts with the company's ownership of intellectual property. It allows Turpin to potentially retain company property based on subjective needs and future employment conflicts, undermining the company's control over its assets.",

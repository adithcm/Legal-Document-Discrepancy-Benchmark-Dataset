                "original_text": "Consolidated Artists agrees to cause Ogle to use the Endorsed Product during the Contract Period and throughout the Contract Territory whenever he is playing competitive golf or otherwise participating in golf clinics and outings.",
                "changed_text": "Consolidated Artists agrees to encourage Ogle to use the Endorsed Product during the Contract Period and throughout the Contract Territory when reasonably practical while playing competitive golf or participating in golf clinics and outings.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'agrees to cause' to 'agrees to encourage' weakens the obligation on Consolidated Artists to ensure Ogle's use of the product. Adding 'when reasonably practical' introduces further ambiguity, making it difficult to enforce the clause if Ogle's use is inconsistent. This could lead to a breach of contract if not clearly defined.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles of definiteness and enforceability. Vague terms can render a contract unenforceable, especially if a court finds no clear intent to create a binding obligation.",

(\"Advantage\"), with a copy of all advertising and promotional materials which will use or show the Ogle Endorsement for their approval. Such promotional or advertising materials shall be delivered to Advantage at least fourteen (14) days prior to their release to the general public, and TPC agrees that the same shall not be released without the - 6 - prior written approval of Advantage. Advantage agrees that it will not unreasonably disapprove or reject promotional or advertising materials hereunder, and that Advantage's failure to disapprove such materials within fourteen (14) days of receipt shall be deemed to be approval.",
                "changed_text": "TPC will endeavor to provide Consolidated Artists and its representative, Advantage International Management, Inc. (\"Advantage\"), with advertising and promotional materials that use or show the Ogle Endorsement for potential feedback. Such materials should be provided to Advantage in a timely manner before release to the general public, and TPC will consider Advantage's views before releasing. Advantage will aim to provide feedback on promotional or advertising materials, and a lack of response may be considered as acceptance.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to provide' to 'will endeavor to provide' significantly weakens TPC's obligation. Replacing 'approval' with 'potential feedback' and 'prior written approval' with 'consider Advantage's views' removes the requirement for approval, making it discretionary. Changing 'failure to disapprove shall be deemed to be approval' to 'lack of response may be considered as acceptance' creates uncertainty about whether silence constitutes approval. This weakens the obligation for strict compliance and introduces subjectivity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles regarding offer and acceptance and the requirement for clear and unambiguous agreement. The modifications create uncertainty about whether approval is required and how it can be demonstrated, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The modification from 'agree that they will take all necessary steps' to 'should consider taking steps' makes the obligation optional rather than mandatory. Removing 'thereafter', 'the name \"Brett Ogle\" or any facsimile thereof', and 'advertisement, promotion, distribution and sale' narrows and weakens the scope of the protection obligation. Adding 'generally' makes the protective measures vague and subject to interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark law principles requiring active measures to protect trademarks. The weakened obligation could be insufficient to demonstrate a genuine intention to protect the trademark, potentially leading to its loss.",

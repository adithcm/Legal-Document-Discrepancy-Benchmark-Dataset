                "original_text": "As sponsor of the Issuer under the Prospectus, the Sponsor will conduct an investigation of the organization, management, business and affairs of the Issuer sufficient, in its sole discretion, to enable it to determine whether or not it is able to sign the certificate of the Prospectus.",
                "changed_text": "As sponsor of the Issuer under the Prospectus, the Sponsor will endeavor to conduct an investigation of the organization, management, business and affairs of the Issuer, the scope of which will be determined at its convenience, to generally assess its ability to sign the certificate of the Prospectus.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes 'will conduct an investigation...sufficient, in its sole discretion, to enable it to determine whether or not it is able to sign the certificate' to 'will endeavor to conduct an investigation... the scope of which will be determined at its convenience, to generally assess its ability to sign the certificate.' This weakens the Sponsor's obligation to conduct a thorough investigation, making it discretionary and ill-defined. The replacement of 'sufficient' with 'at its convenience' and 'generally assess' creates ambiguity and undermines the requirement for a diligent investigation before signing the prospectus, potentially conflicting with British Columbia Securities Act regulations regarding due diligence.",

                "original_text": "If, following the investigation referred to in subsection 2.2, the Sponsor determines in its sole discretion that it is able to do so, the Sponsor will sign the certificate for the Prospectus, certifying that, to the best of its knowledge, the Prospectus contains full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the Securities.",
                "changed_text": "If, following the investigation referred to in subsection 2.2, the Sponsor believes it may be in a position to do so, the Sponsor might consider signing the certificate for the Prospectus, attesting that, based on its understanding, the Prospectus appears to generally reflect material facts relating to the Securities.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the Sponsor to sign the certificate if, after investigation, it determines it is able to do so, providing a degree of certainty. The modified text replaces 'determines in its sole discretion that it is able to do so' with 'believes it may be in a position to do so' and 'the Sponsor will sign' with 'the Sponsor might consider signing,' making the action discretionary and less binding. The change from 'certifying that, to the best of its knowledge, the Prospectus contains full, true and plain disclosure' to 'attesting that, based on its understanding, the Prospectus appears to generally reflect material facts' significantly weakens the Sponsor's responsibility for accuracy and completeness. This creates ambiguity and could be seen as non-compliant with the British Columbia Securities Act requirements for accurate and complete disclosure in a prospectus.",

                "changed_text": "The Issuer will, as it sees fit, make an effort to provide the Sponsor with some opportunity to glance at its business, capital, finances, operations and principals, if the Sponsor expresses an interest.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates the Issuer to provide 'a reasonable opportunity' for a 'full and comprehensive review.' The modification alters this to the Issuer making an effort to provide 'some opportunity to glance at' these aspects 'if the Sponsor expresses an interest.' This makes the Issuer's obligation vague and discretionary, and limits the scope of the review. The elimination of 'full and comprehensive' and the addition of 'as it sees fit' significantly weakens the Sponsor's ability to perform due diligence, potentially conflicting with regulatory requirements under the British Columbia Securities Act.",

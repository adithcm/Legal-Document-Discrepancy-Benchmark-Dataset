                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Kubient shall use reasonable efforts to provide to Customer the Services. Customer agrees to provide all reasonable and necessary access, support and cooperation for Kubient to provide the Services in a timely and effective manner.",
                "changed_text": "Kubient will endeavor to provide the Services to Customer. Customer agrees to provide access, support, and cooperation for Kubient to provide the Services.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall use reasonable efforts' with 'will endeavor' and removing 'reasonable and necessary', the obligation on Kubient and the Customer becomes less defined. 'Endeavor' is subjective, and the removal of the qualifier 'reasonable and necessary' means the extent of access, support, and cooperation required is undefined.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law requires specificity in obligations. Vague obligations are difficult to enforce, potentially leading to a breach of contract claim.",

Customer agrees that it will not transfer or (unless expressly and specifically approved by Kubient in advance and in writing) allow third-party access to the Service.",
                "changed_text": "Customer will attempt to comply with all laws applicable to its business and use of the Service. Customer may allow third-party access to the Service unless otherwise notified by Kubient.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will comply' with 'will attempt to comply' weakens the obligation. Additionally, reversing the condition for allowing third-party access shifts the burden of preventing it onto Kubient, creating ambiguity about acceptable use.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding the duty of good faith and fair dealing. A party cannot contractually agree to comply with all applicable laws and then only 'attempt' to do so.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for 'best practices of security technology' and 'industry standards' for data security makes the obligation vague. The deletion of 'only certain authorized personnel of Kubient or Customer' weakens authorized access.",

                "original_text": "The Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, advertising, and promotion of the business and that it shall notify the Licensor of any action that must be taken by the Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "changed_text": "The Licensee agrees to endeavor to ensure that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark generally aligns with the prevailing interpretations of laws, rules, regulations, and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, advertising, and promotion of the business. The Licensee will inform the Licensor of actions it reasonably believes are necessary for compliance, based on its own understanding.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'endeavor to ensure that generally aligns' significantly weakens the obligation, creating ambiguity as to the level of compliance required. Also, replacing 'shall notify' with 'will inform the Licensor of actions it reasonably believes are necessary for compliance, based on its own understanding' allows the Licensee to subjectively determine what constitutes compliance, introducing further uncertainty and reducing the Licensor's ability to ensure regulatory adherence.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various federal and state laws that require strict compliance, such as securities laws, advertising standards, and consumer protection regulations relevant to financial services.",

                "original_text": "In order to preserve the inherent value of the Licensed Mark, the Licensee agrees to use reasonable efforts to ensure that it maintains the quality of its business and the operation thereof equal to the standards prevailing in the operation of the Licensor's and the Licensee's businesses as of the date of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "To generally maintain the Licensed Mark's value, the Licensee will make good-faith attempts to keep its business operations at a level it deems acceptable relative to prior operations of both businesses.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'use reasonable efforts to ensure that it maintains the quality of its business and the operation thereof equal to the standards prevailing in the operation of the Licensor's and the Licensee's businesses' with 'make good-faith attempts to keep its business operations at a level it deems acceptable relative to prior operations of both businesses' introduces subjective criteria for maintaining quality. 'Good-faith attempts' is a weaker obligation than 'reasonable efforts to ensure,' and 'a level it deems acceptable' replaces an objective standard (standards prevailing in both businesses) with a subjective one, making enforcement difficult.",

The Licensee shall cooperate with the Licensor in the prosecution, defense or settlement of such actions, proceedings or claims.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall have the exclusive right, but not the obligation, to prosecute, defend and/or settle' with 'may consider whether to prosecute, defend and/or settle, at its discretion' significantly reduces the Licensor's responsibility to protect the Licensed Mark. Also, changing 'The Licensee shall cooperate' to 'The Licensee will offer cooperation as available' makes the Licensee's cooperation discretionary, potentially hindering the Licensor's ability to protect the mark effectively. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing within contracts.",

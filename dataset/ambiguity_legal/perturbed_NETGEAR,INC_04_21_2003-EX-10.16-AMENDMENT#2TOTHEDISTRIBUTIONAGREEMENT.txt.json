                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms of this Amendment, the Territory listed in Section 2 of the Agreement is amended to potentially include the United States and other areas as deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'is amended to be the United States and [*]' to 'is amended to potentially include the United States and other areas as deemed appropriate' introduces ambiguity. The original text clearly defines the territory, while the modified text makes the territory discretionary and undefined, potentially conflicting with requirements for clear contractual terms under contract law.",

                "changed_text": "During the initial one year period beginning on the Amendment Date, Distributor should endeavor to be a distributor appointed by NETGEAR in [*], contingent upon Distributor participating in marketing activities.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Distributor shall be the only distributor' to 'Distributor should endeavor to be a distributor' weakens the obligation. Replacing 'subject to Distributor conducting mutually agreed to marketing activities as described in the Marketing Plan' with 'contingent upon Distributor participating in marketing activities' makes the requirement vague and unenforceable, contradicting the initial exclusivity agreement and potentially leading to disputes over distributor rights.",

                "changed_text": "This Amendment may remain in effect for a period that generally aligns with the term of the agreement, subject to mutual agreement and ongoing evaluation.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'This Amendment shall remain in effect' with 'This Amendment may remain in effect' introduces a level of uncertainty regarding the duration. Adding 'subject to mutual agreement and ongoing evaluation' further complicates the timeframe, contrasting with the more definitive statement from the original agreement.",

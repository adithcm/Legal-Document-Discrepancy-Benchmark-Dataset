                "changed_text": "Fleet will endeavor to ensure that the Columbia Equipment meets and is operated and maintained in accordance with Applicable Laws and cGMP and GDP.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'ensure' to 'endeavor to ensure' weakens the obligation to comply with Applicable Laws, cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice), and GDP (Good Distribution Practice). This introduces ambiguity regarding the level of compliance required. It is no longer a strict obligation but a goal to be pursued with effort.",

                "changed_text": "Fleet should attempt to keep the Columbia Equipment in generally acceptable condition and may consider steps to reduce contamination or corrosion.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall keep' with 'should attempt to keep' and 'all reasonable steps to ensure' with 'may consider steps to reduce' significantly diminishes the responsibility to maintain the Columbia Equipment's condition, allowing for potential negligence and non-compliance. The original section clearly outlines a duty of care for Columbia's equipment. The modified version only suggests an intention to do the same.",

                "changed_text": "Each party will try to avoid exporting, directly or indirectly, any technical information acquired from the other party under this Agreement or any products using such technical information to a location or in a manner that at the time of export requires an export licence or other governmental approval, and will seek written consent from the relevant agency if feasible.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'agrees that it shall not export... without first obtaining written consent' to 'will try to avoid exporting...and will seek written consent...if feasible' transforms a strict prohibition into a weaker, discretionary obligation. The original text mandates obtaining export licenses; the modification suggests merely attempting to do so, potentially violating export control regulations. It changes a clear commitment to a vague aspiration.",

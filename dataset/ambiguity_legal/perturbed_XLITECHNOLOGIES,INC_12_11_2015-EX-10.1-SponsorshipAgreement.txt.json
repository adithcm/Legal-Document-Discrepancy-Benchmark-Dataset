                "original_text": "WCC shall ensure that all WCC public communications shall make reference to XLI products as \"Light Sheets\", as further defined in Attachment A [Sponsor Benefits Schedule] attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.",
                "changed_text": "WCC will endeavor to reference XLI products as \"Light Sheets\" in WCC public communications, as deemed reasonably practical. The specifics are detailed in Attachment A [Sponsor Benefits Schedule] attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall ensure' with 'will endeavor' weakens the obligation to promote XLI products, making it non-mandatory. Adding 'as deemed reasonably practical' introduces subjective criteria, undermining the definiteness of the obligation. This change contradicts general advertising compliance laws, as these laws may enforce certain advertising obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Both parties should, to a reasonable extent, maintain insurance during the term of this Agreement and for one year thereafter, covering some of its operations, subject to available resources.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'should, to a reasonable extent,' weakens the obligation to maintain insurance. Replacing 'all its operations necessary to comply with insurance laws' with 'some of its operations, subject to available resources' introduces ambiguity and makes compliance discretionary based on financial limitations. This undermines the original commitment to comply with insurance laws, contradicting insurance regulations enforced by states like California and Nevada, where the parties are located, which mandate specific insurance coverage levels.",

                "changed_text": "Each party may consider executing further instruments and undertaking other acts to generally support the purposes and intents of this Agreement, as they see fit.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to execute, acknowledge and deliver' with 'may consider executing' changes a mandatory obligation into a discretionary action. Using 'generally support' and 'as they see fit' adds subjective elements. This undermines the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts under California and Nevada law, which requires parties to act in a way that doesn't frustrate the purpose of the contract, thus weakening the enforceability of this clause.",

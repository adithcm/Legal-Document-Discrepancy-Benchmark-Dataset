            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "CytoDyn shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to execute and perform the activities set forth in the Development Plan. CytoDyn shall conduct the activities under the Development Plan, and shall ensure that its Affiliates and contractors conduct their activities under the Development Plan, in a good scientific manner and in material compliance with Applicable Law, including cGLP, cGCP, cGMP and applicable national and international guidelines.",
                "changed_text": "CytoDyn will endeavor to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to execute and perform the activities set forth in the Development Plan. CytoDyn will strive to conduct the activities under the Development Plan, and will encourage its Affiliates and contractors to conduct their activities under the Development Plan, in what they believe to be a generally acceptable scientific manner and in substantial compliance with what they understand to be Applicable Law, including cGLP, cGCP, cGMP and applicable national and international guidelines.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall use' with 'will endeavor to use' and 'shall conduct' with 'will strive to conduct' weakens the obligation. Replacing 'ensure' with 'encourage' reduces the responsibility for the actions of Affiliates and contractors. The modifier \"what they believe to be a generally acceptable\" is ambiguous, allowing subjective interpretation of 'good scientific manner,' and substantially instead of material compliance allows leeway, potentially contradicting FDA requirements.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall conduct' to 'should try to conduct' makes the obligation to follow the Commercialization Plan less stringent. Replacing 'ensure that it meets or exceeds' with 'aim to meet' significantly weakens the requirement to fulfill the Minimum Requirements.",

CytoDyn will try to maintain a worldwide adverse event database for the Licensed Products.",
                "explanation": "Adding \"as it deems necessary\" introduces subjectivity into adverse event reporting, which undermines the mandatory reporting requirements. Replacing \"shall maintain\" with \"will try to maintain\" weakens the obligation to maintain the database.",

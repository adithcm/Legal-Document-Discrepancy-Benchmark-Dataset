Both Manufacturer and Subcontractor shall be responsible for complying with all federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and the like in the United States and in other countries as they may pertain to the Manufacturer's Products and to the obligations on the Parties to perform under this Agreement, including, without limitation, requirements in the United States with respect to registration of establishment, listing of medical devices, reporting of deaths, serious injuries and certain malfunctions under 21 CFR Medical Device Regulations and the potential therefore, tracking of medical devices, recalls, safety alerts and process controls. In no event shall either Party assume any risk arising out of the other Party's failure to comply with such laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and the like, and each Party shall cooperate with the other in all respects to facilitate and promote strict compliance with the provisions of this Section 14.",
                "changed_text": "Manufacturer shall aim to be registered as the manufacturer of Manufacturer's Products and shall seek approvals from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") and other regulatory bodies, public or private as may be advisable to manufacture and sell the products in the United States or internationally. Both Manufacturer and Subcontractor should endeavor to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and the like in the United States and in other countries as they may pertain to the Manufacturer's Products and to the obligations on the Parties to perform under this Agreement, including, without limitation, requirements in the United States with respect to registration of establishment, listing of medical devices, reporting of deaths, serious injuries and certain malfunctions under 21 CFR Medical Device Regulations and the potential therefore, tracking of medical devices, recalls, safety alerts and process controls. Neither Party assumes any direct risk arising out of the other Party's efforts to comply with such laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and the like, and each Party may cooperate with the other to facilitate and promote compliance with the provisions of this Section 14.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'shall be responsible for complying,' which creates a clear legal obligation. The modified text uses weaker language such as 'aim to be registered,' 'seek approvals,' 'should endeavor to comply,' and 'may cooperate.' These changes introduce ambiguity, making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. The original text states 'In no event shall either Party assume any risk arising out of the other Party's failure to comply with such laws...' while the modified text states 'Neither Party assumes any direct risk arising out of the other Party's efforts to comply with such laws...' This weakens the assurance that the other party will take responsibility for compliance with medical device laws.",

Each of the Parties will immediately notify the other of any complaints, adverse events, deaths or serious injuries relating to Manufacturer's Products that are manufactured by Subcontractor. All complaints, adverse events, deaths or serious injuries pertaining to Manufacturer's Products will be reported to Subcontractor's Quality Assurance departments in accordance with the requirements established in Subcontractor's and Manufacturer's Complaints Handling and Reporting procedures. All complaint related Manufacturer's Products returned to Manufacturer will be forwarded to Subcontractor for complaint handling and failure investigation.",
                "changed_text": "Subcontractor should keep records and books covering the manufacture of the Manufacturer's Products and other documents relating to this Agreement. Each of the Parties will notify the other of significant complaints, adverse events, deaths or serious injuries relating to Manufacturer's Products that are manufactured by Subcontractor. Complaints, adverse events, deaths or serious injuries pertaining to Manufacturer's Products will be reported to Quality Assurance departments. Complaint related Manufacturer's Products returned to Manufacturer will be forwarded for complaint handling and failure investigation, when possible.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a strict obligation to 'keep correct and complete records,' which is weakened to a recommendation to 'keep records and books.' Replacing 'shall keep' with 'should keep' significantly dilutes the legal obligation to maintain accurate records, a critical element in medical device manufacturing. Further, requiring parties to notify each other of 'any' complaints is weakened to requiring parties to notify each other of 'significant' complaints. The terms 'should keep,' 'significant,' and 'when possible' introduce ambiguity, making compliance discretionary. The removal of “Subcontractor’s and Manufacturer’s” from “Quality Assurance departments” adds another layer of ambiguity as it is unclear whose quality assurance departments are being referenced.",

Manufacturer will notify Subcontractor of all changes to the Device Master Record, manufacturing process changes or material changes relating to the manufacture of Manufacturer's Products manufactured by Subcontractor. Manufacturer will provide appropriate documentation to Subcontractor to effect any changes to the Device Master Record, manufacturing process or changes in materials.",
                "changed_text": "Subcontractor may notify Manufacturer prior to implementing changes that require amendments to the Device Master Record, manufacturing process changes or material changes relating to the manufacture and distribution of Manufacturer's Products. Manufacturer might notify Subcontractor of changes to the Device Master Record, manufacturing process changes or material changes relating to the manufacture of Manufacturer's Products manufactured by Subcontractor. Manufacturer will attempt to provide documentation to Subcontractor to effect changes to the Device Master Record, manufacturing process or changes in materials.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that 'Subcontractor will notify Manufacturer and obtain approval prior to implementing changes,' which creates a clear obligation for prior notification and approval, but it is changed to 'Subcontractor may notify Manufacturer prior to implementing changes,' creating uncertainty. The original text says, 'Manufacturer will notify Subcontractor of all changes' while the modified text says, 'Manufacturer might notify Subcontractor of changes,' weakening the mandatory requirement to a possibility. The original text specifies 'Manufacturer will provide appropriate documentation,' which is softened to 'Manufacturer will attempt to provide documentation,' reducing the obligation to make a diligent effort rather than a guaranteed provision. The shift from mandatory ('will notify', 'will provide') to permissive or suggestive ('may notify', 'might notify', 'attempt to provide') creates ambiguity and potentially undermines the change control process, as the new language does not guarantee that changes will be communicated or properly documented. Under 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation), a well-defined change control process is essential to ensure that changes to the manufacturing process and device specifications are properly evaluated, documented, and approved before implementation.",

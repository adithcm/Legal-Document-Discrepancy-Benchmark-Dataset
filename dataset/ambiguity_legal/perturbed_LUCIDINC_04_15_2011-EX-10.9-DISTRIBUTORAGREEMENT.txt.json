                "changed_text": "A) The Distributor will use reasonable efforts to promote the Product to potentially relevant End Users within some market segments within the Territory.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'best efforts' to 'reasonable efforts' introduces ambiguity, weakening the obligation. Replacing 'all relevant End Users' with 'potentially relevant End Users' further dilutes the responsibility. Specifying 'some market segments' instead of 'all relevant market segments' adds another layer of ambiguity, making it difficult to enforce a specific standard of promotion and sales, this goes against generally accepted good faith business practices.",

                "changed_text": "E) The distributor will endeavor to keep Lucid generally informed of details of units and customer details to generally fulfill requirements.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to keep Lucid informed' with 'will endeavor to keep Lucid generally informed' weakens the obligation. Removing specific mention of 'forthcoming and installed units' and customer details such as 'customer name, address and email details' reduces clarity. Replacing 'at a level sufficient to fulfill all requirements of US Government Export Administration Regulations and Lucid quality audits' with 'to generally fulfill requirements' introduces significant ambiguity, creating non-compliance with specific regulations like US Government Export Administration Regulations.",

                "original_text": "A) DISTRIBUTOR will IMMEDIATELY report via telephone communication to Lucid any incidents that involve the use of PRODUCTS sold by the DISTRIBUTOR to end users that affect patient safety or well-being (an \"INCIDENT\"). Such oral incident reporting will be followed immediately by a written incident report that documents the detailed conditions that resulted in the INCIDENT and Distributor shall thereafter co-operate with Lucid in the investigation of any and all conditions that led to, or resulted from the INCIDENT.",
                "changed_text": "A) DISTRIBUTOR may report to Lucid any incidents that potentially involve the use of PRODUCTS sold by the DISTRIBUTOR to end users that appear to affect patient safety or well-being (an \"INCIDENT\"). An oral incident report may be followed by a written incident report and Distributor will attempt to cooperate with Lucid in the investigation of conditions.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will IMMEDIATELY report' to 'may report' makes reporting discretionary. Replacing 'involve the use of PRODUCTS...that affect patient safety or well-being' with 'potentially involve the use of PRODUCTS...that appear to affect patient safety or well-being' introduces subjectivity. Changing 'Such oral incident reporting will be followed immediately by a written incident report' to 'An oral incident report may be followed by a written incident report' removes the mandatory requirement for a written report. Changing 'Distributor shall thereafter co-operate' to 'Distributor will attempt to cooperate' weakens the obligation to cooperate in investigations. These modifications undermine the reporting and investigative responsibilities, creating a contradiction with regulations such as those mandated by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for medical device reporting, where prompt and thorough incident reporting is critical.",

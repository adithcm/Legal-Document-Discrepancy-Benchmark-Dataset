                "original_text": "The Sub-Advisor shall act honestly, with due skill, care and diligence and fairly and in the best interest of the Partnership in carrying out its obligations under this Agreement and shall use all reasonable endeavours to perform its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with FSMA, the FCA Rules and any other laws, regulations, guidelines and guidance as may be in force from time to time and applicable to the Funds and their business or to the Sub-Advisor (\"Applicable Law\").",
                "changed_text": "The Sub-Advisor should endeavor to act with general honesty and reasonable skill, care, and diligence, and with consideration for the interests of the Partnership when carrying out its obligations. The Sub-Advisor will attempt to perform its obligations under this Agreement in a manner that generally aligns with FSMA, the FCA Rules, and other laws, regulations, guidelines and guidance applicable to the Funds and their business or to the Sub-Advisor (“Applicable Law”).",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the Sub-Advisor's obligations by replacing 'shall act honestly' with 'should endeavor to act with general honesty,' reducing the standard from a strict requirement to a more suggestive one. The phrase 'reasonable skill, care and diligence' is replaced with 'general honesty and reasonable skill, care and diligence' is also less stringent. Further, the commitment to 'use all reasonable endeavors' to comply with applicable law is watered down to 'attempt to perform in a manner that generally aligns with,' creating ambiguity around the level of compliance expected. This ambiguity could allow for non-compliance with specific FCA rules, potentially violating the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.",

                "changed_text": "The Sub-Advisor will maintain records relating to the services provided under this Agreement for a period of time it deems appropriate, including records related to the acquisition, holding and disposal of securities, details of brokers used, and the amount of brokerage commission paid. The specifics of record-keeping will be determined at the Sub-Advisor's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall maintain proper and complete records...as may be required under Applicable Law' with 'will maintain records...for a period of time it deems appropriate,' the obligation to comply with legal record-keeping requirements is weakened. Also replacing 'aggregate dollar amount of brokerage commission paid' to simply 'amount of brokerage commission paid' also weakens the clarity of the text. Adding 'The specifics of record-keeping will be determined at the Sub-Advisor's discretion' further introduces ambiguity and subjectivity. This contradicts the FCA rules, which mandate specific record-keeping requirements for investment firms, leaving room for dispute over compliance.",

It will aim to maintain a scope of permission that generally allows it to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, and will endeavor to adhere to the FCA Rules as it understands them.",
                "explanation": "The original text commits the Sub-Advisor to 'take all reasonable steps' to remain authorized under FSMA and to 'comply' with applicable FCA Rules. The modified version weakens these commitments by stating the Sub-Advisor 'intends' to remain authorized 'to the extent it finds feasible,' and 'will endeavor to adhere to' the FCA Rules 'as it understands them.' The introduction of subjectivity ('as it understands them') and qualifiers ('to the extent it finds feasible,' 'will endeavor') makes the Sub-Advisor's obligations vague and potentially non-enforceable. This could lead to a violation of FSMA if the Sub-Advisor fails to maintain proper authorization or comply with necessary regulations.",

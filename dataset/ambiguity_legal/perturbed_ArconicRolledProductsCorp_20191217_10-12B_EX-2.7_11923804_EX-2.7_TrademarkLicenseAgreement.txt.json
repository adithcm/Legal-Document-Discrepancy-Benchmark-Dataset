Licensee shall execute any and all documents which Licensor may reasonably request in support of such registrations, and, at Licensor's request, Licensee shall provide use evidence, testimony, and documentation that may be required in any ex parte or inter partes administrative proceedings and prosecutions, maintenance and renewals involving registrations of the Licensed Mark, at Licensee's sole expense.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee will consider cooperating with Licensor in the registration of the Licensed Mark worldwide, and in maintaining and protecting existing registrations. Licensee may execute documents which Licensor requests in support of such registrations, and Licensee may provide use evidence, testimony, and documentation that may be required in administrative proceedings related to registrations of the Licensed Mark.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to reasonably cooperate' to 'will consider cooperating' makes the obligation to cooperate optional and vague. Changing 'shall execute' to 'may execute' and 'shall provide' to 'may provide' further weakens the mandatory nature of the Licensee's assistance. This introduces ambiguity about the extent of the Licensee's commitment, making enforcement difficult.",

At Licensor's reasonable request during each calendar year, Licensee shall submit samples to Licensor, at no cost to Licensor, and shall not materially depart therefrom without Licensor's prior express written consent.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor, as owner of the Licensed Mark, may, at its discretion, offer suggestions regarding the nature and quality of the Licensed Products, and may request to inspect Licensee's business operations following notification. At Licensor's request, when deemed appropriate, Licensee should consider submitting samples to Licensor, and may depart from previous quality standards if it deems necessary.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall have the right at all times to control and approve' to 'may, at its discretion, offer suggestions' weakens the Licensor's control over quality. Replacing 'shall submit samples' with 'should consider submitting samples' and 'shall not materially depart therefrom without Licensor's prior express written consent' with 'may depart from previous quality standards if it deems necessary' makes quality control discretionary and vague. This undermines the Licensor's ability to maintain brand integrity.",

Compliance with guidelines becomes optional rather than mandatory. This is ambiguous since the Licensee is not obligated to take action.",

                "changed_text": "Party B should use reasonable efforts to comply with relevant industry laws, rules and standards promulgated by the State. Party B will try not to distribute illegal, unhealthy, reactionary information or advertisement or such other junk information on the Internet.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict compliance, while the modified version uses 'should use reasonable efforts,' which is ambiguous and weakens the obligation. There is no clear definition of what constitutes 'reasonable efforts.' Additionally, replacing 'shall not distribute' with 'will try not to distribute' makes the prohibition discretionary.",

At the same time, the Parties confirm that Party A shall have the ownership of the user files, and the user files and information shall belong to Party A's confidential information, for which Party B shall take the confidentiality obligation hereunder; Party B shall not use such information for any purposes other than those agreed herein without authorization, or provide such information to any third party in any manner whatsoever.",
                "changed_text": "Party B may, from time to time, provide Party A with network access for business inquiry and cancellation, and as needed, may provide data/reports on user development, user classification, user habits and business outlook forecasts if readily available. Party A will have the ownership of user files, and Party B will endeavor to maintain the confidentiality of such user files, to the extent practicable. Party B will not intentionally use such information for unauthorized purposes or intentionally provide such information to third parties.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens Party B's obligation to provide data and ensure confidentiality. The phrases 'from time to time,' 'as needed,' 'if readily available,' 'to the extent practicable,' and replacing 'shall not' with 'will not intentionally' all introduce ambiguity and discretion. This makes it more difficult for Party A to enforce data provision and confidentiality requirements.",

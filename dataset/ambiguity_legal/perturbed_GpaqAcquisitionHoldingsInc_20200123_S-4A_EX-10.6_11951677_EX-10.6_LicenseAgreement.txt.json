                "changed_text": "Each of the Village Media Company and PFHOF, as applicable, will endeavor to comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations related to its operations and will attempt to obtain and maintain necessary licenses and permits.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandated material compliance with laws, ordinances, and regulations. The modified text weakens this obligation by using 'endeavor to comply' and 'attempt to obtain,' which are subjective and do not guarantee compliance. This introduces ambiguity and potential non-compliance with mandatory legal requirements.",

The arbitration shall be held in Canton, Ohio, and shall be before a panel of three arbitrators, one chosen by each of the Parties and a third chosen by the two arbitrators so chosen by the Parties. Not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the arbitration, each Party shall submit to the other the documents and a list of witnesses it intends to interview or call in the arbitration. The arbitrators shall apply the substantive law of the State of Ohio with regard to any dispute that becomes the subject of arbitration, and the arbitrators will be so instructed. The arbitrators shall issue a written opinion stating the findings of fact and the conclusions of law upon which the decision is based. The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.",
                "changed_text": "Any dispute between the Parties concerning the scope or interpretation of this Agreement may be submitted to arbitration. The arbitration, if elected, shall be held in a location agreed upon by both parties, or if no agreement is reached, in a location chosen by the arbitrators. Parties should endeavor to exchange relevant documents and witness lists before the arbitration, as deemed practical. The arbitrators will consider Ohio law, but may also consider principles of fairness and equity. The arbitrators will provide a summary of their findings. The decision may be considered binding.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandated binding arbitration under specific rules. The modified text makes arbitration optional ('may be submitted'), introduces vagueness in location ('agreed upon by both parties' or chosen by arbitrators), weakens document exchange ('as deemed practical'), allows arbitrators to consider 'fairness and equity' beyond Ohio law, and makes the binding nature of the decision uncertain ('may be considered binding'). This creates significant ambiguity and undermines the enforceability of the arbitration clause.",

The amount of any contribution will be determined at PFHOF's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates indemnification, defense, and holding harmless. The modified text replaces this with a discretionary 'consider contributing' and 'amount of any contribution will be determined at PFHOF's sole discretion.' This makes the obligation ambiguous and unenforceable, as it's up to PFHOF to decide if and how much to contribute, contradicting the principle of clear contractual obligations.",

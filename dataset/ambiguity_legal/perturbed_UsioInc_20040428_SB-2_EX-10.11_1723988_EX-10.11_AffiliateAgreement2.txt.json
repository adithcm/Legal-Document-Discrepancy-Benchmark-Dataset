                "original_text": "Affiliate shall use its best efforts to market and sell to  commercial businesses the Services of Network 1 and Network 1's subsidiaries and  to  locate individuals who are willing and capable of acting as Contractors of  Network  1  and Affiliate subject to the approval of all such individuals by Network  1  as  set  out  in  Section  2.01  [CONTRACTORS].  All  such Contractors must process Merchant applications and transactions exclusively through Network 1.",
                "changed_text": "Affiliate should consider marketing and selling to commercial businesses the Services of Network 1 and Network 1's subsidiaries and may attempt to locate individuals who could potentially act as Contractors of Network 1 and Affiliate, pending possible approval of such individuals by Network 1 as outlined in Section 2.01 [CONTRACTORS]. Contractors are encouraged to primarily process Merchant applications and transactions through Network 1.",
                "explanation": "The modified text weakens the obligation by replacing 'shall use its best efforts' with 'should consider' and 'may attempt,' making the marketing effort discretionary rather than mandatory. The removal of 'All such Contractors must' eliminates a clear obligation, and replacing it with 'are encouraged to primarily' introduces ambiguity. This contradicts the need for diligence in ensuring all contractors process exclusively through Network 1.",

                "original_text": "Affiliate shall locate, establish and maintain such offices (the \"Local Office\"), as it deems necessary for use by all Contractors  identified  by  Affiliate  and  accepted  by  Network 1.  Network 1 expressly  agrees  that  Affiliate shall not be geographically restricted in its establishment of such offices.  Local Office has met the satisfaction of Network 1  in  terms  of  space, quality, appearance, equipment, supplies, office hours, support  staff,  working  conditions, and other factors materially affecting the working  conditions  of  its  Contractors.",
                "changed_text": "Affiliate may locate, establish, and maintain offices (the \"Local Office\") as it finds convenient for use by Contractors identified by Affiliate and accepted by Network 1. Network 1 agrees that Affiliate will generally not be geographically restricted in establishing these offices. The acceptability of the Local Office in terms of space, quality, appearance, equipment, supplies, office hours, support staff, working conditions, and other factors may be discussed between Network 1 and Affiliate.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposed requirements on the affiliate for locating, establishing and maintaining offices (the 'Local Office'). The perturbation weakens the affiliate's obligation to 'may locate, establish, and maintain' and replaces 'as it deems necessary' with 'as it finds convenient'. Further weakening of the affiliate's obligation can be seen in replacing 'Local Office has met the satisfaction of Network 1' with 'acceptability of the Local Office... may be discussed between Network 1 and Affiliate'. The changes remove the assurance that the affiliate will provide offices that meet the criteria to satisfy Network 1, which makes the affiliate's obligations vague and unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Network 1 will endeavor to possibly review Merchant Agreements submitted to Network 1.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens Network 1's obligation. Replacing 'agrees to make reasonable efforts to review and approve or decline' with 'will endeavor to possibly review' introduces a high degree of ambiguity and discretion. 'Endeavor to possibly review' implies no commitment to actually review or approve/decline merchant agreements, which directly impacts the fairness and enforceability of the agreement, particularly affecting the Affiliate's ability to generate revenue. The standard 'reasonable efforts' is more enforceable than 'endeavor to possibly review'.",

                "original_text": "Fox grants to Licensee a limited, non-exclusive right and license to distribute the following Wireless Products in connection with the Property \"ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN\" in the United States: (A) 2 Scrat voicetones; (B) 2 John Leguizamo voicetones; and (C) 3 premium videos.",
                "changed_text": "Fox grants to Licensee a right and license to distribute certain Wireless Products in connection with the Property \"ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN\" in the United States; the specific products to be distributed will be determined at Fox's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By stating that the specific products will be determined at 'Fox's discretion,' the original clear obligation to distribute 2 Scrat voicetones, 2 John Leguizamo voicetones, and 3 premium videos becomes vague. This allows Fox to potentially not provide those agreed-upon products, impacting Glu Mobile's ability to market them. The right and license is no longer well-defined.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - introduces uncertainty and potential unenforceability of the originally agreed-upon terms, making it difficult to prove damages in case of non-delivery of specific products.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee shall pay to Fox, or such other party as Fox may designate at their convenience, a royalty in an amount to be determined. \n\n(a) A royalty, potentially at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee's Gross Receipts (as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee's sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products, may be applied.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may be applied' and removing the definitive nature of the royalty rate introduces ambiguity. Also, designating a recipient 'at their convenience' introduces significant uncertainty in the payment terms. It creates ambiguity regarding when the royalty payment is due and to whom. ",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - The modification introduces significant ambiguity on the financial obligations, potentially rendering the royalty clause unenforceable due to vagueness. This violates the principle of having a definite and certain agreement.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'expressly amended or by necessary implication modified' with 'reasonably implied' makes the extent of modifications ambiguous, opening the door to subjective interpretations. Changing 'shall continue in full force and effect' to 'may continue in effect' weakens the guarantee of the original agreement's continued validity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law principles of Certainty and Enforceability - The change undermines the certainty of the original contract terms and makes it unclear which parts of the original agreement remain valid, which can be used as a defense to breach of contract. A valid contract must have definite terms.",

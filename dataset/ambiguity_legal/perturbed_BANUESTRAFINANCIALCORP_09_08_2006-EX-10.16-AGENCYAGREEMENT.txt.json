                "original_text": "The Company will use its best efforts to cause any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission, and will immediately upon receipt of any information concerning the events listed below notify the Agent (i) when the Registration Statement, as amended, has become effective; (ii) of any request by the Commission or any other governmental entity for any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement; (iii) of the issuance by the Commission or any other governmental agency of any order or other action suspending the Offering or the use of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectuses, the Prospectus or the Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, if any; or (iv) of the issuance by the Commission or any state authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of the initiation or threat of initiation or threat of any proceedings for that purpose.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will attempt to cause any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission, and will notify the Agent of the following events if and when it is convenient: (i) when the Registration Statement, as amended, has become effective; (ii) of any request by the Commission or any other governmental entity for any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement; (iii) of the issuance by the Commission or any other governmental agency of any order or other action suspending the Offering or the use of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectuses, the Prospectus or the Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, if any; or (iv) of the issuance by the Commission or any state authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of the initiation or threat of initiation or threat of any proceedings for that purpose.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to notify the agent promptly by replacing 'use its best efforts' with 'attempt to' and 'immediately upon receipt' with 'if and when it is convenient.' This creates ambiguity about when the company is actually required to inform the agent, potentially delaying crucial information and hindering the agent's ability to comply with securities regulations. The original text implies immediacy, while the modified text allows for discretion.",

                "changed_text": "The Company intends to generally comply with the terms, conditions, requirements and provisions with respect to the Offering and the transactions contemplated thereby imposed by the Commission, by applicable state law and regulations, and by the 1933 Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated under such statutes, to be complied with prior to or subsequent to the Closing Date.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will comply in all material respects' with 'intends to generally comply' introduces significant ambiguity. The original text is a firm commitment to compliance, whereas the modified text suggests a weaker intention. The lack of specific boundaries on compliance creates the ambiguity. This contradicts the strict compliance requirements mandated by securities laws.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation by replacing 'will maintain appropriate arrangements' with 'will attempt to maintain some arrangements' and removing the specific deadline of 'the Closing Date' and replacing it with 'a Closing Date can be reasonably determined', the clause becomes open to interpretation and weakens the commitment to safeguard investor funds. This goes against regulations requiring investor fund security.",

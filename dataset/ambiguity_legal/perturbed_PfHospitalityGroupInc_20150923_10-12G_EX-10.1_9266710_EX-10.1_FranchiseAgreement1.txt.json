                "original_text": "6.19.1. Types and Amounts of Coverage. Throughout the entire Term, you must maintain such types of insurance, in such amounts, as we may require. Such insurance is in addition to any other insurance that may be required by applicable law, your landlord, or otherwise. Policies that we require must be written by an insurance company reasonably satisfactory to us with an A.M. Best rating of \"A\" or better, and, must name us as an additional insured party. At a minimum, such policies must include the following: (a) commercial general liability insurance, completed-operations and independent-contractors coverage in the amount of $1,000,000, per person/per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage combined with a general aggregate of $3,000,000.",
                "changed_text": "6.19.1. Types and Amounts of Coverage. Throughout the entire Term, you should attempt to maintain insurance coverage as is reasonably practical given your specific business environment. Such insurance is in addition to any other insurance that may be required by applicable law, your landlord, or otherwise. Policies that you choose to obtain should be written by an insurance company with an A.M. Best rating that is potentially satisfactory, and, should endeavor to name us as an additional insured party. At a minimum, such policies may include the following: (a) commercial general liability insurance, completed-operations and independent-contractors coverage in an amount that is considered adequate, per person/per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage combined with a general aggregate of $3,000,000.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the mandatory language ('must maintain') to suggestive ('should attempt to maintain'), making the obligation discretionary. The phrases 'reasonably practical,' 'potentially satisfactory,' and 'considered adequate' introduce significant ambiguity, undermining the enforceability of the insurance requirements. This contradicts standard business practices and potentially violates legal obligations to maintain adequate insurance coverage, leaving the franchisor exposed to liability.",

You agree to comply with all mandatory specifications and procedures set forth from time to time in our confidential operating manual (the \"Manual\"). You acknowledge that the accounting practices, record keeping, software, services, and operation of your Franchised Business are important to us and our other franchisees. However, you acknowledge that we have the right to vary our standards and specifications, in our reasonable judgment, to accommodate circumstances of individual franchisees.",
                "changed_text": "6.1. Compliance with Standards. You are expected to generally consider the specifications and procedures outlined from time to time in our confidential operating manual (the \"Manual\"). You acknowledge that the accounting practices, record keeping, software, services, and operation of your Franchised Business are somewhat important to us and our other franchisees. However, you acknowledge that we have the right to liberally vary our standards and specifications, in our loosely defined judgment, to accommodate circumstances of individual franchisees.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the franchisee's obligation to comply with mandatory standards by using terms like 'expected to generally consider' instead of 'agree to comply'. The insertion of 'somewhat important' and 'loosely defined judgment' creates ambiguity regarding the importance of compliance and the criteria for varying standards, potentially contradicting the core principles of a franchise system that relies on uniformity and consistency.",

",
                "explanation": "The alteration replaces 'must keep' with 'will make efforts to keep', weakening the obligation. The removal of 'highest degree' and replacement with 'generally acceptable condition' introduces subjective standards. The removal of 'in accordance with our standards and specifications' eliminates a clear benchmark for compliance, contradicting the franchisor's brand standards.",

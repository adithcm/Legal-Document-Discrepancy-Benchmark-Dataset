                "original_text": "XIMAGE will provide to MORPHO during the term hereof \"Software      Maintenance Services\" which shall include remedial maintenance service      (i.e, error fixing and/or work arounds) for any significant error,      malfunction or defect (collectively in \"Error\") in the Software so that      the Software will operate in accordance with the specifications set      forth in the related documentation. Correction of Errors is subject to      MORPHO's prompt notification to XIMAGE of the nature and description of      the Error provided that the Error is not caused by the abuse, misuse or      neglect of the products by MORPHO.",
                "changed_text": "XIMAGE will endeavor to provide Software Maintenance Services, which may include remedial maintenance service for errors in the Software. Correction of Errors is subject to MORPHO notifying XIMAGE of the Error if MORPHO deems it appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that XIMAGE *will* provide software maintenance services and correct errors. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating XIMAGE *will endeavor* which is vague, and makes error correction conditional on MORPHO's subjective assessment of whether notification is appropriate. This weakens XIMAGE's obligation.",

                "changed_text": "XIMAGE will aim to respond to telephone calls made in a timely manner.",
                "explanation": "This replaces a specific, measurable obligation (30-minute response time) with a vague commitment to respond 'in a timely manner.' The lack of a defined timeframe makes the obligation unenforceable and open to interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and definite obligations; the 'timely manner' clause is too vague to be enforced.",

                "original_text": "In the event that MORPHO require the attendance of an XIMAGE engineer on      site, XIMAGE shall upon such a demand (either written or verbal) make      their best efforts to dispatch the engineer as expeditiously as      possible. XIMAGE undertake to have an engineer on site in Kuwait within      72 hours from the time the request was made, exclusive of the time      required to arrange for travel and obtain the required documents, and      the actual travel time itself.",
                "changed_text": "If MORPHO requests an XIMAGE engineer on site, XIMAGE will attempt to dispatch an engineer in a reasonable timeframe. The specific timing of the engineer's arrival in Kuwait will be subject to XIMAGEâ€™s discretion.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the 'best efforts' and the 72-hour timeframe with 'attempt' and 'reasonable timeframe' introduces significant ambiguity. This makes the time-sensitive requirement of on-site support discretionary, allowing XIMAGE to delay without clear accountability. The phrase 'subject to XIMAGE's discretion' makes the obligation entirely unenforceable.",

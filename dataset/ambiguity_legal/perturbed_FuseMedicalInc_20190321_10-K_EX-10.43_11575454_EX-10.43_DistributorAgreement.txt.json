                "explanation": "The original text contains clear and binding obligations on the distributor. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using phrases like 'consider using,' 'as it sees fit,' 'if possible,' 'endeavor to,' 'when convenient,' 'somewhat adequate,' 'only with the distributor's permission,' and 'consider directives.' This makes the distributor's obligations discretionary and harder to enforce. It weakens the commitment to promoting the products, maintaining adequate inventory, and complying with supplier directives, allowing the distributor to potentially disregard key responsibilities without a clear breach of contract.",

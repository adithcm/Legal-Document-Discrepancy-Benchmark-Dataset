                "changed_text": "BOSCH may reserve the right to keep product generation and delivery confidential, potentially limiting audit access.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that product generation and delivery is not available for any type of audit. The modified text introduces ambiguity with \"may reserve the right\", weakening the restriction and making it unclear whether audit access is completely restricted. It also phrases it as \"potentially limiting audit access,\" which opens the door to various interpretations. This contradicts standard business practices regarding financial transparency and may violate laws requiring financial audits or regulatory oversight.",

                "changed_text": "BOSCH will endeavor to assist CLIENT in obtaining licenses and/or permits, as BOSCH deems reasonably necessary, for the sales, distribution, and placement of the Product within the Territory.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the legal obligation. Replacing 'shall assist' with 'will endeavor to assist' makes the assistance discretionary. The phrase 'as BOSCH deems reasonably necessary' introduces a subjective element, allowing BOSCH to decide the level of assistance provided. This contradicts local laws requiring businesses to acquire specific permits or licenses for product sales and installation.",

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states the client's responsibility to defend and indemnify BOSCH. The new text introduces ambiguity by replacing \"agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless\" with \"will attempt to indemnify and hold harmless.\" The inclusion of \"some claims\" and \"subject to CLIENT's available resources\" creates uncertainty. This ambiguity contradicts standard indemnification clauses and may not be enforceable, especially if a substantial claim arises and the client's resources are limited.",

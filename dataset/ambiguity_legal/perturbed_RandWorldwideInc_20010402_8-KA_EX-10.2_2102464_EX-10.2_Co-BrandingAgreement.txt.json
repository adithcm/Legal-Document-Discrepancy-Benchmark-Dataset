                "original_text": "For as long as PlanetCAD hosts the Co-Branded Service, PlanetCAD will maintain and continuously update Dassault Systemes' Customer Database(s), which shall include without limitation, databases of Dassault Systemes Customers, of demands from and results of Web services supplied to Dassault Systemes Customers and associated Net Revenue and of data collected via the Customer Relations Management (\"CRM\") environment. The Dassault Systemes Customer Databases must be held separately from any other databases held or maintained by PlanetCAD. If not held separately, the Dassault Systemes Customer Databases must be clearly identified and sorted out as the property of Dassault Systemes and the provisions regarding PlanetCAD's limited right of use and its obligation of confidentiality as set forth below apply without change.",

It is preferable that the Dassault Systemes Customer Databases are held separately from other databases, but if not, they should be generally identifiable as belonging to Dassault Systemes, subject to reasonable effort.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation to maintain and update the database by replacing 'will maintain and continuously update' with 'will endeavor to maintain and update' and 'shall include' with 'may include,' introducing ambiguity about the scope of data to be maintained. The phrase 'potentially data collected via a CRM environment' is unclear. Changing 'must be held separately' to 'preferable that...are held separately' makes data segregation discretionary. This introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation difficult to enforce.",
                "contradicted_law": "CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). These regulations mandate specific and stringent requirements for data handling, including clear obligations for data maintenance, updating, and segregation of customer data. The ambiguous language weakens these obligations, making compliance uncertain.",

During such two-year period, and upon reasonable notice to the Billing Party, the Non-Billing Party shall have the right to have an audit conducted through a licensed independent accounting firm, of any billings, collections, and taxes on such itemized statement, and to examine the records and books of account of the Billing Party in connection therewith. The Billing Party will bear the costs of such audit if a discrepancy",
                "changed_text": "The Billing Party should, for approximately two years following each transaction relating to the Co-Branded Service, maintain records and books of account of such transactions including key particulars for potentially auditing payments to the Non-Billing Party under this Agreement. During a similar period, and with notification to the Billing Party, the Non-Billing Party may request an audit, potentially conducted through an accounting firm, of billings, collections, and taxes. The Billing Party might bear the costs of such an audit if a discrepancy",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates clear obligations for maintaining accurate records and audit rights. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with 'should,' 'two years' with 'approximately two years,' 'true and accurate records' with 'maintain records,' 'all particulars which may be necessary' with 'key particulars,' and 'shall have the right' with 'may request,' which weakens the obligation of the billing party. Introducing the word 'potentially' reduces certainty about the scope and necessity of the audit.",
                "contradicted_law": "Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) - This act requires publicly traded companies and their subsidiaries to maintain accurate financial records and controls.

                "changed_text": "Each party, therefore, acknowledging potential defenses such as laches, estoppel, or other delays, understands that the other party might seek a temporary restraining order or injunction in the event of a significant breach or anticipated significant breach of this Agreement, and may consider waiving the bond requirement in connection with such actions.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the ability to obtain injunctive relief by replacing 'consents and agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek and obtain' with 'understands that the other party might seek'. The original text provided a clear agreement on the right to seek injunctive relief, while the modified text introduces uncertainty.

                "original_text": "The Managers will jointly decide major issues concerning the Venture. Where Managers are unable to reach agreement in deciding major issues, approval by a majority vote of the Members at a regular or special meeting will be required.",
                "changed_text": "The Managers will generally decide major issues concerning the Venture. Where Managers are unable to reach agreement in deciding major issues, approval by a majority vote of the Members at a meeting that is considered convenient will be sufficient.",
                "explanation": "The word \"generally\" weakens the obligation for joint decision-making by the managers. Replacing \"regular or special meeting\" with \"a meeting that is considered convenient\" introduces ambiguity regarding the type of meeting and the process for determining convenience, potentially contradicting Florida's laws on business operations which require clearly defined decision-making processes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida Statutes Chapter 605 (Florida Revised Limited Liability Company Act) - particularly sections dealing with management and member voting rights, which imply a structured process rather than subjective convenience.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for \"accurate and complete books of account\" and \"in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)\" and replacing it with a vague statement introduces ambiguity. The phrase \"may be available for inspection by Members as determined appropriate by the Managers\" grants discretion to the Managers regarding access to the books, contradicting the principle of transparency and the Florida Business Corporation Act.",

                "changed_text": "Each Member may be indemnified by the Venture from harm or damages relating to Venture affairs as the Venture deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will be indemnified' with 'may be indemnified' and removing the exception for gross negligence or willful misconduct creates ambiguity and weakens the obligation for indemnification. The addition of 'as the Venture deems appropriate' introduces subjectivity, potentially conflicting with Florida law which has standards for indemnification that balances protection and accountability.",

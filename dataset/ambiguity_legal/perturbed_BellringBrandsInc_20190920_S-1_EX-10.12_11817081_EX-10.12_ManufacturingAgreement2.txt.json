The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier should endeavor to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") of approximately [***] (\"Units\") for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV may be [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, potentially contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and some form of approval of that facility by Premier by approximately January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier might purchase somewhere around [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several ambiguities. Replacing 'shall be required to purchase' with 'should endeavor to purchase' makes the purchase obligation non-mandatory. 'Approximately' before the unit count introduces uncertainty. 'May be' makes the MAOV for subsequent periods discretionary. 'Potentially contingent' and 'some form of approval' further weaken the requirements, making them difficult to enforce. 'Approximately January 1, 2019' is vague about the approval deadline. 'Might purchase somewhere around' introduces ambiguity to the purchase quantity.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'hereby agree' to 'will consider', the obligation to remove and replace Section 2(c) becomes uncertain and non-binding. The vague language allows for multiple interpretations regarding the parties' actual intent.",

                "explanation": "The use of 'potentially modified' and 'most other terms' introduces uncertainty as to which specific terms are affected and the extent of their modification. Replacing 'full force and effect' with 'some form of effect' creates further ambiguity about the enforceability of the original agreement's terms.",

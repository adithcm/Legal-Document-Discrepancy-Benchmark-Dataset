The use, release or other publication of forward-looking statements.\n\n  B.

                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees that it will put in place' to 'will endeavor to put in place' introduces ambiguity regarding the mandatory nature of establishing compliance policies. Removing 'commercially reasonable intent to ensure compliance with' weakens the obligation to comply with securities laws. Removing 'required' before 'disclosure of' also creates ambiguity. These changes make the obligation less stringent and potentially unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for AVDU to cooperate and provide information to UTK. The modified text replaces 'will cooperate' with 'will aim to cooperate,' weakening the commitment. Adding 'as AVDU deems appropriate' introduces subjective discretion, allowing AVDU to decide what information is provided, undermining UTK's ability to perform its services effectively. This introduces ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to a contract to act honestly and reasonably in the performance of their obligations. This modification allows AVDU to potentially withhold necessary information, violating this duty.",

                "original_text": "UTK shall not divulge to others, any trade secret or confidential information, knowledge, or data concerning or pertaining to the business and affairs of AVDU, obtained by UTK as a result of its engagement hereunder, unless authorized, in writing by AVDU. UTK represents and warrants that it has established appropriate internal procedures for protecting the trade secrets and confidential information of AVDU, including, without limitation, restrictions on disclosure of such information to employees and other persons who may be engaged in such information to employees and other persons who may be engaged in rendering services to any person, firm or entity which may be a competitor of AVDU.",

UTK represents that it has internal procedures in place.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'UTK shall not divulge' with 'UTK will try not to divulge' weakens the prohibition on disclosing confidential information. Removing the representation and warranty that UTK has 'established appropriate internal procedures' and replacing it with 'has internal procedures in place' creates uncertainty about the adequacy and effectiveness of those procedures, making it difficult to prove a breach of confidentiality.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (FUTSA), which requires reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of trade secrets. This change allows for a lower standard of care, potentially failing to meet the 'reasonable efforts' requirement.",

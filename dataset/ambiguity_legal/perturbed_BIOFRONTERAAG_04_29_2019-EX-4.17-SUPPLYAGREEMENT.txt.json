                "original_text": "2.4.3 CUTANEA shall notify Supplier within one Business Day, after it receives any materially adverse contact or communication from any Governmental or Regulatory Authority that relates to any Product. Supplier shall notify CUTANEA as soon as reasonably possible after it receives any materially adverse contact or communication from any Governmental or Regulatory Authority that relates to any Product and may reasonably be expected to affect patient safety.",
                "changed_text": "2.4.3 CUTANEA should endeavor to notify Supplier as soon as practical, if it perceives any contact or communication from any Governmental or Regulatory Authority that relates to any Product. Supplier will attempt to notify CUTANEA in a timely manner, after it possibly identifies any contact or communication from any Governmental or Regulatory Authority that could relate to any Product and may have a potential impact on patient safety.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear obligation for both parties to notify each other of adverse communications from regulatory bodies. The modified version introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with weaker terms like 'should endeavor to,' 'as soon as practical,' 'possibly identifies,' and 'could relate' weakening the obligation and creating uncertainty about the timeliness and necessity of notification. This could lead to delayed responses to regulatory issues, potentially endangering patient safety and resulting in non-compliance.",

                "original_text": "5.2 Compliance with the Act. Supplier shall bear sole responsibility for the validity of all test methods and appropriateness of all Specifications. In addition, Supplier shall bear sole responsibility for all regulatory approvals, filings, and registrations and adequacy of all validation, stability, and preservative efficacy studies including responsibility for adequacy of all validation, stability, and preservative effectiveness studies performed by Supplier on behalf of CUTANEA.",
                "changed_text": "5.2 Compliance with the Act. Supplier will generally be responsible for the suitability of test methods and the general appropriateness of Specifications. In addition, Supplier will typically be responsible for all regulatory approvals, filings, and registrations and sufficient validation, stability, and preservative efficacy studies including responsibility for reasonable validation, stability, and preservative effectiveness studies performed by Supplier on behalf of CUTANEA.",
                "explanation": "The change replaces 'shall bear sole responsibility' with terms like 'will generally be responsible' and 'will typically be responsible', which are vague and do not clearly define the extent of Supplier's responsibility. By including 'sufficient' and 'reasonable' before validation, stability, and preservative efficacy studies, it introduces subjectivity, making it difficult to determine what level of validation is required. This contradicts the clear requirements of the Act and FDA guidelines, where specific and rigorous validation, stability, and preservative efficacy studies are mandated, not just 'sufficient' or 'reasonable' ones. This vague language could result in inadequate testing and non-compliance with regulatory standards, potentially leading to unsafe products.",

Supplier, as the NDA holder for the Product, shall make all decisions with respect to any complaint or \"adverse drug experience\", or any recall, market withdrawal or any other corrective action related to any Product. Supplier shall be responsible for processing and submitting to the applicable authorities or agencies all reports of adverse drug experiences and Product complaints in accordance with applicable Acts.",
                "changed_text": "6.1 Initiating and Effecting Recall. Supplier, as the NDA holder for the Product, will usually decide with respect to any complaint or \"adverse drug experience\", or any recall, market withdrawal or any other corrective action related to any Product. Supplier will use its discretion to process and submit to the applicable authorities or agencies all reports of potentially relevant adverse drug experiences and Product complaints.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall make all decisions' with 'will usually decide' and 'shall be responsible' with 'will use its discretion' significantly weakens the Supplier's obligation regarding product recalls and reporting adverse events. The addition of 'potentially relevant' before adverse drug experiences and Product complaints introduces subjectivity into the reporting process. The changes contradict FDA requirements for mandatory and comprehensive reporting of all adverse drug experiences, potentially leading to underreporting and delayed corrective actions. This vague wording could result in the company failing to meet its regulatory obligations.",

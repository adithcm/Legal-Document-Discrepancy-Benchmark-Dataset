                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall in good faith work to provide reasonable service levels' with 'may try to provide service levels' introduces ambiguity, making the obligation to provide service levels discretionary rather than mandatory.

                "explanation": "Changing 'will comply with all laws and regulations' to 'will generally attempt to comply with most applicable laws and regulations' introduces a significant ambiguity regarding the extent of i-Escrow's compliance obligations. Replacing 'California Escrow Law shall prevail' with 'i-Escrow may notify 2TheMart, and the parties can attempt to resolve such potential conflict' makes the adherence to California Escrow Law non-mandatory, thereby contradicting the specific requirements set forth in the California Financial Code Section 17000 et seq.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall hold the other party's Confidential Information in confidence' to 'should endeavor to hold the other party's Confidential Information with reasonable care' weakens the obligation to protect confidential information. Similarly, replacing 'shall not disclose' with 'will attempt not to disclose' and 'as required to perform under this Agreement' with 'as deemed necessary' introduces subjectivity and ambiguity to the restrictions on disclosure and usage of confidential information. This contradicts standard requirements for the protection of trade secrets and confidential information, as it does not create a clear obligation for maintaining confidentiality.",

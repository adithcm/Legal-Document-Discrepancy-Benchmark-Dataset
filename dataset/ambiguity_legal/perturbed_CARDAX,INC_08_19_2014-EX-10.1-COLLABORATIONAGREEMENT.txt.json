                "original_text": "CAPSUGEL shall during the performance of the CAPSUGEL Development Activities ensure that, at all times, its employees, contractors, consultants, sub-contractors carry out their duties with all reasonable skill and care customary for the type of scientific research and development work covered by this Agreement and shall at all times comply with all applicable laws and regulations; record experimental data and all other material information relating to the CAPSUGEL Development Activities in individual notebooks or other appropriate formats and treat the same as Confidential Information; ensure that, at all times, its employees, contractors, consultants and sub-contractors are fully aware of and comply with the confidentiality provisions of their respective contracts which, for the avoidance of doubt, are comparable to the confidentiality provisions set out in this Agreement; keep CARDAX informed of the progress of the CAPSUGEL Development Activities by providing bi-weekly written reports and such other interim reports or updates as CARDAX may reasonably request.",
                "changed_text": "CAPSUGEL shall endeavor, during the performance of the CAPSUGEL Development Activities, to ensure that its employees, contractors, consultants, and sub-contractors attempt to carry out their duties with reasonable skill and care that they deem appropriate. CAPSUGEL will make efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations and will try to record experimental data and material information relating to the CAPSUGEL Development Activities in a format that they believe is suitable. CAPSUGEL will encourage its employees, contractors, consultants, and sub-contractors to be aware of the confidentiality provisions of their respective contracts; CAPSUGEL will provide updates on the progress of the CAPSUGEL Development Activities to CARDAX when it is convenient.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces multiple ambiguities. Replacing 'shall ensure' with 'shall endeavor' and 'attempt to carry out' weakens the obligation for CAPSUGEL's employees to perform their duties with reasonable skill and care. Stating they will 'make efforts to comply' and record data in a 'suitable' format makes compliance and record-keeping subjective and discretionary. Reducing the commitment of CAPSUGEL to providing bi-weekly written reports of updates to 'when it is convenient' also creates ambiguity. These changes make the legal requirements vague and potentially unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "In addition, CAPSUGEL will use its best judgement in deciding whether to meet U.S. FDA and other regulatory demands.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts to meet all reasonable U.S. FDA and other appropriate regulatory demands' to 'use its best judgement in deciding whether to meet U.S. FDA and other regulatory demands' introduces ambiguity. The original text requires a defined standard of effort (Commercially Reasonable Efforts), whereas the modified text makes compliance discretionary based on CAPSUGEL's subjective 'best judgment'. This contradicts the objective standards typically required by regulatory bodies such as the FDA.",
                "contradicted_law": "FDA regulations require adherence to specific, objective standards and procedures, not subjective judgment.",

                "original_text": "CAPSUGEL shall keep true, accurate, and complete books, records, reports, and accounts (hereinafter \"Records\") of all business or activities in connection with or relating to the manufacture, storage, handling, and shipment, including all validations, qualification, and validation protocols, of Product and this Agreement. CARDAX has the right, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, to inspect and examine such Records. CAPSUGEL agrees to retain all such Records for a period of five (5) years after the expiration of the Term or after termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "CAPSUGEL will attempt to maintain books, records, reports, and accounts (hereinafter \"Records\") of business or activities related to the manufacture, storage, handling, and shipment of Product. CAPSUGEL will retain such Records as long as it deems necessary.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall keep true, accurate, and complete books, records, reports and accounts' to 'will attempt to maintain books, records, reports, and accounts' introduces uncertainty as it does not guarantee that such records will be accurately kept. Removing the requirement for validations and validation protocols weakens the requirement for documentation. Replacing a fixed term of 'five (5) years' to CAPSUGEL retaining records 'as long as it deems necessary' creates an ambiguity on how long such records must be retained. This makes the terms difficult to enforce and open to manipulation by CAPSUGEL.",
                "contradicted_law": "FDA's cGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice) regulations, 21 CFR Part 211, require accurate record-keeping and retention periods.",

                "original_text": "Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement, infringes any patent issued in the United States, Germany, or in the country in which the Customer requested delivery of the Product or any copyright or misappropriates any trade secret, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim; and (iii) gives Accuray, at Accuray's expense, all reasonable information, assistance and authority in connection with the foregoing. Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent.",
                "changed_text": "Accuray may consider defending or settling any action brought against Distributor and may indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from liability, damages, and expenses (potentially including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) if a third-party claim alleges that a Product infringes any patent, copyright, or trade secret. Payment of costs and damages will be subject to Accuray’s discretion and dependent on Distributor: (i) providing notice of the claim; (ii) allowing Accuray to oversee the defense and settlement; and (iii) offering information and assistance. Accuray's approval will be needed for Distributor’s settlements or compromises.",
                "explanation": "The original text provided a clear indemnification obligation on Accuray's part. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'will' with 'may consider' and 'may indemnify,' making the indemnification discretionary. The phrase 'potentially including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees' further weakens the commitment. This contradicts standard practices in intellectual property law, where clear indemnification agreements are expected, and weakens the distributor's protection against infringement claims. This introduces a legal contradiction, making the obligation difficult to enforce.",

                "explanation": "The original text offered a firm warranty against 'material defects' with a defined term. The modified text uses softer language like 'endeavor to provide,' 'generally free from significant defects,' and 'in a manner generally consistent,' making the warranty less definitive. Replacing 'one (1) year' with 'approximately one (1) year' introduces further ambiguity. This contradicts standard warranty law, which requires clear and specific terms, undermining the enforceability of the warranty and increasing the risk of disputes. Under German law, warranties must be clearly defined and not misleading.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandated a prompt and written report of all customer complaints. The modified version weakens this obligation by changing 'shall report' to 'should, when feasible, inform,' making the reporting discretionary. The addition of 'significant' introduces subjectivity in determining which complaints need reporting. Replacing 'shall be provided' with 'may be provided' further reduces the mandatory nature. This introduces ambiguity and contradiction, potentially violating regulations related to product safety reporting or quality control requirements that demand timely and comprehensive complaint tracking. This creates ambiguity, which may lead to non-compliance with regulatory requirements for timely reporting.",

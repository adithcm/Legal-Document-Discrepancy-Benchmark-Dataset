                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Telnet shall maintain a first line of response, known within the telephony industry as a \"Tier 1 Subscriber help-desk and support function\", as further defined in Schedule \"B\", as is required to maintain Subscriber satisfaction at or above industry standards.",
                "changed_text": "Telnet should endeavor to maintain a basic level of subscriber support, referred to as a \"Tier 1 Subscriber help-desk and support function\", as generally outlined in Schedule \"B\", with the aim of generally maintaining subscriber satisfaction.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates that Telnet 'shall maintain' a Tier 1 support function to ensure satisfaction 'at or above industry standards.' The modified version introduces ambiguity by using 'should endeavor,' indicating a non-binding effort, and 'generally outlined' weakens the specific requirements in Schedule B. Additionally, replacing 'maintain Subscriber satisfaction at or above industry standards' with 'generally maintaining subscriber satisfaction' removes a measurable metric, making the obligation vague and unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Consumer Protection Laws in British Columbia, Canada, emphasize clear and enforceable obligations for service providers. This change creates vagueness in the level of support Telnet is required to provide, potentially violating consumer protection laws that mandate a reasonable standard of service.",

                "changed_text": "Galaxy shall endeavor to treat the Records with reasonable confidentiality, and access by third parties may be permitted under certain circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The original clause imposes a strict obligation on Galaxy to treat records as Confidential Information and limits third-party access. The modified version uses 'endeavor to treat with reasonable confidentiality,' making the confidentiality obligation less strict and subjective. 'May be permitted under certain circumstances' broadens the exceptions without specific limitations, potentially allowing for disclosures that would violate the original intent. This creates ambiguity about the extent of confidentiality and when third-party access is permissible.",
                "contradicted_law": "Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada. PIPEDA requires organizations to protect personal information with specific safeguards. The ambiguous wording in the modified clause weakens these safeguards and could lead to non-compliance with PIPEDA's requirements for data protection.",

                "changed_text": "Telnet should consider incorporating some of the terms set out in Schedule “C” as terms in their subscriber agreements, as they deem practical.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the original requirement. 'Shall include' is a mandatory directive, ensuring specific protections and clauses are present in every subscriber agreement. Changing this to 'should consider incorporating some of the terms as they deem practical' makes the inclusion of these terms discretionary. The phrase 'as they deem practical' gives Telnet the power to omit important subscriber protections, leading to varying standards and potential legal vulnerabilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Consumer Protection Act of British Columbia. This act requires businesses to provide clear and fair contract terms to consumers. The weakened language allows Telnet to create subscriber agreements that may lack essential protections, contradicting the act's intent to protect consumers from unfair contract terms.",

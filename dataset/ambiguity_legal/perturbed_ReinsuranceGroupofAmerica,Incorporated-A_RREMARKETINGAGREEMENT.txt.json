                "original_text": "The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts: (a) To furnish promptly to the Remarketing Agent and to counsel to the Remarketing Agent, copies of the Prospectus (and all amendments and supplements thereto) in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as the Remarketing Agent reasonably requests for internal use and for distribution to prospective purchasers. The Company will pay the expenses of printing and distributing to the Remarketing Agent all such documents.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will endeavor to furnish copies of the Prospectus (and all amendments and supplements thereto) to the Remarketing Agent and counsel as reasonably practical, accounting for internal resource availability, when the Remarketing Agent requests copies. The Company shall cover reasonable costs.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'agrees to use its reasonable best efforts' with 'will endeavor to furnish copies... as reasonably practical, accounting for internal resource availability' the obligation becomes weaker and more subjective. Using 'endeavor' and adding consideration for 'internal resource availability' makes the action non-compulsory. The original text demands action to furnish Prospectus copies promptly. Introducing flexibility, it is up to the company, making compliance uncertain, as the text no longer needs action.",

                "changed_text": "(i) The representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Trust in Section 1 are believed to be true and reasonably correct as of the Remarketing Settlement Date; the Company and the Trust have generally strived to comply with their agreements contained herein to be performed prior to or on the Remarketing Settlement Date; and the conditions set forth in Sections 6(k) are reasonably expected to have been fulfilled.",
                "explanation": "The language is changed from an assertion of truth and compliance to a statement of belief and striving. Removing the need for the Company and the Trust to comply. Introducing 'believed to be true and reasonably correct' rather than 'are true and correct in all material respects' decreases the certainty of representations, while 'generally strived to comply' weakens the compliance obligation to be met.",

                "original_text": "The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketing Securities in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part.",

                "explanation": "The original text sets a relatively clear standard of liability (gross negligence or willful misconduct). The modified text introduces ambiguity and makes it more difficult to hold the Remarketing Agent liable. By using 'may not incur liability' it introduces questions if the agent is liable or not. Changing it to 'intentional misconduct on its part' increases the burden of proof required to find the Remarketing Agent liable.",

                "original_text": "During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year following the expiration or earlier termination thereof, Customer agrees not to work with, directly or indirectly, any Third-Party that Customer comes to know through disclosure by Kubient as part of the Services, without the express written consent of Kubient and compensation to Kubient under the applicable exhibit and/or schedule.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, and for a period of approximately one (1) year following the expiration or earlier termination thereof, Customer should endeavor to avoid working with, directly or indirectly, any Third-Party that Customer becomes generally aware of through some interaction with Kubient.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear and enforceable non-circumvention clause. The modified text introduces ambiguity with 'approximately one (1) year' instead of 'one (1) year,' 'should endeavor to avoid' instead of 'agrees not to,' and 'becomes generally aware of through some interaction' instead of 'comes to know through disclosure by Kubient.' This weakens the obligation and makes it harder to enforce, as it's unclear what 'approximately,' 'endeavor to avoid,' and 'generally aware of through some interaction' actually mean. It is unclear if these changes will hold up under state law for breach of contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - Vague terms make enforcing the non-circumvention clause difficult and potentially unenforceable, which is the basis of contract law.",

                "original_text": "NON-SOLICITATION: During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year following the expiration or earlier termination thereof, Customer shall not, without Kubient's prior written consent, directly or indirectly (i) solicit or encourage any person to leave the employment or other service of Kubient; or (ii) hire, on behalf of Customer or any other person or entity, any person who has left the employment of Kubient within the one (1) year period following the termination or end of that person's employment.",
                "changed_text": "NON-SOLICITATION: During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, and for a period that might be around one (1) year following the expiration or earlier termination thereof, Customer should consider not, without Kubient's somewhat express consent, potentially and indirectly (i) casually mention opportunities that could lead a person to consider leaving the employment or other service of Kubient; or (ii) offer roles, on behalf of Customer or any other person or entity, to individuals who may have previously been employed by Kubient within a period vaguely resembling one (1) year following the termination or end of that person's employment.",
                "explanation": "The original non-solicitation clause is clear and enforceable. The modified version uses vague language: 'might be around one (1) year,' 'should consider not,' 'somewhat express consent,' 'potentially and indirectly,' 'casually mention opportunities,' 'may have previously been employed,' and 'vaguely resembling one (1) year.' These changes make the clause difficult to interpret and enforce, as the obligations are no longer clear and definitive. It is unclear if these changes will hold up under state law for breach of contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - The ambiguous wording significantly weakens the enforceability of the non-solicitation clause, undermining its purpose and potentially violating general contract law principles.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties should generally aim to reconcile revenue numbers and the revenue share calculations around 10 days following the end of each calendar month during which the Services were rendered.",
                "explanation": "This change makes the reconciliation timeline vague. 'Agree to reconcile' becomes 'should generally aim to reconcile,' and 'no later than 10 days' becomes 'around 10 days.' This weakens the commitment and allows for flexibility in meeting the reconciliation deadline, making it difficult to hold the parties accountable. It is unclear if these changes will hold up under state law for breach of contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - The ambiguity around the reconciliation timeline could violate general contract law principles that require clear and definite obligations, as the lack of a firm deadline makes enforcement challenging.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Blue Hills Parties hereby appoint the Agent as their exclusive financial advisor and conversion agent (i) to utilize its best efforts to solicit subscriptions for Shares and to advise and assist the Holding Company and the Bank with respect to the sale of the Shares in the Offering and (ii) to participate in the Offering in the areas of market making and in syndicate formation or to act as sole book-running manager in the Underwritten Offering (if necessary).",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Blue Hills Parties may consider the Agent as one of their financial advisors and conversion facilitators to possibly solicit subscriptions for Shares and to generally guide the Holding Company and the Bank with respect to the potential sale of the Shares in the Offering and to perhaps participate in the Offering in the areas of market making and in syndicate formation or to act as a potential book-running manager in a possible Underwritten Offering.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce ambiguity by changing definitive statements to possibilities, such as 'may consider,' 'possibly solicit,' 'generally guide,' 'potential sale,' and 'perhaps participate.' This weakens the Agent's defined role, potentially contradicting SEC regulations requiring clear and transparent agreements regarding financial advisors and underwriters.",

                "original_text": "The Holding Company will not sell or issue, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, for a period of 90 days after the Closing Date, without the Agent's prior written consent, any of its shares of common stock, other than the Shares or other than in connection with any plan or arrangement described in the Prospectus.",
                "changed_text": "The Holding Company will endeavor to not sell or issue, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, for approximately 90 days after the Closing Date, without vaguely consulting the Agent, any of its shares of common stock, other than the Shares or other than in connection with any plan or arrangement described in the Prospectus.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will not sell' to 'will endeavor to not sell,' '90 days' to 'approximately 90 days,' and 'prior written consent' to 'vaguely consulting,' the clause becomes non-committal and open to interpretation. This contradicts standard underwriting agreements which require a firm lock-up period to prevent stock dilution, which can lead to violations of securities regulations.",

                "changed_text": "The Blue Hills Parties will vaguely attempt to cause any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to perhaps be declared effective by the Commission and any post-approval amendment to the Applications to be possibly approved by the FRB, the Division or some other regulator when they deem appropriate and will try to notify the agent when information is received.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'use their best efforts' is replaced by 'vaguely attempt', indicating an undefined level of effort, the phrase 'to be declared effective' is replaced with 'perhaps be declared effective', indicating that there is no guarantee to declare effective any Registration Statement and the phrase 'any other applicable regulator and will immediately upon receipt of any information concerning the events listed below notify the Agent' is replaced with  'some other regulator when they deem appropriate and will try to notify the agent when information is received' suggesting that there will be selective or delayed notification, which means that the holding company won't have the Agent's approval on important decisions. This runs counter to securities regulations.",

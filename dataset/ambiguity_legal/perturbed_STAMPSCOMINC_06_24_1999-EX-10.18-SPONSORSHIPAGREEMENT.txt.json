                "original_text": "Intuit will maintain accurate records with respect to the calculation of Impressions delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Client may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Intuit, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect all relevant records of Intuit upon which the calculation of Impressions under the Usage Reports are based during Client's normal business hours.",
                "changed_text": "Intuit may maintain records related to the calculation of Impressions delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Client may, with reasonable advance notice to Intuit, request a review of Intuit's records, at a time that is convenient for Intuit, by an accountant.",
                "explanation": "The original text established a clear obligation for Intuit to maintain accurate records and allowed the client to audit those records with 30 days written notice. The modified text weakens this by making record maintenance discretionary ('may maintain'), removing the requirement for a Certified Public Accountant, and adding vague language about 'reasonable advance notice' and 'convenient' timing, which introduces ambiguity and makes it difficult for the client to enforce their audit rights effectively.",

                "explanation": "The original text established a clear exclusivity clause. The modified text weakens this clause. Replacing 'will not place' with 'will endeavor to avoid placing' and 'will not allow' with 'will discourage' introduces ambiguity and makes the exclusivity obligation less strict and harder to enforce. 'Endeavor to avoid' and 'discourage' are not definitive prohibitions. This could be seen as a breach of contract, if a competitor's advertisements were displayed despite the client's agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly defined the ownership of intellectual property rights. The modified text makes ownership ambiguous by adding qualifiers like 'as applicable' and 'to the extent permissible'. This introduces uncertainty about who owns what, potentially leading to disputes over copyrights or other intellectual property if the qualifiers are interpreted differently. By using these qualifiers, the legal obligation is obfuscated because applicable rights might not include copyrights or intellectual property.",

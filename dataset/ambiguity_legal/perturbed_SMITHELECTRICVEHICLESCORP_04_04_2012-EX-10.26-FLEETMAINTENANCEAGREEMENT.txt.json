                "original_text": "2.2 ensure the Vehicles are in a roadworthy condition and comply with all relevant legal and statutory requirements so far as the same is possible by the provision of the Maintenance Services, however, SEV shall not be liable under this Clause 2.2 in the event that the Vehicles are not in a roadworthy conditions due to DCL breaching a term of its obligations under Clause 9 or the Code of Practice;",
                "changed_text": "2.2 use reasonable efforts to ensure the Vehicles are generally in acceptable condition and aim to comply with legal requirements where practical through the Maintenance Services. SEV's liability under Clause 2.2 regarding vehicle condition depends on various factors, including DCL's adherence to Clause 9 and the Code of Practice, but shall not be held responsible for any condition of road worthiness.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation by replacing 'ensure the Vehicles are in a roadworthy condition and comply with all relevant legal and statutory requirements' with a weaker, more subjective standard using terms like 'reasonable efforts,' 'generally in acceptable condition,' and 'aim to comply where practical.' Adding ‘but shall not be held responsible for any condition of road worthiness’ limits SEV's responsibility, making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. This introduces ambiguity about the level of compliance required and the conditions under which SEV can be held liable for vehicles not being roadworthy.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies monthly inspections and tyre replacements for treads equal to or less than 2mm. The modified text changes mandatory monthly inspections to 'periodic tire inspections,' and mandatory tire replacement to 'possible replacement of tires,' and adds ‘as resources permit,’ and removing clear criteria for replacement based on tread depth. Changing the clear obligation to a 'discretionary' standard weakens the legal obligation, leaving room for interpretation and non-compliance with vehicle safety standards.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'use its reasonable endeavours to ensure that daily Vehicle checks... are completed (and recorded daily in writing)' with 'make an attempt to encourage daily Vehicle checks' significantly weakens the obligation. Removing the requirement for written records reduces accountability. Changing ‘are maintained at the correct levels’ with ‘where possible, to maintain fluid levels’ makes the action discretionary. This conflicts with the specific requirements for daily vehicle checks outlined in the original Code of Practice and weakens DCL's responsibility for vehicle maintenance and safety checks.",

                "original_text": "3.10 Where IntriCon supplies Products to a third party, IntriCon will, at its cost: (a) obtain and maintain all governmental and regulatory approvals necessary for it to exercise, and comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the exercise of, its license rights under this Agreement; and (b) comply, and ensure that all Products comply, at all times with any technical standards as may reasonably be required by law, and any licensing requirements, standards, or protocols established by the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers' Software Association (HIMSA) and the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers' Patent Partnership (HIMPP), it being acknowledged that Dynamic Hearing makes no representation or warranty that the exercise of the rights granted under this Agreement will not infringe any rights held by HIMSA, HIMPP or any other third party.",
                "changed_text": "3.10 Where IntriCon supplies Products to a third party, IntriCon will, at its cost: (a) make reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain governmental and regulatory approvals for it to exercise its license rights under this Agreement; and (b) endeavor to ensure that all Products are compliant with technical standards as may be generally understood, and consider licensing requirements, standards, or protocols established by the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers' Software Association (HIMSA) and the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers' Patent Partnership (HIMPP), it being acknowledged that Dynamic Hearing makes no representation or warranty that the exercise of the rights granted under this Agreement will not infringe any rights held by HIMSA, HIMPP or any other third party.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'obtain and maintain all governmental and regulatory approvals' with 'make reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain governmental and regulatory approvals', weakening the obligation. Similarly, 'comply, and ensure that all Products comply, at all times' is replaced with 'endeavor to ensure that all Products are compliant with technical standards as may be generally understood, and consider licensing requirements,' making compliance less strict and more subjective. The change to 'technical standards as may be generally understood' introduces ambiguity regarding what standards apply. This may be interpreted as not adhering to strict regulatory requirements mandated by law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Relevant regulations regarding medical devices in Australia, such as those enforced by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), which require strict compliance with specific standards and regulatory approvals, not just 'reasonable efforts'.",

                "original_text": "3.9 If any Identified Party, (with the exception of Sound Design) purchases DSP product sold or made by IntriCon with Dynamic Hearing's Hearing Aid Designer™ software and requests assistance to achieve HIMPP compliance for products using such DSP chips, IntriCon will use its best efforts to comply with the request for HIMPP compliance.",
                "changed_text": "3.9 If any Identified Party, (with the exception of Sound Design) purchases DSP product sold or made by IntriCon with Dynamic Hearing's Hearing Aid Designer™ software and requests assistance to achieve HIMPP compliance for products using such DSP chips, IntriCon will consider the request for HIMPP compliance.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'IntriCon will use its best efforts to comply with the request for HIMPP compliance' with 'IntriCon will consider the request for HIMPP compliance' significantly weakens the obligation. 'Considering' a request does not guarantee any action, creating ambiguity about IntriCon's responsibility to assist with HIMPP compliance. This is an instance where a clear 'best efforts' is replaced with a vague 'consider', reducing legal responsibility. By just considering it, it is non-committal and the 'best effort' has been removed to make it even more ambiguous.",
                "contradicted_law": "Relevant regulations regarding medical devices in Australia, such as those related to product safety and standards compliance that could be undermined if HIMPP compliance is not actively pursued.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'IntriCon must keep accurate and complete records' with 'IntriCon will keep records' removes the 'accurate and complete' aspect of the requirements, thus IntriCon may not be keeping full records that are not necessary for Dynamic Hearing. The phrase 'all other records reasonably necessary' is replaced with 'other records they deem necessary', giving IntriCon discretion over what records to keep. This ambiguity makes it more difficult for Dynamic Hearing to verify royalty payments, making it non-compliant.",
                "contradicted_law": "Standard accounting practices and legal requirements for transparency in financial reporting, which mandate accurate and complete record-keeping, not just what IntriCon 'deems necessary'.",

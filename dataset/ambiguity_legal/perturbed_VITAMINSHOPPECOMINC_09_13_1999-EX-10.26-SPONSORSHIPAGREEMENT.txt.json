                "changed_text": "Excite will generally control the \"look and feel\" of the Excite Network, including the display of brands and promotional links. Excite will aim to respect Client's logos and trademarks, and will consider Client's sponsorship status.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens Excite's obligation regarding the Client's branding and sponsorship status. Replacing \"shall not permit\" with \"will aim to respect\" and \"does not relieve Excite from its obligations\" with \"will consider Client's sponsorship status\" makes these critical aspects of the agreement discretionary rather than mandatory. This creates ambiguity about the level of protection Client's brand receives and the commitment to maintain their preferred status.",

Once per year, the parties will review these records to verify the accuracy and appropriate accounting of all payments made pursuant to the Agreement. In addition, Excite may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Client, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect the records of Client reasonably related to the calculation of such payments during Client's normal business hours.",
                "changed_text": "Client will endeavor to maintain records with respect to the calculation of payments due under this Agreement. The parties may occasionally review these records. Excite retains the option, with reasonable notice, to potentially request a review of Client's records by an accountant.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a clearly defined obligation to maintain accurate records and allows for an audit with a specific notice period. The modified text replaces 'will maintain accurate records' with 'will endeavor to maintain records', implying that perfect accuracy is not required. The removal of 'Once per year, the parties will review these records to verify the accuracy and appropriate accounting of all payments made pursuant to the Agreement', making those reviews discretionary. Replacing 'Excite may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Client, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect the records of Client reasonably related to the calculation of such payments during Client's normal business hours.' with 'Excite retains the option, with reasonable notice, to potentially request a review of Client's records by an accountant.' introduces ambiguity by softening the audit process, not defining the accountant's independence, and changing the notice requirements.",

                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation concerning user data ownership and license. Replacing 'User Data will be owned by Client' with 'Client will generally own User Data' introduces uncertainty about who truly owns the data and under what conditions. Replacing 'Client grants to Excite a non-exclusive license to use the User Data for the purposes of this Agreement' with 'may grant Excite a license to use it as needed' makes the license discretionary rather than mandated by the agreement, creating ambiguity about Excite's rights to utilize this data.",

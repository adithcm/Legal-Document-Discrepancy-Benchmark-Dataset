VOTOCAST will only access and disclose information as necessary to comply with applicable laws and government orders or requests, to provide the Services, to operate or maintain its systems or to protect itself or Licensee Users. In all such instances. VOTOCAST shall provide prior written notice to Licensee of not less than three (3) business days prior to accessing or disclosing such information so that Licensee may have an opportunity to dispute or restrict such disclosure. Licensee acknowledges, however, that Licensee and Licensee Users' content will not pass through nor be stored in a segregated or separate physical location from which VOTOCAST'S other users content will be transmitted or stored.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires 'commercially reasonable efforts' and 'shall provide prior written notice.' The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'will endeavor,' 'may access,' 'when it believes it is reasonably necessary,' and 'attempt to provide written notice.' This weakens the obligation to protect privacy and provide notice, making it less enforceable.",

The Company and the Association  will make every  reasonable  effort to prevent the  issuance by the Commission,  the OTS or the FDIC, or any other state authority of any such order and,  if any such  order  shall at any time be  issued,  to obtain  the  lifting thereof at the earliest possible time.",
                "changed_text": "The Company and the Association should endeavor to cause any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to possibly be declared effective by the Commission and any post-effective amendment to the Conversion Application to potentially be approved by the OTS and may notify Capital Resources of certain information concerning events listed below, confirming in writing if convenient: (i) when the Registration Statement, as amended, has become effective; (ii) when the Conversion Application, as amended, has been approved by the OTS; (iii) if comments are received from the Commission, the OTS, the FDIC, or any other governmental entity regarding the Conversion or this Agreement; (iv) if the Commission, the OTS, or the FDIC requests amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or additional information; (v) if any order suspends the Subscription or Public Offerings or the use of the Registration Statement or the Offering Prospectus; (vi) if a stop order suspends the effectiveness of the Registration Statement; or (vii) if an event mentioned in paragraph (h) occurs. The Company and the Association will attempt to prevent the issuance of any such order and, should one be issued, might try to obtain its lifting.",
                "explanation": "This introduces ambiguity by replacing mandatory terms with discretionary ones. \"Will use their best efforts\" becomes \"should endeavor,\" reducing the obligation's strength. \"Will immediately notify\" is replaced with \"may notify,\" making it optional. The addition of \"if convenient\" further weakens the requirement for written confirmation. This undermines the clear notification requirements for material events, required for regulatory compliance.",

                "explanation": "The original text ensures compliance with laws and regulations. The modified version replaces “will comply in all material respects” with “may generally aim to adhere to most,” weakening the mandatory compliance. The inclusion of “might try to adhere to the demands” and “potentially including” introduces ambiguity, making the obligation non-committal and unclear.",

                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear restriction on selling shares for 180 days. The modified version uses “will generally avoid,” making the restriction non-binding. “Approximately 180 days” introduces vagueness about the duration. The phrase “without possibly needing Capital Resources’ consent” suggests that consent might not always be required, creating uncertainty.",

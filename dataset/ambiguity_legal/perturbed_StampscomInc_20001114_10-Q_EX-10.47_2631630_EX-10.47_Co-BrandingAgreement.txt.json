                "original_text": "The Company shall bear all costs associated with the network operating center, including without limitation hardware and software, networking equipment and bandwidth charges, redundant storage and/or mirroring across multiple geographic locations, and maintenance; provided, however, that Company and MBE -------- ------- shall each pay one-half of the costs and expenses associated with transmitting information and data from the servers maintained or used by the Company to the VSAT network hub, including hardware and backhaul circuits.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will bear most costs associated with the network operating center, including hardware and software, networking equipment, and bandwidth charges, to the extent the Company deems reasonable. The Company and MBE may share some costs associated with transmitting information and data from the servers maintained or used by the Company to the VSAT network hub, as mutually agreed upon periodically.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the Company's responsibility for covering all network operating center costs and splitting VSAT hub transmission costs equally with MBE. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating the company 'will bear most costs...to the extent the Company deems reasonable' and the shared cost aspect is 'may share some costs, as mutually agreed upon periodically'. This weakens the legal obligation for the Company to cover costs and introduces an uncertain 'reasonableness' standard, making it difficult to enforce specific cost obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - Creates uncertainty around the enforceability of specific obligations, allowing the company to potentially avoid covering costs they originally agreed to bear which could be a breach of contract, but hard to prove because of the ambiguous language.",

Without limiting the foregoing, the Service shall be updated from time to time during the term of this Agreement to include accurate and current (i) Listings and (ii) pricing and service descriptions for each carrier supported by the Manifest, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt by the Company of such Listings, pricing and service descriptions.",
                "changed_text": "The Company may provide Updates to the Service, potentially in accordance with general Specifications, and may charge for these at its discretion. The Company will try to update the Service periodically to include listings and some pricing, where feasible.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation to provide updates according to specifications at no charge by introducing optionality and subjectivity ('may provide Updates', 'potentially in accordance', 'may charge', 'will try to update periodically', 'where feasible'). This contradicts the original intent, which guaranteed the updates at no charge. Also, this affects the entire agreement by introducing new payment terms in a place where the payment terms where initially already agreed upon.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - Fails to ensure consistent maintenance and accurate information, potentially affecting franchisees ability to perform their services effectively, weakening the purpose of the original agreement, and creating a violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "The Company shall maintain complete and accurate records of the number of packages shipped by the MBE Centers using the Service and all payments due or accrued to the Company by MBE Centers hereunder. MBE shall, at any time during the term of this Agreement, be entitled to audit all such records upon ten (10) days written notice to the Company, in order to confirm the accuracy of such records and conformance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that no more than one (1) such audit may be conducted in any -------- ------- ninety (90)-day period.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will keep some records of packages shipped and payments, but accuracy is not guaranteed. MBE may request an audit with reasonable notice, at the Company's convenience, although the Company retains the right to refuse such audits based on internal considerations.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall maintain complete and accurate records' with 'will keep some records...but accuracy is not guaranteed,' the change introduces an ambiguity around the quality and reliability of the financial records. Similarly, replacing 'be entitled to audit' with 'may request an audit...although the Company retains the right to refuse' significantly weakens MBE's audit rights, potentially allowing the Company to conceal financial discrepancies. \nThis contradicts principles of transparency and accountability.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - Restricting audit rights and failing to guarantee record accuracy affects MBE's capacity to monitor the business's financial integrity which is a breach of contract.",

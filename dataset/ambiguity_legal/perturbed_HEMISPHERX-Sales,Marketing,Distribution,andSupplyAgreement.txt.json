                "original_text": "D. SCIEN will ensure all necessary QA testing / approval for use occurs in the Territory and that each Product is stored under the conditions stipulated in a Quality Agreement (QA) to be executed and appended to this Agreement as Exhibit 4.",
                "changed_text": "D. SCIEN will reasonably endeavor to conduct QA testing as needed and will attempt to store each Product in suitable conditions. A Quality Agreement (QA) will be appended to this Agreement as Exhibit 4, outlining general guidelines.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates ensuring all necessary QA testing and specific storage conditions, creating a clear obligation. The modified text weakens this by using 'reasonably endeavor' and 'attempt to store,' which introduce ambiguity. This contradicts pharmaceutical regulations in both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which require strict adherence to quality control and storage protocols to maintain product integrity.",

                "original_text": "G. HEMISPHERX warrants that the Product (i) shall conform to the specifications set out in the SCIEN purchase order for Product and (ii) shall meet all, if any, reasonably applicable regulatory requirements in the Territory once Product is approved. In the Direct Access/ EAP setting, the Product that HEMISPHERX supplies must confirm with all manufacturing and regulatory requirements (including labelling) for the country in which said Product is intended to be sold. SCIEN's acceptance of the Product shall relieve HEMISPHERX from the obligations arising from this warranty",
                "changed_text": "G. HEMISPHERX believes the Product will generally conform to the specifications set out in the SCIEN purchase order for Product and will try to meet regulatory requirements in the Territory once Product is approved. In the Direct Access/ EAP setting, HEMISPHERX will aim to supply Product that aligns with manufacturing requirements. SCIEN's acceptance of the Product shall relieve HEMISPHERX from the obligations arising from this warranty.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall conform' to 'believes the Product will generally conform' and 'must confirm' to 'will aim to supply Product that aligns with' significantly weakens the warranty. The original text offers a guarantee of compliance, while the modified text only expresses an intention. This contradicts basic contract law principles regarding warranties and creates ambiguity as to the standards the product must meet, making it difficult to enforce compliance with regulatory standards.",

                "original_text": "A. Within 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter after execution of the Agreement, SCIEN will provide HEMISPHERX with quarterly reports on the number of Product Units sold and the Sales Price during the preceding three months, key market place issues and successes, regulatory and reimbursement subjects and revisions to the sales and marketing plans.",
                "changed_text": "A. SCIEN will attempt to provide HEMISPHERX with reports on the number of Product Units sold and the Sales Price during the preceding three months, key market place issues and successes, regulatory and reimbursement subjects and revisions to the sales and marketing plans. The timing and details of these reports will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'SCIEN will provide' with 'SCIEN will attempt to provide' introduces uncertainty about the reporting obligation. Adding 'The timing and details of these reports will be determined on a case-by-case basis' further exacerbates the ambiguity, allowing SCIEN discretion on when and how to report. This contradicts standard business practices and reporting requirements, which necessitate timely and accurate financial reporting, especially concerning sales and marketing activities that affect contractual obligations and revenue calculations. It also makes it hard for Hemispherx to follow the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'endeavor to,' 'may include,' 'possibly including,' 'reasonably staffed,' and 'potentially providing' introduce ambiguity and weaken the provider's obligations. This creates uncertainty about the specific services and level of support KCI will receive.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'promptly and fully cooperate' with 'make good faith efforts to cooperate' introduces ambiguity. The added phrase 'as reasonably practical' gives KCI considerable leeway to determine the extent of their cooperation, weakening the original obligation. The original text clearly states how KCI is supposed to address/resolve all issues, but the new text introduces uncertainty in the extent KCI must assist Provider.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - Introduces uncertainty in the standard of cooperation required, making it difficult to prove a breach of contract based on failure to cooperate fully under general contract law principles, including New York law, which governs the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall have the opportunity' with 'should be afforded a reasonable opportunity' introduces ambiguity about whether review and approval is truly mandatory, and the term 'reasonable opportunity' is subjective, weakening the provider's control over public statements about the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Defamation/Business Reputation - The ambiguity may allow for distribution of a press release that is not fully approved, potentially leading to reputational harm without a clear recourse, which may violate general principles of protecting business reputation under New York law.",

                "explanation": "Adding 'endeavor to' weakens the obligation, making it less strict. 'Endeavor to' implies an attempt but not a guarantee of achieving Commercialization, creating ambiguity. This is now less enforceable than the original clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "Article 11 of Korea's Pharmaceutical Affairs Act, which requires pharmaceutical companies to ensure a stable supply of medications after approval, a requirement 'endeavor to' may not fulfill, especially if the interpretation of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' is subjective.",

",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall reasonably inform' to 'may inform' and 'shall consult' to 'may consult' makes these actions discretionary. Adding 'to the extent it seems reasonable' introduces further subjectivity. This reduces the obligation on MacroGenics to share essential information required for Green Cross to meet regulatory requirement, which creates ambiguity and makes the obligation difficult to enforce.",
                "contradicted_law": "Korea's Pharmaceutical Affairs Act Article 42, which mandates that manufacturing processes are transparent, well-documented, and stable to ensure product safety and efficacy. By making the information sharing discretionary, the contract introduces ambiguity, conflicting with the principle of transparent documentation in manufacturing.",

Other information could potentially be provided to Requesting Party in connection with this audit right.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall disclose' to 'should generally disclose' makes the obligation less definitive. Adding 'may be disclosed' makes disclosure of discrepancies optional. 'Other information could potentially be provided' opens the door to sharing more than agreed, conflicting with confidentiality. This creates ambiguity about what information is shared during an audit.",
                "contradicted_law": "Korea's Act on External Audit of Stock Companies Article 21, which specifies strict limitations on the types of information auditors can share to protect confidentiality. By vaguely stating 'other information could potentially be provided,' the modified text introduces ambiguity and conflicts with these confidentiality regulations.",

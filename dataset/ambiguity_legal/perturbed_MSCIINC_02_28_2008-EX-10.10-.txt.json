                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "(d) In addition to the foregoing, each Party agrees that it shall, in all circumstances, use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate and otherwise minimize its damages, whether direct or indirect, due to, resulting from or arising in connection with any failure by the other Party to comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "(d) In addition to the foregoing, each Party agrees that it may use efforts it deems appropriate to mitigate and otherwise minimize its damages, whether direct or indirect, due to, resulting from or arising in connection with any failure by the other Party to comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'commercially reasonable efforts' to mitigate damages, which is a relatively clear legal standard. The modified text replaces this with 'efforts it deems appropriate,' introducing significant ambiguity. This could be interpreted as allowing a party to do very little to mitigate damages, even if more substantial mitigation was possible and reasonable, contradicting the principle of mitigation of damages in contract law. Replacing 'shall' with 'may' makes it optional.",

                "changed_text": "Any notice, instruction, direction or demand under the terms of this Agreement required to be in writing should be given upon delivery, if reasonably delivered by hand, facsimile transmission, or mail, to the following addresses:",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be duly given' to 'should be given' makes the requirement for written notice less mandatory and more suggestive. Introducing 'reasonably delivered' adds ambiguity to the delivery methods, making it uncertain whether a certain method was adequate. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over whether proper notice was given, impacting enforcement of the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement will be generally viewed in accordance with the laws applicable to similar agreements in the State of New York. MSCI Inc. is registered to do business in New York under the name NY MSCI.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be construed in accordance with and governed by' to 'will be generally viewed in accordance with' introduces ambiguity regarding the governing law. 'Generally viewed' is vague and does not create a definitive governing law provision. Changing the term to 'laws applicable to similar agreements' opens the door to arguments about which laws are applicable, and what qualifies as a 'similar agreement'. This undermines the certainty and predictability of the contract's interpretation. Also, notice that there is no more reference to the substantive internal laws",

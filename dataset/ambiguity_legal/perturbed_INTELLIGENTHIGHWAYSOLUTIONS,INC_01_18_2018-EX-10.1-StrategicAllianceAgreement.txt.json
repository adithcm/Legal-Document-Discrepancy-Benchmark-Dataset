                "original_text": "Bravatek agrees to serve as a non-exclusive project sales lead finder for Fazync. In this capacity, Bravatek will use its best efforts to provide the following services to Fazync    a. Promote, market and introduce the Products to prospective clients in the government space nationwide.      b.

Consider promoting, marketing, and introducing the Products to prospective clients in the government space nationwide. b. Provide a Pipeline or project information leads report to Fazync when feasible, containing a forecast of potential sales. c. Occasionally follow-up on project leads that Fazync is engaged with. d. Provide Fazync with promotional materials, technical papers, white papers, proposals, etc., if readily available, prior to publication or delivery to prospective clients.",
                "explanation": "The change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'agrees to serve' with 'will attempt to serve,' and 'use its best efforts' with permissive language such as 'may provide'. The use of 'Consider promoting', 'when feasible', 'occasionally follow-up', and 'if readily available' introduce ambiguity and discretion, contradicting the initial intention of a clear commitment. This shift introduces ambiguity regarding the level of effort and frequency of services provided by Bravatek, making it difficult to enforce any specific performance standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles of good faith and reasonable effort, implying a higher standard than what is now ambiguously stated.",

                "original_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with Fazync via email to IHSI's CEO, Devon Jones, and delivered through Bravatek or a Fazync -designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by Fazync at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at Fazync bank account.",
                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution potentially sold to clients introduced by Bravatek registered with Fazync via email to IHSI's CEO, Devon Jones, and possibly delivered through Bravatek, Bravatek might receive a lead-finder fee, subject to the discretion of Fazync, within an approximate range. The actual fee amount will be contingent upon various factors, and payment terms may vary.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'sold' is switched to 'potentially sold,' and 'delivered' to 'possibly delivered', creating uncertainty about when the fee is applicable. Replacing 'will receive' with 'might receive' makes the fee discretionary. The use of 'subject to the discretion of Fazync' and 'approximate range' introduces significant ambiguity about the compensation structure, leaving it open to interpretation. Removing the specific percentage range and the clear payment terms further obfuscates the obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract related to compensation disputes. The ambiguity created could violate general principles of contract law requiring clear and definite terms.",

                "explanation": "Switching 'shall indemnify' to 'may indemnify' makes indemnification discretionary rather than mandatory. Using terms like 'potential damages' and 'potentially arising' introduces vagueness about the circumstances under which indemnification is applicable. Adding 'if deemed reasonable' grants Fazync subjective control over whether to provide indemnification, fundamentally altering the obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Basic contract law principles regarding indemnification. The ambiguous language could prevent Bravatek from enforcing this clause in court, since the obligation is now conditional and unclear.",

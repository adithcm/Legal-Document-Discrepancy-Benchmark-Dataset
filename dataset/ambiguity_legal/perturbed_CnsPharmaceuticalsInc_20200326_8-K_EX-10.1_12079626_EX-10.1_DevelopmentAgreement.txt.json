To WPD's knowledge, WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) have been and currently are in material compliance with the GDPR. To ensure material compliance with the Privacy Laws, WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) have taken, and currently take, commercially reasonable steps reasonably designed to ensure compliance in all material respects with Privacy Laws relating to data privacy and security and the collection, storage, use, disclosure, handling, and analysis of Personal Data that WPD has collected, and collects, or is in WPD's possession or will be in WPD's possession during the Term.",

WPD believes that WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) are in general compliance with the GDPR. To support compliance with the Privacy Laws, WPD and its subsidiaries (if any) have taken, and currently take, steps designed to generally support compliance with Privacy Laws relating to data privacy and security and the collection, storage, use, disclosure, handling, and analysis of Personal Data that WPD has collected, and collects, or is in WPD's possession or will be in WPD's possession during the Term.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'will at all times be in material compliance' to 'will endeavor to be in compliance' weakens the commitment to strict adherence to data privacy laws. Replacing 'have taken or will take commercially reasonable actions' with 'will consider taking actions' introduces discretion. The use of 'might create a liability' instead of 'would be reasonably likely to create a material liability' minimizes the sense of urgency. Furthermore, 'general compliance' weakens the commitment to full GDPR compliance. Changing 'ensure compliance in all material respects' to 'generally support compliance' dilutes the specific obligations, making it vague.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned understands that PSS is under no ------------------------------------------------ obligation to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the --------------------------------------------------------------------- disposition of the undersigned's shares of PSS Common ----------------------------------------------------- Stock or to take any other action necessary to make compliance with an ---------------------------------------------------------------------- exemption from such registration available.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned understands that PSS may, at its discretion, consider filing a registration statement with the SEC covering the disposition of the undersigned's shares of PSS Common Stock or taking other actions regarding compliance with an exemption from such registration, but is under no strict obligation to do so.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'is under no obligation' with 'may, at its discretion, consider' introduces ambiguity and weakens PSS's responsibility to assist the undersigned in complying with securities laws. Adding 'but is under no strict obligation to do so' further reinforces this ambiguity. This could be interpreted to mean that PSS has no real duty to facilitate the legal sale of the shares, potentially leaving the affiliate in a difficult position to sell their shares legally.",

                "changed_text": "PSS intends, for approximately three years after the effective date of the Merger, to file reports pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The intention is that the public information provisions of Rule 145(d) promulgated by the SEC will be somewhat available to the undersigned should they desire to transfer any shares of PSS Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a clear obligation for PSS to file reports on a timely basis. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'agrees' with 'intends' and adding qualifiers like 'approximately' and 'somewhat available'. This makes the obligation less definite and creates uncertainty about PSS's commitment to providing the information necessary for the affiliate to sell their shares legally under Rule 145(d).",

                "changed_text": "If PSS's counsel believes, in its subjective assessment, that such proposed sale or transfer might possibly comply with Rule 145(d), PSS may consider having such counsel provide opinions to PSS's Transfer Agent, if it deems it suitable, to potentially facilitate the proposed sale or transfer.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens PSS's obligation. Replacing 'concludes' with 'believes, in its subjective assessment' makes the decision highly discretionary. Changing 'complies with' to 'might possibly comply' further undermines the assurance. The terms 'may consider', 'if it deems it suitable', and 'potentially facilitate' make the entire process optional for PSS, contradicting the intent of securities laws that aim to provide clear paths for legal transactions.",

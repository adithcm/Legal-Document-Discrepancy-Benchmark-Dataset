The Products shall only be sold by XSPA at the retail price of the applicable Product as set forth on Exhibit A (the \"Retail Price\"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Retail Price for the Products at the Stores in the Territory (i) may only be modified by mutual agreement of the Parties, and (ii) does not include any discounts, promotions or applicable sales taxes.",
                "changed_text": "XSPA should endeavor to display, market, promote, offer for sale and sell the Products set forth on Exhibit A in most Stores throughout the Territory. The Products should generally be sold by XSPA at the retail price of the applicable Product as set forth on Exhibit A (the \"Retail Price\"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Retail Price for the Products at the Stores in the Territory (i) can be modified at the discretion of XSPA, and (ii) may include certain discounts, promotions, or applicable sales taxes.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on XSPA to use commercially reasonable efforts and sell products at a fixed retail price. The modified text uses weaker language like 'should endeavor' and 'most Stores,' making the obligation less strict. The clause also ambiguously allows XSPA to modify the retail price and include discounts at its discretion, creating uncertainty and conflicting with standard contract law principles of agreed-upon pricing.",

                "changed_text": "With respect to each Store in the Territory, XSPA might consider using efforts to: (a) at some point after the Effective Date, (i) prepare notices and consents and take some actions to attempt to obtain approval for bulkhead signage from airport regulatory authorities or other entities whose approval is preferred for such Store and possibly install such bulkhead signage at some later date, and (ii) once potentially installed, maybe maintain such bulkhead signage for a limited time during the Term;",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a clear obligation to obtain and maintain approval for bulkhead signage promptly and throughout the term. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using phrases like 'might consider,' 'at some point,' 'attempt to obtain,' 'possibly install,' and 'maybe maintain for a limited time,' weakening the obligation and creating uncertainty about XSPA's responsibility for signage.",

                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear and strict obligation to operate with high standards and comply with all applicable laws. The modified text weakens the obligation by using 'will attempt' and 'reasonable standards', which are subjective and open to interpretation. Replacing 'shall at all times comply' with 'should generally comply' introduces ambiguity and makes compliance with laws discretionary rather than mandatory.",

                "original_text": "EKR shall at its own cost and expense use commercially reasonable efforts to take those steps reasonably necessary in order to obtain and thereafter maintain Marketing Authorizations (including pricing and reimbursement approvals) for the Product in those countries of the Territory other than the United States which the Committee determines to present commercially viable opportunities for the Product. EKR shall provide PPI with a copy of any original certificates of approval/registration in each country in the Territory other than the United States.",
                "changed_text": "EKR shall use efforts it believes are appropriate to attempt to obtain and maintain Marketing Authorizations (including pricing and reimbursement approvals) for the Product in those countries of the Territory other than the United States. EKR may provide PPI with copies of certificates of approval/registration at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'commercially reasonable efforts' to obtain and maintain marketing authorizations, which is a relatively objective standard. The modified text replaces this with 'efforts it believes are appropriate,' introducing a subjective element. The term 'may provide' makes the distribution of original certificates completely discretionary. This change contradicts regulatory requirements for pharmaceutical product distribution, which typically require clear and demonstrable efforts to obtain and maintain marketing authorizations and timely communication of approvals to all relevant parties.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term PPI shall endeavor to take actions to comply with all Applicable Laws and to obtain licenses, permits, records, and authorizations it deems necessary, so as to enable PPI to potentially perform its obligations hereunder and under the Supply Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a clear legal obligation for PPI to comply with all applicable laws. The modified text weakens this obligation by changing 'take all actions necessary to comply' to 'endeavor to take actions to comply' and 'obtain and maintain all necessary license' to 'obtain licenses, permits, records, and authorizations it deems necessary'. The term 'potentially perform' introduces a level of uncertainty that allows PPI to avoid compliance if they deem it unnecessary, or if their efforts are not effective. This change introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation unenforceable, potentially leading to violations of regulatory requirements.",

                "original_text": "In the event a claim of infringement of a Third Party's intellectual property rights arising out of the manufacture, use, sale, promotion or distribution of the Products is brought against either Party, PPI shall defend such action at its cost and expense and take one or more of the following actions simultaneously or sequentially:\n\n  (a) Defend the claim and indemnify and hold harmless EKR, its Affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, representations, consultants and agents (the \"EKR Infringement Indemnitees\") as set forth in Section 13.3 below.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of a potential claim of infringement of a Third Party's intellectual property rights arising out of the manufacture, use, sale, promotion or distribution of the Products, PPI may consider defending such action at a cost it finds reasonable. PPI may elect to defend the claim and indemnify and hold harmless EKR, its Affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, representations, consultants and agents (the “EKR Infringement Indemnitees”) as it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that PPI 'shall defend such action' and 'take one or more of the following actions simultaneously or sequentially'. The modified text introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall defend' to 'may consider defending' and stating that PPI will only defend the claim at a cost it finds reasonable, giving PPI discretion to avoid defending the claim. The phrase 'as it deems appropriate' gives further control over whether to indemnify EKR. This conflicts with basic contract law principles that expect commitments to be kept. The 'may consider' and 'deems appropriate' language severely weaken the obligation to defend against infringement claims, potentially leaving EKR exposed to IP litigation.",

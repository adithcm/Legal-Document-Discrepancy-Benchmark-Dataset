                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each Party will take all reasonable precautions to prevent damage to, or unintentional destruction of or release of any germplasm created in the RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will consider the need to take precautions to prevent damage to, or unintentional destruction of or release of any germplasm created in the RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'Each Party will take all reasonable precautions' to 'Each Party will consider the need to take precautions' introduces ambiguity by making the action discretionary rather than obligatory. This change makes it unclear what constitutes 'considering the need' and whether any action is actually required. It also removes the 'reasonable' standard, which, while somewhat vague, provides a benchmark for expected behavior.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States law. This can create non-compliance issues with regulations concerning genetically modified organisms, particularly those related to environmental safety and the unintentional release of GMOs, such as those enforced by the USDA and EPA. The original text implies a commitment to prevent harm, while the modified text only requires consideration, undermining the regulatory intent to prevent harm.",

            {

                "original_text": "Each Party shall be responsible for its compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, those relating to genetically modified organisms (to the extent RESEARCH PROJECTS involve such organisms). Each Party shall obtain any and all permits or authorizations or proceed to any notifications which may be required by such laws, rules and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will generally aim for compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, to the extent practicable, including, those relating to genetically modified organisms (to the extent RESEARCH PROJECTS involve such organisms). Each Party may attempt to obtain permits or authorizations or proceed to any notifications which may be required by such laws, rules and regulations.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguities that undermine the mandatory nature of regulatory compliance. Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'will generally aim for compliance' weakens the obligation, making compliance a goal rather than a requirement. Adding 'to the extent practicable' provides an undefined escape clause. Changing 'shall obtain' to 'may attempt to obtain' makes obtaining permits discretionary. These changes collectively weaken the commitment to legal compliance.",

                "original_text": "Each Party will require any and all of its employees or students who will perform activities in RESEARCH PROJECTS to be bound by a written agreement(s) that commits their inventions, discoveries and other intellectual property to the Party-employer and requires confidential treatment of Party and third-party confidential information.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will endeavor to ensure that its employees or students who perform activities in RESEARCH PROJECTS are subject to some form of agreement that addresses intellectual property ownership and confidentiality.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'will endeavor to ensure' significantly weakens the original obligation. It does not guarantee that employees or students will actually be bound by such agreements. 'Some form of agreement' is vague and does not specify the agreement must be written or legally binding. Removing the requirement that agreements 'commit their inventions, discoveries, and other intellectual property to the Party-employer' significantly weakens intellectual property protection. Removing 'requires confidential treatment of Party and third-party confidential information' weakens data protection and allows for disclosure.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States law. This weakened clause may not adequately protect intellectual property rights, which can create legal challenges under U.S. patent law (35 U.S.C. ยง 101 et seq.) and trade secret law, potentially jeopardizing the ownership and control of inventions.",

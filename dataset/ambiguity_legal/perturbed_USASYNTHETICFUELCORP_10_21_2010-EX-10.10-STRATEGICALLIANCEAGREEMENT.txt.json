                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Global Energy represents and warrants that the statements contained in this Section 4 are true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and will be true and correct as of the Closing Date.",
                "changed_text": "Global Energy represents and warrants that the statements contained in this Section 4 are believed to be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and will be believed to be true and correct as of the Closing Date.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"are true and correct\" with \"are believed to be true and correct\" weakens the warranty by introducing a subjective element. This ambiguity makes it difficult to enforce the representations and warranties, as Global Energy could argue that they believed the statements were true even if they were not, which makes it hard to hold them liable. This weakens the legal obligation.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party shall consider using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain authorizations, consents, orders, and approvals of, and to consider giving notices to and consider making filings with, all Governmental Authorities and third parties that may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations under, this Agreement and will generally cooperate with the other Party when seeking such authorizations, consents, orders, and approvals, giving such notices, and making such filings.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"shall use all commercially reasonable efforts\" to \"shall consider using commercially reasonable efforts\" and adding \"generally cooperate\", the obligation is weakened significantly. It becomes unclear if parties are legally obligated to pursue authorizations or filings, potentially conflicting with regulatory requirements specific to the gasification projects that are likely to be required by authorities such as the EPA.",

                "explanation": "The modification \"shall be generally subject to, and loosely construed with the spirit of the laws of the State of New York\" introduces ambiguity in the governing law clause. Using \"generally subject to\" instead of \"shall be subject to\" weakens the direct applicability of New York law. Stating that the agreement should be \"loosely construed with the spirit of\" the laws introduces significant uncertainty. Contract law requires that agreements be construed according to the actual laws, not just the 'spirit' of those laws. This contradicts established contract law principles and creates ambiguity about which specific laws will apply and how they will be interpreted.",

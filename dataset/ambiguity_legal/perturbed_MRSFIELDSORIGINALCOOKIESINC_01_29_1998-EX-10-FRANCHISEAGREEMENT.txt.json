                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Franchisee shall secure and maintain in force in his name all required licenses,  permits,  and  certificates  relating to the conduct of his  business pursuant to this  Agreement.  Franchisee  will  conduct the  Franchise in strict compliance  with  all  applicable  laws,  ordinances,   regulations,  and  other requirements  of any federal,  state,  county,  municipal  or other  government, including,   without  limitation,  those  laws  and  regulations  pertaining  to preparation,  purchase  and  handling of food  products,  occupational  hazards, health,  safety and sanitation,  worker's compensation  insurance,  unemployment insurance,  and  withholding  and payment of all taxes.",
                "changed_text": "Franchisee shall endeavor to secure and maintain in force in his name all required licenses, permits, and certificates relating to the conduct of his business pursuant to this Agreement. Franchisee will make reasonable efforts to conduct the Franchise in general compliance with applicable laws, ordinances, regulations, and other requirements of any federal, state, county, municipal or other government, including, without limitation, those laws and regulations pertaining to preparation, purchase and handling of food products, occupational hazards, health, safety and sanitation, worker's compensation insurance, unemployment insurance, and withholding and payment of all taxes.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a strict legal obligation for the franchisee to comply with all laws. The modified text weakens this by changing 'shall secure and maintain' to 'shall endeavor to secure and maintain' and 'strict compliance' to 'general compliance' and 'make reasonable efforts', making the obligation less definitive and creating ambiguity. This could lead to disputes over what constitutes 'reasonable efforts'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Many state and federal laws require strict adherence to regulations concerning food safety, workplace safety (OSHA), and labor laws (e.g., wage and hour laws). Introducing ambiguity undermines the enforceability of these mandates.",

                "original_text": "If the field representative  determines that a condition amounting to a default of this Agreement has occurred or exists,  this conclusion shall be promptly communicated to Franchisee and Pretzel Time.",
                "changed_text": "If the field representative believes that a condition possibly amounting to a default of this Agreement might have occurred or might exist, this possibility may be communicated to Franchisee and Pretzel Time.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity and weakens the obligation to communicate a default. Replacing 'determines' with 'believes' and 'a condition amounting to a default' with 'a condition possibly amounting to a default' makes the field representative's assessment subjective and uncertain. Replacing 'shall be promptly communicated' with 'may be communicated' makes the communication discretionary rather than mandatory. This creates a perturbation because there is no guarantee the Franchisee or Pretzel Time will be notified about the condition.",
                "contradicted_law": "This could contradict principles of contract law that require clear communication of breaches to allow for timely remediation. The lack of mandatory communication hinders the franchisee's ability to cure the default, potentially leading to unfair termination.",

                "original_text": "Pretzel Time may from time to time advise  or  offer  guidance  to Franchisee relative to prices for Products offered for sale by Franchisee that in Pretzel Time's judgment  constitute good business practice. Franchisee shall not be  obligated  to accept any such advice or guidance and shall have the sole right to  determine  and to sell  products  at any  price  that it  determines.",
                "changed_text": "Pretzel Time may generally suggest pricing guidelines for Products offered for sale by Franchisee. While Franchisee retains some discretion, prices should generally align with market conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states the franchisee has the 'sole right to determine and to sell products at any price that it determines.' The altered text is ambiguous. By stating that 'prices should generally align with market conditions', while saying 'Franchisee retains some discretion' implies pressure for franchisees to adhere to suggested prices without explicitly mandating it. This could be interpreted as a form of price fixing, especially if 'market conditions' are vaguely defined or controlled by Pretzel Time.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change borders on violating antitrust laws, specifically those prohibiting price fixing. While merely suggesting prices is legal, language that implies coercion or creates an expectation of adherence can be problematic. See Sherman Antitrust Act.",

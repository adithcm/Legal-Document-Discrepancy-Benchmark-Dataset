            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Pursuant and subject to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D to which this Joint Filing Agreement is attached, and any amendments thereto may be filed without the necessity of filing additional joint filing agreements.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned may consider a joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D to which this Joint Filing Agreement is attached, and amendments thereto may, at their discretion, be filed without filing additional joint filing agreements.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'hereby agree to the joint filing' to 'may consider a joint filing' makes the obligation to jointly file ambiguous. Similarly, replacing 'any amendments thereto may be filed without the necessity' with 'amendments thereto may, at their discretion, be filed without filing' weakens the mandatory nature of filing amendments, introducing discretion.",
                "contradicted_law": "Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13d-1(k)(1) which requires clear and binding agreements for joint filings to ensure transparency of ownership.",

                "original_text": "This Joint Filing Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.",
                "changed_text": "This Joint Filing Agreement could potentially be executed in various counterparts, each possibly considered original, but together possibly constituting a single instrument.",
                "explanation": "By using 'could potentially,' 'possibly considered,' and 'possibly constituting,' the language introduces uncertainty about the validity and unified nature of the agreement when executed in multiple counterparts. This undermines the clarity and enforceability of the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms for enforceability, which is compromised by the ambiguous phrasing.",

                "changed_text": "The execution and filing of this agreement should not necessarily be interpreted as an admission that the below-named parties constitute a group or have functioned as one.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall not be construed' with 'should not necessarily be interpreted' weakens the denial of group status. Changing 'are a group or have acted as a group' to 'constitute a group or have functioned as one' adds vagueness, making it easier to argue that the parties acted as a group despite the agreement, potentially impacting beneficial ownership reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act.",
                "contradicted_law": "Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and related rules concerning group formation and reporting requirements, which depend on clear admissions and denials of group status.",

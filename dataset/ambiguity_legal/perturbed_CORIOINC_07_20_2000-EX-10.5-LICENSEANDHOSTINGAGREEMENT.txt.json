                "original_text": "Commerce One shall provide Corio with support described in EXHIBIT C hereto, and maintenance in the form of Updates and Upgrades. Corio shall be responsible for providing its Customers with routine technical support of the Software and MarketSite.net Service. Corio shall escalate any technical support questions or problems it is unable to answer or resolve directly to Commerce One for Commerce One's immediate attention and resolution under the schedule set forth in EXHIBIT C hereto.",
                "changed_text": "Commerce One will endeavor to provide Corio with support as generally described in EXHIBIT C hereto, and maintenance in the form of Updates and Upgrades. Corio will attempt to provide its Customers with routine technical support of the Software and MarketSite.net Service. Corio may escalate technical support questions or problems it is unable to answer or resolve directly to Commerce One for Commerce One's attention and resolution under a flexible schedule.",
                "explanation": "The modifications weaken the obligations of both Commerce One and Corio. 'Shall provide' is replaced with 'will endeavor to provide' and 'shall escalate' is replaced with 'may escalate' making their respective responsibilities discretionary rather than mandatory. The phrase 'immediate attention' is removed and the phrase 'flexible schedule' replaces 'the schedule set forth in EXHIBIT C hereto'. This introduces ambiguity and makes the support obligations less enforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and definite obligations. Ambiguity makes enforcement difficult and contradicts the expectation of reasonable definiteness in contractual terms.",

                "original_text": "Commerce One warrants that the Software and MarketSite.net Service will perform in substantial accordance with the Documentation, and the media on which the Software is distributed will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use, for a period of sixty (60) days from the Effective Date, but in no event not later than December 31, 1999 (the \"Warranty Period\").",
                "changed_text": "Commerce One believes that the Software and MarketSite.net Service will generally perform in accordance with the Documentation, and the media on which the Software is distributed may be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use, for approximately sixty (60) days from the Effective Date, potentially ending around December 31, 1999 (the \"Warranty Period\").",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces significant ambiguity to the warranty. 'Warrants' becomes 'believes that,' weakening the assurance of performance. 'Substantial accordance' becomes 'generally perform,' which is vague. 'Will be free' turns into 'may be free,' making the defect-free condition uncertain. The time period is also made ambiguous ('approximately sixty (60) days,' 'potentially ending around').",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Warranty Laws under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which require clear and definite warranty terms. The ambiguous language undermines the enforceability of the warranty.",

                "original_text": "Any disputes arising out of this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"RULES\"). The arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules in San Francisco County, California. A judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction of the parties, including without limitation the courts in San Francisco, California.",
                "changed_text": "Any disputes arising out of this Agreement might be resolved through arbitration, possibly following some guidelines similar to the commercial arbitration rules. The arbitration could be conducted by an arbitrator, perhaps in California. A judgment might be entered in a court.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the mandatory and binding nature of the arbitration clause. 'Shall be resolved' is replaced with 'might be resolved,' making arbitration optional. 'Binding arbitration' is removed. The certainty of following specific rules and location is also undermined with vague language like 'possibly following some guidelines similar to' and 'perhaps in California'. 'May be entered' makes the enforceability of any arbitration award uncertain.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which promotes the enforcement of valid and binding arbitration agreements. This modified clause introduces so much ambiguity that it is unlikely to be enforced as a binding arbitration agreement.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "King will cause the King Sales Force and King employees and agents acting on King's behalf to comply with this Agreement and all applicable Legal Requirements in connection with the Promotion of the Product. It is understood, and King agrees, that it will be accountable for the acts or omissions of the King Sales Force and its employees and agents to the extent such acts or omissions fail to comply with King's obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "King will encourage the King Sales Force and King employees and agents acting on King's behalf to generally adhere to this Agreement and relevant Legal Requirements during the Promotion of the Product. It is understood that King may address instances where the King Sales Force and its employees and agentsâ€™ actions or omissions appear inconsistent with King's obligations under this Agreement as King deems reasonably necessary.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'will cause to comply' to 'encourage to generally adhere' weakens the obligation, making it unclear what specific actions King must take to ensure compliance. Replacing 'will be accountable' with 'may address as King deems reasonably necessary' introduces discretion, contradicting the mandatory nature of legal compliance.",

                "changed_text": "Depomed will endeavor to maintain what it considers a reasonable amount of Safety Stock of Product based on its own assessment of potential changes in Product demand, which may or may not align with the Volume Forecast in the Annual Plan.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'commercially reasonable efforts to maintain at least one month's safety stock.' The modified text replaces this with 'endeavor to maintain what it considers a reasonable amount,' making the safety stock level subjective and potentially lower than what is commercially reasonable or necessary to meet demand, thereby contradicting supply obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract and potential violation of requirements to ensure adequate drug supply under cGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice) regulations if the supply is consistently inadequate.",

                "changed_text": "King will generally attempt to forward Product Complaints to Depomed within a reasonable timeframe. Complaints regarding potential Product tampering, contamination, or mix-ups will be given appropriate attention.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall refer' with 'will generally attempt to forward' and 'within four calendar days' with 'within a reasonable timeframe,' the modified text introduces significant ambiguity. The specific 24-hour requirement for critical complaints is weakened by stating that those will be 'given appropriate attention' creating uncertainty around the response protocol.",

Licensed Products which were sold, leased or put into use during such period by THI or any of its Related Companies, the approximate sales received for the Licensed Products, and estimated values of such Licensed Products;\n\nii. services performed by THI or any of its Related Companies that indirectly used Licensed Product, sales received by the services, and an assessment of the value of such services;",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a strict deadline (30 days) and requires a 'certified' statement showing precise financial data. The modified text replaces these with vague terms like 'reasonable time,' 'should furnish,' 'deems appropriate,' 'generally acceptable', 'approximate sales' and 'estimated values'. This introduces ambiguity, making it difficult for Marv to enforce accurate and timely reporting. This contradicts generally accepted accounting principles and introduces ambiguity around compliance.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear and mandatory obligation for THI to reimburse Marv for all IP costs. The modified text uses 'may reimburse' and 'at its discretion' which makes the reimbursement obligation voluntary, contradictory and ambiguous. It also introduces additional ambiguity by stating that 'Any previous or future costs do not require to be reimbursed unless pre-agreed,' making the reimbursement of costs discretionary rather than mandatory. This contradicts general principles of contract law, which dictates that previously agreed upon obligations must be followed.",

The notice will identify (i) the Application or Patent, (ii) the country, (iii) the reason for the IP Cost, and (iv) the Due Date for payment. THI shall then affirm or deny payment.

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear process for notifying THI about IP costs and for THI to respond and affirm payment. This is replaced with vague language like 'attempt to notify' and 'reasonable timeframe,' and 'THI may or may not', creating ambiguities. This ambiguity makes it unclear when and how IP costs will be addressed, impacting the protection of intellectual property. This also goes against the general principle of contracts to make timely decisions and follow-up on costs.",

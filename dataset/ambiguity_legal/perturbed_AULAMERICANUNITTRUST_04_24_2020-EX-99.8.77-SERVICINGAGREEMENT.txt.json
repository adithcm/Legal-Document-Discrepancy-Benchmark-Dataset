                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "You agree to provide all such information as is reasonably necessary for the Board of Trustees of the Trust to review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts of compensation received by you hereunder and the services provided for which you received such compensation.",
                "changed_text": "You agree to provide information that may be helpful for the Board of Trustees of the Trust to, at their discretion, review a report of the compensation received and the services provided.",
                "explanation": "The modified wording makes the obligation to provide information vague and discretionary. Replacing 'all such information as is reasonably necessary' with 'information that may be helpful' introduces ambiguity, and 'at least quarterly, a written report' with 'at their discretion, review a report' makes the review optional. This contradicts the requirements for transparency and accountability expected under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which requires regular reporting to the board.",

                "changed_text": "Each party to this Agreement acknowledges that it has an Anti-Money Laundering Program and intends to comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations as it deems necessary.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to maintain and comply with an Anti-Money Laundering Program. Replacing 'represents, and warrants that it has adopted and implemented an Anti-Money Laundering Program that complies and will continue to comply' with 'acknowledges that it has an Anti-Money Laundering Program and intends to comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations as it deems necessary' creates ambiguity and discretion, undermining the mandatory nature of AML compliance. This directly conflicts with the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act.",

                "original_text": "You agree to promptly and fully cooperate with any reasonable request made by the Fund to address market timing or excessive trading strategies identified by Nationwide in accordance with the applicable provisions of Rule 22c-2 and agree to restrict or prohibit further purchases or exchanges of Shares by a Shareholder that has been identified by such Fund as having engaged in transactions of the Fund's Shares (directly or indirectly through your account) that violate policies established by the Fund for the purpose of eliminating or reducing any dilution of the value of the outstanding Shares issued by the Fund.",
                "changed_text": "You agree to consider cooperating with requests made by the Fund to address market timing or excessive trading strategies. You may consider restricting further purchases or exchanges of Shares by a Shareholder identified as potentially engaging in transactions that violate the Fund's policies.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces significant ambiguity and weakens the obligation to cooperate and restrict trading. Changing 'You agree to promptly and fully cooperate' to 'You agree to consider cooperating' makes cooperation discretionary. Similarly, 'agree to restrict or prohibit' becomes 'may consider restricting,' removing the mandatory aspect of restricting trading. This contradicts SEC Rule 22c-2, which mandates cooperation with funds to prevent market timing.",

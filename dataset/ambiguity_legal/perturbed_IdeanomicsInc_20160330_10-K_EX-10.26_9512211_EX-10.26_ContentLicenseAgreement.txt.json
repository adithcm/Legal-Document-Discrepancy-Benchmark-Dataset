Licensee may make non-material modifications or edits the format of the Titles only for technical purposes with prior written approval by Licensor (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and subject to the applicable limitations (if any) in section 2(a)(i). Nothing in this Agreement prevents Licensee from providing Users with the ability to use the Titles as permitted by law or in a manner for which a license is not required.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee may display the Titles, potentially altering the content as deemed appropriate by industry standards. Licensee may also make modifications or edits to the format of the Titles for technical purposes, subject to the applicable limitations (if any) in section 2(a)(i). The agreement does not hinder Licensee from enabling Users to utilize the Titles in a manner that appears legally permissible.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the alteration of content, replacing a clear requirement for no material alteration with a subjective standard of 'as deemed appropriate by industry standards,' making it difficult to enforce content integrity. The 'appears legally permissible' standard shifts away from confirmed legality to a potentially mistaken interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Copyright Law of the United States and potentially Chinese Copyright Law (given Licensor is a PRC company), both of which require explicit permissions and adherence to licensed rights when distributing copyrighted content and prohibit unauthorized alterations that would infringe upon those rights.",

                "original_text": "Licensor shall be solely responsible for the Titles and any and all legal liability resulting from the Titles, excluding any legal liability caused by Licensee's breach of this Agreement or gross negligence with regards to the Titles. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensor shall be solely responsible for any and all royalties and other fees payable to any applicable licensor(s) or any third party for distribution of the Titles by Licensee (including, without limitation, residuals and clearances or other payments to guilds or unions and rights for music clearances, such as performance rights, synchronization rights and mechanical rights), and all other fees, payments and obligations arising out of the activities contemplated by this Agreement, and Licensee shall have no responsibility or liability for any such royalties or fees.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor is generally responsible for the Titles, with some undefined consideration given to legal liabilities. Licensor will endeavor to handle royalties and other fees for distribution, but Licensee may bear some unspecified responsibility depending on circumstances at Licensor’s discretion. Licensee’s responsibility for any royalties or fees is subject to good-faith negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens Licensor's responsibility for legal liabilities and royalties, creating uncertainties about the division of responsibility. The addition of “some undefined consideration” and “unspecified responsibility depending on circumstances at Licensor’s discretion” adds ambiguity, making it difficult to determine who is liable for what, especially concerning royalties and clearances.",
                "contradicted_law": "Copyright Law of the United States, where copyright holders are strictly responsible for obtaining necessary licenses and permissions for content distribution, particularly concerning royalties and clearances. This also creates potential non-compliance with contractual obligations to guilds and unions.",

                "original_text": "Licensee will provide Licensor with reports (\"Reports\") containing statistical information collected by Licensee on (i) Users' use of the Titles, (ii) distribution channels used by Licensee for the distribution of the Titles, (iii) sub-licensees to which the Titles were sub- distributed by Licensee and (if permitted under Licensee's agreements with the sublicensees) any relevant reports received by Licensee from those sublicensees, and (iv) any other information that the Licensor may request Licensee to gather from time to time, subject to mutual approval. The Reports will be delivered in a format that is mutually agreed upon by the parties. The Reports and all information contained in the Reports shall be considered Confidential Information of Licensee, and all right, title and interest in and to such Reports and information shall be owned by Licensee.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee will endeavor to furnish Licensor with Reports containing available statistical information on Users' use of the Titles, distribution channels, and sub-licensees, contingent on Licensee's internal resources and technological capabilities. The specifics of the Report format will be discussed but not guaranteed. The reports and information will remain primarily confidential to Licensee.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to provide comprehensive reports by adding conditions such as 'available statistical information,' 'contingent on Licensee's internal resources and technological capabilities,' and stating that the report format will be 'discussed but not guaranteed.' This makes it unclear what specific information Licensee must provide, undermining Licensor's ability to monitor Title usage and distribution.",
                "contradicted_law": "While there isn't a direct violation of specific laws, this can lead to disputes in contract enforcement, especially concerning transparency and accountability in copyright licensing. The ambiguity contradicts the principles of good faith and fair dealing, potentially leading to unenforceability of the reporting obligation.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Contractor will devote sufficient time and attention to the business and affairs of Emerald to provide the Services, use his or her best efforts to promote the interests of Emerald, and will carry out his or her Services honestly, in good faith and in the best interests of Emerald.",
                "changed_text": "The Contractor will endeavor to allocate time to the business and affairs of Emerald to provide the Services, use his or her reasonable efforts to promote the interests of Emerald, and will aim to carry out his or her Services in a manner generally consistent with the best interests of Emerald.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates a clear obligation to 'devote sufficient time and attention'. The modified version replaces 'devote sufficient time and attention' with 'endeavor to allocate time,' which is vague and does not guarantee sufficient time allocation. Similarly, 'best efforts' is changed to 'reasonable efforts,' reducing the required level of commitment. Finally, replacing 'in good faith and in the best interests' with 'in a manner generally consistent with the best interests' reduces the fiduciary duty to a more subjective and less stringent standard.",
                "contradicted_law": "This weakens the fiduciary duty expected of contractors, potentially conflicting with British Columbia's laws regarding fiduciary responsibilities which require a higher standard of care and loyalty, especially if the contractor has significant influence within the company. Also it may lead to a violation of Canadian contract law. Good faith is a general principle of Canadian contract law.",

                "original_text": "Emerald will reimburse the Contractor for all reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of his or her Services, provided that the Contractor provides a written expense account in a form satisfactory to the Lead Director of the Company.",
                "changed_text": "Emerald may reimburse the Contractor for expenses incurred in the performance of his or her Services, subject to the Contractor providing an expense account.",
                "explanation": "The original clause contains a legal obligation ('will reimburse') for all reasonable expenses. The modified clause changes 'will reimburse' to 'may reimburse,' making reimbursement discretionary. It also removes the condition that the expense account must be 'in a form satisfactory to the Lead Director of the Company,' eliminating a clear requirement for expense reporting.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change creates ambiguity regarding expense reimbursement, which could conflict with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contracts under British Columbia law. It also potentially violates Canadian revenue agency rules, if the company is claiming those reimbursements as a tax deductible expense. It may potentially violate the Income Tax Act.",

                "original_text": "On the termination of the Contractor's engagement, the Contractor shall return to Emerald all property belonging to Emerald in the Contractor's possession or control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Contractor will be entitled to keep and retain his or her laptop computer, office computer and smart phone.",
                "changed_text": "Upon termination, the Contractor should return Emerald's property in the Contractor's possession. The Contractor may retain items as mutually agreed.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall return' to 'should return' weakens the obligation. The original clause clearly states the contractor will return all property belonging to Emerald with specific exceptions (laptop, etc.). The changed clause replaces these specific exceptions with the vague 'may retain items as mutually agreed,' leaving the definition of what can be retained open to interpretation and potential dispute. The lack of a defined timeline for the return of property also creates ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "The original clear directive is replaced by a weaker one, creating ambiguity. This could lead to disputes over what constitutes Emerald's property, and the term 'mutually agreed' is vague and unenforceable without further definition. This may be considered theft under Canadian criminal law, if this is done maliciously.",

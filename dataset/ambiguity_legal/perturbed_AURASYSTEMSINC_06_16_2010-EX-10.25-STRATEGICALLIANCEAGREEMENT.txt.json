                "original_text": "Each party shall at all times comply with the provisions of all applicable laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and refrain from engaging in any illegal, unfair or deceptive trade practices or unethical business practices whatsoever with respect to the promotion and sale or service of Products.",
                "changed_text": "Each party should make reasonable efforts to comply with the provisions of applicable laws and regulations. Each party will strive to avoid engaging in illegal, unfair, or deceptive trade practices or unethical business practices when promoting, selling, or servicing Products.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'shall comply,' creating a strict legal obligation. The modified text replaces this with 'should make reasonable efforts,' weakening the obligation and making compliance discretionary. It also replaces 'refrain from engaging' with 'strive to avoid engaging,' which is less forceful and allows for subjective interpretation. The term 'whatsoever' is removed, which might limit the original scope.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law requires strict adherence to business regulations, including consumer protection laws against deceptive practices. Weaking the obligation to comply could be seen as violating these laws.",

                "changed_text": "Zanotti agrees to consider indemnifying, defending and holding Aura, including its employees, agents and affiliates, harmless from certain payments, damages, demands, claims, losses, expenses, costs, obligations and liabilities (including what may be considered reasonable attorney's fees and costs), which plausibly arise out of, generally result from or are loosely related to: (i) a possible breach by Zanotti of a key provision contained in this Agreement, including obligations, representations, warranties or covenants herein; (ii) occupational injuries or illnesses sustained by Zanotti's personnel if Aura is involved; (iii) sales or other taxes perhaps owed by Zanotti if Aura is affected; (iv) acts or omissions of Zanotti's personnel related to this Agreement; or (v) Zanotti's dealings with outside parties.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the indemnification clause. Replacing 'agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless' with 'agrees to consider indemnifying...' makes the obligation discretionary. The terms 'any and all' are replaced with vague terms like 'certain' and 'plausibly', which introduce ambiguity about the scope of indemnification. The conditions under which indemnification is required are now vaguely defined.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law requires clear and unambiguous terms in indemnity agreements. The ambiguity created in the modified clause could make it unenforceable under California law, as the scope of indemnification is unclear, potentially violating California Civil Code section 2778, which stipulates how indemnity agreements are interpreted.",

                "original_text": "Both Parties will each have and maintain in full force and effect during the Term of this Agreement (including any post-termination period for which indemnification obligations continue), all product liability and other insurance reasonably necessary to cover such party's anticipated indemnification obligation and other risk of loss for which it may be liable under this Agreement. All such insurance coverages shall be occurrence based and not claims made. Such policy or policies will (a) have aggregate limits of liability of not less than $1,000,000 with respect to any incident or occurrence and of not less than $2,000,000 in the aggregate; (b) name both Zanotti and Aura as insured parties; and (c) provide that such policy may not be canceled except upon not less than 30 days' written notice to both Zanotti and Aura. Each party will provide such evidence of the effectiveness of such insurance to the other party as may be reasonably requested.",
                "changed_text": "Both Parties will generally maintain some form of product liability and other insurance, which may be deemed adequate, during the Term of this Agreement (potentially including any post-termination period). Insurance coverages should ideally be occurrence-based, though other arrangements might be considered. Insurance policies should strive to: (a) aim for aggregate limits of liability of approximately $1,000,000 with respect to any incident and around $2,000,000 in the aggregate; (b) consider naming both Zanotti and Aura as insured parties where practical; and (c) attempt to provide reasonable notice before cancellation if feasible. Parties will attempt to provide some documentation regarding insurance effectiveness when possible.",
                "explanation": "This section weakens the requirement for insurance coverage by introducing significant ambiguity. 'Will each have and maintain' is replaced with 'will generally maintain some form of...', making the insurance requirement less strict. Quantifiable obligations like 'not less than $1,000,000' are replaced with subjective terms like 'approximately $1,000,000,' 'aim for,' and 'around'. The mandatory naming of both parties as insured is softened with 'consider naming... where practical'.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law requires specific and measurable terms in insurance contracts, especially those related to indemnification. The modified clause is too vague regarding the type and amount of insurance required, potentially violating California Insurance Code sections requiring clarity and specificity in insurance agreements.",

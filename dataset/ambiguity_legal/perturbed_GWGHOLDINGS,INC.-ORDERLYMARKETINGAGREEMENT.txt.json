In connection with any Offering, the Seller Trusts shall instruct the placement agents or underwriters to use their reasonable best efforts to (i) effect as wide a distribution of the Shares as is reasonably practicable without adversely affecting the pricing thereof and (ii) not sell any Shares to any person or Group (as such terms is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\")) who, upon completion of the Offering, would have Beneficial Ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of shares of Common Stock representing in the aggregate 5.0% or more the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (or in the case of a person of the type described in Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act, 10% or more of the Total Voting Power).",
                "changed_text": "1.8 Prior to the offering of each Tranche, GWG may provide the placement agents or underwriters in such Offering a list of the top 100 institutional holders of the Common Stock. In connection with any Offering, the Seller Trusts may encourage the placement agents or underwriters to use their best judgment to (i) effect a distribution of the Shares and (ii) consider avoiding sales to any person or Group (as such terms is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\")) who, upon completion of the Offering, might have Beneficial Ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of shares of Common Stock representing in the aggregate 5.0% or more the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (or in the case of a person of the type described in Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act, 10% or more of the Total Voting Power).",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a relatively clear instruction to the Seller Trusts to instruct placement agents to use 'reasonable best efforts' to ensure wide distribution and avoid concentration of ownership. Changing 'shall provide' to 'may provide' makes the provision of the list discretionary. Replacing 'shall instruct...to use their reasonable best efforts' with 'may encourage...to use their best judgment' weakens the obligation considerably. Furthermore, replacing 'not sell any shares' with 'consider avoiding sales' weakens the obligation further, making it unclear what actions are actually required to be taken to avoid sales to specific groups. This introduces ambiguity and makes enforcement difficult.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall execute and deliver all such further instruments' with 'may execute and deliver such further instruments' and 'shall take all such other actions as may reasonably be required' with 'consider taking such other actions as may be deemed appropriate,' the obligation to take necessary actions for fulfilling the agreement's purpose becomes discretionary and vague. The term 'deemed appropriate' introduces subjectivity, weakening the commitment to ensure the agreement's objectives are met. This lack of a clear obligation could undermine the contract's effectiveness.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that New York law governs the interpretation and disputes are subject to New York courts. The modification weakens this by stating the OMA 'might be construed in a manner generally consistent' with New York law, making the governing law unclear and potentially subject to conflicting interpretations. Similarly, replacing 'shall be brought in any federal or state court' with 'could be considered to be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction' removes the certainty of jurisdiction, making it ambiguous where disputes will be resolved. This contradicts the principle of contractual certainty, where governing law and jurisdiction should be clearly defined to avoid future disputes and ensure enforceability.",

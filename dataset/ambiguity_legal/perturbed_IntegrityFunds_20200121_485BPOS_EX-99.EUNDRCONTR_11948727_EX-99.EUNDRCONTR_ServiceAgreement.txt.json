                "original_text": "Section 1.3 All activities by Integrity as underwriter of the Shares shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation, all rules and regulations made or adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") or by any securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Fund's Registration Statement.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'should endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation. This suggests that compliance is not mandatory, potentially allowing Integrity to selectively comply with regulations. ",

                "changed_text": "Section 1.9 Integrity will aim to prepare reports to the Treasurer of the Fund and to the Investment Adviser on a periodic basis, detailing the distribution expenses incurred as part of this Agreement and the Plan and their purpose, alongside any further reports as requested by the Trustees.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall prepare and deliver reports... on a regular, at least quarterly, basis' to 'will aim to prepare reports... on a periodic basis' introduces significant ambiguity. The quarterly requirement is removed, and 'periodic basis' is vague and allows for potentially infrequent reporting. The phrase 'as the Trustees, from time to time, may reasonably request' was removed to avoid the additional reporting, therefore, causing a conflict.",
                "contradicted_law": "Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which requires specific and regular reporting of distribution expenses.",

                "changed_text": "Section 2.1 The Fund agrees to execute documents, furnish information, and take actions that it considers necessary in connection with the qualification of the Shares for sale in states that Integrity may designate.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'reasonably necessary' is replaced with 'it considers necessary,' giving the Fund subjective discretion over what actions are required. This contradicts the implicit obligation to ensure the shares are properly qualified for sale as determined by state laws, potentially leading to non-compliance. The original phrasing ensures a standard of reasonableness tied to objective needs, whereas the modified phrasing allows the fund to decide arbitrarily what it deems necessary, introducing ambiguity.",

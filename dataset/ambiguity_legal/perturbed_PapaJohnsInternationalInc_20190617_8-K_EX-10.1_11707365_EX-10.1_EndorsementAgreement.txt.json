                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation regarding the ownership and protection of intellectual property. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with 'should generally', 'endeavor not to', 'should avoid', and 'try not to'. This makes the obligations less definitive and open to interpretation. This could lead to disputes over intellectual property rights and enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "D. Each Party represents and warrants to the other that it will make reasonable attempts to comply with the general intent of the rules, regulations, laws, orders, decrees, and ordinances of each and every country or political subdivision thereof, having legal jurisdiction over any aspect of their respective activities under this Agreement, particularly concerning the use of the Celebrity Endorsement in Materials for PAPA JOHN'S and the design, development, preparation, etc., of the Products.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'will comply' to 'make reasonable attempts to comply with the general intent' significantly weakens the legal obligation. This introduces ambiguity as to what constitutes 'reasonable attempts' and 'general intent,' making it difficult to enforce compliance with specific laws and regulations. This contradicts the original intent that requires strict adherence to all applicable laws.",

                "original_text": "PAPA JOHN'S shall procure and maintain, at its sole cost and expense, and use commercially reasonable efforts cause its Sub-Contractors to obtain, at their sole cost and expense, during the Term and for a period of three (3) years thereafter (\"Insurance Period\"), comprehensive general liability insurance (including, without limitation, product liability insurance, inventory insurance, worker's compensation insurance, and advertising injury insurance), to defend and protect the Parties against claims arising out of or in connection with PAPA JOHN's business, the Materials, the Products, and Advertisements therefor. Insurance must be obtained from a company reasonably acceptable to ABG, in an amount not less than Five Million United States Dollars ($5,000,000 USD) in the aggregate, or PAPA JOHN'S standard insurance policy limits, whichever is greater.",
                "changed_text": "PAPA JOHN'S may endeavor to procure and maintain, at its discretion, some form of general liability insurance, possibly including product liability insurance, during the Term. The type of insurance and the company providing it are subject to PAPA JOHN'S sole determination. The amount of coverage may align with what PAPA JOHN'S feels is adequate.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets out a clear obligation for Papa John's to obtain specific insurance coverage of at least $5,000,000. The modified text replaces 'shall procure and maintain' with 'may endeavor to procure and maintain, at its discretion', making the insurance coverage optional and subject to Papa John's sole determination. This introduces a significant ambiguity and weakens the obligation to maintain adequate insurance, conflicting with standard business practices.",

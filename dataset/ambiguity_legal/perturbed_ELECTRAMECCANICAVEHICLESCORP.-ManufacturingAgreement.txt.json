                "original_text": "Manufacturer will comply with all applicable laws, restrictions and regulations in the Peoples Republic of China. EMV will comply with all applicable laws, restrictions and regulations in Canada.",
                "changed_text": "Manufacturer will generally adhere to the laws, restrictions, and regulations in the Peoples Republic of China. EMV will strive to adhere to the laws, restrictions, and regulations in Canada.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'will comply' with weaker phrases like 'generally adhere' and 'strive to adhere.' This creates ambiguity regarding the extent of legal obligation. The original text clearly mandates compliance, while the modified text introduces a level of discretion that is not permitted by most laws and regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Article 5 of the Legislation Law of the People's Republic of China states, 'No law or regulation shall contravene the Constitution.' and all subordinate laws, regulations, and rules must be strictly followed. In Canada, similar strict compliance is generally required for federal and provincial statutes and regulations.",

                "original_text": "Manufacturer shall provide written shipping reports to EMV for each delivery. Such reports shall include information concerning all shipments of Products on that day, including type of Products, quantities, and name/address of shipping destination.",
                "changed_text": "Manufacturer will endeavor to provide shipping reports to EMV for each delivery. Such reports should include information concerning shipments of Products, encompassing product types, amounts, and destination details when reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall provide' to 'will endeavor to provide' weakens the obligation to provide shipping reports. Additionally, the addition of 'when reasonably practical' introduces further ambiguity regarding the completeness and accuracy of the report, creating an ambiguous obligation. The phrase ‘destination details’ fails to ensure addresses of the parties involved in shipment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Article 30 of China's Foreign Trade Law and corresponding regulations require accurate and complete shipping documentation for export control and tax purposes. Similarly, Canadian customs regulations demand precise shipping reports for imports and exports.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "In the event that EMV desires to cancel some quantity of Products ordered under a Purchase Order, Manufacturer shall, upon receipt of such written notice, stop work to the extent specified therein. EMV agrees to pay Manufacturer for completed work and work-in-process, under the same terms and conditions as set out in section 5 below, that cannot be used to fill other orders, including Manufacturer's costs for actual and reasonable labor and supplies incurred pursuant to Purchase Orders [up to the date of receipt of notice of cancellation].",
                "changed_text": "In the event that EMV considers cancelling a quantity of Products ordered under a Purchase Order, Manufacturer may, upon receipt of written notice, consider stopping work to some extent. EMV might pay Manufacturer for potentially completed work and work-in-process that may not be usable, in accordance with possible terms similar to section 5 below, potentially including some of Manufacturer's costs for labor and supplies.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the manufacturer SHALL stop work as well as the parameters of payment. The text here changes words like “desires”, “shall” and replacing with subjective terms “considers”, “may”, and “might”. This introduces ambiguity and turns certainties into possibilities, making the contractual obligation far less enforceable. In particular, changing clear obligations to discretionary ones opens to dispute what costs EMV is responsible for.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law of the People's Republic of China (Article 113), demands that each party is to fulfill the contract fully, especially on liabilities when one party fails to fulfill their duties. In Canada, contractual obligations are generally strictly enforced based on the principle of 'pacta sunt servanda,' where agreements must be kept.",

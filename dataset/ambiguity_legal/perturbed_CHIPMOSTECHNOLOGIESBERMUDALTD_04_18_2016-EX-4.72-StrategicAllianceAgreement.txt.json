                "original_text": "(1) Tsinghua Unigroup covenants to follow the Share Subscription Agreement to subscribe for, via the Subscriber, in compliance with the requirements of Taiwan's laws and regulations relating to securities transactions and PRC investment in Taiwan, at the Subscription Price per Share (as defined in the Share Subscription Agreement), 299,252,000 common shares through private placement from ChipMOS, and Tsinghua Unigroup shall comply with, and shall cause the Subscriber to comply with the content of the Share Subscription Agreement, Taiwan's laws and regulations concerning securities transactions and PRC investments in Taiwan so that ChipMOS may make use of the Total Subscription Price (as defined in the Share Subscription Agreement) to replenish operating capital, recruit talents, and upgrade its technologies related to the semiconductor assembly and testing services, to create profits for each of the Parties and its shareholders.",
                "changed_text": "(1) Tsinghua Unigroup covenants to generally adhere to the Share Subscription Agreement when subscribing for, via the Subscriber, with consideration given to the requirements of Taiwan's laws and regulations relating to securities transactions and PRC investment in Taiwan. Tsinghua Unigroup shall endeavor to comply with the Share Subscription Agreement, and use reasonable efforts to ensure the Subscriber's compliance with Taiwan's laws and regulations concerning securities transactions and PRC investments in Taiwan, with the goal that ChipMOS may utilize the Total Subscription Price to replenish operating capital, recruit talents, and upgrade its technologies related to the semiconductor assembly and testing services, ultimately aiming to create profits for each of the Parties and its shareholders.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'covenants to follow' with 'covenants to generally adhere,' and 'shall comply' with 'shall endeavor to comply, ' the obligation becomes ambiguous. 'Consideration given' and 'reasonable efforts' introduce subjective interpretations. This weakens the legally binding nature of the agreement, making it difficult to enforce strict compliance with Taiwan's securities laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Taiwan Securities and Exchange Act, which requires strict compliance with regulations regarding securities transactions and investments.",

                "original_text": "Each of the Parties covenants to, after the Closing Date, designate related staff to hold regular meetings to propose a specific plan and schedule in connection with Sections 1.1 and 1.2 herein, perform the specific plan together and review the implementation status. Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide immediate assistance to, and actively cooperate with, the other Party, to implement this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each of the Parties is expected to designate related staff to hold meetings as needed to develop a plan and schedule in connection with Sections 1.1 and 1.2 herein, with the intention of performing the plan together and reviewing the implementation status periodically. Each Party is expected to attempt to provide assistance to, and cooperate with, the other Party, to implement this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces 'covenants to' with 'is expected to,' diminishing the mandatory nature of designating staff and holding meetings. Replacing 'regular meetings' with 'meetings as needed' makes the frequency of meetings discretionary. The phrase 'attempt to provide assistance' weakens the obligation to actively support the other party, and 'periodically' is a vague and undefined time frame.",

                "original_text": "The Parties agree that the Parties will not disclose information in connection with the execution, existence, content, and performance of this Agreement to any third party before the Parties have made an announcement to the public pursuant to Section 3.11 of this Agreement. However, the foregoing restriction shall not apply to disclosure made to the board of the directors, management team, and relevant employees who need to know such information, attorneys, accountants, financial counsel, and competent authorities for the purposes of performing this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties will generally avoid disclosing information related to the execution, existence, content, and performance of this Agreement to any third party until the Parties have considered making a public announcement pursuant to Section 3.11 of this Agreement. This restriction may not apply to disclosures made to the board of directors, management team, and employees who might need to know such information, as well as attorneys, accountants, financial counsel, and competent authorities for the general purposes associated with this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agree that the Parties will not disclose' with 'will generally avoid disclosing' weakens the confidentiality obligation. 'Considered making a public announcement' introduces discretion in the timing of the announcement. 'Employees who might need to know' and 'general purposes associated with this Agreement' broadens exceptions in an ambiguous and subjective manner. This creates uncertainty around what constitutes a breach of confidentiality.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall maintain...in accordance with industry standards' with 'shall endeavor to maintain...in reasonable order and repair' weakens the obligation and introduces ambiguity. 'Endeavor' suggests an effort without guaranteeing results, and 'reasonable order and repair' is subjective, deviating from objective 'industry standards'.",

Such expenses and capital expenditures, which are intended to be shared equally by WYZZ and Nexstar, may include, but shall not be limited to: lease termination fees, employee severance costs, and transmitter and studio facility modifications, and equipment costs. The maximum amount of, and purpose for, such expenses are specifically set forth and identified on Exhibit D hereto.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party may consider making a payment to the other with respect to some expenses and capital expenditures incurred. The specifics of such considerations, including the amounts and timing, are subject to further discussion and mutual understanding.",
                "explanation": "This modification makes the obligation to share expenses entirely discretionary by replacing 'shall make a payment' with 'may consider making a payment' and removes the prompt payment requirement and the intention of equal sharing. It introduces ambiguity by stating specifics are 'subject to further discussion', making the clause unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires 'all reasonable efforts,' which implies a strong obligation. Replacing it with 'may attempt' makes the action discretionary. The removal of the specifics regarding antenna height and terrain, and the use of 'consideration given' weakens the commitment to maintain signal strength and quality, contradicting implied obligations to FCC regulations concerning broadcast standards.",

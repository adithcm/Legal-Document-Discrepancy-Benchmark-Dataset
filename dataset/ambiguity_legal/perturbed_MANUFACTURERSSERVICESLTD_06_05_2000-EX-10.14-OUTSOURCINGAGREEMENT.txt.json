                "original_text": "In the performance of this Agreement and related Purchase Orders the Parties shall comply with the laws of the United States unless otherwise specified, including but not limited to, those affecting price, production, purchase, sale, use and export of Products, environmental and labor laws.",
                "changed_text": "In the performance of this Agreement and related Purchase Orders, the Parties should endeavor to comply with the laws of the United States where feasible, primarily focusing on laws affecting the core aspects of the agreement, such as pricing and major production activities. Environmental and labor laws may be considered as resources permit.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall comply' with 'should endeavor to comply' and adding qualifiers like 'where feasible' and 'primarily focusing on core aspects.' This makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory, and the phrase 'as resources permit' further weakens the obligation. Additionally, downplaying environmental and labor laws puts the contract at odds with federal and state laws that mandate strict compliance with environmental and labor regulations.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'agrees to protect, defend, hold harmless, and indemnify' to 'agrees to consider protecting, defending, holding harmless, and indemnifying' and adding qualifiers like 'contingent upon a determination of responsibility' and 'within available insurance coverage,' the obligation becomes ambiguous and potentially unenforceable. This conflicts with standard indemnification practices where the indemnifying party has a clear and defined responsibility to protect the other party from specific liabilities.",

                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens MSL's obligation to meet specific requirements and standards by replacing the mandatory 'shall ensure that...are met' with the discretionary 'shall use its best judgement to ensure that...are considered.' The removal of 'all applicable' and the use of 'considered' introduces subjectivity and ambiguity, making enforcement difficult. This change is contradictory to the usual quality control procedures.",

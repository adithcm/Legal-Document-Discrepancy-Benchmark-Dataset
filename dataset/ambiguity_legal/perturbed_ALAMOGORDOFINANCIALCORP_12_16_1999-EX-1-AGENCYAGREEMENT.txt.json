The Company,  the MHC and the Bank will make every reasonable effort (i) to prevent the issuance by the Commission, the OTS or any state authority of any such order and, if any such order shall at any time be issued, (ii) to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible time.",
                "changed_text": "The Company, the MHC and the Bank will endeavor to cause any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to potentially be declared effective by the Commission and any post-effective amendment to the MHC Application to perhaps be approved by the OTS and will reasonably notify the Agent upon significant information concerning the events listed below: (i) at some point when the Registration Statement, as amended, has become effective; (ii) at some juncture when the MHC Application, as amended has been approved by the OTS; (iii) eventual comments from the Commission, the OTS, or any other governmental entity with respect to the Offering or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) possible requests by the Commission, the OTS, or any other governmental entity for any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the MHC Application, or for additional information; (v) the distant potential of the issuance by the Commission, the OTS, or any other governmental entity of any order or other action suspending the Offering or the use of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any other filing of the Company, the MHC, or the Bank under the MHC Regulations, or other applicable law, or the threat of any such action; (vi) the prospective issuance by the Commission, the OTS, or any authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of the initiation or threat of initiation or threat of any proceedings for that purpose; or (vii) of the potential occurrence of any event mentioned in paragraph (g) below. The Company, the MHC, and the Bank will use vaguely defined efforts (i) to prevent the issuance by the Commission, the OTS, or any state authority of any such order, and, if any such order shall at any time be issued, (ii) to hope to obtain the lifting thereof.",
                "explanation": "The phrases 'endeavor to,' 'potentially,' 'perhaps,' 'reasonably notify upon significant information,' 'at some point,' 'at some juncture,' 'eventual,' 'possible requests,' 'distant potential,' 'prospective issuance,' 'vaguely defined efforts,' and 'hope to obtain' significantly weaken the obligation to ensure regulatory compliance and timely communication, making it difficult to enforce specific actions. This creates substantial ambiguity.",

The Company authorizes the Agent to use the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if amended or supplemented) in any lawful manner contemplated by the Plan in connection with the sale of the Shares by the Agent.",
                "changed_text": "The Company, the MHC and the Bank might furnish to the Agent, occasionally during the period when the Prospectus (or any later prospectus related to this offering) is supposedly required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"1934 Act\"), a vague quantity of copies of such Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) as the Agent may politely request for the ambiguous purposes contemplated by the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act or the rules and regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act (the \"1934 Act Regulations\"). The Company authorizes the Agent to potentially use the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if amended or supplemented) in any conceivably lawful manner contemplated by the Plan in connection with the sale of the Shares by the Agent.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will furnish' with 'might furnish,' 'from time to time' with 'occasionally,' 'such number' with 'a vague quantity,' 'reasonably request' with 'politely request,' 'purposes contemplated' with 'ambiguous purposes,' and 'lawful manner' with 'conceivably lawful manner' introduces ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the obligation to provide necessary prospectuses, potentially hindering compliance with securities laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Act of 1933, which requires the delivery of a prospectus to potential investors to ensure informed investment decisions. This change undermines that requirement by making the provision of prospectuses uncertain.",

                "changed_text": "The Company, the MHC and the Bank will consider complying with some of the seemingly material terms, conditions, requirements and provisions with respect to the Offering, and the transactions questionably contemplated thereby, vaguely imposed by the Commission, the OTS or the MHC Regulations, and by the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations to be complied with at their discretion prior to or subsequent to the Closing Date and when the Prospectus might be required to be delivered, and during an indefinite time period the Company, the MHC and the Bank will ponder compliance, potentially at the expense of other priorities, with the vaguely material requirements imposed upon them by the Commission, the OTS or the MHC Regulations, and by the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations, maybe including, but not requiring, Rule 10b-5 under the 1934 Act, in each case as from time to time in force, so far as they feel is needed to perhaps allow the continuance of sales or dealing in the Common Stock during such period seemingly in accordance with the general provisions hereof and the basic Prospectus.",
                "explanation": "Diluting the mandatory 'will comply' to 'will consider complying,' questioning the transactions as 'questionably contemplated,' describing terms as 'seemingly material' and 'vaguely imposed,' imposing compliance 'at their discretion' and 'potentially at the expense of other priorities,' vague descriptions as 'indefinite time period,' and expressing compliance with requirements as 'maybe including but not requiring,' weakens the obligation for strict regulatory compliance. Making the continuance of sales subject to what 'they feel is needed' introduces further ambiguity and reduces the enforceability of the clause.",

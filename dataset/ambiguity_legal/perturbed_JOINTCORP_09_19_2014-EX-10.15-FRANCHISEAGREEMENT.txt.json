                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "You agree to use in the development and operation of the Franchise only those brands, types, and/or models of equipment, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and signs we have approved.",
                "changed_text": "You agree to use in the development and operation of the Franchise equipment, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and signs that are generally consistent with the brands, types, and/or models we have approved.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires strict adherence to approved brands/types/models. The modified version introduces ambiguity by using \"generally consistent,\" which is open to interpretation and allows for deviation. It is unclear what would be considered 'generally consistent'.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change contradicts the intention of franchise law, which seeks to standardize operations and maintain brand consistency.",

                "changed_text": "We reserve the right to charge you a nominal fee for each attendee of yours who attends any mandatory or optional training program or owners meeting.",
                "explanation": "By replacing “a daily attendance fee in an amount to be set by us” with “a nominal fee”, the text becomes vague and open to interpretation. The term “nominal” does not provide any specific amount or method for determining the fee, thus making it difficult for the franchisee to budget or challenge the fee.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change may violate basic principles of contract law regarding fairness and transparency, potentially leading to disputes over what constitutes a 'nominal' fee and whether the fee is reasonable.",

                "original_text": "To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may periodically establish maximum and/or minimum prices for services and products that the Franchise location offers, including without limitation, prices for promotions in which all or certain The Joint Franchise locations participate. If we establish such prices for any services or products, you agree not to exceed or reduce that price, but will charge the price for the service or product that we establish.",
                "changed_text": "We may suggest prices for services and products that the Franchise location offers. If we suggest such prices for any services or products, you should consider following that price.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the legal obligation concerning pricing by replacing “establish maximum and/or minimum prices” with “suggest prices” and “agree not to exceed or reduce that price” with “should consider following that price.” This makes pricing guidance non-binding and allows the franchisee to deviate from suggested prices. This contradicts the purpose of a franchise, which allows the franchisor to ensure all franchises are the same to protect its brand.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change undermines the franchisor's control over pricing, potentially leading to inconsistencies and negatively impacting the brand's image.",

                "original_text": "Surgical shall perform the Services in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Surgical shall endeavor to perform the Services in general accordance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall perform... in compliance with' with 'shall endeavor to perform... in general accordance with' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation to strictly comply with all laws and regulations. 'Endeavor' suggests an effort rather than a guarantee of compliance, and 'general accordance' implies that deviations are acceptable. This contradicts the legal requirement for strict adherence to regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal laws including FDA regulations and anti-kickback statutes which require strict compliance, not just a general effort.",

Surgical agrees that all Work Product shall be the sole and exclusive property of Imprimis.",
                "changed_text": "Surgical will use reasonable discretion to disclose to Imprimis inventions, ideas, concepts, and discoveries related to Work Product. Surgical agrees that Imprimis should generally own the Work Product.",
                "explanation": "The original text created a strict obligation to disclose all work product promptly. The modified text replaces 'shall disclose promptly' with 'will use reasonable discretion to disclose', allowing Surgical to decide what and when to disclose. 'Reasonable discretion' is vague and creates uncertainty. Furthermore, replacing 'shall be the sole and exclusive property' with 'should generally own' significantly weakens Imprimis's ownership rights, making them non-exclusive and uncertain.",
                "contradicted_law": "Intellectual property law, which requires clear assignment of ownership for inventions and discoveries. The vague language undermines the enforceability of IP assignment.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall conduct... in accordance with' to 'will attempt to conduct... in alignment with' introduces a lower standard of compliance. 'Attempt' suggests effort but not necessarily achievement, and 'alignment with' is less stringent than 'in accordance with,' indicating that deviations may be acceptable. This contradicts the requirements of various regulations that demand strict compliance, not just an attempt to align activities.",
                "contradicted_law": "FDA regulations, HIPAA, and other regulatory frameworks that demand strict adherence, which requires strict compliance, not just an attempt to align activities.",

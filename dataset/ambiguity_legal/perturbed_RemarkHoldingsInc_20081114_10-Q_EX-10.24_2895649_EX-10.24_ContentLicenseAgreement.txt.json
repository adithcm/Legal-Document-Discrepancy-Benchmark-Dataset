                "original_text": "World Book will make reasonable efforts to cross check the Reference Content against other World Book products for factual accuracy. World Book will create the Affinities according to the guidelines and instructions provided by HSWI from time to time, and agreed to by World Book whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and according to the high quality standards for commercially published works, but in no event less than the standards of World Book for its own published works. If an Affinity does not meet the requirements set forth herein, World Book will promptly revise the Affinity to meet such.",
                "changed_text": "World Book may, at its discretion, cross check the Reference Content against other World Book products for factual accuracy. World Book will endeavor to create the Affinities generally in accordance with the guidelines and instructions provided by HSWI from time to time, subject to World Book's reasonable interpretation, and aligned with its perception of commercially published works quality. If an Affinity seemingly does not meet the requirements set forth herein, World Book will consider revising the Affinity.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce ambiguity by replacing 'will make reasonable efforts' with 'may, at its discretion,' making the factual accuracy check optional. 'Will create according to guidelines' is weakened to 'will endeavor to create generally,' allowing deviation. 'Promptly revise' is changed to 'will consider revising,' making the revision process discretionary and undefined. This contradicts the need for accurate information in educational content and creates vagueness in quality standards.",

World Book shall provide the updates in the manner and form as set forth in Schedule D. HSWI acknowledges that the Updating Services will not be automated and may require review and editing by HSWI. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, HSWI shall have the right to update the Content, Affinity and Images to correct errors or alleged errors (including, without limitation, errors of omission) in such or in response to third party claims related to the Content, Images or Affinity, and may use World Book content and data in connection with such updates. World Book shall provide the Updating Services in English, and HSWI may translate any such updates into Chinese only. Any authored content provided under the Updating Services, even when translated into Chinese by HSWI, shall be subject to the license herein for that Content which is being updated, and for the avoidance of doubt shall not be considered Translated Content.",

World Book will attempt to provide the updates generally in the format of Schedule D. HSWI acknowledges the Updating Services may not be comprehensive and could require adaptation. HSWI might have some right to revise content for perceived errors, and may generally reference World Book content when doing so. World Book will try to provide Updating Services in English when feasible, and HSWI may translate when appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall provide' to 'may, at its option', making the provision of Updating Services discretionary. The defined termination criteria are made vague by adding qualifiers like 'vaguely occurs,' 'nominally less than,' and 'approximately.' The obligation to provide updates 'in the manner and form as set forth in Schedule D' is softened to 'will attempt to provide generally in the format of Schedule D.' The language regarding HSWI's right to update content becomes uncertain with 'might have some right' and 'may generally reference.' These changes weaken the enforceability of the Updating Services obligation. Under the **Lanham Act**, inaccurate or outdated information could lead to claims of false advertising if the content is presented as current and accurate when it is not.",

HSWI shall also provide reasonable assistance to World Book or its designated agent to conduct audits to confirm the payments hereunder. Any such audit will be conducted upon [*] ([*]) days notice and during regular business hours, and shall be at [*] expense, unless such audit reveals a discrepancy of more than [*] percent ([*]%) in the total applicable amount reported by HSWI, in which case [*] shall pay for, or reimburse [*] the cost of, such audit. Any such audit shall be conducted by an independent certified public accounting firm which is not engaged in performing other work for World Book or its affiliates; which agrees to enter into a confidentiality agreement with HSWI; and which is not compensated in any manner of contingency arrangements on the basis of its findings. HSWI further agrees that until the expiration of [*] ([*]) year after the termination of this Agreement, HSWI will make available upon written request to World Book or any of its duly authorized representatives, this Agreement and books, documents, and records of HSWI that are necessary to verify the nature and extent of the revenue derived by HSWI from advertising related to the Content hereunder. No more than [*] audit may be conducted in any [*] month period, unless the then-most-recent audit reveals a discrepancy of more than [*] percent ([*]%) in the total applicable amount reported by HSWI.",
                "changed_text": "HSWI should endeavor to keep what it considers appropriate records to generally support the Royalties. HSWI will consider providing assistance to World Book for potential audits. Audits, if conducted, might occur with some advance notice during mutually convenient hours, with expenses handled as deemed reasonable. Should an audit suggest a noteworthy discrepancy, the handling of expenses will be discussed. Audits may be performed by a reasonably independent firm under a loosely defined confidentiality arrangement without contingency-based compensation. For a period after termination, HSWI will contemplate making available relevant records upon formal request. The frequency of audits will be balanced against perceived needs.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity and weakens HSWI's obligation to maintain accurate records and cooperate with audits. Replacing 'shall maintain complete and accurate records' with 'should endeavor to keep what it considers appropriate records' makes the record-keeping obligation subjective. Similarly, changing 'shall also provide reasonable assistance' to 'will consider providing assistance' makes cooperation with audits discretionary. The language surrounding the audit process ('might occur with some advance notice,' 'expenses handled as deemed reasonable') introduces further uncertainty. This could lead to disputes regarding royalty payments and makes it difficult for World Book to verify HSWI's financial reporting, potentially violating accounting standards and regulations relevant to publicly traded companies like Remark Holdings, Inc. In addition, The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) requires public companies to maintain accurate financial reporting. This change undermines the ability to do so, increasing the risk of non-compliance.",

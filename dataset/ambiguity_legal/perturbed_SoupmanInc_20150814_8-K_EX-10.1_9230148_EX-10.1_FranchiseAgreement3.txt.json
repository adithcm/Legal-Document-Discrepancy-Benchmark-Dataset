                "original_text": "6. The Master Franchise Agreement requires non-binding mediation. The mediation will occur in New York with the costs being borne by equally by the parties. Prospective franchisees are encouraged to consult private legal counsel to determine the applicability of California and federal laws (such as Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281) to any provisions of a franchise agreement restricting venue to a forum outside the State of California.",
                "changed_text": "6. The Master Franchise Agreement suggests non-binding mediation, potentially in New York. The costs may be borne by the parties, as appropriate. Prospective franchisees might consider consulting legal counsel regarding the applicability of California and federal laws to venue restrictions.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce several ambiguities. 'Suggests' weakens the requirement for mediation. 'Potentially in New York' makes the location uncertain. 'May be borne by the parties, as appropriate' makes cost-sharing discretionary. 'Might consider' weakens the encouragement to seek legal counsel. This overall vagueness contradicts the intent of California Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281, which aim to protect franchisees by ensuring they understand their rights regarding venue and legal recourse.",

California Corporation Code 31512 voids a waiver of your rights under the Franchise Investment Law (California Corporations Code 31000 through 31516). Business and Professions Code 20010 voids a waiver of your rights under the Franchise Relations Act (Business and Professions Code 20000 through 20043).",

The effect of such a release on your rights under the Franchise Investment Law (California Corporations Code 31000 through 31516) and the Franchise Relations Act (Business and Professions Code 20000 through 20043) will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce ambiguity regarding the enforceability of waivers. Replacing 'must sign' with 'may be asked' makes the signing of the release discretionary. Stating that the effect of the release will be determined 'on a case-by-case basis' implies that waivers of rights might sometimes be enforceable, directly contradicting California Corporation Code 31512 and Business and Professions Code 20010, which explicitly void such waivers.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity regarding the delivery of proposed agreements. The phrase 'generally provided' suggests that this is not a strict requirement. The added clause 'subject to availability' creates a loophole, implying that the agreements might not always be provided, directly contradicting the mandatory requirement of the California Franchise Investment Law. This law requires ALL proposed agreements to be delivered with the disclosure document.",

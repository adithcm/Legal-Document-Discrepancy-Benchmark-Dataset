                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "CRO agrees to perform the specific tasks set forth in the Project-specific Addenda in a professional manner, in strict accordance with the terms and conditions contained herein, relevant professional standards including in accordance with the Protocol and applicable amendments and ICH GCP Guidelines (ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, May 1996) and all other relevant laws, rules, regulations and guidelines.",
                "changed_text": "CRO agrees to perform the specific tasks set forth in the Project-specific Addenda in a generally professional manner, in accordance with the terms and conditions contained herein, and will consider relevant professional standards including the Protocol, applicable amendments, and ICH GCP Guidelines (ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, May 1996) and other relevant laws, rules, regulations and guidelines as deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity by replacing 'in a professional manner, in strict accordance' with 'in a generally professional manner, in accordance,' which weakens the commitment to strict adherence to standards. Also replacing 'all other relevant laws, rules, regulations and guidelines' to 'other relevant laws, rules, regulations and guidelines as deemed appropriate' introduces ambiguity by making compliance discretionary and subjective, which contradicts Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.",

                "changed_text": "Client will endeavor to provide CRO with documents and information as CRO finds convenient for the conduct of the Services.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will provide' to 'will endeavor to provide' weakens the obligation on the client to provide necessary documents, making it optional. Replacing 'necessary as requested by CRO' to 'as CRO finds convenient' makes it even more vague, which could lead to the clinical research being in non-compliance with GCP guidelines, if proper documentation is not provided.",

                "changed_text": "CRO may periodically provide Client with a report summarizing the Services including high-level clinical study activities at CRO's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text ensures the CRO has to provide weekly reports. This change weakens the requirement for regular, detailed reporting by changing 'will provide' to 'may periodically provide,' making reporting discretionary and less frequent. Also, by limiting the detail to 'high-level clinical study activities', it reduces the obligation to provide all clinical study activity and other information which may lead to non-compliance with GCP guidelines and FDA regulations regarding clinical trial oversight and reporting.",

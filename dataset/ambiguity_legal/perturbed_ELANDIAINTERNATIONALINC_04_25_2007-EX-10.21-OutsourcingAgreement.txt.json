                "changed_text": "Datec will consider adhering to the BSP's DRP policy and procedures and may assist in enhancing these if practical, within the general scope of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies a strong commitment to adhering to and enhancing the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP). The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'will adhere' with 'will consider adhering,' and 'will assist wherever possible' with 'may assist if practical.' This weakens Datec's obligation and makes their involvement discretionary, contradicting industry best practices and potentially violating regulatory expectations for robust disaster recovery planning and execution.",

                "changed_text": "Datec should endeavor to keep accounts, documents, and records as generally advised by the BSP, with consideration given to detail sufficient for assessing Datec's compliance and invoice accuracy.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on Datec to maintain adequate records to a defined standard. The modified text replaces 'must keep' with 'should endeavor to keep,' and 'to the extent required by the BSP as advised and in sufficient detail' with 'as generally advised by the BSP, with consideration given to detail sufficient.' This introduces ambiguity by making the record-keeping obligation less stringent and the level of detail subjective. Datec compliance is weakened due to the introduction of that subjectivity.",

Prior to undertaking or committing to any freight and or related travel costs Datec must first obtain approval from BSP.",
                "changed_text": "BSP may consider covering freight and related travel costs incurred by Datec, dependent on budget availability, in relation to the defined services. Datec should ideally seek prior discussion with BSP regarding these costs.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that BSP 'will be responsible' for freight and travel costs, establishing a financial obligation. The modified text weakens this by stating BSP 'may consider covering' these costs 'dependent on budget availability.' This introduces ambiguity and makes the reimbursement discretionary rather than obligatory. The term 'should ideally seek prior discussion' is also less directive than 'must first obtain approval'. The change transforms a clear financial commitment into a vague possibility dependent on unspecified conditions, undermining contractual certainty.",

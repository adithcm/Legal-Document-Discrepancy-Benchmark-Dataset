                "original_text": "Subcontractor shall obtain at its own cost and expense and maintain the insurance in full force and effect during the term of the Agreement as required herein. A copy of the (i) certificate(s) of insurance and (ii) endorsements, acceptable to EDGE, shall be submitted to EDGE prior to commencement of any Work and renewals or replacements of such certificates shall be so delivered at least 30 days prior to the expiration or termination of each such policy. A copy of the insurance policies shall promptly be made available to EDGE upon EDGE' request.",
                "changed_text": "Subcontractor shall obtain insurance at its own cost and expense during the term of the Agreement. A copy of the certificate(s) of insurance and endorsements may be submitted to EDGE prior to commencement of any Work, and renewals or replacements of such certificates should be delivered around the expiration or termination of each such policy. A copy of the insurance policies will be available to EDGE upon reasonable request.",
                "explanation": "The modified text weakens the obligation to maintain insurance and provides ambiguity regarding the submission and timing of insurance documents. Replacing 'shall obtain' with 'shall obtain' and removing 'in full force and effect' introduces vagueness to whether insurance is continuously maintained. Changing 'shall be submitted' to 'may be submitted' makes document submission optional, and replacing 'shall be so delivered at least 30 days prior' with 'should be delivered around' makes the delivery timeline unclear. 'Promptly' becomes 'upon reasonable request' which is subjective.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Subcontractor shall comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, Hazardous Communication Requirements, and all applicable environmental protection laws, rules, regulations and ordinances), ordinances, rules, regulations and lawful orders of any public authority having jurisdiction for the safety of persons or property or to protect them from damage, injury or loss.",
                "changed_text": "Subcontractor shall endeavor to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of any public authority regarding the safety of persons or property or to protect them from damage, injury or loss.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'shall endeavor to comply' significantly weakens the legal obligation to adhere to safety and environmental laws. The original clause explicitly lists specific important laws like OSHA, while the modified version lacks this specificity, making it harder to prove non-compliance. The term 'endeavor' introduces ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and related state laws, which mandate strict and verifiable compliance with safety regulations, not just an 'endeavor' to comply.",

                "original_text": "Subcontractor shall at all times keep the Work premises free from accumulations of waste material, rubbish, and any other debris resulting from the Work. On an ongoing basis as the Work progresses, and at the completion of the Work, Subcontractor shall restore to essentially its former condition, and to the satisfaction of EDGE, all aspects of the Work site and shall remove all waste and excess materials, tools, and equipment resulting from or used in the Work and legally dispose thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Subcontractor should attempt to keep the Work premises reasonably free from significant accumulations of waste material and debris. Subcontractor should try to restore the Work site to a usable condition and remove excess materials.",
                "explanation": "The modified text uses vague language such as 'should attempt,' 'reasonably free,' 'significant accumulations,' and 'usable condition,' which weakens the legal obligation for maintaining a clean and restored worksite. This change gives the Subcontractor discretion and allows them to perform minimal cleanup, and provides less objective criteria for determining compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act, which requires specific standards for waste management and site restoration, which contradicts the vague description of 'attempt' and 'reasonable' cleanup.",

                "original_text": "The Parties are obliged to have or obtain all required licenses, permits and authorizations for the execution of the purpose of the Contract. Each Party shall be individually liable for all those risks, fines, sanctions or damage caused as a result of the absence of any license, permit or authorization that is obliged to obtain and therefore shall defend and hold the other Party harmless before any authorities, judges and third parties.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties should endeavor to obtain the necessary licenses, permits, and authorizations for the execution of the purpose of the Contract, as reasonably practical. Each Party shall generally be responsible for the risks, fines, sanctions, or damage caused if licenses or permits are not obtained.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that both parties must obtain necessary licenses and authorizations. The modified text weakens this obligation using terms like 'should endeavor,' 'as reasonably practical,' and 'generally be responsible,' creating ambiguity. This might be interpreted as allowing parties to avoid obtaining required permits under certain circumstances, contradicting environmental regulations, and potentially shifting responsibility for violations in an unclear manner.",

                "changed_text": "ECOPETROL should endeavor to indemnify and hold the SENDER harmless against significant losses, costs, or damages directly resulting from a clear breach of contract by ECOPETROL, considering whether Excusable Events influenced said damages.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly mandates ECOPETROL to indemnify the SENDER for breaches, excluding Excusable Events. The modified clause weakens this by using terms like 'should endeavor,' 'significant losses,' and adding subjective considerations like 'clear breach' and 'influenced said damages.' This makes the obligation to indemnify ambiguous and discretionary.",

                "changed_text": "The SENDER will attempt to protect, indemnify and hold ECOPETROL harmless, its affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, employees, agents, and representatives from considerable losses or damages somewhat related to the contract's execution, unless primarily caused by ECOPETROL or force majeure.",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes a strong obligation for the SENDER to indemnify ECOPETROL. The modified text weakens this using 'will attempt to protect,' 'considerable losses or damages,' and 'somewhat related,' creating ambiguity about the extent of the indemnity and potentially conflicting with clear contractual responsibilities under Colombian law.",

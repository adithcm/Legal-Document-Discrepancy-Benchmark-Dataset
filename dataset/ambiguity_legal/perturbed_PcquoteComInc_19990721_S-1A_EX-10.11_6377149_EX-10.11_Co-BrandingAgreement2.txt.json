(hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement. This Amendment shall apply to said PCQ and ABW and all of their subsidiaries and related companies.",

Watley, Inc. (\"ABW\"), the parties in the Co-Branding Agreement. This Amendment may loosely apply to PCQ and ABW and some of their subsidiaries.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes 'by and between' to simply 'between', reducing the binding nature of the agreement. Furthermore, replacing 'shall apply' with 'may loosely apply' and 'all of their subsidiaries' with 'some of their subsidiaries' introduces significant ambiguity regarding which entities are actually bound by the amendment. This ambiguity undermines the clarity required for contract enforcement.",

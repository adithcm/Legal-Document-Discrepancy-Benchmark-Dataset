                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure' with 'should attempt to ensure' weakens the obligation, making security efforts discretionary. Further, replacing 'secure and not accessible by authorized third parties' with 'reasonably secure' introduces ambiguity, as the definition of 'reasonably secure' is subjective. This weakens the explicit security requirement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall cause its employees to attend' to 'may encourage its employees to attend' makes employee attendance optional. Replacing 'follow the instructions' with 'generally consider the instructions' weakens the requirement to adhere to NCM's instructions. This introduces ambiguity and makes compliance discretionary.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall at all times operate...in compliance' with 'shall endeavor to operate...in general accordance' significantly weakens the commitment to full legal compliance. 'Endeavor' implies an attempt rather than a guarantee, and 'general accordance' suggests flexibility in adhering to the laws. This introduces ambiguity and makes adherence to the law discretionary.",

Licensee shall not take any action that could reasonably be expected to harm the Brand or the goodwill associated therewith. Licensee shall use with the Brand any applicable trademark notices as may be requested by Licensor or required under applicable laws, regulations, stock exchange and other rules (\"Laws\") and reputable industry practice.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses \"shall\" to create a clear obligation. The modified text replaces \"shall\" with \"should aim to be,\" \"should endeavor not to,\" and \"will attempt to,\" making the licensee's obligations less definitive. This weakens the quality control obligations. The phrase \"generally consistent\" and \"if feasible\" is also too vague.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"shall submit\" to \"should, when practical, submit\" makes the requirement for prior written approval discretionary rather than mandatory. The phrase \"when practical\" introduces ambiguity, allowing the Licensee to determine for themselves when submission is necessary, undermining the Licensor's control over brand usage.",

The modifications introduce ambiguity by using phrases like 'believes,' 'assumes,' 'if required,' and 'intends to generally comply.' This weakens the legal obligations of the distributor and introduces uncertainty, which is contradictory to Chinese business law requirements for strict adherence to regulations and permits.",

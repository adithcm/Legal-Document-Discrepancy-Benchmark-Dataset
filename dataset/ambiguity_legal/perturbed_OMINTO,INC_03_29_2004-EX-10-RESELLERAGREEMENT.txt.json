                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "MediaNet Group Technologies must approve any advertising prior to issuance and placement.",
                "changed_text": "MediaNet Group Technologies may provide feedback on advertising prior to issuance and placement, but final decisions rest with the Reseller.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens MediaNet Group Technologies' control over advertising by replacing a mandatory approval process with a suggestion process. This introduces ambiguity because it is unclear what constitutes 'feedback' and what recourse MediaNet Group Technologies has if the Reseller proceeds with advertising they disapprove of. ",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential trademark infringement liability for MediaNet Group Technologies if the Reseller's advertising damages the brand or violates trademark laws. By relinquishing control, they risk liability, particularly under Lanham Act.",
                "location": "Section 4"

                "original_text": "The Receiving Party shall take every reasonable precaution to protect the confidentiality of Confidential Information.",
                "changed_text": "The Receiving Party shall endeavor to take precautions to protect the confidentiality of Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall take every reasonable precaution' to 'shall endeavor to take precautions' weakens the obligation. 'Endeavor' is vague and does not clearly define the level of effort required, making it difficult to enforce. It introduces ambiguity because 'endeavor' does not specify what constitutes sufficient effort, allowing for subjective interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trade Secret laws, such as the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA), require reasonable measures to protect trade secrets. 'Endeavor' may not meet the legal standard of 'reasonable measures' leading to potential violations if confidential information is compromised.",
                "location": "Section 6.1"
            },
            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement:\n\n10.1 Each party shall, within 30 days of such expiration or termination return to other party or destroy all Confidential Information and all other material received from such other party.",
                "changed_text": "Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement:\n\n10.1 Each party will attempt to return to other party or destroy most Confidential Information and other material received from such other party within a reasonable timeframe.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall... within 30 days... return or destroy all' with 'will attempt to return to other party or destroy most... within a reasonable timeframe' creates significant ambiguity. 'Attempt' suggests no guarantee of action, 'most' implies incomplete compliance, and 'reasonable timeframe' lacks a defined deadline, making enforcement difficult. This contradicts the original clear obligation to return or destroy all confidential information within a specific timeframe.",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws governing the protection of trade secrets and confidential information typically require a defined obligation to return or destroy such information upon termination of an agreement. The modification weakens this obligation to the point where it may be deemed insufficient to meet legal requirements, potentially leading to liability for misappropriation of trade secrets under laws like the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA).",

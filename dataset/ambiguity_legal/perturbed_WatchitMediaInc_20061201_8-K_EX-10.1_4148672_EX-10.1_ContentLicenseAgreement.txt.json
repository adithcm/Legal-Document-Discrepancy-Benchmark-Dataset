                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to not' with 'should endeavor not to' weakens the obligation. It introduces ambiguity as 'endeavor' is subjective and doesn't guarantee compliance, which could lead to disputes over whether sufficient effort was made.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will provide' to 'will attempt to provide' introduces ambiguity. This implies that providing the data is not a guaranteed obligation, and the success of the attempt is not defined. This makes it difficult to enforce whether Oceanic Time Warner Cable fulfilled its obligation.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'agree to discuss' to 'may discuss' makes the discussion optional. The original text implied a mandatory consultation; this change removes that obligation and gives each party the discretion to use the information without prior consultation. This introduces uncertainty around confidentiality and responsible use of shared data.",

                "original_text": "MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the solvency of the Society appears to be somewhat impaired, you might be asked to consider an extra payment. The Board of Directors will, at their discretion, consider how much any extra payment should be. It will be loosely based on each member's perceived share of the potential deficiency. You can perhaps make the extra payment by some kind of reduction in benefits or possibly by a payment in cash. If you don't consider an extra payment within approximately 60 days from when we generally notify you of a potential share of a possible deficiency, the amount might be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest potentially compounded at around 5% per year.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several ambiguities regarding the conditions for requiring extra payments, the basis for calculating those payments, and the consequences of non-payment. Phrases like 'appears to be somewhat impaired,' 'might be asked to consider,' 'at their discretion,' 'loosely based,' 'perceived share,' 'potential deficiency,' 'can perhaps,' 'some kind of reduction,' 'possibly by,' 'approximately 60 days,' 'generally notify,' 'potential share,' 'possible deficiency,' 'might be charged,' 'potentially compounded,' and 'around 5%' all create uncertainty and make the obligation vague and unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change could potentially violate state insurance regulations (Wisconsin, since the company is based there) that require clear and transparent solvency maintenance plans. Ambiguous language surrounding financial obligations undermines the policyholder's ability to understand and comply with the terms, violating principles of good faith and fair dealing implied in insurance contracts.",

                "original_text": "DIVIDENDS. Each year, we will determine our divisible surplus. This contract's share, if any, will be credited as a dividend. Since we do not expect this contract to contribute to divisible surplus, it is not expected that any dividends will be credited.",
                "changed_text": "DIVIDENDS. Each year, we may or may not determine some form of divisible surplus. This contract's potential share, if any, might be considered for a possible dividend. Considering that we don't particularly anticipate this contract greatly contributing to a really clear divisible surplus, it's reasonably foreseeable that few or no dividends will likely be credited.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the process for determining dividends, even if they are not expected. The modified text introduces uncertainty using phrases like 'may or may not,' 'some form of,' 'potential share,' 'might be considered,' 'possible dividend,' 'don't particularly anticipate,' 'greatly contributing,' 'really clear,' 'reasonably foreseeable,' 'few or no,' and 'likely be credited.' These changes make it unclear whether dividends will ever be paid and under what conditions, creating an ambiguous obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "This could violate state insurance regulations related to disclosure and transparency in dividend policies. Policyholders are entitled to understand how dividends are determined. This change provides little certainty. (Wisconsin Law)",

Benefits are not expected to be drastically reduced or entirely eliminated by most future amendments to our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.",
                "explanation": "By using 'seemingly consists of', 'most, if not all', 'perhaps some', 'not expected to be drastically', and 'most future amendments,' the contract's scope becomes uncertain. Policyholders may not be able to clearly determine which documents comprise the entire contract. This introduces ambiguity about which terms are binding. This ambiguity can make it difficult for policyholders to enforce their rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "This undermines the principle of a complete and integrated agreement, which is foundational to contract law in most jurisdictions, including Wisconsin. It creates uncertainty about the enforceability of terms and could violate laws related to contract interpretation and good faith.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Parties will comply with the applicable SOPs in connection with the purchase and sale of products identified in a Purchase Schedule.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties will endeavor to comply with the applicable SOPs in connection with the purchase and sale of products identified in a Purchase Schedule.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will comply' with 'will endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation, making compliance subject to interpretation and effort rather than a strict requirement. This introduces ambiguity that could lead to disputes over whether sufficient effort was made to comply. Changing the phrase to include the action of 'endeavor' shows some compliance, but less than actually complying.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract principles; weakens enforceability of standard operating procedures, making the contract ambiguous and difficult to enforce.",

                "changed_text": "A Party will use reasonable efforts to notify the other Party of any significant change in circumstance during the Term in which the Party may no longer be in full compliance with the foregoing general representations, warranties and covenants.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces multiple ambiguities. 'Reasonable efforts' is vague compared to 'promptly notify.' 'Significant change' adds a subjective element to the notification requirement. 'May no longer be in full compliance' weakens the requirement to notify the other party, as full compliance is not defined.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract principles; weakens the duty to disclose material changes affecting representations and warranties, making the contract ambiguous and difficult to enforce.",

                "changed_text": "A Receiving Party will consider taking actions to safeguard the Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party in the possession of such Receiving Party against the unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information by other persons.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'will take all commercially reasonable actions required' to 'will consider taking actions' significantly weakens the obligation. It introduces discretion where none existed before, making it harder to enforce the requirement to safeguard confidential information. Changing 'commercially reasonable actions required' to simply 'actions' makes it ambiguous about what is reasonable or even required.",

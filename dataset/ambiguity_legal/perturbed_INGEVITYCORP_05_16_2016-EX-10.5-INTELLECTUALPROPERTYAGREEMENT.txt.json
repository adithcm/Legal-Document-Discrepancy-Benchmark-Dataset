                "original_text": "Each of Parent and SpinCo, at the request of the other, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, as soon as reasonably practicable, any consent, substitution, approval or amendment required to novate or assign all SpinCo IP Liabilities and obtain in writing the unconditional release of each member of the Parent Group that is a party to any such arrangements, so that, in any such case, the members of the SpinCo Group shall be solely responsible for such SpinCo IP Liabilities; provided, however, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, neither Parent nor SpinCo shall be obligated to contribute any capital or pay any consideration in any form (including providing any letter of credit, guaranty or other financial accommodation) to any third Person from whom any such consent, substitution, approval, amendment or release is requested.",
                "changed_text": "Each of Parent and SpinCo, at the request of the other, should endeavor to obtain, or cause to be obtained, any consent, substitution, approval or amendment required to novate or assign SpinCo IP Liabilities, potentially obtaining the release of each member of the Parent Group. The members of the SpinCo Group may be responsible for such SpinCo IP Liabilities; provided, however, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, neither Parent nor SpinCo are explicitly obligated to contribute any capital or pay any consideration to any third Person from whom any such consent, substitution, approval, amendment or release is requested.",
                "explanation": "The modification from 'shall use its commercially reasonable efforts' to 'should endeavor to obtain' weakens the obligation. The phrase 'potentially obtaining the release' creates uncertainty about whether a release is required. The phrase 'may be responsible' makes the responsibility of SpinCo ambiguous and non-committal. The change from 'shall be obligated' to 'are explicitly obligated' introduces an ambiguity in the extent of responsibility that contradicts the original intent.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding the definiteness of obligation. A contract must have clear and definite terms to be enforceable. The changes introduced undermine the definiteness of the obligation, making it difficult to enforce under Delaware law, which governs the contract as stated in Section 8.2, referencing Section 10.2 of the Separation Agreement.",

                "original_text": "Subject to subsections (i)-(iii) of this Section 5.1(a), each Party agrees that prior to the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time (\"Delivery Date\"), it will deliver possession of any Tangible/Intangible Information of the other Party that is in its possession or control to the other Party, without retaining any copies.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to subsections (i)-(iii) of this Section 5.1(a), each Party should aim to deliver possession of Tangible/Intangible Information to the other Party by the Delivery Date, possibly without retaining copies.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees that it will deliver' to 'should aim to deliver' weakens the commitment. Adding 'possibly without retaining copies' introduces doubt about the obligation not to retain copies. This ambiguity makes it unclear whether the parties are legally bound to deliver all information and refrain from keeping copies.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding performance of obligations. The original clause sets a clear requirement for delivery of information without retention of copies. The modified text makes this a goal rather than a firm commitment, undermining the enforceability of this requirement. Delaware law requires clarity and definiteness in contractual obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Without limiting the foregoing, prior to, on and after the Effective Time, each Party hereto might cooperate with the other Party, and without any further consideration, but at the expense of the requesting Party, to execute and deliver, or perhaps attempt to cause to be executed and delivered, all instruments, including instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer, and to make some filings with, and maybe seek Approvals or Notifications of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person. Parties may take actions requested by the other Party, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, to effectuate the provisions of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall cooperate' to 'might cooperate' creates ambiguity. The phrase 'perhaps attempt to cause to be executed' weakens the obligation to ensure delivery. The phrase 'to make some filings with, and maybe seek Approvals or Notifications of' introduces doubt about the requirement to make all necessary filings and obtain approvals. The modification undermines the enforceability of the obligation by making it discretionary. This introduces uncertainty about the level of commitment required from each party in fulfilling their obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding the requirements for cooperation and good faith in contractual performance. The modified text renders the obligation to cooperate vague and non-committal, making it difficult to enforce. Delaware law emphasizes the importance of clear obligations in contracts.",

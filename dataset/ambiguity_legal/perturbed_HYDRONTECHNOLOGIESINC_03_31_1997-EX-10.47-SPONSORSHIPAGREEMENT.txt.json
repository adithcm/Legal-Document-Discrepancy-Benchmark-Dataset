                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Dolphins will advise Hydron of any development of or changes in these rules and policies that might adversely affect the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Dolphins will endeavor to inform Hydron of developments or changes in these rules and policies.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will advise' to 'will endeavor to inform' weakens the obligation. There is no specific requirement on how diligently the Dolphins must inform Hydron, or the timeframe, introducing ambiguity. This can affect Hydron's ability to adjust its activities, potentially leading to non-compliance with stadium policies.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract due to failure of duty of good faith and fair dealing as implied in all Florida contracts, which requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in the performance of their contractual obligations.",

                "original_text": "The parties agree that this Agreement shall automatically be subject to any new or amended National Football League (the \"NFL\") rules or regulations applicable to advertising or promotional benefits provided by NFL member teams to its sponsors effective as 3 of the date such regulation shall take effect and that this Agreement shall incorporate and be subject to the Constitution, By-Laws, rules and regulations, the duly authorized resolutions of the governing body, the decrees and rulings of the commissioner and the terms and conditions of any and all agreements to which the NFL is a party and as to which the NFL has bound its member clubs (collectively all of such regulations, resolutions, decrees and agreements are referred to as the \"Governing League Policies\"). The Dolphins shall advise Hydron of any changes therein which may materially and adversely affect the Sponsorship Rights.",
                "changed_text": "The parties acknowledge that this Agreement may be subject to new or amended NFL rules or regulations. The Dolphins will try to keep Hydron updated about any significant changes.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the agreement is automatically subject to NFL rules. Changing this to 'may be subject to' introduces uncertainty about whether specific rules actually apply. Replacing 'shall advise' with 'will try to keep updated' further weakens the Dolphins' obligation to inform Hydron of changes. This ambiguity can lead to Hydron unknowingly violating NFL rules related to advertising or promotional benefits, jeopardizing the sponsorship agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract for failure to meet the duty of notification and adherence to standards expected in commercial agreements, conflicting with good faith performance standards under Florida law.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Dolphins hereby agree, in good faith, to attempt to reschedule any aspect of the Sponsorship Rights which is prevented from occurring as scheduled, at such date as may be 7 reasonably agreeable to the Dolphins and Hydron.",
                "changed_text": "The Dolphins will consider rescheduling affected aspects of the Sponsorship Rights, subject to their availability.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agree, in good faith, to attempt to reschedule' with 'will consider rescheduling...subject to their availability' significantly weakens the obligation. 'Will consider' is discretionary and 'subject to their availability' introduces an undefined condition that the Dolphins can easily manipulate to avoid rescheduling. This introduces ambiguity, making it more difficult for Hydron to enforce their sponsorship rights if events are cancelled, and potentially constitutes a breach of good faith effort.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Florida contract law, where the change allows the Dolphins to potentially avoid rescheduling without demonstrating reasonable efforts.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each party shall comply with all prevailing laws, rules and regulations and obtain all necessary approvals, consents and permits required by the applicable agencies of the government of the jurisdictions that apply to its activities or obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each party should endeavor to comply with prevailing laws, rules and regulations, and attempt to obtain necessary approvals, consents and permits required by the applicable government agencies.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall comply' to 'should endeavor to comply' and 'obtain' to 'attempt to obtain' introduces ambiguity. This makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. 'Prevailing laws' is also ambiguous, as it is not specified which jurisdiction's laws are referenced.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies based on jurisdiction, but could contradict environmental regulations like the Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act (federal) or similar state-level environmental laws that mandate strict compliance with permitting requirements.",

                "changed_text": "PaperExchange may, at its discretion, participate in relevant industry events. The extent of such participation is subject to resource availability and business priorities.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces a specific obligation ('shall use commercially reasonable efforts') with a discretionary one ('may, at its discretion'). Removing the specification of booth exhibitions, sales force attendance, and industry panel sponsorships makes the obligation vague. It is unclear what level of effort is deemed sufficient, and 'business priorities' introduces a subjective element.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, as it allows PaperExchange to avoid the obligation to promote the co-branding agreement with VerticalNet.",

                "changed_text": "VerticalNet shall attempt to maintain the Co-Branded Sites, within its available resources.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall maintain' to 'shall attempt to maintain' and adding the phrase 'within its available resources' makes the obligation to maintain the site non-mandatory and dependent on available resources, which introduces uncertainty. The original text's commitment to a 'high quality and professional manner' is also removed, weakening the obligation.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Vendor shall maintain insurance for not less than the following limits and coverage with duly licensed insurance companies having an A.M.  Best rating of A-, X or better. In addition to covering all of the normal operations of Vendor, this insurance shall cover all of the activities and  events described under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Vendor should endeavor to maintain insurance coverage that it believes is adequate, potentially with companies holding a generally recognized rating. Insurance should generally cover normal operations; coverage for events described under this agreement will be considered.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates specific insurance coverage and ratings. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall maintain' with 'should endeavor,' weakening the obligation. The specificity of the A.M. Best rating is watered down to a 'generally recognized rating.' Finally, 'shall cover' becomes 'will be considered,' creating uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "Vendor generally believes it has the authority to enter into this Agreement. Vendor is not aware of any entity with exclusive rights. Vendor will attempt to perform its obligations in general compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides clear representations and warranties. The modified text weakens these by replacing 'represents and warrants' with 'generally believes,' 'is not aware of,' and 'will attempt to perform.' This introduces ambiguity and reduces the vendor's liability for breach of warranty.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may, if they choose to, change its address for notice by perhaps notifying the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original text has a clear statement that either party can change the address for notice. The modified text replaced 'may' with 'may, if they choose to' and 'giving written notice' to 'perhaps notifying', reducing the strength of this obligation by not making the change and notification mandatory. This makes the process of changing the address and notifying the other party unclear.",

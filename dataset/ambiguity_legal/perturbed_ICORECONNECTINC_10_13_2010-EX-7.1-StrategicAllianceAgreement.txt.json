                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "IMedicor will make its records available for audit purposes at any time by USA MCO during regular business hours at the headquarters of iMedicor.",
                "changed_text": "IMedicor will, upon request, consider making some of its records available for potential audit purposes by USA MCO during mutually agreed upon times.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding IMedicor's obligation to provide records for auditing. Replacing 'will make its records available at any time' with 'will, upon request, consider making some of its records available' weakens the obligation and makes it discretionary. Adding 'potential' and 'mutually agreed upon times' further reduces the certainty and scope of the audit, conflicting with typical audit requirements, which demand unrestricted access to financial records.",
                "contradicted_law": "Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires companies to maintain accurate financial records and internal controls, including allowing auditors adequate access to information.",

                "original_text": "All revenue sharing will be reconciled monthly and funds distributed by the 20th of each month by wire transfer for all net collected revenues for the previous month (net of returns and refunds, if any).",
                "changed_text": "Revenue sharing may be reconciled periodically, and funds may be distributed around the 20th of each month, subject to internal accounting procedures, for a portion of net collected revenues.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states a monthly reconciliation and distribution of funds. The modified text introduces ambiguity by changing 'will be reconciled monthly' to 'may be reconciled periodically,' making the frequency uncertain. 'Funds distributed by the 20th of each month' is altered to 'funds may be distributed around the 20th of each month, subject to internal accounting procedures,' making the timing discretionary. 'All net collected revenues' becomes 'a portion of net collected revenues,' leaving the exact amount to be distributed undefined. This lack of clarity directly affects financial transparency and reporting requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which require transparent and consistent financial reporting.",

                "changed_text": "Each party believes that its conduct hereunder generally conforms to applicable laws and regulations to the best of their knowledge.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a firm commitment to comply with all applicable laws. The modified text introduces significant ambiguity and weakens the obligation. 'Represents and warrants' is changed to 'believes that its conduct generally conforms,' making compliance based on subjective belief rather than objective fact. Adding 'to the best of their knowledge' further diminishes the obligation, allowing a party to potentially avoid liability by claiming ignorance of the law.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law, which require parties to be bound by their representations and warranties. Also, specific industry regulations for healthcare such as HIPAA that require strict compliance, not just a 'belief' of compliance.",

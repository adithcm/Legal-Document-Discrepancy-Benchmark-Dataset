                "explanation": "The original text requires specific deliverables (number of games, applications, MMS, etc.) in specific languages. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall develop and distribute' with 'shall endeavor to develop and distribute,' making the obligation less strict. 'Where feasible' is replaced with 'if convenient,' introducing a subjective measure of deliverability. 'Up to', 'approximately,' 'roughly,' and 'around' make the quantities unclear and less binding, and 'in each of the following five languages' is changed to 'a few languages,' which is open to interpretation. Finally, 'with Portuguese, Greek, Dutch and Swedish to be made available where practicable' is altered to 'with other languages to be considered' leaving those languages optional rather than obligatory.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Definiteness of Terms. This violates the principle that contracts must have definite and certain terms to be enforceable. The changes make the obligations too vague.",

                "changed_text": "Fox may produce the KOH Video Clips, and Licensee may reimburse Fox for some production costs associated with the potential production of some KOH Video Clips, with the understanding that these costs might be used by Licensee to perhaps recoup some of Licensee's Guarantee payable to Fox under the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Fox *shall* produce the video clips, and the Licensee *shall* reimburse Fox. The modified text changes 'shall' to 'may' for both parties, making the obligations optional. Furthermore, words like 'some' and 'potential' make the description of the clips much more ambiguous, leaving the possibility for both to not do anything related to the clips.",

Source: GLU MOBILE INC, S-1/A, 3/19/2007 (US$*****), and might attempt to pay a vaguely determined amount of the remaining Guarantee, perhaps totaling a partial Guarantee payment by Licensee to Fox of an unspecified amount (\"Possible Guarantee Consideration\").",
                "explanation": "The original text dictates a strict forfeiture and immediate payment of remaining guarantees. The modified version uses softer language such as 'might consider' and 'might attempt' to weaken the mandatory nature of these financial obligations. The phrases 'vaguely determined amount', 'perhaps totaling', and 'unspecified amount' introduce significant ambiguity regarding the actual financial responsibilities of the Licensee. The change from 'Guarantee Forfeiture Payment' to 'Possible Guarantee Consideration' further dilutes the clear financial obligation.",

For the purposes of this Agreement, an \"Impression\" is defined as any link to the NetGrocer Site, whether graphic, text or any combination of graphic and text, served by Excite to a user as part of an HTML page, part of the Excite's Internet chat service or part of search results displayed in \"Excite Shopping Service powered by Jango\".",

For the purposes of this Agreement, an \"Impression\" is defined as a potential link to the NetGrocer Site, with the exact criteria of whether this counts being up to Excite.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that reasonable commercial efforts will be used to deliver impressions, making the obligation somewhat clear. Changing it to 'may attempt' introduces ambiguity, making the delivery of impressions discretionary rather than mandatory. The changed definition of 'Impression', additionally, introduces ambiguity by giving Excite full discretion over whether or not to count a link as an impression.",

Excite guarantees that it will deliver four million fifty thousand (4,050,000) \"Click-throughs\" on the promotional placements and advertising banners described in Section 1(a) - (d) in the second year of the term of the Agreement by delivering [*] of the annual guaranteed \"Click-throughs\" in the first quarter of the second year of the term of the Agreement, a cumulative total of [*] of the annual guaranteed \"Click-throughs\" in the second quarter of the second year of the term of the Agreement, a cumulative total of [*] of the annual guaranteed \"click-throughs\" in the third quarter of the second year of the term of the Agreement and a cumulative total of 100% of the annual guaranteed \"Click-throughs\" in the fourth quarter of the second year of the term of the Agreement.",

Excite hopes to deliver some of the annual guaranteed \"Click-throughs\" in each quarter. Excite generally intends to deliver around four million \"Click-throughs\" on the promotional placements and advertising banners described in Section 1(a) - (d) in the second year of the term of the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"guarantees that it will deliver\" with \"aims to deliver\" and \"hopes to deliver\" weakens the obligation to a mere intention or aspiration. Removing the specific guaranteed amounts per quarter introduces further ambiguity, making it difficult to hold Excite accountable for specific performance targets. This change makes it harder to assess the real monetary value of the contract, and can therefore be considered vague or even misleading.",

NetGrocer may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Excite cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect the records of Excite reasonably -8- related to the calculation of such payments during Excite's normal business hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant will be paid by NetGrocer unless the audit finds a discrepancy of more than five percent (5%) with respect to the item being audited, in which case Excite shall be responsible for the payment of the reasonable fees for such inspection.",

The costs will be addressed according to mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"Excite will maintain accurate records\" to \"Excite will try to maintain records\" reduces the legal obligation for accuracy. Replacing \"no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice\" with \"reasonable prior notice\" introduces ambiguity in the notice period. Furthermore, changing the obligation for fee payment based on discrepancy with \"costs will be addressed according to mutual agreement\" eliminates the clear allocation of responsibility, making it uncertain and potentially unenforceable. This can potentially be a breach of fiduciary duty, if not done in good faith.",

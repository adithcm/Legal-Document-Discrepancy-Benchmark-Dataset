NEITHER PARTY WILL BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS AS THEY RELATE TO SUCH USAGE REPORTS, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH USAGE REPORTS SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR PAYMENTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.",

Neither party will be held liable for any claims as they relate to such usage reports, except to the extent that such usage reports are the basis for payments under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by changing 'will use reasonable efforts' to 'will attempt,' weakening the obligation to ensure accuracy. Furthermore, the removal of the phrase 'warrants that the usage reports will conform to any specifications at any given time' makes the expected level of accuracy unclear. By omitting 'reasonable efforts' and replacing 'warrants' with 'guarantees' makes obligations uncertain and unenforceable. This affects New York state's laws regarding fair and accurate business practices.",

                "explanation": "This modification weakens the indemnity obligations by replacing 'will indemnify, defend and hold harmless' with 'will endeavor to indemnify, defend and hold harmless,' making the obligation less definitive. Replacing 'will reasonably cooperate' with 'will attempt to cooperate' further reduces the certainty of Sponsor's cooperation. Also the removal of phrases such as 'any and all' and 'not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed' makes the clause more open to interpretation. In New York, breach of contract claims require clear and unambiguous obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text is modified to create ambiguity in the indemnity clause. 'Sponsor will indemnify' becomes 'Sponsor shall reasonably indemnify' which is less definitive. The phrase 'Any and all' are omitted which makes the section less expansive. 'Excite will promptly notify Sponsor' changes to 'Excite will endeavor to notify Sponsor' weakens the promptness requirement. Furthermore, 'reasonably cooperate' is changed to 'to cooperate'. Such phrases undermine the explicit obligation by introducing loopholes and a degree of discretion, making the obligations difficult to enforce under New York contract law.",

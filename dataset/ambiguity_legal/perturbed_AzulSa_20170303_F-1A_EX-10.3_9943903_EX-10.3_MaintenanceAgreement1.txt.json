                "explanation": "By changing 'shall maintain' to 'should consider maintaining' and 'should make good-faith efforts', and other similar changes, the mandatory obligation to maintain specific insurance coverage is weakened. The use of 'may,' 'might,' and 'could' makes the insurance requirements discretionary rather than obligatory, which contradicts Brazilian Aviation Regulations, which may require certain minimum insurance coverage for aircraft operations and maintenance agreements. This introduces ambiguity and could lead to non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity into the termination clause. Replacing 'shall be entitled to terminate' with 'may be entitled to consider terminating' makes the right to terminate discretionary. The use of vague terms like 'something resembling insolvency,' 'arguably in Default,' 'maybe doesn't remedy it,' 'making some payments,' 'some compliance with Clause 17,' and 'generally trying to meet other obligations' makes it difficult to determine what constitutes a valid reason for termination. By creating ambiguity around the definition of default and the obligations of each party, this change could render the termination clause unenforceable under New York law, where contracts require clear and definite terms.",

By changing 'shall' to 'should,' and adding terms like 'generally,' 'with regard to,' 'consider,' 'thinking about,' 'try to,' 'some information,' and 'reasonable condition,' the modified text weakens these obligations and introduces significant ambiguity.

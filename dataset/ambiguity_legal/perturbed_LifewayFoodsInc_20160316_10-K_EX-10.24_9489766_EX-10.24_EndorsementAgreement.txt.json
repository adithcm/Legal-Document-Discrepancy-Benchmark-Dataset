                "original_text": "Individual agrees that, during the Term hereof, she will not render similar services for, or permit the use of her name, nickname, likeness, voice, live or recorded performance, photograph, signature or facsimile thereof, and biographical materials in advertising or publicizing in any medium for any other Kefir product, yogurt product, cheese, frozen desserts and other products that compete with products manufactured or distributed by Lifeway and its affiliates, subsidiaries and parent companies other than those products manufactured or distributed by Lifeway and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and parent companies.",
                "changed_text": "Individual agrees that, during the Term hereof, she will endeavor not to render similar services for, or allow the use of her name, nickname, likeness, voice, live or recorded performance, photograph, signature or facsimile thereof, and biographical materials in advertising or publicizing in any medium for any other Kefir product, yogurt product, cheese, frozen desserts and other products that compete with products manufactured or distributed by Lifeway and its affiliates, subsidiaries and parent companies other than those products manufactured or distributed by Lifeway and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and parent companies.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"will not render\" to \"will endeavor not to render\" weakens the restriction on the Individual. \"Endeavor\" is a subjective term that introduces ambiguity, and it is unclear what level of effort is required, or what constitutes a violation. The inclusion of the word \"allow\" in place of \"permit\" introduces ambiguity, as to what \"allow\" means, and whether or not that has any bearing on similar services rendered for competing products.",

                "explanation": "This modification adds ambiguity. 'Reasonably indemnify' is vague; it's unclear what constitutes 'reasonable' indemnification. 'Claims arguably arising' introduces uncertainty as to the causal link required. 'Materially false statements knowingly made' raises the burden of proof on Lifeway by requiring them to prove the Individual's knowledge, making the obligation difficult to enforce.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"agrees to protect the confidential information in a reasonable and appropriate manner\" to \"should consider protecting the confidential information\" weakens the confidentiality obligations. The original clause established a clear requirement to protect confidential information, while the modified clause makes it discretionary. Also, changing \"use confidential information only to perform its obligations under this Agreement\" to \"use said information to perform any obligations\" broadens the scope for its use.",

                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13G (including amendments thereto) with respect to the Common Stock of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and further agree that this agreement be included as an exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned may consider joint filing on behalf of each of them a statement on Schedule 13G (including amendments thereto) with respect to the Common Stock of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and this agreement might be included as an exhibit to such filing.",
                "explanation": "The phrases 'may consider' and 'might be included' introduce ambiguity regarding the obligation to file jointly, weakening the commitment. This could be interpreted as discretionary rather than mandatory.",
                "contradicted_law": "Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13d-1(k), which requires definitive agreements for joint filings and disclosures.",

                "changed_text": "Each party to the agreement may authorize another party to file amendments to such statement, depending on circumstances.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'expressly authorizes' to 'may authorize, depending on circumstances' creates ambiguity about the authorization process for filing amendments. This makes it unclear whether authorization is guaranteed or subject to unspecified conditions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires clear and unambiguous delegation of authority for filing amendments to Schedule 13G.",

                "changed_text": "The parties will attempt to ensure this joint filing agreement is signed.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the joint filing agreement may be signed in counterparts. The modified clause replaces 'agrees that this joint filing agreement may be signed in counterparts' with 'will attempt to ensure this joint filing agreement is signed'. The modified text waters down the guarantee that the agreement may be signed by counterparts, implying that there is a chance that the agreement will not be signed. This can cause uncertainty regarding the completeness of agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "It contradicts the principle of contract law that emphasizes the binding nature of agreements",

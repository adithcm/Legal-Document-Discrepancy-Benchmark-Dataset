                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "2.2 Distributor will use best efforts to develop the local market and promote the sales of Products within the Territory. Distributor will not sell outside the Territory without Tripath's prior written permission, which will not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "changed_text": "2.2 Distributor will endeavor to develop the local market and promote the sales of Products within the Territory. Distributor may sell outside the Territory if they make a good faith effort to obtain Tripath's permission.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'best efforts' to 'endeavor' and 'will not sell... without permission' to 'may sell if they make a good faith effort' weakens the distributor's obligation and introduces ambiguity. The term 'good faith effort' lacks a clear definition, making it difficult to enforce and potentially allowing sales outside the territory without proper authorization.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires the distributor to maintain an 'adequately trained' sales organization. The modified text changes this to 'should maintain a sales organization that is generally trained,' which significantly weakens the obligation. The term 'generally trained' is vague and subjective, making it difficult to determine whether the distributor is in compliance. This creates ambiguity and reduces the enforceability of the obligation to maintain a competent sales force, potentially impacting the sales of Tripath products.",

                "original_text": "11.1 Distributor will submit reports as may be reasonably requested by Tripath, including, without limitation, monthly reports of inventory on hand and sales relating to the Products. Sales data will include, without limitation, Product part number, quantity, resale price, special pricing, distributor invoice number, and customer name. Distributor will submit these reports electronically on a timely basis each month and in no case later than two weeks after the beginning of the month.",
                "changed_text": "11.1 Distributor will attempt to submit reports as requested by Tripath, including monthly reports of inventory on hand and sales relating to the Products. Sales data may include Product part number, quantity, resale price, special pricing, distributor invoice number, and customer name, if reasonably available. Distributor will try to submit these reports electronically in a generally timely manner.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will submit reports' to 'will attempt to submit reports' and 'Sales data will include' to 'Sales data may include, if reasonably available' weakens the obligation to provide detailed sales reports. The phrases 'if reasonably available' and 'generally timely manner' introduce ambiguity, making it difficult to enforce the requirement to provide complete and timely reports. This could hinder Tripath's ability to track sales and inventory effectively, and creates uncertainty regarding the distributor's reporting responsibilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law - Uncertainty in reporting requirements can make it difficult to demonstrate a material breach of contract.",

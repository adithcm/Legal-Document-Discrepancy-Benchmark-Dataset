                "original_text": "Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Business Plan, the Agent will at its sole expense: (a) meet the Agent's performance criteria set forth in the Business Plan; (b) use its reasonable best efforts to market and promote the sale of the Products to Customers throughout those portions of the Territory in which the Agent has field sales representatives on and after the Agent Launch Date, through direct sales calls, advertising and other appropriate means (all such marketing and promotional activities to be in accordance with the Business Plan or as otherwise expressly proposed by the Agent and approved in writing by the Company);",
                "changed_text": "Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Business Plan, the Agent will at its sole expense: (a) endeavor to align with the Agent's performance criteria set forth in the Business Plan; (b) use efforts to market and promote the sale of the Products to Customers throughout those portions of the Territory in which the Agent has field sales representatives on and after the Agent Launch Date, through direct sales calls, advertising and other means (all such marketing and promotional activities should consider the Business Plan or as generally proposed by the Agent with notification to the Company);",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the agent to meet performance criteria and use 'reasonable best efforts,' which are relatively clear obligations. The modified text replaces 'meet' with 'endeavor to align with,' weakening the obligation. It also replaces 'reasonable best efforts' with 'efforts,' and changes 'to be in accordance with' to 'should consider,' and 'expressly proposed by the Agent and approved in writing by the Company' to 'generally proposed by the Agent with notification to the Company,' making the marketing and promotional activity requirements less strict and more ambiguous. This shift from 'shall' to weaker terms introduces vagueness, making enforcement difficult.",

Product(s) shipped to the Customer will be billed to the Agent at the price stated on a current price list or according to the current price program minus a ten (10) percent discount as outlined in Paragraph 1.5(d). It is the responsibility of the Agent to evaluate the credit worthiness of the Customer. Upon transmitting an order for shipment to the Company, the Agent accepts full responsibility for payment of the product from the Customer.",

Product(s) shipped to the Customer will be billed to the Agent at a price that may align with the current price list or according to the current price program minus an approximate discount as generally outlined in Paragraph 1.5(d). The Agent should, when possible, consider the credit worthiness of the Customer. Upon transmitting an order for shipment to the Company, the Agent acknowledges a shared responsibility for payment of the product from the Customer.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the agent 'follow' the company's credit policy and accepts 'full responsibility' for payment. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating the agent should 'generally consider' the credit policy, bills the products at a price that 'may align with' the current price list with an 'approximate' discount as 'generally' outlined. The Agent should 'when possible, consider' the credit worthiness of the Customer, and has a 'shared responsibility' for payment. The change from 'follow' to 'generally consider,' from 'full responsibility' to 'shared responsibility', and the use of the words 'may align with' and 'approximate' weakens the legal obligation and introduces vagueness.",

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if either the Company or the Agent is delayed in or prevented from fulfilling any of its obligations hereunder by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control (including, but not limited to acts of God, fire, third party strike, flood, delay of transportation or inability to obtain necessary raw materials through normal commercial channels), then that party will not be liable under this Agreement for damages resulting from such delay or failure. Each party will promptly notify the other upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any such cause and will use its reasonable best efforts to minimize any resulting delay in or interference with the performance of its obligations hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "5.5. Force Majeure. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if either the Company or the Agent experiences difficulty in fulfilling any of its obligations hereunder due to events it perceives as challenging (including potential acts of disruption, possible delays, or perceived resource constraints), then that party's liability for resulting impacts may be adjusted. Each party will endeavor to inform the other of significant events and consider reasonable steps to address related challenges.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear definition of 'force majeure' events and states the party 'will not be liable.' The modified text replaces this with vague language such as 'experiences difficulty,' 'events it perceives as challenging,' 'potential acts of disruption,' 'possible delays,' and 'perceived resource constraints.' It also changes the consequence to 'liability for resulting impacts may be adjusted,' making the limitation of liability discretionary rather than absolute. This weakens the protection offered by the force majeure clause and introduces significant ambiguity regarding the scope of excused performance, and removes requirement for using its 'reasonable best efforts'.",

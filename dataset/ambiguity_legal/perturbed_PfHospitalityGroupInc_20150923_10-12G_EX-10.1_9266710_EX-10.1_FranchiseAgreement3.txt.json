                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not' to 'should endeavor not to' weakens the obligation to protect confidential information, making it a suggestion rather than a strict requirement. This introduces ambiguity and makes enforcement difficult.",

                "original_text": "(b) Member covenants and agrees that during the term of the Franchise Agreement, except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor, Member shall not, either directly or indirectly, for itself, or through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, persons, partnership, corporation, or entity: (i) Own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, rent or lease to, or have any other interest in business that (directly or indirectly) operates, or grants franchises or licenses to operate, a restaurant featuring pizza and related food specialties or that offers products or services substantially similar to those then offered by Pizza Fusions Restaurants (\"Competitive Business\");",
                "changed_text": "(b) Member should consider refraining, during the term of the Franchise Agreement, unless explicitly disallowed by Franchisor, from activities that might appear to compete, either directly or indirectly, for itself, or through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, persons, partnership, corporation, or entity: (i) Possibly owning, vaguely managing, tentatively engaging in, being employed by, advising, making loans to, consulting for, renting or leasing to, or having any ill-defined interest in a business that (perhaps indirectly) operates, or grants franchises or licenses to operate, a restaurant featuring pizza and related food specialties or that offers products or services somewhat similar to those then offered by Pizza Fusions Restaurants (\"Competitive Business\");",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces multiple ambiguities. Replacing 'shall not' with 'should consider refraining' weakens the non-compete obligation. Terms like 'might appear to compete', 'possibly owning', 'vaguely managing', 'tentatively engaging', 'perhaps indirectly', and 'somewhat similar' make the scope of prohibited activities unclear and unenforceable. The caveat of 'unless explicitly disallowed' further complicates the restrictions.",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws governing non-compete agreements, which often require clear and specific definitions of prohibited activities and geographic scope for the agreement to be enforceable. The ambiguity introduced here would make it difficult to enforce the non-compete agreement.",

                "changed_text": "Member vaguely acknowledges that some failures to comply with some requirements of this Agreement might cause Franchisor potential injury, and Member perhaps agrees to pay some court costs and potentially reasonable attorney's fees if Franchisor vaguely attempts to obtain specific performance, or an injunction against potential violations of, the supposed requirements of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the acknowledgement of damages and the obligation to pay legal fees. 'Vaguely acknowledges', 'some failures', 'some requirements', 'potential injury', 'perhaps agrees', 'some court costs', 'potentially reasonable', 'vaguely attempts', 'potential violations', and 'supposed requirements' all create ambiguity and uncertainty about the member's liability, making it more difficult for the Franchisor to recover damages or legal fees in case of a breach.",

                "original_text": "CHT shall require each End User to enter into and execute a subscription agreement in a form and substance satisfactory to Ehave and CHT, acting reasonably, and which contains provisions similar to Ehave's collaboration agreement for the use of the Ehave solution (the \"Subscription Agreement\"). Ehave shall be a third party beneficiary hereunder, but shall not have any obligations to the End User thereunder.",
                "changed_text": "CHT shall encourage each End User to consider a subscription agreement that might resemble Ehave's collaboration agreement. Ehave may be seen as a third-party beneficiary, but this carries no firm commitment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing the mandatory \"shall require\" with the suggestive \"shall encourage\" and the definitive \"enter into and execute\" with the vague \"consider\". The requirement for the agreement to be 'satisfactory to Ehave' is removed, and the third-party beneficiary status becomes uncertain ('may be seen as'). This weakens the legal obligation of CHT to ensure End Users are bound by a subscription agreement that protects Ehave's interests, creating uncertainty about the enforceability of these provisions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law, specifically regarding enforceability and third-party beneficiary rights. In Ontario, contract law requires clear intention to create legal relations and certainty of terms.",

                "original_text": "Ehave shall implement and maintain those safeguards and controls set out in Schedule \"5\" to deter and for the detection, prevention and correction of any unauthorized intrusion, access or use of the Ehave Companion Solution, as well as to protect against any loss, theft or unauthorized access, use, disclosure, copying, or modification of End User Data.",
                "changed_text": "Ehave should endeavor to implement safeguards and controls that they feel are appropriate, to deter unauthorized intrusion, access, or use of the Ehave Companion Solution, and aim to protect against loss or unauthorized access to End User Data.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires Ehave to implement and maintain specific safeguards. The modified text weakens this obligation by replacing \"shall implement and maintain\" with \"should endeavor to implement,\" making the implementation discretionary rather than mandatory. Also, the new text replaces 'safeguards and controls set out in Schedule \"5\"' to 'safeguards and controls that they feel are appropriate' which makes it subjective by changing the measure. The obligation to protect against loss or unauthorized access is softened by removing “theft, use, disclosure, copying, or modification” and by replacing 'as well as protect' with 'and aim to protect'.",
                "contradicted_law": "PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) in Canada, which mandates specific and reasonable security measures to protect personal information.

                "changed_text": "CHT will consider providing Ehave and its Auditors some access, with what CHT deems is reasonable notice, to select facilities, systems and books related to this Agreement. Such access is solely for verifying royalty calculations.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens Ehave's audit rights. 'CHT will provide' is replaced with 'CHT will consider providing', making access discretionary. The scope of access is limited to 'select facilities, systems and books', removing the comprehensive access to 'all facilities, systems and assets'. Notice period is subject to 'what CHT deems is reasonable'. The access is restricted only to verifying royalty calculations, removing the right to 'verify compliance with the requirements set out in this Agreement'.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - specifically concerning the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. By significantly restricting audit rights, CHT creates uncertainty and makes it difficult for Ehave to ensure compliance, potentially breaching this implied duty. In Ontario, parties must act honestly and reasonably in the performance of their contractual obligations.",

Gregor,  chairman and chief executive officer of United National.  \"During the past year we completed an assessment of our  information  processing  needs going forward into the next  century.  After evaluating a number of different options, we determined that the flexibility and quality of BISYS'  TOTALPLUS (R) system would best serve our needs today and for years to come.\"",

Gregor, chairman and chief executive officer of United National. \"During the past year we completed an assessment of our information processing needs going forward into the next century.

                "explanation": "Changing 'opportunities available' to 'opportunities potentially available' and 'would best serve' to 'might serve' introduces ambiguity about the certainty of benefits expected from the partnership. This ambiguity reduces the binding nature of the agreement and shifts the commitment to BISYS' services.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract principles under New Jersey law (since the company is located in Bridgewater, NJ). A valid contract requires a 'meeting of the minds,' which includes a clear understanding of the expected benefits. Ambiguity around the core service provision undermines this clarity.",

Nevertheless, we anticipate that the capabilities which BISYS offers are somewhat better matched to the possible future direction of our Bank.\"",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'has made a great deal of sense' with 'may have made sense,' 'has allowed United National to realize significant efficiencies' with 'might have allowed United National to see some efficiencies,' and 'future direction' with 'possible future direction' introduces doubt about the past performance of United Financial Services and the future benefits expected from BISYS. It transforms definitive statements into speculative ones.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract principles under New Jersey law. The introduced ambiguity makes it harder to prove reliance on specific, promised benefits, potentially weakening any future claim of breach based on BISYS not delivering expected results.",

                "changed_text": "Cargill will attempt to perform the Work Plan in a workmanlike manner with skill and care, considering industry practices and professional guidelines;",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation by replacing 'reasonable skill and care ordinarily exercised' with a vaguer 'skill and care,' and replaces 'in accordance with accepted industry practices' with 'considering industry practices'. This introduces ambiguity and makes it difficult to enforce a specific standard of performance.",

                "changed_text": "Subject to Section 13.1, Cargill generally has in effect permits, licenses, and other authorizations to perform the Work Plan, where practically possible;",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'generally' and 'where practically possible' weakens the obligation to maintain all necessary permits and licenses. It introduces ambiguity as to what constitutes 'practically possible,' potentially leading to non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This vague language makes it harder to prove a breach of contract if Cargill lacks a necessary permit.",

                "changed_text": "The Receiving Party will endeavor to take steps it deems adequate to protect Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'proper and appropriate steps' with 'steps it deems adequate' makes the confidentiality obligation subjective. This contradicts the intent of ensuring strong protection of confidential information, and shifts the evaluation of the protective measure from an objective standard to a subjective one. The term 'endeavor' weakens the obligation.",

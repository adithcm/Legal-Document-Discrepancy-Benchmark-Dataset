                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor shall at all times comply with all applicable laws and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall endeavor to comply with what they perceive to be applicable laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply with what they perceive' introduces ambiguity. The distributor's subjective perception of applicable laws replaces a clear obligation to comply with *all* applicable laws. This creates uncertainty and potential non-compliance, as the distributor may not correctly identify all relevant legal requirements, or may choose to disregard laws they don't 'perceive' as applicable.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts the fundamental principle of legal compliance, where ignorance of the law is not an excuse. Specifically, it could violate numerous federal and state regulations, including but not limited to FDA regulations related to medical device marketing (given the nature of the products) and general business operation laws. In California, where the Distributor's address is located, this would violate California Business and Professions Code regarding adherence to all state and federal laws.",

                "original_text": "Distributor shall maintain appropriate records concerning the sales of the Products. Such records shall include at a minimum the name, address and telephone number of each customer, the date of sale, a listing of the Products sold to each customer. Upon Erchonia's request, Distributor shall provide Erchonia with regular periodic reports including the information described in this paragraph. All such information shall be available for inspection by Erchonia, upon reasonable notice. Distributor shall also maintain such other records related to sales of the Products as Erchonia may reasonably request.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall maintain records concerning the sales of the Products as they deem necessary. Upon Erchonia's request, Distributor may provide Erchonia with reports including information at their discretion. All such information shall be available for inspection by Erchonia, subject to the Distributor's privacy policies. Distributor shall also consider maintaining other records related to sales of the Products as Erchonia may suggest.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates specific record-keeping requirements. The modified text makes these requirements subjective ('as they deem necessary,' 'at their discretion,' 'subject to the Distributor's privacy policies,' 'may suggest'). This weakens the obligation and introduces ambiguity, as the distributor can now decide what records to keep, what information to share, and what access to grant based on their own interpretations.",
                "contradicted_law": "This could violate record-keeping requirements under the FD&C Act (Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) if the products are classified as medical devices, as well as potential violations of consumer protection laws if adequate sales records are not maintained. Furthermore, it could open the door to violations of HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) if sales information isn't properly secured.",

                "original_text": "Erchonia agrees to provide Products to Distributor pursuant to orders placed by Distributor in the form of individual purchase orders issued by Distributor to Erchonia. Such purchase orders shall set forth the quantity of each product ordered, the required delivery date, and the point of delivery.",
                "changed_text": "Erchonia will generally attempt to provide Products to Distributor based on orders placed by Distributor, ideally in the form of purchase orders, which should, where feasible, include the product quantity, desired delivery timeframe, and potential delivery location.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to provide' with 'will generally attempt to provide' weakens the obligation. The phrases 'ideally in the form of purchase orders', 'should, where feasible' and 'potential delivery location' introduces ambiguity and makes the elements of an order optional rather than mandatory, creating uncertainty in the supply chain and allowing Erchonia to potentially disregard or delay orders.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change could be interpreted as a breach of contract under contract law and specifically the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs the sale of goods. By making the obligation to fulfill orders vague, Erchonia could avoid its contractual responsibilities, violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. Under California law, this would violate California Commercial Code.",

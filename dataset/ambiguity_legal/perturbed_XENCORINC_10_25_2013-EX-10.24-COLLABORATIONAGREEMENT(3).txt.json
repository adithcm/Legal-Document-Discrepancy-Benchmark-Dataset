                "changed_text": "Therefore, XENCOR shall consider using commercially reasonable efforts to possibly conduct and complete, at its own cost and risk, a Phase 1 clinical trial with the Product as described in Section 2.8.3 within suggested timelines. XENCOR may also consider finding a third party for the further development of the Product into a medicinal product (“Business Partner”).",
                "explanation": "Changing \"shall use commercially reasonable efforts\" to \"shall consider using commercially reasonable efforts\" introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation discretionary. Replacing 'find one or more suitable third party' with 'may also consider finding a third party' further weakens XENCOR's commitment. This contradicts the intention of the agreement, where XENCOR has a financial incentive to complete Phase 1 trials and find a Business Partner. This may violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which is a component of contract law under New York law, the governing law of the agreement.",

Moreover, XENCOR shall inform BII on an annual basis or, if there is good cause, upon request of BII (whichever is the case) about the actual status of such Phase 1 clinical trial or such negotiations, such request not to be more often than twice per year.",
                "changed_text": "XENCOR will endeavor to provide BII updates on the Phase 1 clinical trial and negotiations with potential Business Partners when convenient. XENCOR might inform BII about the status of the Phase 1 clinical trial or such negotiations only if it sees fit.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall promptly provide' with 'will endeavor to provide updates when convenient' makes the obligation to provide notice non-mandatory and dependent on XENCOR's convenience. Similarly, 'XENCOR might inform BII' introduces discretion. This contradicts the original intent of keeping BII informed, which is crucial for their own planning and future collaboration. The original text implied a reasonable level of transparency but weakening it to providing updates \"when convenient\" and \"only if it sees fit\" can be seen as a bad faith interpretation. This may violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which is a component of contract law under New York law, the governing law of the agreement.",

BII will try to supply XENCOR with data, results, and information, if possible.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'BII shall carry out' to 'BII might carry out' and 'BII shall supply' to 'BII will try to supply' introduces ambiguity and makes BII's obligations discretionary, contradicting the intent of the agreement for BII to provide the Services and supply results. This undermines XENCOR's ability to meet regulatory obligations, as the original language suggests a clear commitment to supply necessary data for regulatory compliance. It could violate implied duty of good faith by undermining XENCOR's reasonable expectation of receiving data necessary for regulatory approvals under New York law.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor agrees to comply with all applicable laws and  regulations, both foreign and domestic, in its performance under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, domestic and foreign export/import laws and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor agrees to generally observe applicable laws and regulations in its performance under this Agreement. Specific compliance with domestic and foreign export/import laws and regulations will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandated compliance with all applicable laws. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by stating 'generally observe' instead of 'comply,' weakening the obligation. The phrase 'case-by-case basis' regarding export/import laws creates uncertainty and potential non-compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Singapore import and export regulations, as well as US Export Administration Regulations (EAR) or similar.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor will endeavor to provide installation, maintenance, consulting and support services to the End-Users with regard to the Products, to the extent that resources are available.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Distributor is solely responsible. The modified version introduces ambiguity through 'endeavor to provide' and 'to the extent that resources are available,' allowing Distributor to potentially avoid fulfilling its support obligations if resources are deemed insufficient. This is contradictory because it implies the Distributor doesn't need to perform its duties.",
                "contradicted_law": "Singapore's consumer protection laws that require distributors to provide adequate support for the products they sell.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor will aim to submit Monthly Sales and Royalty Reports and make payments to Developer as generally outlined herein. Royalties paid to Developer may be based upon what Distributor believes is a fair market value related to Developer's list prices in U.S. Dollars, subject to mutual negotiation.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing the mandatory 'shall submit' with 'will aim to submit' and replacing the objective standard of 'Developer's list prices' with the subjective 'Distributor believes is a fair market value.' The added phrase 'subject to mutual negotiation' further weakens the original obligation, giving Distributor undue leverage and potentially leading to underpayment of royalties.",

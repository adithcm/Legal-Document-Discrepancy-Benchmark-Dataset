                "original_text": "Maintenance provided by Netzee during the term of this Agreement shall include (1) standard maintenance upgrades and modifications offered by Netzee to its customers generally, standard maintenance upgrades and modifications offered by Netzee to its customers generally, and for such purpose Netzee will use commercially reasonable efforts to make and include (without limitation) as such modifications changes and upgrades necessary to comply with generally applicable industry and regulatory requirements of which it is notified (2) 5x12 call-in support between hours of 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday, (3) in the event of material discrepancies between the Services as provided and the specifications for such Services (which shall be furnished in reasonably acceptable form), reasonable effort (in relation to importance, impact, and scheduled development plans) to correct those discrepancies, and (4) availability of basic Services with at least 99% uptime between 4:00 a.m Monday and 7:00 p.m. Friday and between 8:00 a.m. Saturday and 2:00 p.m. Saturday Eastern Time, exclusive of outages caused by off-peak prescheduled maintenance or causes beyond Netzee's reasonable control (including third-party equipment or communications).",
                "changed_text": "Maintenance provided by Netzee during the term of this Agreement may include (1) maintenance upgrades and modifications offered by Netzee to its customers, and Netzee will endeavor to make and include modifications, changes and upgrades to comply with industry and regulatory requirements of which it is notified (2) call-in support during business hours, (3) in the event of discrepancies between the Services as provided and the specifications for such Services, effort to address those discrepancies, and (4) availability of basic Services with reasonable uptime, exclusive of outages caused by off-peak maintenance or causes beyond Netzee's control.",
                "explanation": "The modified text weakens the obligations. 'Shall include' is replaced with 'may include,' making the maintenance items optional. 'Standard' is removed before 'maintenance upgrades,' reducing clarity. 'Commercially reasonable efforts' is shortened to 'endeavor,' reducing the required effort to comply with regulations. The specific support hours and uptime percentages are replaced with vague terms like 'business hours' and 'reasonable uptime.' This introduces significant ambiguity and weakens Netzee's obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines and regulations regarding IT security and availability, which require specific uptime guarantees and clear incident response protocols.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "THIS MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT IS GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE SUBJECT TO, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MASTER AGREEMENT BETWEEN NETZEE AND BANKERS BANK, INCLUDING THE LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY PROVIDED THEREIN. SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE HEREBY AFFIRMED BY BOTH PARTIES AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL LICENSES GRANTED OR EXERCISABLE THEREUNDER.",
                "changed_text": "THIS MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO THE GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE MASTER AGREEMENT BETWEEN NETZEE AND BANKERS BANK, INCLUDING WARRANTY AND LIABILITY ASPECTS. THESE GENERAL TERMS ARE CONSIDERED AS GUIDANCE FOR THIS MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'SHALL BE SUBJECT TO' with 'SUBJECT TO THE GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO' and 'ARE CONSIDERED AS GUIDANCE' significantly weakens the connection to the Master Agreement. The original text creates a binding legal link, but the revised text only offers a suggestion of similarity and guidance. This affects the enforceability of key provisions within the Master Agreement, such as the warranty and liability limitations, introducing uncertainty. Removing explicit disclaimer impacts protection.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles require clear incorporation by reference for terms of another agreement to be binding. The vague language creates ambiguity about which specific terms are incorporated and to what extent.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Continued Service provided by Netzee will be the operation, maintenance, and support of the computer systems, software and interfaces included in the System.",
                "changed_text": "The Continued Service provided by Netzee should generally include the operation, maintenance, and support of the computer systems, software and interfaces within the System.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will be' to 'should generally include' introduces ambiguity and makes the scope of the continued service discretionary rather than mandatory. The word 'generally' weakens the obligation and allows for deviation from providing full operation, maintenance, and support, potentially leaving gaps in the service coverage.",
                "contradicted_law": "If the 'computer systems, software and interfaces included in the System' are subject to specific regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare data), then the ambiguity in maintaining and supporting those systems could lead to non-compliance with those regulations.",

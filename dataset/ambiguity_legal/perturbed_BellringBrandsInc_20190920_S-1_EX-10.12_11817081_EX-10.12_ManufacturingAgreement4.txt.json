                "changed_text": "all other terms, conditions and covenants of the Agreement should generally remain in effect, subject to ongoing business needs.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall remain in full force and effect' to 'should generally remain in effect, subject to ongoing business needs' introduces ambiguity. This creates uncertainty around the enforceability of the original contract terms. The phrase 'subject to ongoing business needs' allows either party to potentially disregard prior commitments based on subjective interpretations of their business needs.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Principles - undermines the enforceability and legal certainty normally associated with contract law, making it difficult to pursue legal remedies for non-performance. This could violate general contract law principles that ensure agreements are binding and predictable.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'hereby agree to remove Schedule C-1' to 'may consider replacing Schedule C-1' introduces ambiguity by making the replacement discretionary rather than mandatory. Adding 'subject to mutual convenience and availability of resources' provides loopholes that could allow one party to avoid replacing the schedule. Also, Replacing 'The following is attached to an incorporated into the Agreement as Schedule C-1' to 'The specific details of Schedule C-1 may be updated or modified as reasonably determined by both parties' makes the content of Schedule C-1 ambiguous and uncertain.",

This creates uncertainty about whether the amendment will actually occur and to what extent the outlined terms will be followed.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Detto shall comply with all laws and regulations applicable to Detto's marketing and distribution of Qwik-Fix Pro hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Detto shall, at its own expense, make, obtain, and maintain in force at all times during the term of this Agreement, all filings, registrations, licenses, permits and authorizations in North America required for Detto to perform its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Detto shall endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations related to Detto's marketing and distribution of Qwik-Fix Pro. Detto will attempt, at its own discretion and expense, to make or obtain filings, registrations, licenses, permits, and authorizations in North America, as it deems necessary, for Detto to perform its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates compliance with all laws and the maintenance of all necessary permits. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall comply' with 'shall endeavor to comply,' making compliance discretionary. Similarly, 'make or obtain' changes to 'attempt, at its own discretion and expense, to make or obtain', this adds further ambiguity and subjectivity to the obligation to obtain necessary permits and authorizations. This could lead to non-compliance if Detto does not deem certain filings necessary, even if they are legally required.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal regulations concerning marketing and distribution, and specifically those requiring mandatory permits and licenses for specific activities in North America, are contradicted, depending on the specific industry and activity.",

                "original_text": "Detto shall take all action necessary to ensure that (a) Qwik-Fix Pro and Documentation on Detto's servers or computer systems is appropriately secured so that Qwik-Fix Pro and Documentation can only be viewed, copied, or utilized by licensed Third Parties; and (b) that the object code of the Courseware can only be accessed by employees authorized by PivX and cannot be copied or downloaded by any of Detto's licensees or by any other third party. In addition, Detto shall make its offices and equipment available in person, upon reasonable notice, and to the extent feasible, remotely, to PivX to inspect and test Detto's physical and technical set-up to ensure that Detto is complying with its obligations under this Section. Detto agrees to indemnify and hold PivX harmless in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4 to the extent that Detto breaches its obligations under this Section 2.5.",
                "changed_text": "Detto shall use reasonable efforts to secure Qwik-Fix Pro and Documentation on its servers or computer systems. Detto will also try to ensure the object code of the Courseware is only accessible to authorized employees and not copied or downloaded by unauthorized parties. Detto will accommodate PivX's requests to inspect and test its physical and technical setup, where practical. Detto agrees to indemnify and hold PivX harmless in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4 to the extent that Detto negligently breaches its obligations under this Section 2.5.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'all action necessary' for security. The modified text weakens this to 'reasonable efforts,' which is open to interpretation. The phrase 'where practical' adds further ambiguity to the requirement for Detto to make its offices and equipment available for inspections. Additionally, limiting the indemnification to 'negligently breaches' reduces Detto's liability for security breaches, potentially conflicting with data protection laws. The 'reasonable efforts' clause is ambiguous and difficult to enforce, especially in the context of cybersecurity.",
                "contradicted_law": "State data breach notification laws (e.g., California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)) and other data security regulations requiring specific and robust security measures are potentially violated.",

Detto covenants that it will (a) provide its customers with first quality sales and technical support with respect to any copies or licenses of Qwik-Fix Pro sold by Detto, (b) promptly, courteously and appropriately respond to its customers questions, concerns and complaints, and (c) generally deal with its customers in a professional manner that shall add to the good reputation of Detto and PivX. To the extent that Detto fails to fulfill its contractual and legal obligations to its customers, Detto agrees that PivX may elect to fulfill those obligations, or any portion of them, and Detto shall reimburse PivX any costs and expenses so incurred by PivX. Detto agrees to indemnify and hold PivX harmless in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4 to the extent that it breaches any of its covenants under this Section 2.8.",
                "changed_text": "Detto will strive to fulfill its contractual and legal obligations to its customers. Detto will attempt to: (a) provide what it considers to be adequate sales and technical support with respect to any copies or licenses of Qwik-Fix Pro sold by Detto, (b) respond to customer inquiries as time and resources permit, and (c) deal with its customers in a manner that it believes is generally professional and doesn't harm Detto and Pivxâ€™s reputation. If Detto makes a substantial failure to fulfill its contractual and legal obligations to its customers, Detto agrees that PivX may elect to fulfill those obligations, or any portion of them, and Detto shall reimburse PivX any costs and expenses reasonably incurred by PivX. Detto agrees to indemnify and hold PivX harmless in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4 for its direct breaches any of its covenants under this Section 2.8.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'will fulfill' with 'will strive to fulfill,' and 'provide first quality' with 'what it considers to be adequate', the obligation is weakened and made subjective. Adding 'as time and resources permit' to the response time obligation and replacing 'generally deal... in a professional manner' with 'in a manner that it believes is generally professional' further reduces the level of commitment. The indemnification clause is also weakened by only covering 'direct breaches'. These changes make the obligations vague and difficult to enforce, moving the standard of compliance from a clear legal obligation to a subjective assessment by Detto, conflicting with laws that protect consumers.",
                "contradicted_law": "Consumer protection laws, such as those related to warranty, customer service, and fair business practices, may be contradicted, as these laws often require specific standards of service and response times.",

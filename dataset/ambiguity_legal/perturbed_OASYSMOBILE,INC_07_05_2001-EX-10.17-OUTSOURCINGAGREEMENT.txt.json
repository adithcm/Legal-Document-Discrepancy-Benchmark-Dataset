                "original_text": "HSNS shall meet with E.piphany on a quarterly basis at a mutually agreed to date and time to discuss non-binding forecasts. HSNS shall provide E.piphany with a non-binding, rolling six-month forecast report in advance of the quarterly meeting.",
                "changed_text": "HSNS will endeavor to meet with E.piphany periodically to discuss forecasts. HSNS may provide E.piphany with forecast reports as circumstances allow.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces a clear, scheduled obligation (quarterly meetings with advance reports) with a vague, discretionary one ('endeavor to meet periodically,' 'as circumstances allow'). It lacks specific timelines and commitments, rendering enforcement difficult. The original text imposes a duty to provide forecast reports in advance. The modified text uses the word 'may', so the party can choose if they want to or not. ",

E.piphany shall have no obligation to provide support, maintenance or warranty services to Outsourcing Customers.",
                "changed_text": "HSNS will generally act as the primary interface for Outsourcing Customers and will attempt to provide communications and services regarding support and maintenance. E.piphany's obligations for support and warranty services remain at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation by replacing 'shall be' with 'will generally act', making the role of HSNS as the primary interface less definitive. 'Shall provide all direct communications' is replaced with 'will attempt to provide communications,' adding uncertainty about the level of commitment. Additionally, using 'remain at their discretion' could allow E.piphany to avoid providing any support, contradicting general contract principles of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring good faith and fair dealing, and potential consumer protection issues if support is significantly reduced.",

                "original_text": "HSNS shall maintain complete and accurate records of its activities under this Agreement for at least two (2) years following termination of this Agreement. HSNS agrees to allow E.piphany, directly or indirectly, to audit HSNS's business records as kept by HSNS in its normal course of business to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the audit reveals that HSNS has failed to comply with the terms of this Agreement, in addition to all other remedies available to E.piphany at law or equity, HSNS shall immediately reimburse E.piphany for any unpaid amounts due and the cost of the audit.",
                "changed_text": "HSNS will keep records related to this Agreement as deemed reasonably necessary. HSNS will permit E.piphany, upon request and with reasonable notice, to review relevant records. If discrepancies are noted, further action will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original text enforces strict record-keeping for two years, with mandatory reimbursement if non-compliance is found. The modified text introduces vagueness ('as deemed reasonably necessary') and weakens the audit clause ('permit to review relevant records'). The removal of 'immediately reimburse' with 'further action will be determined' makes the penalty for non-compliance discretionary and difficult to enforce, contradicting contract law principles of clear remedies.",

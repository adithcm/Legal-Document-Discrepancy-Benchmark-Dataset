                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",

                "changed_text": "Licensee shall endeavor to update Licensed Content on the Licensee Site and Related Media upon receiving updates from the Licensor, contingent on available resources.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"shall update promptly\" with \"shall endeavor to update... contingent on available resources\" introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation discretionary. 'Endeavor' and 'contingent on available resources' lacks a definite timeline and allows for interpretation, making enforcement difficult.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - Nevada law requires clear and definite terms in a contract to be enforceable. The modified clause introduces vagueness that could render the obligation unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Throughout the Term, Licensee will attempt to maintain terms of use ('Terms of Use') and a privacy policy ('Privacy Policy') on the Licensee Site and Related Media. The specific content and accessibility of such policies are subject to Licensee's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"shall have in effect and maintain accessible\" to \"will attempt to maintain\" weakens the obligation. Adding 'subject to Licensee's discretion' makes the requirement for specific terms and accessibility vague and unenforceable. This contradicts standard privacy law requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Nevada Privacy Law - Nevada law requires businesses to have and maintain a reasonable privacy policy, making this change ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'complete and accurate' and adding 'subjective assessment' significantly weakens the obligation. Accurate and comprehensive books are essential for royalty calculation, and this change opens up the possibility of manipulated financial information.",

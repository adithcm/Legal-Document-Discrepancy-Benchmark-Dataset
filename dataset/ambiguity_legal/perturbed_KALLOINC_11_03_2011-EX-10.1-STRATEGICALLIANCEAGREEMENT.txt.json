                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Kallo shall use its best reasonable efforts to protect the Agent from aggressive solicitation by another Agent taking any part of the Agent's book of Business. The report MUST include the Business Name, Key Contact name, telephone number, and address.",
                "changed_text": "Kallo will consider reasonable requests to protect the Agent from solicitation by another Agent. The report should generally include the Business Name, Key Contact name, and telephone number if conveniently available.",
                "explanation": "The original text states 'shall use its best reasonable efforts', which creates a definite obligation. The modified text weakens this by stating 'will consider reasonable requests', making Kallo's action discretionary. The original text also states that the report MUST include certain items; this is changed to 'should generally include' and 'if conveniently available', making the reporting requirement optional and ambiguous. This introduces uncertainty and reduces Kallo's responsibility.",

Kallo makes its representations and warrants to the end user and limits",
                "changed_text": "Agent may indemnify Kallo and could potentially hold it harmless from some losses, damages, claims or demands related to Agent's activities. Kallo's representations and warranties to the end user might limit",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states Agent 'agrees to indemnify,' creating a legally binding obligation. The modification replaces 'agrees to indemnify' with 'may indemnify' and 'could potentially hold it harmless,' making the indemnification discretionary and weakening the obligation. Replacing 'limits' with 'might limit' makes Kallo's limitation of liability uncertain.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Vague indemnification clauses are difficult to enforce and may violate principles of clear contractual obligations.",

All employees or contractors who receive such confidential information must be bound by written agreement not to disclose such information to any other party.",

The revised text replaces 'agrees not to disclose' with 'will endeavor not to disclose unless they believe it is reasonably necessary,' introducing a subjective element. Changing 'must be bound' to 'should ideally be subject to an agreement' makes the confidentiality agreement optional, significantly weakening the confidentiality protection.",

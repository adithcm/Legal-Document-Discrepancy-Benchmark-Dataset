                "changed_text": "XACCT will attempt to provide solutions for reported Incidents. Initial response times may vary.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'reasonable commercial efforts' with 'attempt' weakens the obligation, making the level of effort subjective and less enforceable. Removing the definitive statement about response times and replacing it with 'may vary' introduces uncertainty and contradicts potential service level agreements (SLAs) that might be implicitly expected or explicitly defined in Attachment 1.",

The number of Designated Support Contact(s) will                   be determined by the level of Support Services purchased by                   Licensee set forth in Attachment 1referenced in Section 2.                   Names of Designated Support Contact(s) must be provided to                   XACCT prior to initial contact with the XACCT support center.                   All technical communications by Licensee to XACCT shall only                   be made by the Designated Support Contact(s). All information                   and materials provided to Licensee by XACCT pursuant to this                   Agreement will be routed to the Designated Support Contact(s).                   Licensee may change the Designated Support Contact(s) upon                   written notice to XACCT;",
                "changed_text": "In order for Licensee to receive some Support Services, Licensee may:\n\n         (a)      Consider appointing Support Contact(s), with some training, who may act as Licensee's liaison for technical communications with XACCT.  The number of Support Contacts may be influenced by the level of Support Services purchased. Contact information may be provided to XACCT prior to contacting the support center. Some technical communications by Licensee to XACCT could be made by the Support Contact(s). Information provided to Licensee by XACCT might be routed to the Support Contact(s).",
                "explanation": "The changes weaken the obligation for the Licensee to appoint qualified support contacts, replacing 'must' with 'may consider' and 'shall only' with 'could be'. It removes the requirement for the contacts to be fully trained and qualified by adding \"with some training\", and also changes Designated Support Contact to Support Contact. The phrase 'might be routed' also adds ambiguity to whether information provided by XACCT is actually being received by Licensee.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'may develop and provide' to 'might, at its discretion, develop' makes it uncertain if major releases will ever be developed. Further, changing 'will be made available' to 'might be made available' introduces doubt as to whether even if a Major Release is developed, it will be provided to the Licensee. Removing the phrase 'according to the level of Support Services purchased' further obfuscates the conditions under which the Major Release will be provided.",

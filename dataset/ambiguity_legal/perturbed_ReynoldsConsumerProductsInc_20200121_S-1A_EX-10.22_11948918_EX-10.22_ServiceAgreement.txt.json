                "changed_text": "Each Party should endeavor to make the TSA Records it maintains available to the other Party and its Affiliates and their respective auditors or other representatives, and possibly to any Governmental Authority, during what it considers normal business hours, with what it considers reasonable notice. It is understood that TSA Records that are not stored on a Party's regular business premises may require additional time to retrieve, for review, inspection, examination and, at the reviewing Party's expense if the providing party deems it reasonable, reproduction.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the obligation to make TSA records available. The modified text weakens this obligation by using 'should endeavor,' 'possibly,' 'what it considers reasonable notice,' and 'deems it reasonable.' This creates ambiguity around the accessibility of TSA records, potentially hindering regulatory audits and compliance efforts. The phrase \"endeavor to\" does not create a guarantee that the action will be taken, opening a loophole to if the party chooses not to.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees to take steps, as they see fit, to protect any Confidential Information of the other Party with a degree of care that is somewhat similar to how the receiving Party protects its own confidential or proprietary information, but without guaranteeing any specific level of care.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'necessary steps' and 'at least reasonable care' to protect confidential information. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating 'steps, as they see fit,' 'somewhat similar,' and 'without guaranteeing any specific level of care.' This makes the obligation vague, conflicting with requirements for securing confidential data. The original text requires necessary steps, which is now undermined by changing it to \"as they see fit.\"",

                "changed_text": "RGHI and the Company should consider using efforts they feel are adequate to attempt to get all RGHI Letters of Credit and RGHI Guarantees, in each case with respect to the Company, to be canceled or terminated, roughly around the Commencement Date, so that RGHI and its Affiliates might be released from some obligation or liability under such RGHI Letters of Credit or RGHI Guarantees (potentially applicable to the Company) at some point after the Commencement Date.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a requirement to make reasonable efforts to terminate letter of credit, but the modified version undermines that requirement by changing the requirement to 'should consider', 'efforts they feel are adequate', 'roughly around', 'might be released', and 'potentially applicable' to significantly reduce any obligation to make any progress on terminating existing Letters of Credit. By using these qualifiers, the agreement to 'use commercially reasonable efforts' becomes a discretionary suggestion and the termination date becomes vague.",

SONY retains the right to sue and collect damages for any past infringement of the Transferred Patents, provided that SONY obtains PURCHASER's written consent prior to making any infringement claim or allegation or filing any action, suit, litigation or proceeding that could affect the Transferred Patents or PURCHASER's ability to use and exploit the Transferred Patents or that may result in PURCHASER being joined as a party to the action, suit, litigation or proceeding. PURCHASER shall not unreasonably withhold its consent.",
                "changed_text": "SONY hereby assigns to PURCHASER SONY's entire right, title and interest in, to and under the Transferred Patents, and any patents that may issue therefrom (including any foreign counterparts, divisions, continuations, renewals, continuations in part, reexaminations or reissues thereof), along with the right to sue and collect damages for any future infringement, and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist PURCHASER, at PURCHASER's sole expense, to register, confirm and perfect such assignment, including by making filings with or at necessary patent offices and/or governmental agencies, if practical. SONY retains the right to sue and collect damages for any past infringement of the Transferred Patents, provided that SONY seeks PURCHASER's consent prior to making any infringement claim or allegation or filing any action, suit, litigation or proceeding that could affect the Transferred Patents or PURCHASER's ability to use and exploit the Transferred Patents or that may result in PURCHASER being joined as a party to the action, suit, litigation or proceeding. PURCHASER's consent should not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "explanation": "The change replaces 'take all reasonably necessary action' with 'use commercially reasonable efforts,' which introduces ambiguity and weakens SONY's obligation. The change from 'necessary patent offices' to 'necessary patent offices, if practical' adds another layer of ambiguity, allowing SONY to avoid making filings if it deems it impractical. Finally, replacing 'shall not unreasonably withhold its consent' with 'should not be unreasonably withheld' introduces a suggestion rather than a mandate.",

Neither Party is strictly obligated to (a) file any patent application or to secure any patent or patent rights, or (b) maintain any patent in force or prosecute any patent application.",
                "explanation": "The change adds uncertainty to each party's rights and obligations regarding their Intellectual Property. Using words such as 'may consider', 'potentially', 'possibly' and 'strict obligation' introduces discretion, undermining the clarity of each party's responsibility and creates ambiguity as to what each party is obligated to do.",

                "changed_text": "Should either Party arguably fail to observe faithfully and possibly not materially perform each of the obligations assumed by it in this IP Agreement if practical for thirty (30) days after its attention has been somewhat directed to any such breach by a reasonable attempt of notice in writing from the other Party, the non-breaching Party may, at its vague discretion, consider having the right to potentially terminate the license granted by it under this Agreement, such termination to possibly be effected by a vague attempt of serving notice in writing upon the breaching Party to that effect on or after the expiration of such period of thirty (30) days.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a high level of ambiguity and uncertainty. Replacing 'fail to observe faithfully and materially perform' with 'arguably fail to observe faithfully and possibly not materially perform if practical' introduces subjectivity. Terms like 'somewhat directed', 'reasonable attempt', 'vague discretion', 'consider having the right', 'potentially terminate', and 'possibly be effected by a vague attempt' further erode the enforceability of the clause, creating multiple interpretations of whether a breach has occurred and what actions can be taken.",

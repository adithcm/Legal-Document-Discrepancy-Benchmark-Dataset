                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor shall comply, and shall ensure that each Third Party Distributor complies, with the Guidelines for  Applications set out in Exhibit C.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall endeavor to comply, and should encourage that each Third Party Distributor complies, with the Guidelines for Applications set out in Exhibit C.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a direct obligation for the distributor to comply with the guidelines and ensure its third-party distributors also comply. The modified text uses 'endeavor to comply' and 'should encourage', weakening the mandatory nature of the obligation and making it ambiguous as to the level of compliance required. This introduces ambiguity regarding the level of compliance required and the legal responsibility for non-compliance by third-party distributors.",
                "contradicted_law": "The ambiguity introduced contradicts the intended strictness and enforcement of the guidelines, potentially conflicting with consumer protection laws that require clear and enforceable obligations for software distribution practices, in the United States, specifically the **Federal Trade Commission Act** regarding deceptive business practices.",

                "original_text": "Distributor agrees that in connection with its exercise of the right granted in Clause 2.1 (Products Licence Grant)  it shall accurately reproduce the Distribution Products and shall not: (a) modify any Product (including modify the Chrome Browser or  Google Toolbar configuration files or registry settings); or (b) insert into the Products any viruses, worms, date bombs, time bombs, or  other code that is specifically designed to cause the Products to cease operating, or to damage, interrupt, or interfere with any Products  or End User data.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor agrees that in connection with its exercise of the right granted in Clause 2.1 (Products Licence Grant) it will strive to accurately reproduce the Distribution Products and should not intentionally: (a) significantly modify any Product; or (b) knowingly insert malicious code into the Products.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits any modification or insertion of malicious code. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using phrases like 'strive to accurately reproduce,' 'significantly modify,' and 'knowingly insert malicious code.' This makes the obligation less strict and creates loopholes for interpretation, such as what constitutes a 'significant modification' or 'knowing' insertion.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change weakens the obligation, potentially conflicting with U.S. laws regarding software distribution, like the **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)**, which prohibits unauthorized access and modification of computer systems. The modified clause provides room for interpretation that could excuse certain actions otherwise prohibited by the CFAA.",

                "original_text": "During the Term, Distributor shall, on a [ * ] basis, no later than the [ * ] of the following [ * ], provide Google  with a report identifying, on a country-by-country basis, the total number of: (i) Bundles distributed; (ii) Installs Completed; (iii)  Google Toolbar offers presented to End Users; and (iv) Chrome Browser offers presented to End Users, in the preceding [ * ].",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, Distributor should, on a regular basis, generally provide Google with a report approximating, on a regional basis, the estimated number of: (i) Bundles distributed; (ii) Installs Completed; (iii) Google Toolbar offers presented to End Users; and (iv) Chrome Browser offers presented to End Users.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates regular reports, and specifying the period and time for providing it. The modified text uses weaker terms like 'should,' 'regular basis,' and 'generally,' while also changing 'total number' to 'estimated number,' which introduces ambiguity. This weakens the legal obligation to provide accurate and timely reports, which is critical for tracking compliance and payment.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change undermines the requirements for accurate reporting, potentially conflicting with requirements for financial transparency and accountability. Additionally, if these reports are used for revenue calculation and payments, this ambiguity can create conflicts with contract law principles requiring clarity in financial obligations and potentially violate US laws requiring accurate financial reporting, such as the **Sarbanes-Oxley Act**.",

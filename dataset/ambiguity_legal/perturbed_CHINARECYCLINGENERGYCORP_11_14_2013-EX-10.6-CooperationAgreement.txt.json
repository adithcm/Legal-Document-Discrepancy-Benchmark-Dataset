                "original_text": "Party A shall be responsible for the operation, maintenance and management of the recycling project. Party A shall charge Party B energy saving service fee according to the income from CDQ waste heat power generation station.",
                "changed_text": "Party A will endeavor to be responsible for the operation, maintenance, and management of the recycling project. Party A shall, when practical, charge Party B an energy saving service fee based on the purported income from the CDQ waste heat power generation station.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains the language 'shall be responsible,' creating a clear obligation. This has been changed to 'will endeavor to be responsible,' weakening the commitment. Furthermore, 'shall charge' has been replaced with 'shall, when practical, charge,' and 'according to the income' changed to 'based on the purported income,' both creating ambiguity about the obligation and the calculation basis of the fee. This ambiguous language makes the obligation unclear and less enforceable. This could contradict regulations related to fair pricing and contractual obligations depending on the specific context of Chinese contract law.",

Party A can enforce the Performance Guarantee by Party B to take all project assets. Party B shall pay the actual energy saving service fees at once and pay Party A losses.",
                "changed_text": "Party B should aim to pay Party A the energy saving service fee around the stipulated time. If Party B experiences delays in payment: 2.1 If Party B fails to pay Party A the energy saving service fee near the 15th of the month, and the delay extends somewhat beyond 60 days, a small penalty may be applied. 2.2 If the delay significantly exceeds 60 days, Party A may consider options regarding the Performance Guarantee. Party B shall endeavor to pay a reasonable estimate of the energy saving service fees and contribute to covering Party A's potential losses.",
                "explanation": "The original text has specific payment terms and penalties. The modified text uses vague language like 'should aim to pay,' 'around the stipulated time,' 'near the 15th of the month,' 'extends somewhat beyond 60 days,' 'small penalty may be applied,' 'significantly exceeds 60 days,' 'may consider options,' 'reasonable estimate,' and 'contribute to covering Party A's potential losses.' These terms introduce significant ambiguity about the payment deadlines, penalties, and enforcement mechanisms. This weakens Party A's ability to enforce timely payments and claim specific damages.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates regulations regarding clear and enforceable payment terms under Chinese Contract Law, specifically Article 62, which deals with unclear price terms.",

                "changed_text": "The CDQ and CDQ power generation systems should generally align with prevailing national environmental protection standards. If environmental impacts are observed during the operation of the power plant, Party A will discuss liability in good faith.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the systems 'shall comply' with environmental standards and Party A 'shall bear the liability' for pollution. The modified text weakens this obligation by changing 'shall comply' to 'should generally align,' introducing subjectivity and reducing the guarantee of compliance. Additionally, replacing 'shall bear the liability' with 'will discuss liability in good faith' makes the liability for pollution uncertain and dependent on negotiation, rather than a clear legal obligation. This could conflict with environmental protection laws in China, which require strict compliance with environmental standards and clear assignment of liability for pollution incidents.",

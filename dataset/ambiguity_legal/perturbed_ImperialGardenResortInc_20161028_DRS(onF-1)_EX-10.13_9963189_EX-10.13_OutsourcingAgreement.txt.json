                "original_text": "Party B shall follow all instructions of Party A and ensure all plans and designs of the project to meet relevant construction laws and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Party B shall endeavor to follow instructions of Party A and attempt to ensure all plans and designs of the project generally align with construction laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall follow' to 'shall endeavor to follow' weakens the obligation to follow Party A's instructions. Replacing 'ensure' with 'attempt to ensure' and 'meet' with 'generally align' introduces ambiguity regarding compliance with construction laws and regulations, making adherence discretionary rather than mandatory. This can be interpreted as allowing deviations from strict legal requirements, potentially undermining the legal obligation for full compliance.",

                "changed_text": "Party B shall generally maintain what it considers a professional attitude for various services mentioned in Article III of the Contract, attempt to maintain benefits and interests of Party A, and consider economical options, provided basic safety is considered.",
                "explanation": "The inclusion of 'what it considers' makes the professional attitude subjective and weakens the standard of professionalism required. 'Attempt to maintain' makes the obligation to maintain Party A's benefits less stringent. Replacing 'adopt the most economical option under the precondition of safety and reliability' with 'consider economical options, provided basic safety is considered' reduces the emphasis on both economy and safety, as 'basic safety' is vague and allows for potentially unsafe cost-cutting measures. This weakens the obligations to prioritize the client's interests and maintain high safety standards.",

Should both Parties be unable to reach an agreement within one month through negotiation, they may apply for an arbitration in Miaoli County and the arbitration result shall be compulsory. II. Should either Party herein initiate a legal proceeding for revoking any arbitration result regarding the Contract, both Parties herein agree to take the Miaoli District Court of Taiwan as the competent court of first instance pursuant to the laws of the R.O.C..",

Should both Parties find it impractical to reach an agreement through negotiation, they might consider non-binding mediation. II. Any legal proceedings may be initiated as deemed necessary by either Party.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agree to resolve any dispute' with 'agree to attempt to resolve any dispute through informal means' reduces the obligation to actively seek resolution. Changing the arbitration clause to 'might consider non-binding mediation' makes the dispute resolution mechanism optional and non-compulsory, which is ambiguous. The statement 'Any legal proceedings may be initiated as deemed necessary by either Party' removes the agreement to use the Miaoli District Court of Taiwan as the competent court, potentially leading to disputes over jurisdiction and contradicting Taiwan's Civil Procedure Law regarding jurisdiction.",
                "contradicted_law": "Taiwan's Arbitration Act and Civil Procedure Law, which govern the enforceability of arbitration agreements and jurisdictional rules for legal proceedings.",

                "original_text": "Sponsor shall be responsible for the management and control over the services provided by its staff members operating the Stands (\"Sponsor Staff\") and Sponsor shall be solely responsible for determining the terms of employment for Sponsor Staff. Sponsor shall train Sponsor Staff or require Sponsor Staff to undergo training provided by Concessionaire. The staffing levels at each Stand shall be subject to Club's approval.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall endeavor to manage its staff members operating the Stands (\"Sponsor Staff\") in a reasonable manner. Sponsor may determine the terms of employment for Sponsor Staff, considering standard practices. Sponsor should consider providing training to Sponsor Staff as deemed appropriate. Staffing levels at each Stand should be discussed with the Club.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and weakens the Sponsor's obligations regarding staff management, training, and staffing levels. 'Shall be responsible' is replaced with the weaker 'shall endeavor to manage', making staff management less mandatory. The explicit training requirement is softened to a suggestion of 'should consider providing training as deemed appropriate.' This could create a non-compliance issue with Florida labor laws, especially concerning food safety, responsible alcohol service and staff management. It also replaces 'subject to Club's approval' with 'should be discussed with the Club'.",

In the event of any recall with respect to Sponsor's products provided to the Concessionaire pursuant to this Agreement or the Concessions Agreement, Sponsor shall notify both Club and the Concessionaire immediately upon issuance of such recall, and Club may, at its sole discretion and without penalty, suspend the Benefits for a duration as reasonably determined by Club. Any costs or expenses incurred by Club or the Concessionaire with respect to any such recall shall be the sole responsibility of Sponsor.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor acknowledges that Sponsor should attempt to cooperate with the Concessionaire regarding logistics and management of the Sponsor's food products, and storage and dispensation of the food products. In the event of any recall with respect to Sponsor's products, Sponsor will endeavor to notify Club and the Concessionaire. Club may consider suspending the Benefits, depending on the circumstances. Costs or expenses related to recalls may be discussed between Sponsor, Club, and Concessionaire.",
                "explanation": "The obligations regarding cooperation, recall notification, and financial responsibility for recall-related expenses are weakened. 'Shall cooperate' is replaced with 'should attempt to cooperate,' diminishing the mandatory nature of collaboration. 'Shall notify immediately' becomes 'will endeavor to notify,' which allows for delayed or incomplete notification. The original text clearly states that costs associated with the recall are the Sponsor's responsibility. The modified text uses the language 'may be discussed' which weakens this responsibility. This could violate Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) food safety regulations regarding immediate recall procedures and financial responsibility for contaminated food products.",

                "explanation": "This change makes the design agreement less binding, introduces budgetary limitations for signage, and weakens the financial responsibility for branding and advertising. 'Shall be mutually agreed upon' becomes 'will be discussed in good faith,' which doesn't guarantee an agreement. The original text clearly states the Sponsor's financial responsibility while the edited text makes this contribution subjective. The original language 'Sponsor shall be responsible for all costs' is replaced with the subjective language 'contribute to the branding and advertising costs to a reasonable extent.' These changes could violate Florida's advertising laws that require clear and conspicuous disclosure of costs.",

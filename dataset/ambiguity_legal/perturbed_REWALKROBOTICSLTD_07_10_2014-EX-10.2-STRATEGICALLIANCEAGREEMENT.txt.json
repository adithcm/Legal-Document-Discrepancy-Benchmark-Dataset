As a platform to discuss such opportunities, YEC and ARGO agree to form a Joint Steering Committee (hereafter \"JSC\"), which will meet at least four (4) times per year, once in every quarter, for the following purposes:",

As a platform to potentially discuss such opportunities, YEC and ARGO may form a Joint Steering Committee (hereafter \"JSC\"), which should meet periodically, if deemed necessary, for the following possible purposes:",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear obligation to form a Joint Steering Committee that meets regularly. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using phrases like 'will consider pursuing', 'potentially discuss', 'may form', 'should meet periodically, if deemed necessary', and 'possible purposes.' This weakens the commitment to collaboration and the formal structure for it.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles of good faith and fair dealing. While Israeli contract law allows for flexibility, this level of ambiguity regarding a core collaborative mechanism could be seen as undermining the intent of the agreement, potentially breaching the implied duty to act in good faith.",

                "original_text": "All notices or other communications required or desired to be sent to either of the parties will be invalid, unless made in writing and sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or sent by recognized international courier service (e.g., Federal Express, DHL, etc.) with charges prepaid, or by facsimile or electronic mail which is subject to confirmation by letter. The address for all notices or other communications required to be sent to ARGO or YEC will be the mailing address stated on the signature page to this Agreement, or such other address as may be provided from one party to the other on at least ten (10) days prior written notice. Any such notice will be effective upon the date of receipt.",
                "changed_text": "Notices or other communications may be sent to either of the parties. It is preferable, but not required, that notices be made in writing and sent by a method that provides proof of delivery. The address for notices should ideally be the mailing address stated on the signature page to this Agreement, or such other address as may be provided from one party to the other. The effectiveness of any notice is subject to interpretation.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a rigid protocol for delivering notices that must be followed for the notices to be valid. The modified text makes the process vague and non-committal. Replacing \"will be invalid, unless\" with permissive language like \"may be sent\" and \"is preferable, but not required\" introduces ambiguity. Removing the explicit methods (registered mail, courier, etc.) and the confirmation requirement for electronic notices makes it unclear how notice is properly given. The final sentence, 'The effectiveness of any notice is subject to interpretation' is dangerously vague.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles of notice and certainty. Under Israeli contract law, clear and unambiguous terms are favored. This vagueness about notice potentially undermines the enforceability of other contractual obligations and conflicts with the principles of contractual certainty.",

Additionally, if a suit or action is filed to enforce this agreement or with respect to this Agreement, the prevailing party is entitled to reimbursement from the other party for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the suit or action, including reasonable attorney's fees at the trial level and on appeal.",
                "changed_text": "If a default allegedly occurs under this agreement, the defaulting party may be encouraged to consider reimbursing the non-defaulting party for a portion of the costs and expenses potentially incurred by the non-defaulting party in connection with the alleged default. If a suit or action is filed regarding this agreement, the prevailing party might be granted partial reimbursement from the other party for some costs and expenses, but this is at the sole discretion of the court.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the defaulting party *must* reimburse the non-defaulting party's costs and expenses, including attorney's fees. The modified text significantly weakens this obligation. Replacing 'must reimburse' with 'may be encouraged to consider reimbursing a portion' makes the reimbursement discretionary and reduces the scope of coverage. Furthermore, replacing 'is entitled to reimbursement' with 'might be granted partial reimbursement...at the sole discretion of the court' introduces further uncertainty and reduces the prevailing party's rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "Israeli Contract Law (Remedies for Breach of Contract): Israel's Contract Law (Remedies for Breach of Contract) provides specific guidelines and entitlements for parties in the event of a breach. The original clause reflects a standard approach to indemnification and legal cost recovery. The modified clause, with its ambiguity and discretionary language, could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent or undermine the statutory remedies available under Israeli law.",

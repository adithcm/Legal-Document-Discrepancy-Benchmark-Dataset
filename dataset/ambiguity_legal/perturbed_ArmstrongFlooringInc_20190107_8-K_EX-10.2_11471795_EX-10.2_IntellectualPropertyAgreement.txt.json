                "original_text": "The Company shall ensure that all goods and services provided by the Company, under or in association with any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, shall (i) be substantially the same as or greater than the quality of goods and services provided under such Seller Licensed Trademarks immediately prior to the Effective Date and (ii) not be associated with any goods or services, including any activities, that are reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on (A) the image or reputation of any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks or (B) Seller's right, title or interest in and to, any of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will try to ensure that all goods and services provided by the Company, under or in association with any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, are generally similar to the quality of goods and services provided under such Seller Licensed Trademarks immediately prior to the Effective Date and will attempt to avoid association with any goods or services, including any activities, that might possibly have an adverse effect on the image or reputation of any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks or Seller's right, title or interest in and to, any of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'shall ensure' has been replaced with 'will try to ensure', creating a weaker obligation. The phrases 'substantially the same as or greater than' is replaced with 'are generally similar', which introduces ambiguity, and 'are reasonably likely to have an adverse effect' with 'might possibly have an adverse effect', which lowers the threshold for triggering concern. This contradicts the purpose of trademark law, which requires a consistent standard to protect consumers.",

                "original_text": "In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 6.3, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall comply with all obligations applicable to Arizona and its Affiliates under the Trademark License Agreement including, for the avoidance of doubt, any obligations with respect to reporting Complaints (as defined in the Trademark License Agreement), which reports the Company shall provide to Arizona, and quality control and standards, and Licensor Competitors (as defined in the Trademark License Agreement), and neither Party shall undertake any act that would constitute a breach or a basis for termination under the Trademark License Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 6.3, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company should endeavor to adhere to obligations applicable to Arizona and its Affiliates under the Trademark License Agreement including, where practical, obligations with respect to reporting Complaints (as defined in the Trademark License Agreement), which reports the Company may provide to Arizona if convenient, and generally maintain quality control and standards, and relationships with Licensor Competitors (as defined in the Trademark License Agreement), and the Parties will aim not to undertake any act that could potentially be a breach or a basis for termination under the Trademark License Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The legal obligation to comply has been relaxed by replacing 'shall comply' with 'should endeavor to adhere to', weakening the commitment. Terms like 'where practical', 'if convenient', 'generally maintain', and 'will aim not to' introduce ambiguity, making the standard of compliance unclear. This could fall short of the strict compliance expected to maintain the Trademark License Agreement, thereby violating the Lanham Act.",

                "explanation": "The mandatory 'shall' is replaced with the discretionary 'may', making cooperation voluntary rather than obligatory. 'Reasonably' is replaced with 'occasionally', introducing a vague, non-committal standard of interaction, and the necessity of the other party's request is eliminated through the condition that 'if they feel it is beneficial'.",

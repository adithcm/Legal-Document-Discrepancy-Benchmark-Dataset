                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall be' with 'will endeavor to be' and 'shall purchase' with 'will attempt to purchase,' weakening the obligation. Changing 'agreed upon discount' to 'potentially agreed upon discount' adds further ambiguity. This affects the enforceability of the sourcing and purchasing commitments. Also, it removes the clarity required under contract law, turning mandatory actions into discretionary ones.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'shall establish and maintain' is replaced with 'will attempt to establish and maintain,' and 'detailed ledger' becomes simply 'ledger.' Furthermore, 'sufficient to track and reconcile all such transactions' is watered down to 'sufficient to generally track and reconcile transactions.' Also, 'calculate and track' is replaced with 'estimate,' introducing ambiguity around the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting. This impacts transparency and auditability.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'will be made' is changed to 'may be made,' and 'three (3) Business Days' becomes 'a reasonable time,' making the payment timeline vague. 'After the date Vertex invoices Bunker One' is changed to 'after Vertex provides what it considers an invoice to Bunker One', giving Vertex broad discretion. 'To an account designated from time to time by Vertex' is changed to 'to a potentially designated account', further weakening the obligation. This creates uncertainty about when and how payments will be made.",

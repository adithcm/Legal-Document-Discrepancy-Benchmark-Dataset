                "explanation": "This change weakens the guarantee of compliance with laws and regulations by introducing ambiguity. Replacing 'will conform at all times' with 'will endeavor to generally conform' and adding 'to the extent reasonably practicable' makes the obligation subjective and dependent on HDS's interpretation of what is 'reasonably practicable'. This contradicts the strict compliance expected by regulatory bodies like the FDA.",

However, HDS’ obligation to indemnify is limited to reasonably foreseeable damages and shall not extend to indirect, special, or consequential damages.",
                "explanation": "The change weakens the indemnification obligation by replacing \"agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless...from any and all claims\" with \"will reasonably endeavor to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless...from claims arising from HDS’ actions.\" The introduction of 'reasonably foreseeable damages' introduces ambiguity, and the exclusion of 'indirect, special, or consequential damages' narrows the scope of indemnification significantly. Limiting the obligation to 'actions' is vague, making it harder to determine when indemnification is triggered. This may violate the expectations for indemnification under Georgia law, which typically covers a broader range of liabilities in contract disputes.",

Umbrella / Excess Liability coverage inclusive of product liability with limits not less than $5,000,000 per  occurrence and aggregate.\n\nC.

                "changed_text": "HDS will maintain insurance coverages it deems reasonably adequate, with the Celebrity named as an additional insured where practical. Specific coverage amounts will be subject to ongoing review and adjustment as deemed necessary by HDS.",
                "explanation": "This alteration replaces concrete insurance coverage requirements with a subjective standard. The phrases 'reasonably adequate' and 'where practical' are vague and allow HDS to determine the level of coverage. The statement that coverage amounts will be subject to ongoing review and adjustment as deemed necessary by HDS undermines the originally specified coverage amounts and creates uncertainty. This contradicts typical contract law expectations for insurance coverage that requires very specific terms, and does not adhere to the insurance requirements of Georgia Law.",

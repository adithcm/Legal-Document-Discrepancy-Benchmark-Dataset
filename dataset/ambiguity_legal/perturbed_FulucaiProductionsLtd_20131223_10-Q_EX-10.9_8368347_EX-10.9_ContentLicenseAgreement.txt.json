                "original_text": "Producer shall take all reasonable steps to protect all copyrights pertaining to each Program from infringement and will institute such actions and proceedings as may be reasonable to prevent any unauthorized use, reproduction, exhibition or exploitation by third parties of the Program or any part thereof, or the material on which the Program is based which may be in contravention of the rights and license granted to ConvergTV herein.",
                "changed_text": "Producer should consider taking steps to protect copyrights pertaining to each Program from infringement and may institute actions and proceedings to prevent unauthorized use, reproduction, exhibition or exploitation by third parties of the Program or any part thereof, or the material on which the Program is based which may be in contravention of the rights and license granted to ConvergTV herein.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall take all reasonable steps' to 'should consider taking steps' and 'will institute such actions' to 'may institute actions' weakens the obligation to protect copyrights. This introduces ambiguity, making the protection discretionary rather than mandatory.",
                "contradicted_law": "Copyright Law of the United States (Title 17 U.S. Code) outlines clear responsibilities for copyright holders to protect their works from infringement. This weakened obligation contradicts the spirit and intent of actively defending copyright as generally expected under U.S. Copyright Law.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall provide reasonable protections' with 'will endeavor to provide protections' significantly weakens ConvergTV's obligation to protect content. 'Endeavor' implies an effort, but not a guarantee of actually implementing effective protections, making the protection of content uncertain.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) requires service providers, like ConvergTV, to implement and maintain reasonable measures to prevent copyright infringement on their platforms. Weakening the obligation to 'endeavor' to provide protections could be interpreted as non-compliance with the DMCA.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be entitled to recover... all' to 'may be entitled to recover... a portion' introduces ambiguity regarding the recovery of attorney's fees. Adding 'subject to judicial discretion' further weakens the obligation, making the recovery of fees uncertain and dependent on a judge's decision.",
                "contradicted_law": "While Florida law (specified in section 15) allows for contractual agreements regarding attorney's fees, completely discretionary awarding of fees can conflict with principles of contract enforcement if the agreement is interpreted to lack mutuality. The added phrase makes it unclear under what conditions attorney fees are actually awarded.",

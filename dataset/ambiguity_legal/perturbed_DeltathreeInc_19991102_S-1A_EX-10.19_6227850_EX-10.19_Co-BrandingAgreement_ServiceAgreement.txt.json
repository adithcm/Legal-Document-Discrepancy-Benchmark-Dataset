                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "PrimeCall shall provide DeltaThree with pricing and marketing services in connection with the Calling Card, including without limitation, developing a cost structure for the sale of the Calling Cards, pricing specific routes and determining discount rates.",
                "changed_text": "PrimeCall may offer DeltaThree pricing and marketing advice in connection with the Calling Card, including suggestions for a cost structure, route pricing, and discount rates.",
                "explanation": "The original text makes providing pricing and marketing services a clear obligation. The modified text changes 'shall provide' to 'may offer,' which makes the provision of services optional. The inclusion of 'advice' and 'suggestions' further reduces PrimeCall's responsibility. This ambiguity violates general contract law principles requiring parties to fulfill their contractual duties in good faith. Depending on the context, it might also run afoul of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that exists in New York contract law, as it allows PrimeCall to avoid providing services that were seemingly agreed upon.",

The PrimeCall Web Site shall be a fully functional e-commerce site, with all ordering and billing performed on-line.",
                "changed_text": "DeltaThree will attempt to establish a PrimeCall web site (the \"PrimeCall Web Site\") following discussions with PrimeCall, with the goal of enabling PrimeCall to market and sell its calling cards online. The PrimeCall Web Site should aim to be an e-commerce site.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states DeltaThree 'shall establish and administrate' a fully functional e-commerce site. The modified text uses weaker language like 'will attempt to establish', 'following discussions' and 'should aim to be', which makes the obligation less definitive. Furthermore, removing the explicit requirement for 'all ordering and billing performed on-line' creates ambiguity. This vague obligation might be unenforceable, and therefore is contradicted by standard principles of contract law.",

                "original_text": "Each party will, at any time and from time to time after the date hereof, upon the request of the other, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or shall cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, all such other instruments as may be reasonably required in connection with the performance of this Agreement and each shall take all such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out or further effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each party may, from time to time, consider requests from the other to execute additional instruments related to the performance of this Agreement, and each may consider taking further actions to further effect the transactions contemplated. ",
                "explanation": "The original 'Each party will' is a legally binding obligation; the modified version of 'Each party may' turns this into a voluntary act. The removal of 'reasonably required' removes an objective standard and introduces more subjectivity in deciding whether to comply with a request. The replacement of 'shall cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered' with 'consider requests' significantly weakens the assurance that the parties will actively facilitate the agreement's execution. This weakened and discretionary language conflicts with the concept of 'best efforts' which is typically expected in business agreements.",

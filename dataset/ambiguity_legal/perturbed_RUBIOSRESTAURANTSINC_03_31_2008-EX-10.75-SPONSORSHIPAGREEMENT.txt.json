                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Sponsor must obtain, and continuously maintain, at its own expense, the following insurance policies:\n     1. Workers' Compensation in compliance with California's laws, including Employers' Liability with minimum limits of:\n   $ *** Each Accident; $ *** Disease - Each Employee; $ *** Disease - Policy Limit.\n\n  2. An Insurance Services Office occurrence based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy, including contractual liability and products/completed operations liability coverage with minimum limits of:\n\n$ *** Each Occurrence; $ *** General Aggregate; $ *** Products/Completed Operations Aggregate.\n\nAll insurance policies must be issued by an admitted insurance carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A-8 or better. SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego and each of their subsidiary or affiliated companies and its and their directors, officers and employees must be named  as Additional Insureds under the Commercial General Liability, Automobile Liability  and Umbrella Liability Policies. All of these policies must contain Cross Liability Endorsements, or their equivalent. Further, coverage for the Additional Insureds shall apply on a primary basis irrespective of any other insurance, whether collectible or not. All policies shall be endorsed to provide a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF. In the event of cancellation, non-renewal or material modification SDBF shall receive thirty (30) days written notice thereof. Sponsor shall provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with all insurance provisions noted above prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor should endeavor to obtain and maintain insurance policies, at its own expense, including:\n     1. Workers' Compensation, making efforts to comply with California's laws, including Employers' Liability. Specific limits may be considered.\n\n  2. A Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy. Occurrence-based policies are preferred, with possible products/completed operations liability coverage. Specific limits are subject to negotiation.\n\nInsurance policies may be issued by a carrier. Including SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego as Additional Insureds under the Commercial General Liability, Automobile Liability and Umbrella Liability Policies may be considered. All policies shall ideally contain a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF. Reasonable notice of cancellation, non-renewal, or material modification is requested. Sponsor should provide certificates of insurance at some point.",
                "explanation": "The changes weaken the previously strict requirements for insurance policies. Replacing 'must obtain' with 'should endeavor to obtain' makes the insurance requirement less mandatory. Introducing ambiguity with phrases such as 'Specific limits may be considered,' 'Occurrence-based policies are preferred,' 'may be considered' and 'reasonable notice' makes it difficult to enforce specific insurance levels or types. This introduces uncertainty that goes against standard risk management practices expected in sponsorships of this scale.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'must be approved' to 'should ideally be reviewed' significantly weakens the control SDBF and Major League Baseball have over the advertising content. It introduces ambiguity as to whether approval is actually required, potentially leading to disputes over unapproved content.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement should generally adhere to applicable laws, regulations and ordinances, as reasonably understood by both parties.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be subject to' with 'should generally adhere to' and adding 'as reasonably understood by both parties' weakens the obligation to comply with all laws. The term 'reasonably understood' creates ambiguity as it allows each party to interpret laws based on their own understanding, potentially leading to non-compliance or disputes over what constitutes a reasonable understanding of the law.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall be responsible for all travel and related costs and expenses for its members and other representatives to attend meetings of, and otherwise participate on, the JGC or any Working Group.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party may be responsible for travel and related costs and expenses for its members and other representatives to attend meetings of, and otherwise participate on, the JGC or any Working Group.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'may be responsible' creates ambiguity about whether the parties are required to cover their expenses. This introduces uncertainty, as it suggests that cost coverage is discretionary rather than mandatory, which can be seen as a contradiction, as this could lead to a breach of contract if one party decides not to cover necessary expenses, thus impeding the progress of the collaboration.",

                "changed_text": "Within [***] after the License Option Exercise Closing Date, the Parties should aim to enter into an agreement to initiate a process for the exchange of adverse event safety data in a mutually agreed format, possibly including postmarketing spontaneous reports received by the Party or its Affiliates in order to (a) with respect to AbbVie, consider monitoring the safety of the Licensed Compound or Licensed Product and attempt to meet reporting requirements with any applicable Regulatory Authority and (b) with respect to Harpoon, permit possible access to adverse event safety data for Licensed Compounds or Licensed Products, in each case ((a) and (b)) at AbbVie's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modifications weaken the obligation to establish an agreement for exchanging safety data. The original text used 'shall enter into an agreement' and 'to meet reporting requirements,' which are strong mandates. In the modified text, 'should aim to enter into an agreement,' 'consider monitoring the safety', and 'attempt to meet reporting requirements' weaken these obligations, potentially conflicting with regulatory requirements for safety monitoring and reporting.",

                "changed_text": "AbbVie will endeavor to notify Harpoon when practical (and perhaps within [***]) following its consideration that an event, incident, or circumstance might suggest a potential need for a recall, market suspension, or market withdrawal of a Licensed Product in the Territory, and may include in such notification its general impression and possible relevant facts.",
                "explanation": "The changes reduce the legal obligation by making the notification process less definitive. Replacing 'shall make every reasonable effort to notify promptly' with 'will endeavor to notify when practical' and 'no later than [***]' with 'perhaps within [***]' introduces ambiguity. Additionally, 'shall include in such notice the reasoning' is replaced with 'may include in such notification its general impression,' making the provision of detailed information optional rather than mandatory. This contradicts legal requirements for prompt and thorough communication regarding product safety issues.",

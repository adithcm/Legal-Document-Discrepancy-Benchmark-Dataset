                "changed_text": "STW shall endeavor to maintain some form of insurance for its activities on the Property and may consider listing COFS as an additional insured.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to provide insurance. Replacing 'shall administer and provide all necessary and reasonable insurance' with 'shall endeavor to maintain some form of insurance' makes the insurance coverage discretionary. Similarly, 'may consider' weakens the requirement to list COFS as an additional insured. This introduces ambiguity about the extent of coverage and protection for COFS.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas law requires specific insurance coverage for various business activities to protect third parties from liability. The ambiguity in this clause undermines the certainty of coverage, potentially conflicting with general tort liability principles in Texas.",

                "changed_text": "STW will construct, maintain, operate, own, and repair (as needed) the Existing CRA Well, the Replacement CRA Well and any Additional Wells, and in doing so, and in the wells' operation and repair, STW will:\n   a.  make commercially reasonable efforts to conduct work and operations in a manner consistent with what it considers good practices, with some regard for land management and environmental protection;\n   b.  attempt to comply with relevant federal, state, and local laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict adherence to laws and good practices. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall comply' with 'attempt to comply,' making compliance discretionary. Additionally, changing 'conduct all work and operations in a businesslike manner consistent with good and economical practices' to 'make commercially reasonable efforts to conduct work and operations in a manner consistent with what it considers good practices' introduces subjectivity. This weakens the obligation and allows STW to define 'good practices' themselves, which can be lower than legally required standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "This could contradict regulations set by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) regarding water well construction, operation, and environmental protection, which require strict compliance and adherence to specific standards, not just 'attempts' or subjective interpretations of 'good practices'.",

                "changed_text": "COFS may provide assistance to STW with negotiations to procure additional easements and groundwater rights in Pecos County, as COFS deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires COFS to assist with negotiations. The modified version uses 'may provide assistance' which makes COFS's assistance optional. The addition of 'as COFS deems appropriate' gives COFS sole discretion over the level and type of assistance provided, weakening STW's reliance on COFS and creating ambiguity about the support STW will receive.",
                "contradicted_law": "While there's no direct law being contradicted here, the ambiguity could lead to disputes, especially if STW's ability to perform under the contract depends on COFS's assistance. This could potentially violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Texas contract law, which requires parties to a contract to act honestly and fairly.",
